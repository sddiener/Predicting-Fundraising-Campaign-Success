<p><b>The
Singles and Exes Story</b></p>
<p>I had an idea almost 2 years ago to
create a late night radio talk show.  It would be a show like nothing else
on Little Rock radio. It would be like Happy Hour, LIVE on air.  A
groundbreaking independent show that talked about all the adult stuff that
you talk about with your friends after work, sitting on a deck, having an adult
beverage and laughing...a lot. It's basically my life on air along with some of
my best friends.</p>
<p>The show started from nothing. 
Thanks to wonderful business owners in the Little Rock we have been very
successful for the last year and a half.  Our fan base that listens on News
Radio 102.9 KARN or via the website streaming live on <a href=""http://www.singlesandexes.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><u>www.singlesandexes.com</u></span></a>
has become very loyal.  Recently we took the show on the road,
broadcasting live from sponsors locations and everyone involved loved being a
part of those shows.</p>
<p><b>We
are a small business who wants to help other small business.</b></p>
<p>I actually own Singles and Exes,
even though it is broadcast on Cumulus Radio; I am an independent small
business owner.  I am able to create my own rates and advertising
campaigns.  This makes this show very appealing to small businesses that
don’t have a huge advertising budget. However, I also need to cover
the expenses of the show and the small staff so my rates have to be set at
a certain level.  </p>
<p>This money would allow us to lower
our rates, which would help more small business owners to reach our very loyal
listeners and allow our current advertisers to increase their exposure.</p>
<p><b>What
this funding would do</b></p>
<p> This funding would not
only secure Singles and Exes remaining on KARN 102.9 but would open up
advertising opportunities that many small local business owners would love to
have available but currently can't afford.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We understand that not everyone can
contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<p>Please help to get the word
out, tell everyone you know and make some noise about our campaign.</p>

<p>When Gerard Comeau went on a run to pick up a few cases of his favourite brew, he didn't know that bringing them back from Quebec to his home in New Brunswick was illegal.<br/><br/>He does now. <br/><br/>Mounties stopped Gerard, confiscated his beer and slapped him with a fine for $292.50. He was fined for breaking an unconstitutional and unjust part of New Brunswick's Liquor Control Act.<br/><br/>It turns out that in 2015, it is somehow still illegal to bring certain amounts of legally purchased alcohol across the border. <br/><br/>The worst part? The framers of our constitution always intended that goods ""be admitted free into each of the other Provinces"". All the way back to 1867. Any Canadian reading that line from our constitution should be able to see how unjust this protectionist law is.<br/><br/>It's time our courts saw this too.<br/><br/>Gerard has decided to not pay this fine. In fact, he is challenging this law. The<br/>Canadian Constitution Foundation is helping him with legal support. And we're running this campaign to give you an opportunity to help too.<br/><br/>Our constitution is supposed to ensure the free movement of goods between the provinces. And since the prohibition era, provincial governments have been content to violate this principle based on some bad and outdated legal precedent set by the Supreme Court in 1921.<br/><br/>It's time to FREE BEER and follow the constitution. It's time to free consumers and small business from government control.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1> <p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Gerard Comeau and the CCF are fighting for a stronger interpretation of s. 121 of our constitution.</p>
<p><i>“121. All Articles of the Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other Provinces.”</i><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Success in this challenge for Gerard could mean a lot more than a new era in booze runs. It could mean a new era in Canadian commerce. A broader application of s. 121 from this case gives Canadians a stronger legal bulwark against all kinds of government meddling. And though we are challenging a law in New Brunswick, we are challenging it with a constitutional argument that can have a wide-reaching effect across the country.</p>
<p>“If Gerard wins, similar cases are almost certain to follow Canada-wide,” said CCF Executive Director Marni Soupcoff. </p>
<p>These protectionist laws benefit government monopoly sales agencies while constraining private businesses and citizens. Government alcohol agencies determine what products are bought and sold and at what price. There are billions of dollars at stake for the provincial governments. It’s almost guaranteed that they will try to defend their monopoly through all possible avenues of appeal. As the CCF presents Gerard’s case, every province will be watching.<br/><br/> <b>A win for Gerard will be a win for all consumers – more choice, more freedom.</b></p>

**UPDATE: 10 DAYS TO GO**Check out just some of the news coverage we have been getting across the country recently!http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/booze-border-limit-challenge-could-be-revolutionary-judge-says-1.2760525http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/new-brunswick-man-takes-constitutional-fight-over-beer-rights-to-court/article26088730/http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/new-brunswick-residents-buying-beer-in-quebec-an-an-everyday-occurrence-says-investigator-in-import-trialhttp://ici.radio-canada.ca/regions/atlantique/2015/08/26/007-temoins-proces-gerard-comeau-nouveau-brunswick.shtmlhttp://www.thestar.com/opinion/editorials/2015/09/06/absurd-booze-laws-are-due-to-fall-editorial.htmlhttp://munchies.vice.com/articles/canadas-booze-laws-might-be-unconstitutional**


When Gerard Comeau went on a run to pick up a few cases of his favourite brew, he didn't know that bringing them back from Quebec to his home in New Brunswick was illegal.He does now. Mounties stopped Gerard, confiscated his beer and slapped him with a fine for $292.50. He was fined for breaking an unconstitutional and unjust part of New Brunswick's Liquor Control Act.It turns out that in 2015, it is somehow still illegal to bring certain amounts of legally purchased alcohol across the border. The worst part? The framers of our constitution always intended that goods ""be admitted free into each of the other Provinces"". All the way back to 1867. Any Canadian reading that line from our constitution should be able to see how unjust this protectionist law is.It's time our courts saw this too.Gerard has decided to not pay this fine. In fact, he is challenging this law. TheCanadian Constitution Foundation is helping him with legal support. And we're running this campaign to give you an opportunity to help too.Our constitution is supposed to ensure the free movement of goods between the provinces. And since the prohibition era, provincial governments have been content to violate this principle based on some bad and outdated legal precedent set by the Supreme Court in 1921.It's time to FREE BEER and follow the constitution. It's time to free consumers and small business from government control.
By donating to the campaign, supporters can ensure the CCF is fully prepared to fight for the constitutional rights of all Canadians – and to make sure that this time, freedom wins.

   
What We Need & What You Get 

CCF is a non-profit and charitable organization. The people we work with are volunteering their services. All of the money we receive will go towards the support fees inherent in participating in the legal process and helping Gerard fight this challenge. 


And because CCF is a registered charity, donations are tax deductible*.  As of August 13, 2015 you MUST leave a mailing address, email address and your full name in order to receive a tax receipt. If any of these are left out, we cannot issue you a receipt.



Our initial campaign goal of $20,000 won't cover all of our costs (even with our lawyers volunteering), but the money will help pay for:



Filing Fees

Document review costs
Expert response reports
Flying in constitutional experts (these laws are so old we need to dig up an expert from England)
Record procurement
Transcripts (if it goes to appeal)

* Due to the regulations surrounding charity law, tax-deductible donations are only available for the donation minus the value of any campaign 'perk' we may be offering. For this reason, our perks are small or symbolic as we try to raise money for this legal case.


PerksAnd while fixing broken laws offers its own rewards, we thought we'd honour your contribution with a memento as outrageous as our most outdated laws, ie:
 
The ""Free Beer"" pins your backpack is dying for

Canada Post issued stamps
A courtroom sketch of you, drawn with your choice of innocent or guilty look    
The Impact 


Gerard Comeau and the CCF are fighting for a stronger interpretation of s. 121 of our constitution.
“121. All Articles of the Growth, Produce, or Manufacture of any one of the Provinces shall, from and after the Union, be admitted free into each of the other Provinces.”

Success in this challenge for Gerard could mean a lot more than a new era in booze runs. It could mean a new era in Canadian commerce. A broader application of s. 121 from this case gives Canadians a stronger legal bulwark against all kinds of government meddling. And though we are challenging a law in New Brunswick, we are challenging it with a constitutional argument that can have a wide-reaching effect across the country.
“If Gerard wins, similar cases are almost certain to follow Canada-wide,” said CCF Executive Director Marni Soupcoff. 
These protectionist laws benefit government monopoly sales agencies while constraining private businesses and citizens. Government alcohol agencies determine what products are bought and sold and at what price. There are billions of dollars at stake for the provincial governments. It’s almost guaranteed that they will try to defend their monopoly through all possible avenues of appeal. As the CCF presents Gerard’s case, every province will be watching. A win for Gerard will be a win for all consumers – more choice, more freedom.

</div><div><b>Project Background</b></div><div>
<b></b><p>A community of skateboarders has existed in Yangon since the mid 1990's.

<p>Construction of the 400 sq. meter skatepark was completed in December 2015, led by a team of professional skatepark builders from around the world working as volunteers. They not only donated their time and skills to build a skatepark, but worked with local skateboarders to share their knowledge in the art of skatepark construction, creating a truly community-built skatepark. Local skateboarders were provided with the tools, materials, and knowledge to create their own skatepark. After construction, the skatepark was painted by local youth and partner organization <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/aptarts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">AptArt - Awareness and Prevention through Art</a>. <br/></p>
<p>The skatepark now provides a shared community space where interested youth can learn from more experienced skateboarders, allowing the Burmese skateboarding community to grow and flourish for decades to come. Children from all different ethnic, religious, and economic backgrounds can find common ground through skateboarding in a country rife with ethnic and religious conflict. In a city with 9 major ethnic groups and 4 major religions, the existing skateboarding community of Yangon is already a strong example of how skateboarding has been able to connect youth from all different backgrounds toward a shared passion.</p>

But as we came towards a downward hill, we decided to pull off the road to be safe, we were only going 10 kilometres an hour, and every time we tried the brakes we skidded. We had just pulled to a stop behind a truck, when we were rear ended by a huge truck, which squashed into the one in front. I don't know what happened, there were three big shattering smacks, it felt like a few giants were playing ball with us, and we were the ball being smashed from wall to wall. <br/>The car was totalled, all of our belongings pulverized, all windows shattered.<br/>The miracle is that Kai, Rohan and the all four pets, were all physically fine. The horror is that my beautiful little Synia, who was going to have her 7th birthday, died! <br/>I climbed out of my window, not caring about the broken glass that was cutting me, I saw the car smoking and I wanted to get my children out fast! I was in my socks with no coat, in the icy snow. I first went to my daughters door, and right away saw that she was dead, I couldn't stop screaming, it worse than any nightmare, worse than the worse horror movie, I couldn't believe that it was real.<br/>She died as peacefully as she lived, one super smack to her head while she was napping.<br/>She was the sweetest of children, delightful in every way, she never caused any trouble, she was fun, sweet, cute, funny, spunky, loving, wise, kind, creative, clever, imaginative and spiritual. <br/>In short, she was as perfect a little girl as I could ever have hoped for. She had so many talents: She loved to sing, dance, act and draw, play with her 100 children cuddlies. <br/><br/>She had so much wisdom and common sense, she was a teacher and an inspiration for us all, there was the time where I was having a conflict with Rohan, who can be very strong willed. <br/>And she said Mommy the problem is that Rohan is a dragon, and you don’t understand dragons. I said oh please help me to understand, and she did, sitting in the park, she chose for hours to tell me all about dragons, unicorns and phoenixes, instead of playing with her friends.<br/>My friend had a tipi in her house, and she sat and did an Ohm Sat Nam, for half an hour with total third eye focus. She would play with her little plastic baby animals for hours in the bathtub, singing to them. She sang all the time, she used to sing <br/>“May there always be sunshine, may there always be blue skies, may there always be Mama may there always be me” in her beautiful loud clear child voice. And I would sing may there always be Synia. I have tried to sing this song to her wherever she is, but I cannot sing any song without chocking up. <br/>I am right now too full of deep pain to be wise, I have had three children, and only one is left, one who didn’t want to be an only child. <br/><br/>Rohan her older brother is devastated, and my heart also breaks for him, we un-schooled them, and felt that by having them home with us, their friendship was so much stronger than average. They were like two puppies frolicking together all day long. Rohan would invent imagination cat games for hours, (though he tells me that they are not games or invented that they are real). Synia and him totally believed in them. There were whole worlds, legends, from the far past, different dimensions, and cat characters that they knew by name and behaviour. It was a very funny and loud world, that would have both kids shrieking and giggling with joy for hours. <br/>They did everything together...<br/>He has lost his best friend…He is full of pain and is regressing back to the maturity of a baby, he needs us 100% of the time. He cannot enjoy anything without thinking that Synia would have loved it, and that thought makes him so sad. Much of his life with her, he loved to make her happy.

But as we came towards a downward hill, we decided to pull off the road to be safe, we were only going 10 kilometres an hour, and every time we tried the brakes we skidded. We had just pulled to a stop behind a truck, when we were rear ended by a huge truck, which squashed into the one in front. I don't know what happened, there were three big shattering smacks, it felt like a few giants were playing ball with us, and we were the ball being smashed from wall to wall. The car was totalled, all of our belongings pulverized, all windows shattered.The miracle is that Kai, Rohan and the all four pets, were all physically fine. The horror is that my beautiful little Synia, who was going to have her 7th birthday, died! I climbed out of my window, not caring about the broken glass that was cutting me, I saw the car smoking and I wanted to get my children out fast! I was in my socks with no coat, in the icy snow. I first went to my daughters door, and right away saw that she was dead, I couldn't stop screaming, it worse than any nightmare, worse than the worse horror movie, I couldn't believe that it was real.She died as peacefully as she lived, one super smack to her head while she was napping.She was the sweetest of children, delightful in every way, she never caused any trouble, she was fun, sweet, cute, funny, spunky, loving, wise, kind, creative, clever, imaginative and spiritual. In short, she was as perfect a little girl as I could ever have hoped for. She had so many talents: She loved to sing, dance, act and draw, play with her 100 children cuddlies. She had so much wisdom and common sense, she was a teacher and an inspiration for us all, there was the time where I was having a conflict with Rohan, who can be very strong willed. And she said Mommy the problem is that Rohan is a dragon, and you don’t understand dragons. I said oh please help me to understand, and she did, sitting in the park, she chose for hours to tell me all about dragons, unicorns and phoenixes, instead of playing with her friends.My friend had a tipi in her house, and she sat and did an Ohm Sat Nam, for half an hour with total third eye focus. She would play with her little plastic baby animals for hours in the bathtub, singing to them. She sang all the time, she used to sing “May there always be sunshine, may there always be blue skies, may there always be Mama may there always be me” in her beautiful loud clear child voice. And I would sing may there always be Synia. I have tried to sing this song to her wherever she is, but I cannot sing any song without chocking up. I am right now too full of deep pain to be wise, I have had three children, and only one is left, one who didn’t want to be an only child. Rohan her older brother is devastated, and my heart also breaks for him, we un-schooled them, and felt that by having them home with us, their friendship was so much stronger than average. They were like two puppies frolicking together all day long. Rohan would invent imagination cat games for hours, (though he tells me that they are not games or invented that they are real). Synia and him totally believed in them. There were whole worlds, legends, from the far past, different dimensions, and cat characters that they knew by name and behaviour. It was a very funny and loud world, that would have both kids shrieking and giggling with joy for hours. They did everything together...He has lost his best friend…He is full of pain and is regressing back to the maturity of a baby, he needs us 100% of the time. He cannot enjoy anything without thinking that Synia would have loved it, and that thought makes him so sad. Much of his life with her, he loved to make her happy. She was the perfect sister and best friend.We all know that whatever we do, and of course, life will go on eventually. But there will never be another Synia, there will never be my amazing little daughter again, at least not in her beautiful little body that I can hold and love.As for me, I keep wanting to wake up out of this nightmare.She taught me how to love, and be totally connected, she was my daughter, my sister, my guru and my friend for life.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3><strong><strong><span>Short Summary</span><br/><br/></strong></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>My name is Abdellah Smita, and I am a graphic designer from Er Rachidia (southeast Morocco). I am also the Founder and Creative Director of Maures, a T-shirt and paper goods brand that aims to revive Moroccan visual culture and spread awareness of the Moroccan identity through products of a daily use.</span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>Maures is a design group based in Errachidia, Morocco. Maures, which means “Moors“ in English, is the name that was given to the people who inhabited Morocco, western Algeria, Mauritania and Muslim Iberia whether they were Muslims, Jews, Arabs or Berbers. The word “Moors” has taken many other definitions throughout time, but its first meaning has remained, which shows the diversity of this region. Our goal is make the culture of Morocco more accessible to people in a new and creative way combining unique, modern designs with everyday items like T-shirts, calendars, home decorations, and office supplies. The true culture and history of Morocco is somewhat diluted and misunderstood by people, so our goal is to educate and excite people about everything Morocco!</span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>At this point, there is no money available to continue producing or selling new merchandise. Funding is needed to be able to purchase blank cotton t-shirts and print new designs on them along with other costs associated with producing more work. Contributing to this campaign will help us continue our work of promoting the culture of Morocco in a positive and genuine way.</span></li>
</ul><ul>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>So far our designs have included various historical and cultural stories that would be unknown to many young Moroccans and other people in the region. We also have larger, long-term goals of providing people in the region the opportunity to share and enhance the culture/art scene of Morocco. You would be helping us in this first step to achieve our goals!</span></li>
</ul><h3><strong><strong><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/><br/></strong></strong></h3>
<ul>

</ul></div>","Short Summary

My name is Abdellah Smita, and I am a graphic designer from Er Rachidia (southeast Morocco). I am also the Founder and Creative Director of Maures, a T-shirt and paper goods brand that aims to revive Moroccan visual culture and spread awareness of the Moroccan identity through products of a daily use.

Maures is a design group based in Errachidia, Morocco. Maures, which means “Moors“ in English, is the name that was given to the people who inhabited Morocco, western Algeria, Mauritania and Muslim Iberia whether they were Muslims, Jews, Arabs or Berbers. The word “Moors” has taken many other definitions throughout time, but its first meaning has remained, which shows the diversity of this region. Our goal is make the culture of Morocco more accessible to people in a new and creative way combining unique, modern designs with everyday items like T-shirts, calendars, home decorations, and office supplies. The true culture and history of Morocco is somewhat diluted and misunderstood by people, so our goal is to educate and excite people about everything Morocco!

At this point, there is no money available to continue producing or selling new merchandise. Funding is needed to be able to purchase blank cotton t-shirts and print new designs on them along with other costs associated with producing more work. Contributing to this campaign will help us continue our work of promoting the culture of Morocco in a positive and genuine way.

So far our designs have included various historical and cultural stories that would be unknown to many young Moroccans and other people in the region. We also have larger, long-term goals of providing people in the region the opportunity to share and enhance the culture/art scene of Morocco. You would be helping us in this first step to achieve our goals!
What We Need & What You Get

We need funding right now for the purchase of around 500 cotton T-shirts, other materials needed like paper tags and packaging, shipping costs, and payment to a local printer to create the shirts. A very small portion (around $100) of the funds will also be used for some marketing of the new products.

If we don’t reach our entire goal, the funds will still be used towards the same materials needed such as the cotton T-shirts, tags, printing, packaging, and shipping. The only difference would be less of those items. If we receive the full amount (which we carefully calculated), we will be able to purchase the cotton shirts at a more reasonable price than a smaller quantity.

Our perks you would receive include one-of-a-kind pieces of art created by a team of young, rising Moroccan graphic artists. Maures’ unique works have been featured in international art/culture magazines and other local media, so you would be receiving perks that are very unique and modern pieces of current Moroccan art and culture. Right now we have built some excitement about Maures, but we are missing the money to continue operating and producing T-shirts. The designs represent the stories and cultural legends of Morocco, so you would be receiving a unique part of Morocco by helping us fund our campaign. 
Examples of our perks:
 
 
Legends Calendar - Moroccan traveler: Ibn Battuta

Legends Calendar - Moroccan myth: Aicha Kandicha

Isli d'Tislit T-shirt - Moroccan legend

Booyah Omar T-shirt

Kandicha, Waterman Joker and other prints.
 
The Impact

Maures is valuable first and foremost to Morocco and its people. The merchandise produced at Maures are things of a daily use and through these things, we can communicate the Moroccan identity and culture. One of our goals is to fight the stereotypical image of Morocco. Even within the region of North Africa and the Middle East, Morocco is a country with a very unique history and culture. We want to share the uniqueness of the Moroccan culture to the world through graphic design, comics, and other artistic means.

Maures is a young company, but we have a history of hard work paying off with some great successes. We have participated in a local art/design market in Marrakesh in which we were the “coup de coeur” or the “hotspot” of the whole event. We’ve also organized our own exhibitions in Casablanca and Marrakesh that were both very successful. We’ve been highlighted in an international magazine, Brownbook. Local Moroccan artists and media are excited for the future of Maures, but we really just need help right now to continue operating and to create something better for the future!

<p>Picture a room full of children laughing, reading, writing, coloring, and calculating. Imagine that the children are of a great variety of ethnicities, have come from very different countries and backgrounds, and speak several different languages. They are newcomers to America and they have a <strong>lot</strong> to learn. These children have a difficult battle ahead of them; they will face an unfamiliar school system, a new language and culture, and may be critically behind in school, even in danger of being held back a grade. Their families face a battle as well; they too will encounter new customs and language, new systems, unfamiliar tasks, and immigration challenges. The barriers they face are intimidating, but luckily for these families, they have found an oasis of support, camaraderie, and friendship at CIANA.</p>
<p>The Center for the Integration and Advancement of New Americans, Inc. (CIANA) arms these children and their families with language and education skills as well as immigration services. We offer conversation-based adult ESL classes at the same time as our youth program so that the students’ mothers can take part. We have found that for these women the ESL classes are a rare opportunity, perhaps the only opportunity that they have to take part in their own education and integration.</p>
<p> Our volunteer staff, many of whom are immigrants themselves, offer culturally competent and language-appropriate assistance; they are tutors, teachers, friends, and most importantly, partners, working to help ease the transition to a new home.</p>
<p>CIANA’s goal is two-fold – we aim to engage the hardest to reach immigrant families and secondly, to provide resources and support so that these families have all the tools they need in order to participate successfully and positively in society. We are located in Queens, New York, the hub of immigrant communities in New York.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Need You?</strong></p>
<p>Our services, for both the children and their families, are free! We pay our volunteer staff in a currency of appreciation and experience. Unfortunately, our program expenses are rapidly increasing, and we need your help!</p>
<p>Due to the wild success of our education programs, CIANA is bursting at the seams; the need for our tutoring and ESL services are growing daily. In order to continue to offer the individual-centered tutoring and ESL lessons, and expand our programs to reach the immigrant families still in need of our services, CIANA needs you! Every little bit goes a long way. Thank you!</p>

where only 1 participating chiropractor will be shown                                                             
and
 then encourages them to call THAT local Chiropractor



                             
The campaign will be run by NewsCorp Australia and Partners and

inventory, including a highly trained 
Social marketing team and Google Certified Advertising Managers.

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">SUMMARY OF PROJECT</span></p>
<p>We are Fundación En Vía, a non-profit organization working to <strong>fight poverty and support community development</strong> through responsible tourism in Oaxaca, Mexico. We do this by using funds from tourism to provide <strong>interest-free</strong> <strong>microloans</strong> and educational programs to women and their families in largely indigenous communities.</p>
<p>Our<strong> microloan program</strong> gives women the opportunity to create or expand small businesses, empowering them to better provide for themselves and their families. Also, since the average interest rate on a standard microloan in Mexico is 74.2%, the highest in all of Latin America, our interest-free loans provide a far better option for women working to get themselves and their families out of poverty.</p>
<p>Our <strong>educational programs</strong> provide the women with the knowledge to make better financial decisions in order to fully capitalize on their loans.</p>
<p>Our <strong>responsible tourism</strong> financing-model gives visitors an opportunity to both support the economic advancement of these women and their families, and learn about Oaxacan communities and their customs. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">OUR BORROWERS</span></p>
<p>We are currently working in five villages outside of Oaxaca City: Teotitlán del Valle, San Jerónimo Tlacochahuaya, Villa Díaz Ordaz, San Sebastián Abásolo and Santo Domingo Tomaltepec.</p>
<p>Our programs have <strong>supported over 300 women</strong>, and these borrowers have used their interest-free loans to invest in their businesses/projects.</p>
<p>These hardworking and resourceful entrepreneurs have a variety of different skills and activities. They are bread and tortilla makers, seamstresses, market vendors (selling things such as cheese, poultry, and vegetables), farmers, artisans, food vendors and much more!</p>
<p>The women use their microloans to start or improve their businesses. For example a woman may invest in a flock of chicks to raise and sell; purchase a grill to start selling tacos; invest in wool and dye to make artisanal textiles; or buy a measuring scale and bulk bags of beans and corn, for her small home-based convenience store, allowing her to sell them by the kilo to customers.</p>
<p><img alt=""Photos from our tours to meet with women borrowers."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fundacionenvia.squarespace.com/storage/images/collage%20photo%201.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: text-bottom;""/></p>
<p>These communities are often marginalized from access to services and development of infrastructure.  A few statistics paint a picture of the economic status of these communities: </p>
<ul>
<li>Households with dirt floors: from 7% to 37%</li>
<li>Women in our program with a primary education: 65%</li>
<li>Women in our program with high school education or higher: 16%</li>
</ul>
<p>A small amount of money can make a big difference.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">SUSTAINABLE TOURISM <em>EN VÍA</em> STYLE</span></p>
<p>We lead tours comprised of visitors primarily from the US, Canada, Australia and Europe into the communities where we work. Tour participants have the chance to meet our borrowers, learn about their loans and project plans, and offer support for their success.</p>
<p><strong>We use 100% of the tour fees to provide interest-free microloans.</strong>  </p>
<p>Repaid loans then go to support our various educational programs such as English and business classes, new loans, and administration costs, including an <strong>annual van rental cost of approximately $10,000 – which is the equivalent of 100 first-time loans</strong>. </p>
<p>The tours provide a special glimpse of life in Oaxaca including different artisanal trades, traditional foods, and an introduction to local customs and way of life. Whether talking about business plans or wedding customs, hearing the ancient Zapotec language, or seeing the preparation of <em>chapulines</em> (grasshoppers -- a local food favorite), the tours provide the opportunity to cross cultural boundaries and connect people to people.</p>
<p>These tours fund 86% of our interest-free microloans and are crucial to our mission of fighting poverty and empowering women entrepreneurs to succeed on their own terms.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">WHAT WE’RE ASKING FOR</span></p>
<p>Since 100% of tour fees and loan repayments go first to fund our loan and educational programs and then to cover our administrative costs, we have launched our Indiegogo campaign to buy a van.</p>
<p><strong>By owning our own van we will reduce our total annual operating costs by 10%. </strong></p>
<p>With the amount we pay yearly on renting the van we could give out 100 first-time loans to women borrowers who are currently waiting for the chance to participate. This is money that women could be using right now to invest in businesses that support their families and communities!</p>
<p><img alt=""Photos from our tours to the communities."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fundacionenvia.squarespace.com/storage/images/collage%20photo%203.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">IMPACT</span></p>
<p>En Vía’s programs have a positive impact on the individual women borrowers, their families and entire communities. Our borrowers have been able to launch, expand and diversify their own businesses through interest-free loans.</p>
<p>Equally important to the loans, our educational classes have given our borrowers the tools and support to better manage their finances and build confidence to run their businesses.</p>
<p>The profits gained from improved business practices can make the difference in providing a fully nutritious meal for their family, improving living conditions, or sending the first member of the family to high school. </p>
<p>As more borrowers join our foundation, <strong>communities are being strengthened one woman, one business, and one family at a time.</strong> The phrase “En Vía” can be translated as “on the path,” and these women are, step by step, on the path to greater economic and personal empowerment.</p>
<p>We hope you will join us in our efforts to support more women as they bring themselves and their families out of poverty.</p>

Our microloan program gives women the opportunity to create or expand small businesses, empowering them to better provide for themselves and their families. Also, since the average interest rate on a standard microloan in Mexico is 74.2%, the highest in all of Latin America, our interest-free loans provide a far better option for women working to get themselves and their families out of poverty.
Our educational programs provide the women with the knowledge to make better financial decisions in order to fully capitalize on their loans.
Our responsible tourism financing-model gives visitors an opportunity to both support the economic advancement of these women and their families, and learn about Oaxacan communities and their customs. 
OUR BORROWERS
We are currently working in five villages outside of Oaxaca City: Teotitlán del Valle, San Jerónimo Tlacochahuaya, Villa Díaz Ordaz, San Sebastián Abásolo and Santo Domingo Tomaltepec.
Our programs have supported over 300 women, and these borrowers have used their interest-free loans to invest in their businesses/projects.
These hardworking and resourceful entrepreneurs have a variety of different skills and activities. They are bread and tortilla makers, seamstresses, market vendors (selling things such as cheese, poultry, and vegetables), farmers, artisans, food vendors and much more!
The women use their microloans to start or improve their businesses. For example a woman may invest in a flock of chicks to raise and sell; purchase a grill to start selling tacos; invest in wool and dye to make artisanal textiles; or buy a measuring scale and bulk bags of beans and corn, for her small home-based convenience store, allowing her to sell them by the kilo to customers.

These communities are often marginalized from access to services and development of infrastructure.  A few statistics paint a picture of the economic status of these communities: 

Households with dirt floors: from 7% to 37%
Women in our program with a primary education: 65%
Women in our program with high school education or higher: 16%

A small amount of money can make a big difference.
SUSTAINABLE TOURISM EN VÍA STYLE
We lead tours comprised of visitors primarily from the US, Canada, Australia and Europe into the communities where we work. Tour participants have the chance to meet our borrowers, learn about their loans and project plans, and offer support for their success.
We use 100% of the tour fees to provide interest-free microloans.  
Repaid loans then go to support our various educational programs such as English and business classes, new loans, and administration costs, including an annual van rental cost of approximately $10,000 – which is the equivalent of 100 first-time loans. 
The tours provide a special glimpse of life in Oaxaca including different artisanal trades, traditional foods, and an introduction to local customs and way of life. Whether talking about business plans or wedding customs, hearing the ancient Zapotec language, or seeing the preparation of chapulines (grasshoppers -- a local food favorite), the tours provide the opportunity to cross cultural boundaries and connect people to people.
These tours fund 86% of our interest-free microloans and are crucial to our mission of fighting poverty and empowering women entrepreneurs to succeed on their own terms.
WHAT WE’RE ASKING FOR
Since 100% of tour fees and loan repayments go first to fund our loan and educational programs and then to cover our administrative costs, we have launched our Indiegogo campaign to buy a van.
By owning our own van we will reduce our total annual operating costs by 10%. 
With the amount we pay yearly on renting the van we could give out 100 first-time loans to women borrowers who are currently waiting for the chance to participate. This is money that women could be using right now to invest in businesses that support their families and communities!

IMPACT
En Vía’s programs have a positive impact on the individual women borrowers, their families and entire communities. Our borrowers have been able to launch, expand and diversify their own businesses through interest-free loans.
Equally important to the loans, our educational classes have given our borrowers the tools and support to better manage their finances and build confidence to run their businesses.
The profits gained from improved business practices can make the difference in providing a fully nutritious meal for their family, improving living conditions, or sending the first member of the family to high school. 
As more borrowers join our foundation, communities are being strengthened one woman, one business, and one family at a time. The phrase “En Vía” can be translated as “on the path,” and these women are, step by step, on the path to greater economic and personal empowerment.
We hope you will join us in our efforts to support more women as they bring themselves and their families out of poverty.

<p>With the help and support of my wife, Sarah, and my young son, Ian, as well as close friends, I have been able to start a change in career.  What started as a dream to  sail across the ocean, has  given me the opportunity to turn my passion for sailing into a  career.</p>
<p>It has been a difficult road both emotionally and financially to get where we are today.  We have made an epic trip from the Azores(where we purchased our boat) to the Canary Islands, across the Atlantic to Sint Maarten, then solo back to Maine.</p>
<p>We now need some financial support to follow this through.  We are going to offer our boat, with me as Captain, for sailing charters with locally sourced food for as little as a few hours sail up to offshore experiences depending on guests chosen itinerary. </p>
<p>Sailing has the ability to change lives through its simplistic idea of traveling by an unseen but  powerful force; the wind.   The unbelievable throws of emotion one has to tackle, especially to be a, ""Bluewater"" sailor, are to be thrown into the heights of adventure and adrenaline, down to the lows of fear and loneliness.  With your help, I want to share these stories to others and show folks just how beautiful our coast of Maine is from the sea.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>I have set a goal of 25K to be put toward many items on the list to get Shadowfax in top condition to receive her first charter guests.  Her immediate needs are to get hauled out of the water and brought back to our house, so I can start the engine overhaul and prep for paint in the spring.   I would love to re-power with electric drive and lithium batteries, recharged by solar, thus the large funding goal.  We also need to create a website for the business, which I already own the domain name, ""sailingshadowfax.com.""  Also, we need to cover costs such as insurance, and licencing.  The more we raise, the more can be used to hire local people to do what they do best, and help our small economy here in Maine. </div>
<div>We will be offering perks of coasters, soaps and glasses that my wife and I will be making ourselves.  For higher amounts we will be offering days of charter.</div> <p>If we do not reach our goal, we will at the very least, be making steps towards making this dream a reality sometime in the near future.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I want to introduce and re-introduce sailing at a price point that people can afford.  With help from our friends and community we want others to have a great experience and possibly a lifelong passion.   I think it is important to see the world we live in, from the perspective of the sea and our impact on it. </div>
<div>There aren't words to express the feeling from raising sails, peeling off a mooring and heading out to sea with no engine noise, only the rush of water and the wind in the sails.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Many of the risks are behind us.</div>
<div>However, we have a short sailing season here in Maine and the weather for sailing won't always be in our favor.  That is why we are also going to include some great food and music on those days when folks just may want to sit on the mooring enclosed in the cockpit having a warm cup of soup.  Through our own knowledge and the vast knowledge of friends that have done many sailing and kayaking trips, we know of many quiet anchorages for those in need of a quiet repose and we also are in touch with finding great places along the coast that have live music right on the waterfront.</div>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>We are four UCLA Bruins and an Australian dude, and we are building <a href=""http://startsomegood.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">StartSomeGood.com</a> to leverage the power of the crowd to empower people from around the world to launch their own social enterprise.There are so many people with ideas for how they want to make a difference in the world, yet they lack the resources that they need to get started.  StartSomeGood connects budding social entrepreneurs with the financial and intellectual capital that they need -- all in a fun, engaging and community-driven way.  Our site taps into the power of the crowd, allowing social entrepreneurs to ask for small amounts of money from lots of different people -- just like here on IndieGoGo -- rather than hope for one lump sum.  It's crowdfunding for social enterprises, but we've also got a few tricks up our sleeve!<br/><p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 style="""">What Makes Us Unique</h3>
</div>
<div>The crowdfunding model is becoming increasingly popular -- especially in the arts-world -- and we believe it is perfect for supporting the growth and development of social enterprise. Here's what makes StartSomeGood stand out from the pack:</div>
<div>
<br/><ul>
<li>We focus on social enterprises and organizations, as opposed to other ""social good fund-raising"" sites where people raise money for things like running a marathon for charity.  Though those sites are great too, we are looking to help launch the type of organizations that will create long-term, meaningful change in the world.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We have created a hybrid crowdfunding model unique to the needs of a social enterprise.  Social entrepreneurs select a ""tipping point"" -- <span class=""s1"">the amount of money that is necessary to start doing good -- and fund-raising up until this point is done in an all-or-nothing way.  Supporters pledge funds, but are only charged if a venture reaches its tipping point goal by its deadline.  Beyond the tipping point, though, we allow the venture to raise additional funds -- limited only by the same time deadline -- and keep all funds raised beyond the tipping point.  This empowers social entrepreneurs to tap into the power of the crowd  to launch their venture as well as to begin creating real change in the world.<br/></span>
</li>
<li>We provide a platform for launching brand new social enterprises, unlike other sites that focus on fund-raising for already-established organizations.</li>
<li>In addition to launching a social enterprise on our site, we support the ongoing launch of projects and new endeavors by a social enterprise using the same hybrid, tipping-point crowdfunding model.  We give social enterprises a dynamic home for launching their crowd-powered projects both at the start and into the future.</li>
<li>We recognize that starting a social enterprise takes more than just money; it takes people!  We connect social entrepreneurs with people from around the world who want to use their talents for good.  Are you a social enterprise looking for an hour or two of pro-bono legal help?  Maybe you're a graphic designer looking to use your Photoshop skills for good.  We connect do-gooders with social enterprises that need help getting launched, creating exciting opportunities to contribute. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>By focusing on the combination of these things, we make StartSomeGood stand out from the pack, and well-positioned to be a force in driving meaningful change in the world through social enterprise. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Social entrepreneurship is a movement that is growing rapidly in popularity and awareness, yet according to Change.org, 72% of social entrepreneurs say that access to capital is their greatest challenge.  Though funds exist for organizations that are already off the ground, so many brilliant, game-changing ideas never come to life because of the hurdles that exist for starting a social enterprise.  StartSomeGood seeks to simplify things, based on the premise that we want more people to do more good in the world.  We lower the barriers to entry of starting a social enterprise, and connect social entrepreneurs with the people, passion, ideas and support they need to do great things in the world.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I am an aspiring photographer with the motivation and the competitive nature to provide the best service available to my customers.</p>
<p>Several years back when I worked in a studio, I had an unforgettable experience with one of my customers. The first time they came in was to have photos taken of their newly born daughter. A year later, on their daughter's birthday, they came back with a photo I had taken the previous year. I noticed that they only brought their four year old daughter with them to the studio. I soon learned that three months after the original photoshoot, the baby passed away. </p>
<p>During the emotional photoshoot, the older daughter posed with the photo I had taken of their youngest a year prior. The whole time the parents were in tears. My first son just so happened to have been born about a month before this. During this shoot, I was speaking with the parents about what all happened and the connection we made was unreal. Even today, just writing this, I cannot help but tear up when I think about them. Having so much emotion behind a photo and the story is why I can't do anything but this. I love it and nothing will change that. I love the feeling I get after making that personal connection with my ""customers."" At that point they aren't a customer, they are much more. </p>
<p>There is a service I would like to volunteer for called ""Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep."" It is a organization that connects parents with photographers free of charge to take photos with their babies who didn't make it. I cannot think of a better way to volunteer my time and services. It really is an amazing program. </p>

<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p>Before hiding in my usual excuse of “what can one person do?” I decided to open my eyes and see what’s happening all around me. The picture was ugly and forced me to see many unpleasant facts:  For example, my best friend died for lack of health care. At first I thought this was an extreme case, but later I found that her story is very common. The lack of health insurance is responsible for 45,000 preventable deaths in USA each year according to a <a href=""http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/new-study-finds-45000-deaths-annually-linked-to-lack-of-health-coverage/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">study</a>published in 2009 by the <em>Harvard Medical School</em>.  Instead of creating a single payer health care system which is most humane and most feasible, President Obama and U.S. legislators created a mandate to buy private health insurance. What the recent Supreme Court ruling really means is that corporations now can use federal law to force people to buy their products.</p>
<p>As an immigrant, I saw that the real engine that drives immigration is the demand for cheaper labor to boost profits, so much that for years capitalists have sent trucks to the U.S./ Mexican border to haul workers to the agricultural, meatpacking, construction jobs that educated Americans left behind.</p>
<p>I am still paying off the student loans for my education and see the student-loan debt is yet another leash for young people who worry about the cost of bucking authority, losing their jobs, and being unable to pay for their education.</p>
<p>As a native Middle Easterner, I found that all the wars in that region were caused by corporations exploiting those countries’ natural recourses.</p>
<p>As a teacher, I personally witnessed how schools educate for compliance and not for democracy. Obey orders blindly is the theme of today’s educational system. If the students refuse to follow orders, then they are diagnosed with some sort of disruptive disorder.</p>
<p>The list goes on. And for me, this is not a time to say “what can one person do?”  I believe that every Journey has a first step and small changes are a great way to start, because the quick successes will motivate us to keep going.  Therefore, I am focused on how I can be the change.</p>
<p>I have served as a project manager in a humanitarian organization for the Bam earthquake’s victims and I was responsible for construction of health houses, an obstetrics unit, an emergency room and a school building for the victims.  Later, I had a vested interest in health care education issues in regards to the single payer system (Improved Medicare for All). I have now created a Social Forum to organize, educate and empower people on critical issues; sharing knowledge; and teaching skills to build alternative and sustainable systems that better meet our human needs.  Through the Social Forum model, individuals reflect on their own purpose and how to make a difference, and finally, I hope to create the consciousness that we have the knowledge and skills and the power to create the change we desire.</p>

<strong> </strong><p><strong>Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>Hi! We are A Spoon Full of Sugar Childminders! Our names are Shannon and Sarah. We have both worked in childcare for over 10 years, either as ECE's in daycares, or as nannies. </p>
<p>We have learned so much in our time working with children and their families, and noticed a giant gap in the childcare in Manitoba. Most daycares are open 730 AM- 530 Pm Monday to Friday. So what about families who work shift work? Single parents that have longer days? Parents who need some time off to relax with other adults? That is where we come in. </p>
<p><strong>What do we do?</strong></p>
<p>We offer casual, part time, and full time childcare to those who need it. We are available 24 hrs a day, 7 days a week. We are never closed. We can accomodate short notice plans, and we can plan as far ahead as needed. <strong>Check out our site for more info! </strong><a href=""www.aspoonfullofsugarchildminders.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>HERE</strong></a><strong> Or our Facebook page </strong><a href=""www.facebook.com/aspoonfullofsugarchildminders"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>HERE</strong></a></p>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is to raise funds for families who are struggling to find affordable care for their children. Our services are not necessarily cheap as we only hire highly qualified sitters and nannies.</p>
<p> All our employees have:</p>
<ul>
<li>criminal record checks</li>
<li>child abuse registry checks</li>
<li>CPR and First Aid</li>
<li>references personally checked by the owners</li>
</ul>
<p> Our business is registered and insured. We would love to be able to help out families who need services but would not normally be able to afford them. Since we do not qualify for subsidy as we are not a day care, we needed to find another solution. </p>
<p><strong>This is where you come in.</strong> </p>
<p>Any money donated will go directly to funding childcare for those who need it the most. You will be providing parents a chance to have a break, go look for jobs, get grocery shopping done, take care of themselves while their children are being safely cared for. You will be providing a service for a deserving family.</p>
</div><div> <p>We are looking to raise $500 in this campaign. This will serve 5 families! It will provide those 5 families with approximately 6 hours of babysitting. </p>

 Our business is registered and insured. We would love to be able to help out families who need services but would not normally be able to afford them. Since we do not qualify for subsidy as we are not a day care, we needed to find another solution. 
This is where you come in. 
Any money donated will go directly to funding childcare for those who need it the most. You will be providing parents a chance to have a break, go look for jobs, get grocery shopping done, take care of themselves while their children are being safely cared for. You will be providing a service for a deserving family.
 We are looking to raise $500 in this campaign. This will serve 5 families! It will provide those 5 families with approximately 6 hours of babysitting.

Like many new pet parents, you learn on the

and confused when he first came home with us. <br/><br/>We learned that the first few weeks your new pet is with you, they may have a tendancy to runaway out of confusion and a very
important time to get him an ID tag right away.  Melou is micro-chipped but only Vets and shelters can read that information.  <br/><br/>We bought fancy metal ID tags and were startled in the middle of the night by the jingling of the tag.   This began our search for the quietest tag on
the market.  We went through personalized
collars which were great but he grew out of them and were expensive.  We bought the plastic ones which did not last
long.  Then a pocket that the tags went
inside – we lost 3 of them.  We began
taping the tags together and that was dirty but it worked.  None of these was ever the one and we just removed the tags off Melou.    <br/><br/></span>

Jorge has handed out these meals for almost ten years without fail and does so with the purpose of ""stealing a smile from hunger."" </p><p>Jorge has been funding the mission out of his own pocket since day one- Almost ten years ago when he stopped to ask a couple of day laborers on the street if they had eaten and was moved by their answer when they told him that if they did not find work for that day then they would not eat that night. Now the mission has grown and over 100 people depend on him every night in order to not go to sleep without a meal in their stomachs. To this day, Jorge has handed out around 350,000 meals which has gained him recognition by President Obama (Citizen's Medal Award), CNN (Top 10 CNN Hero 2009), and various other organizations.</p><p>Jorge greatly depends on donations to keep the mission running as his income alone does not suffice. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>Jorge Needs Your Help</h3><p>The $100,000 will all go towards the mission to buy the supplies required to hand out the meal (food, food containers, utensils, cooking supplies). Jorge's weekly expenses exceed well over $3,500- an amount he cannot bear on his own. The $100,000 would aid in the expansion of the mission and would help Jorge make sure that ""no one goes hungry tonight.""</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Your donation will greatly help feed hundreds of people who have to endure hunger in the cold and unforgiving New York winter. </p><p>Many times we see people who are in need and do not know how to help. This is our chance to make a big difference in someone's life by providing them with a warm meal that is made with care.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>We thank you for taking the time to learn about Jorge's mission. In addition to monetary donations, Jorge can make very good use of the following items:</p><ul>
<li>Food containers</li>

Jorge has handed out these meals for almost ten years without fail and does so with the purpose of ""stealing a smile from hunger."" Jorge has been funding the mission out of his own pocket since day one- Almost ten years ago when he stopped to ask a couple of day laborers on the street if they had eaten and was moved by their answer when they told him that if they did not find work for that day then they would not eat that night. Now the mission has grown and over 100 people depend on him every night in order to not go to sleep without a meal in their stomachs. To this day, Jorge has handed out around 350,000 meals which has gained him recognition by President Obama (Citizen's Medal Award), CNN (Top 10 CNN Hero 2009), and various other organizations.Jorge greatly depends on donations to keep the mission running as his income alone does not suffice. Jorge Needs Your HelpThe $100,000 will all go towards the mission to buy the supplies required to hand out the meal (food, food containers, utensils, cooking supplies). Jorge's weekly expenses exceed well over $3,500- an amount he cannot bear on his own. The $100,000 would aid in the expansion of the mission and would help Jorge make sure that ""no one goes hungry tonight.""The ImpactYour donation will greatly help feed hundreds of people who have to endure hunger in the cold and unforgiving New York winter. Many times we see people who are in need and do not know how to help. This is our chance to make a big difference in someone's life by providing them with a warm meal that is made with care.Other Ways You Can HelpWe thank you for taking the time to learn about Jorge's mission. In addition to monetary donations, Jorge can make very good use of the following items:
Food containers
Plastic Forks
Styrofoam Cups
Cooking Utensils

</div><div><p></p></div></div>","Nearly
two years after the devastating earthquake that struck Haiti on
January 12, 2010, much of the country remains in ruins with millions
of displaced people living in impossible conditions. The necessary grieving
process for the 300,000 people that perished compounded by the loss
of homes and livelihoods, has been interrupted by the sheer need of
survival.



Ayiti
Resurrect is a
grassroots collective that formed in the aftermath of the
earthquake based on principles of solidarity, creativity, and
collective resilience. A team of visionary artists,
community builders, and holistic healers with bloodlines in the
Caribbean and African Diaspora, we have organized ourselves to work
in collaboration with local Haitian organizations to facilitate
psychological and spiritual healing for earthquake survivors. Through
art, movement and music therapy, yoga and meditation, plant medicine,
environmental sustainability initiatives, peer to peer counseling,
and mental wellness clinics, Ayiti Resurrect is dedicated to
transforming trauma through collective healing.



Between
December 27, 2010 and January 16, 2011 Ayiti Resurrect in
partnership with Ayiti Cherie Healing Project travelled to Cormier, a rural community in the
state of Leogane, and partnered with local artists, community
organizers, and healers to facilitate art and music therapy
workshops, implement a mental wellness clinic, and commemorate the
anniversary of the earthquake.



This
first delegation and set of programs were such a success that our
partners and participants in Cormier invited us to return. Ayiti
Resurrect is now gearing up to travel to Haiti coinciding with the second
anniversary of the earthquake to continue assisting the Comier
community in charting their way back to wholeness, and forgiving the
past to make way for a brighter, more promising future.



We've
assembled an incredible team of holistic healers, artists,
musicians, dancers, yoga instructors, permaculture gardeners and
environmental innovators who will be traveling to Haiti during
the first two weeks of January, working in collaboration with
artists, healers and community builders living in Haiti, to implement
a Mental Wellness & Stress Relief clinic, initiate an
environmental sustainability education project, and facilitate art
and music therapy workshops with and for quake survivors. Workshops
and sessions will be organized by Haitians and international allies
through collaboration and shared facilitation, and the
coalescing of our energy, creativity and wisdom promises to be
powerful!!!


Learn
more about our delegate team, what we are offering, and our strategy
for sustainability at www.ayitiresurrect.org.
You can also find out more details about our history, past work, and
the partnerships we have here and in Haiti.


Interconnected RootsWe
are a grassroots endeavor of two communities coming together across
bloodlines and continents to facilitate healing from within. We are
not an NGO with foundational or institutional backing, we are
representatives from our hometowns, our neighborhoods, and our
lineages. Your support means everything as we engage in this all
volunteer work dedicated to cultivating genuine people-to-people
solidarity among members of the African diasporic family while
reinforcing the strength and autonomy of the Haitian community.



Please
considering making a donation to make possible this critical work,
and see below for other ways to contribute to this mission.
Through the realization of this project dedicated to transforming
trauma through collective healing, we hope to contribute in a small
but significant way to building a saner, more just existence for the
future generations of all Haitians.




What

continued work hinges on raising enough funds to cover expenses on

the community in general. We have $9834 left to raise before we depart!

13) Monetary Contribution- to collaborating orgs in Haiti, and tips for drivers/cooks etc.: $800
14) Overhead (percentage of donations going to fiscal sponsor/Indiegogo/Pay Pal etc): $450

fundraisers this fall (a holistic health fair in Brooklyn and a Fet Gede

<p><b><u>Introduction</u></b></p>
<p>Hello,
my name is Shruti Kapoor. I am the founder of Sayfty; a startup that helps
women in India protect themselves against violence and abuse with the help of
personal safety products, self-defense training &amp; awareness. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The
horrific gang-rape of a physiotherapy
student in December 2012 in New Delhi, India shook me to the core. The
brutality of the incident opened my eyes to the fact that India indeed is unsafe for women. While looking
for information relating to women’s safety, I came upon a disturbing fact: In
India, a woman is raped every 20 minutes. </p>
<p></p>
<p>In
2011, India was voted the fourth most dangerous country for women according to
a global poll by the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Over 24,000 rapes and 220,000 cases of molestation and abuse were reported, but
experts believe the number of unreported cases is much higher. </p>
<p>For the
average Indian woman, sexual abuse and harassment are also a part of her daily
routine. From being leered at, to being groped, verbally abused and even
masturbated on, women in India are at a constant threat of being sexually
assaulted. Crowded streets, buses, trains and other public spaces are the most
common locations for such assaults. Such public sexual harassment is
colloquially called ‘eve teasing’ and has become so institutionalized in Indian
society that more often than not, women are advised to ignore it. Most Indians
don’t even view such behavior as abuse, but rather as a pesky reality of life
in India. </p>
<p>I want
to help and provide women in India the same sense of security I feel when I walk the
streets of New York City. I feel free and I feel safe. A vast majority of women in India
feel neither! I want to help by creating awareness. I want to help by equipping
every woman in India with personal safety tools that are portable, effective,
safe and easy to use. Tools like pepper spray that can be effective in warding
off danger. </p>
<p>To do
so, I need your help. These products are not ‘THE’ solution but they are “A”
solution. A solution, that is quick, effective and immediate. The laws in India will
change when they change and the government will take its time to fix things,
but we cannot and must not wait. The presence of a personal safety tool 
along with appropriate mental and physical training will
help these women become more aware and alert of their surroundings. Support me
in this mission because an “alert”, “equipped” and an “educated” mind will lead
to a safer body!</p>
<p><b><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></b></p>
<p>While personal safety items such as
pepper spray and stun guns are common knowledge in countries like the United
States, they are largely unheard of in India. Despite being legal, pepper spray
is not readily available in most parts of the country. In cases where people
are aware of its presence, they do not know where to buy it. </p>
<p>We at Sayfty wish to provide women in
India with such items, so they can feel protected and empowered as they go
about their daily activities. </p>
<p>Our aim is to equip
1800 women with a can of Pepper Spray each in Delhi &amp; Mumbai. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We will give 200 women in
India access to self-defense classes. We have tied up with two companies
(Justice for Women &amp; Sportz 360 India Pvt. Ltd.) in Mumbai and Delhi that will
provide 15 hours of self-defense training per woman.</span></p>
<p>To achieve our goal we need $25,000 in total</p>
<p>1 can of pepper spray will cost US $10 <br/>
15 hrs of self-defense classes will cost US $35 per person </p>
<p>1800 women *

<p>Total =
$25,000</p><p>100% of money raised will go towards supplies, education and marketing around the issue of violence against women.</p>
<p><b><u>Why carry personal safety products</u></b></p>
<p>From
April – July 2013, we interviewed 1200 respondents about how safe they felt in
India. Over half admitted that they had been sexually assaulted/harassed at
least once. Most respondents admitted that they would like to carry personal
safety products. </p>
<p>A

<p>We understand that you might not be able to
help us monetarily. Don’t worry there are other ways in which you can make this
project successful.</p>
<ul>
<li>Contribute any amount to the

<li>Help us by promoting our campaign. Use Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and emails to spread the

</ul><p>
</p><p><b><u>Finally</u></b></p><p>We have repeatedly been asked, “What
if attackers get a hold of pepper spray and use it to hurt victims?”</p>
<p>First of all, we are not simply
handing cans of pepper spray to women and asking them to do with it as they
please. We are educating them about usage, spreading awareness and via classes,
giving them an opportunity to defend themselves. These are all resources that they
do not currently have. </p>
<p>We are happy to address any concerns
you may have via email.</p><p></p>

Hello,
my name is Shruti Kapoor. I am the founder of Sayfty; a startup that helps

The

Why carry personal safety products

India. Over half admitted that they had been sexually assaulted/harassed at
least once. Most respondents admitted that they would like to carry personal
safety products. 
A
detailed report of our findings is available here.

FinallyWe have repeatedly been asked, “What
if attackers get a hold of pepper spray and use it to hurt victims?”
First of all, we are not simply
handing cans of pepper spray to women and asking them to do with it as they
please. We are educating them about usage, spreading awareness and via classes,
giving them an opportunity to defend themselves. These are all resources that they
do not currently have.

We provide fully guided outdoor-adventure tours for young adults between the ages of 18 and 35 who are living with mental illness or their related symptoms.

<h2>The Finer Details</h2>
<div>
<p><b>All Inclusive:</b> A Halcyon tour comes with no extra expenses or hidden fees. When you agree to go on one of our tours, you know exactly what you are getting. Unlike some of our competitors, we don't want you paying extra for things you thought were included and having to stretch your budget. Once your tour starts we want you to just focus on having a good time and making lifelong memories.</p>
<p><strong>Meals:</strong> Each tour lists exactly how many meals are included so you won't have to budget extra for food. When we are in camp, or out in the wilderness exploring somewhere, we will always provide all your meals. The only meals not usually provided will be when you have free time in a city so that way you can choose from anything you feel like in that moment.</p>
<p><strong>Attractions: </strong>If we list an attraction in the tour description, then that attraction is included in the tour price. Simple as that. We won't take you somewhere then make you pay extra just to enjoy it. Each tour description will list every attraction included. The only attractions not usually included are when we have free time, then you can choose to do whatever you wish; though our tour guides will probably give you a bunch of awesome recommendations and the tour bus will drop everyone off wherever they want to go.</p>
<p><strong>Accommodations and Transportation:</strong> All of your accommodations and transportation are fully included in the tour price. We list how many nights will be spent in a hotel or hostel, and how many will be spent in camp. No surprises here.</p>
<p><b>Tour Guides: </b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">All of our tour guides have received their CAG certificate and have up-to-date First Aid/CPR certifications as well. You will always feel in safe hands with them. They have experience leading tour groups and have extensive knowledge of all the locations you will visit. They will be your go-to source for anything you need while on tour. Once a tour departs, they are never off duty until the tour concludes.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""><b>Mental Health Professionals:</b> </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Our counsellors are university educated and fully qualified to lead all counselling and therapy sessions while on tour. They have experience providing therapy in both individual and group settings and are eager to help you in whatever ways you need. Don't be afraid to chat with them outside of the planned therapy sessions too, as long bus rides can be a good time to talk.</span></p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><strong>When are tours going to be available?</strong></p>
<p>We have no confirmed dates as of yet, but our goal is to get our first set of tours out sometime in 2015. You can <strong><a href=""/subscribe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">join our mailing list</a></strong> to hear about tour availability as soon as they are released.</p>
<p><strong>Are you just in North America?</strong></p>
<p>Halcyon Backpacking Company is a Canadian company, based out of Victoria, British Columbia. We are going to be initially offering tours solely across North America until we are able to grow and expand our operations to additional countries and continents. We hope to constantly grow our tour operations and be continually adding to our list of available destinations.</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to live in North America to participate in a tour?</strong></p>
<p>Not at all! Our tours are open to anyone from around the world. Each tour starts in a large city with a major international airport to make it easier for anyone to participate. All you need is a passport, an ability to communicate in English (more languages to be supported in the future), and any applicable tourist visas to join our tours.</p>
<p><strong>What is the anticipated or ideal size of each tour group?</strong></p>
<p>Each tour will have a different minimum and maximum number of participants allotted dependant upon: length of trip, which mental illness(es) are to be supported, and various other factors. Once tours become available, the tour information pages will clearly outline those numbers. With that said, the ideal group size we are striving towards will between 15 and 20 participants per tour.</p>
<p><strong>What qualifications do tour guides have?</strong></p>
<p>All tour guides are held to top industry standards and must pass our own requirements before being allowed to lead a tour. Each tour guide has at a minimum, a CAG (Certified Assistant Guide) certificate and a valid and up to date First Aid/CPR training. Our tour guides also have personal experience with outdoor survival and have experience leading others in adventure activities. You are always in good hands.</p>
<p><strong>What qualifications do counsellors have?</strong></p>
<p>Our counsellors are a team of wonderfully hard working people whose main job on tour is to make sure all your needs are being addressed and that your therapy time is a time of learning and growth. All counsellors are university educated with a degree that is best suited to assist the mental illnesses they are assigned. They also have a background in counselling individuals in both a one-on-one and group dynamic. They love to travel and have adventurous personalities, which is why they are on tour with you and not stuck in an office somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to bring my own gear?</strong></p>
<p>We will be constantly adding to the range of gear available for participants to rent from us, <a href=""/gear-equipment"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>which can be found here</strong></a>. Each tour will have a list of recommended gear that you will likely need, but if you don't have something, you will be given the option to rent it from us while you are booking your tour. The only gear you will need that you won't be able to rent from us is a backpack and some good walking shoes.</p>
<p><strong>What does Halcyon mean, and why is that the name of your business?</strong></p>
<p>Halcyon (<i>adjective</i>): (1) Describing something that is happy, carefree, or thriving; a blissful, peaceful or joyous occasion. (2) Denoting a period of time in the past that was joyous and peaceful. We felt that the word halcyon perfectly and fully encapsulates the type of experience we wish to offer our customers. We not only want to provide you with great experiences and unforgettable memories, but we also want to provide you with a healthy and happy state of mind as well.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any investment opportunities available?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we currently have investment opportunities available for those who wish to become shareholders with Halcyon Backpacking Company. To learn more and to request an information package, you can <a href=""http://www.halcyonbackpacking.com/investing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>visit the investment page on our website</b></a>, or send an email to <a href=""mailto:%20halcyonbackpacking@icloud.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>halcyonbackpacking@icloud.com</strong></a>.</p>

<h2>Risks and Rewards</h2>
<p>Your support for our vision is greatly appreciated and will not go unnoticed. Your contribution is a vital part in the development of our company, and will allow us to begin offering memorable tours for those living with mental health issues who dream of travel and well-being. </p>
<p>The risks associated with your contribution are very small, but we want you to know that we are prepared for any situation.</p>
<p><b>1.</b> Our company is in the start-up stages of operations and as such, our future could be unpredictable. The funds we raise will go towards research and development and will hopefully help launch operations in early 2015. However, unforeseen delays may occur and we will do our best to maximize our crowd-funding contributions and get tours out and running as soon as we can. We want to be on the road.</p>
<p><b>2.</b> Delays in perk shipping may occur. We are working with external partners in some instances and due to stock quantities or other circumstances, your perk may not reach you by the estimated delivery time. If there are any delays, we will be sure to inform you of them and get your package to you as soon as we can.</p>
<p><b>3.</b> Our campaign is a flexible one, meaning all the contributions we receive will be kept.

The only attractions not usually included are when we have free time, then you can choose to do whatever you wish; though our tour guides will probably give you a bunch of awesome recommendations and the tour bus will drop everyone off wherever they want to go.
Accommodations and Transportation: All of your accommodations and transportation are fully included in the tour price. We list how many nights will be spent in a hotel or hostel, and how many will be spent in camp. No surprises here.
Tour Guides: All of our tour guides have received their CAG certificate and have up-to-date First Aid/CPR certifications as well. You will always feel in safe hands with them. They have experience leading tour groups and have extensive knowledge of all the locations you will visit. They will be your go-to source for anything you need while on tour. Once a tour departs, they are never off duty until the tour concludes.
Mental Health Professionals: Our counsellors are university educated and fully qualified to lead all counselling and therapy sessions while on tour. They have experience providing therapy in both individual and group settings and are eager to help you in whatever ways you need. Don't be afraid to chat with them outside of the planned therapy sessions too, as long bus rides can be a good time to talk.

Frequently Asked Questions
When are tours going to be available?
We have no confirmed dates as of yet, but our goal is to get our first set of tours out sometime in 2015. You can join our mailing list to hear about tour availability as soon as they are released.
Are you just in North America?
Halcyon Backpacking Company is a Canadian company, based out of Victoria, British Columbia. We are going to be initially offering tours solely across North America until we are able to grow and expand our operations to additional countries and continents. We hope to constantly grow our tour operations and be continually adding to our list of available destinations.
Do I have to live in North America to participate in a tour?
Not at all! Our tours are open to anyone from around the world. Each tour starts in a large city with a major international airport to make it easier for anyone to participate. All you need is a passport, an ability to communicate in English (more languages to be supported in the future), and any applicable tourist visas to join our tours.
What is the anticipated or ideal size of each tour group?
Each tour will have a different minimum and maximum number of participants allotted dependant upon: length of trip, which mental illness(es) are to be supported, and various other factors. Once tours become available, the tour information pages will clearly outline those numbers. With that said, the ideal group size we are striving towards will between 15 and 20 participants per tour.
What qualifications do tour guides have?
All tour guides are held to top industry standards and must pass our own requirements before being allowed to lead a tour. Each tour guide has at a minimum, a CAG (Certified Assistant Guide) certificate and a valid and up to date First Aid/CPR training. Our tour guides also have personal experience with outdoor survival and have experience leading others in adventure activities. You are always in good hands.
What qualifications do counsellors have?
Our counsellors are a team of wonderfully hard working people whose main job on tour is to make sure all your needs are being addressed and that your therapy time is a time of learning and growth. All counsellors are university educated with a degree that is best suited to assist the mental illnesses they are assigned. They also have a background in counselling individuals in both a one-on-one and group dynamic. They love to travel and have adventurous personalities, which is why they are on tour with you and not stuck in an office somewhere.
Do I need to bring my own gear?
We will be constantly adding to the range of gear available for participants to rent from us, which can be found here. Each tour will have a list of recommended gear that you will likely need, but if you don't have something, you will be given the option to rent it from us while you are booking your tour. The only gear you will need that you won't be able to rent from us is a backpack and some good walking shoes.
What does Halcyon mean, and why is that the name of your business?
Halcyon (adjective): (1) Describing something that is happy, carefree, or thriving; a blissful, peaceful or joyous occasion. (2) Denoting a period of time in the past that was joyous and peaceful. We felt that the word halcyon perfectly and fully encapsulates the type of experience we wish to offer our customers. We not only want to provide you with great experiences and unforgettable memories, but we also want to provide you with a healthy and happy state of mind as well.
Do you have any investment opportunities available?
Yes, we currently have investment opportunities available for those who wish to become shareholders with Halcyon Backpacking Company. To learn more and to request an information package, you can visit the investment page on our website, or send an email to halcyonbackpacking@icloud.com.

Risks and Rewards
Your support for our vision is greatly appreciated and will not go unnoticed. Your contribution is a vital part in the development of our company, and will allow us to begin offering memorable tours for those living with mental health issues who dream of travel and well-being. 
The risks associated with your contribution are very small, but we want you to know that we are prepared for any situation.
1. Our company is in the start-up stages of operations and as such, our future could be unpredictable. The funds we raise will go towards research and development and will hopefully help launch operations in early 2015. However, unforeseen delays may occur and we will do our best to maximize our crowd-funding contributions and get tours out and running as soon as we can. We want to be on the road.
2. Delays in perk shipping may occur. We are working with external partners in some instances and due to stock quantities or other circumstances, your perk may not reach you by the estimated delivery time. If there are any delays, we will be sure to inform you of them and get your package to you as soon as we can.
3. Our campaign is a flexible one, meaning all the contributions we receive will be kept. If you face any issues while contributing, have questions about your financial statements after contributing, or wish to inquire about refunds, please click here to read Indiegogo's refund policy.",11.0,0,"1 Campaign

Since 2009, we have been been harvesting fruit from backyards and public spaces in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara Counties. In 2012, we started collecting unsold produce from Los Angeles area farmers markets and early this year, we piloted our new Wholesale Recovery Program to collect otherwise wasted produce from the downtown Los Angeles Wholesale Produce Market. Our initial goal was to recover and distribute 300,000 pounds of produce in the first year of the program. We are pleased to say we have collected and donated nearly 2 million pounds in just 5 months. AND this was accomplished with a borrowed truck, operating with limited hours, only three days a week. Imagine what we could do with our own truck, running at capacity five days a week?!?
With your support, we
hope to raise the funds to purchase a 24-foot box truck and begin daily
collections of produce. We believe that a truck, dedicated to the Wholesale Recovery Program full-time, will allow us to grow from
an average of 6 market runs a week to 12-15 runs, in effect doubling our
recovery efforts.Food Waste at the Los Angeles Wholesale Produce MarketWhat We Need & What You Get We need to raise $40,000 in 40 days to purchase a 24-foot box truck.

Wholesale
Produce Market Recovery conducts systematic rescue of fresh, unsold produce from

<h3>Who Be These Strangers?</h3> <p>Hello!  We are The Lilith, a party room at Convergence!  Which, as you know, is just about the raddest nerd convention in the Midwest happening every July.  We provide congoers with games, alcohol and an ambiance that inspires them to pillage and plunder with all the zeal a pirate should have!</p>

<p>""BLACKBEARD'S BOOTY, that's a lot!"" you might say.  However, we need to pay for the hotel (three night stay, unfortunately not cheap) and all the alcohol.  Also, to get the beds removed (it's expensive to not have big, bulky beds in there...)  We also  need to rebuild the ships for Pirate Beer Pong.  You heard me right.  Pirate Beer Pong, where you set your cups on model ships and use cannons to shoot the ping pong balls.  It's great.  But we need new ships, as the old ones ran aground on some reefs the year before.</p>
<p>We also need decorations for the room.  While it's been fun to get away with a blank hotel room with vaguely piratey posters, this year we would like to make the experience more immersive.  What that entails will be entirely up to the funds we are able to raise.  These decorations will be used from year to year, so this will be the only time we need to make this expense.</p>
<p>But don't worry, if you scratch our salty, tattooed backs, we are there to scratch yours.  We'll have special drinks for our donors.  An invitation to the Captain's Table Party, a piratey potluck that takes place on the first night before the room opens.  Patches to sew onto your pirate vests.  Badge ribbons so you can tell everyone else how awesome we think you are.  Drinking mugs so you can gloat over your coffee.  All highly sought after items!</p>
<p>Our bare minimum to run the room is $1000.  We would like to meet it and maybe even surpass it so that we can have an AMAZING party!  Any money that doesn't get used is being set in an account for the next year, so when we come to you with hat in hand, we don't need to ask for quite so much.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Online Coupon Offers: Two Key Requirements</strong></h3>
<p>First, market research from several large companies shows that about half (50%) of <em><strong>all</strong> <strong>new business</strong></em> that walks in the door these days is the result of a Google search.</p>
<p>Second, the research proves that 87% of all consumers will use a coupon if available.</p>
<p><strong>The Obvious Conclusion</strong>: Showing up in Google searches with a coupon, especially a video coupon, is a powerful combination. It works. That is the primary unique benefit we offer our members. Our website gives small business owners the perfect platform to make it happen.</p>
<p>Gold Members can post an unlimited number of printable coupons, with a video option if they want to use it. Each one of those coupons will show up as a separate online page in Google searches.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Two actual client examples:</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://flowingbusiness.com/day-chiropractic-clearlake-ca-special-offer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://flowingbusiness.com/day-chiropractic-clearlake-ca-special-offer/</a></p>

<p>A Gold Membership, which allows posting an unlimited number of coupons and special offers live on the internet, is just $29.00 per month.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>A Similar Site Success Story!</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A somewhat similar website that allows paid members to make business posts is not a coupon site; it is a business development site for Realtors. That site,</strong><strong> </strong><a href=""http://activerain.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://activerain.com/</a>, allows members to make posts about their business online. They charge $39.00 per month.</p>
<p>If you click the above link you will see on their Home Page (top right under “Sign Up”) <strong>they have over 220,000 members!!</strong> </p>
<p>Our potential market is much bigger because we can offer online video coupons to <em>any</em> business, including Realtors! In fact our “Free Consultation” coupon offer is PERFECT for Realtors willing to give a free opinion of value to get a new listing!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why We Need Help</strong></h3>
<p>OUR WEBSITE IS NOT QUITE READY YET!  A computer crash corrupted files and created directory errors that were then unfortunately copied into our backup copy of the site due to operator error. FlowingBusiness.com is now about 90% rebuilt (with multiple backups!) and even better than it was before! However rebuilding it cost time and money and as a result we've now run short of cash to complete and launch the website. We're really excited about it, but we need funds to finish and launch it!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need to Do to Finish and Launch</strong></h3>
<p>We still need to (1) set up a payment gateway, (2) get our services-offered pages finished, (3) finalize relationships with a few contract workers to provide the services offered, (4) set up and test our affiliate program, (5) get dozens of test clients and then test, test, test like crazy for one or two months, (6) then move the website to a super-fast cloud server and then (7) launch our marketing program.</p>
<p>I can bootstrap much of that but I honestly need about $8,500 for costs and expenses, including some high-end professional help, while I finish the website and we ramp it up. That includes a little bit of money for promoting the website both online and offline, although once launched my business plan shows it moving quickly into profitability.  </p>
<p>THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN – there is no way I’m quitting – but there is not $8.5K sitting around and available, which is what I need to do it right. And it had better be right because once launched we expect it to grow fast!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our full goal the funds will be spent on getting the payment gateway and services-offered page set-up. That way at least I can start selling it while I finish it piece-by-piece after that!</p>

Hi, my name is Patrick Dague and we’ve got some great perks!

FlowingBusiness.com is a membership website that will allow the millions of small business owners out there, even those with limited internet skills, to put up “searchable” online video-coupon offers with a “print-coupon” option. We also offer free training plus low cost services for those who want it. 
Links to live Member video-coupon offers are shown further below... 
Please watch the short video above and the 2 minute introductory video on our Home Page at www.FlowingBusiness.com to learn more. This will grow fast so being an early affiliate, which is a perk every donor gets, is a powerful spot to have! 
 
Members Can Set-up an Online Coupon Offer in Minutes!
Our members can set up an internet video-coupon, or alternatively a coupon without video, within just a few minutes. The coupons include fields for keywords to help them get found in local search results. (43% of all Google searches include a city, neighborhood or zip code – we make sure those parameters are included.)
 
Members Get Coupon Capability, Free Training & Low Cost Services
To bring new members “in the door” we let them join free, which allows them to create and preview video coupon offers. However our members have to upgrade to a paid GOLD MEMBERSHIP to publish their business coupon offers live on the internet.
We give all members (free members too) immediate access to our extensive free training on the most important internet business development tools, such as Facebook Timeline business pages, Google Places (now Google+ Local), Twitter, LinkedIn and more. The free training is offered in an easy-to-understand framework.
For those who want it “done for them” we also offer low cost services to set up those same internet business development tools. The bottom line is that with our help any small or medium-sized businesses can quickly develop a strong online presence and bring in a lot more clients, customers or patients!
In a nutshell, FlowingBusiness.com helps non-internet savvy people – and again there are millions of them – to get:(1) a coupon offer for their business quickly up online and easily found, along with (2) loads of good free training in a well structured easy-to-use  format, and (3) low cost help if they want us to do it for them.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Unsere Vision ist es, einen Online-Marktplatz zu schaffen, auf dem Bedürfnisse der Dienstleister im Mittelpunkt stehen.</strong></p>
<p>Für qualitativ hochwertige Kreativdienstleistungen gibt es bisher keinen Onlinemarkt. Im Tagesgeschäft wird der richtige Dienstleister nicht wegen des Preises, sondern primär aufgrund des Vertrauens in dessen Fähigkeiten vergeben. Alle bestehenden Konzepte, die diese Dienste über das Internet zu vermitteln versuchen, resultieren in einem Preiskampf der Leistungserbringer.</p>
<p>Wir ermöglichen es den Anbietern sich so zu präsentieren, wie Sie es bei einem Pitch im alltäglichen Arbeitsablauf gewohnt sind. Wir bringen die weichen Faktoren wie Sympathie und Vertrauen ins Internet. pitchbridge nutzen bedeutet, zu wissen mit wem man um was konkurriert und für großen Aufwand sogar entschädigt zu werden.</p>
<p>Die Kunden auf Nachfrageseite erhalten strukturierte und professionelle Hilfe bei der Analyse ihres Bedarfs und der Erstellung einer Projektausschreibung. Sie können den Kreis der möglichen Anbieter nach ihren Präferenzen eingrenzen und auf die Kompetenz und Fähigkeit der Teilnehmer vertrauen.</p>
<p>So sparen sich die Kunden den Weg zu mehreren Agenturen und die Zeit für die stets ähnlichen Erstgespräche. Die Anbieter erhalten einen neuen Vertriebskanal und können die Anzahl der Arbeiten, die nicht zu einem Geschäftsabschluss führen, minimieren.</p>
<p>Diesen Service (Aufwand und Zeiteinsatz minimieren, Effizienz der Vermittlung steigern) bietet pitchbridge exklusiv an und generiert durch Vermittlungsprovisionen Umsatz.</p>
<p>Wir – Ray und Alex – kennen uns seit über 13 Jahren. Kreativ und unternehmungslustig waren wir schon immer, aber jetzt wagen wir den Sprung ins kalte Wasser. Die Fähigkeiten zur Umsetzung bringen wir mit. Was wir nicht wissen, lernen wir. Was wir nicht können oder wollen, vergeben wir in vertrauensvolle Hände. Wir trauen uns diesen Schritt zu und freuen uns auf euer Vertrauen und eure Unterstützung. Wir möchten etwas Eigenes schaffen, von dem viele Menschen profitieren. Dienstleistungen sollten nach Wert bezahlt werden, nicht nach dem Preis.</p>
<p><strong>Um eine Demoversion unserer Webapplikation und der dahinter liegenden Datenbank vorantreiben zu können, benötigen wir ca. 10.000€ Startkapital.</strong></p>
<p>Mit dem über Indiegogo eingesammelten Geld werden wir außerdem die ersten Messebesuche finanzieren. Überschussmittel sollen die Kosten der Anbieterakquise etwas abschwächen. Wir wollen mit einer Demoversion Investoren überzeugen können. Neben der Präsentation der Funktion wollen wir zeigen, dass wir es ernst meinen und mit unserem eigenen Kapital hinter unserer Idee stehen.</p>
<p>Wir freuen uns über jeden, der an unsere Idee glaubt und wer bereit ist, uns Geld zur Verfügung zu stellen, der wird dafür belohnt! Wir haben ganz exklusive Perks entwickelt, mit denen ihr den besonderen Service unseres Projektes stark reduziert in Anspruch nehmen könnt.</p>
<p>Ihr könnt euch das Recht erwerben auf unseren Seiten genannt und verlinkt zu werden, um so von unserem wachsenden Bekanntheitsgrad zu profitieren. Ihr habt hier die Möglichkeit frühzeitig Vergünstigungen für unsere Premium-Accounts zu erlangen, die nach Liveschaltung unserer Plattform ein Vielfaches des hier gehandelten Preises kosten werden. Wenn ihr das Potenzial unserer Geschäftsidee bereits erkannt habt, bekommt ihr hier die Gelegenheit euch die Vermittlungsleistung für einen Bruchteil der später anfallenden Vermittlungsgebühr zu sichern. Für eine Großveranstaltung, die ein Projektvolumen von 150.000€ hat, liegt Dank der 500€ für unseren größten Perk die Provision für euch bei nur knapp 0,3% - ihr spart also über 1000€!</p>
<p>Für den unwahrscheinlichen Fall, dass wir unser Funding-Ziel nicht erreichen sollten: Eure Spenden gehen nicht verloren. pitchbridge wird live gehen, egal wie diese Kampagne ausgeht. Die Perks bestehen, das ist also garantiert! Aufgeben gehört nicht zum Wortschatz der Gründer – Rückzug oder Aufgeben ist also keine Option ;)</p>
<p><strong>Nicht jeder kann oder will Geld investieren – das wissen wir. Aber helfen kann uns dennoch jeder!</strong></p>
<p>Auch wenn ihr keine Perks von uns erwerben könnt oder wollt, freuen wir uns über jede Form der Unterstützung. Auf Indiegogo werden alle Kampagnen mit einem „Gogo-Faktor“ bewertet. Unser Erfolg an diesem Gründungswettbewerb hängt von unserem Gogo-Faktor ab! Wenn euch unser Konzept gefällt, erzählt es bitte weiter! Ob via Twitter oder Facebook, per E-Mail oder durch Weiterleitung des Projekt-Links – ihr unterstützt uns dadurch sehr! Mit diesem Wettbewerb haben wir die einmalige Möglichkeit bis zu 10.000€, zusätzlich zu dem hier gesammelten Geld, von Google Deutschland zu erhalten. Mit diesem Gewinn könnten wir richtig durchstarten!</p>
<p>Also investiert, empfehlt und sprecht über uns! In wenigen Jahren könnt ihr behaupten, ihr wart einer der ersten, der von pitchbridge wusste und daran geglaubt hat!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We envision an online marketplace that focusses on the needs of the service providers.</strong></p>
<p>Up until now we haven’t seen a marketplace for services that is provider-oriented or is able to attract the right people in order to offer high quality services. In day to day business, providers are chosen based on trust and due to their skills – not because their offer is the cheapest. With the existing online concepts in this area it all comes down to the same thing in the end: a price war between the suppliers.</p>
<p>We’re forging an online environment which allows suppliers to present themselves and their services the same way, they’d be able to in daily business. We introduce all the soft skills, the trust and the transparency into an online marketplace. To use pitchbridge means that</p>
<p>-       you know who you are specifically pitching for,</p>
<p>-       who you are in competition with and,</p>
<p>-       you are compensated for your pitching efforts even without winning it, if the job is big enough.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our customers on the demand side get to experience the first central search platform for service-specific suppliers. They receive skilled and structured support with analyzing their demand and submitting their project tender. Our service actually allows you to find the right supplier based on your preferences and needs, making it possible to trust and judge supplier’s competencies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Customers save themselves the time and money for initial interviews. Suppliers gain a new sales channel and are able to minimize their failure stats on quotes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This service (smart utilization of time and resources, efficiently boosting matching successes) is exclusively offered on pitchbridge. The platform itself makes it money on the provision of successful matchings.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We, Ray and Alex, have known each other for over 13 years now. We’re creative and risk-taking and ready to leap headfirst into the shark tank. We trust ourselves with having the right skills to get it done. The stuff we don’t know, we’ll learn. The stuff we can’t do (or don’t want to) we’ll handover to trustworthy partners. We believe in ourselves and are ready to prove it – all it takes is a little bit of support, be it financially or morally. We’d like to build something that we can be proud of, something with impact, something a lot of people will benefit from.</p>
<p>We’d like to put value back on the map of a price-driven online market.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Support us by funding a presentable version of our service so that we can demonstrate its awesomeness to our future investors.</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The collected funds help us with customer acquisition and venture capitalists. Travelling at current gas prices is damn expensive. Plus, there’s stuff like food, rent and entry fees startup founders have to consider. So guys immediately impact our ability to visit conventions, network meetings and getting a working showcase version of our service. We’ve invested our own money already but every additional Cent counts – help us get there faster and well prepared!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’re happy about every believing supporter. Our perks, which are guaranteed in delivery, make a donation worth the money! Save a bunch of money by investing today and benefit from early believer rebates later on. Or just show off and tell the world that you believed early – your name (and possible website link) will be carved in bits and bytes into the depth of our platform and promotional blog.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even if we don’t reach our funding goal, which we neither hope nor believe, our idea is going to happen. We’re invested deeply, time- and moneywise, so giving up is not an option. Good for you, because your perks will definitely be ready to pick next year.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For all of you who believe, are amused, like to share or are just a little broke right now – you can still do your part!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those of you who have nothing to spare can help us heaps by spreading the word. We’re participating in a contest of Google Germany and can get up to 10.000€ in price money on top of our Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you want to help us win this thing,</p>
<p>click,</p>
<p>share,</p>
<p>mail,</p>
<p>tell however and whoever you can. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>One day you can tell your grandchildren that in October 2012, you’ve helped by supporting pitchbridge…and all you had to do was posting it on facebook among all those duckfaces, instagram food pics and alleged quotes in Helvetica ;)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>THANKS GUYS!</p>

Wir trauen uns diesen Schritt zu und freuen uns auf euer Vertrauen und eure Unterstützung. Wir möchten etwas Eigenes schaffen, von dem viele Menschen profitieren. Dienstleistungen sollten nach Wert bezahlt werden, nicht nach dem Preis.
Um eine Demoversion unserer Webapplikation und der dahinter liegenden Datenbank vorantreiben zu können, benötigen wir ca. 10.000€ Startkapital.
Mit dem über Indiegogo eingesammelten Geld werden wir außerdem die ersten Messebesuche finanzieren. Überschussmittel sollen die Kosten der Anbieterakquise etwas abschwächen. Wir wollen mit einer Demoversion Investoren überzeugen können. Neben der Präsentation der Funktion wollen wir zeigen, dass wir es ernst meinen und mit unserem eigenen Kapital hinter unserer Idee stehen.
Wir freuen uns über jeden, der an unsere Idee glaubt und wer bereit ist, uns Geld zur Verfügung zu stellen, der wird dafür belohnt! Wir haben ganz exklusive Perks entwickelt, mit denen ihr den besonderen Service unseres Projektes stark reduziert in Anspruch nehmen könnt.
Ihr könnt euch das Recht erwerben auf unseren Seiten genannt und verlinkt zu werden, um so von unserem wachsenden Bekanntheitsgrad zu profitieren. Ihr habt hier die Möglichkeit frühzeitig Vergünstigungen für unsere Premium-Accounts zu erlangen, die nach Liveschaltung unserer Plattform ein Vielfaches des hier gehandelten Preises kosten werden. Wenn ihr das Potenzial unserer Geschäftsidee bereits erkannt habt, bekommt ihr hier die Gelegenheit euch die Vermittlungsleistung für einen Bruchteil der später anfallenden Vermittlungsgebühr zu sichern. Für eine Großveranstaltung, die ein Projektvolumen von 150.000€ hat, liegt Dank der 500€ für unseren größten Perk die Provision für euch bei nur knapp 0,3% - ihr spart also über 1000€!
Für den unwahrscheinlichen Fall, dass wir unser Funding-Ziel nicht erreichen sollten: Eure Spenden gehen nicht verloren. pitchbridge wird live gehen, egal wie diese Kampagne ausgeht. Die Perks bestehen, das ist also garantiert! Aufgeben gehört nicht zum Wortschatz der Gründer – Rückzug oder Aufgeben ist also keine Option ;)
Nicht jeder kann oder will Geld investieren – das wissen wir. Aber helfen kann uns dennoch jeder!
Auch wenn ihr keine Perks von uns erwerben könnt oder wollt, freuen wir uns über jede Form der Unterstützung. Auf Indiegogo werden alle Kampagnen mit einem „Gogo-Faktor“ bewertet. Unser Erfolg an diesem Gründungswettbewerb hängt von unserem Gogo-Faktor ab! Wenn euch unser Konzept gefällt, erzählt es bitte weiter! Ob via Twitter oder Facebook, per E-Mail oder durch Weiterleitung des Projekt-Links – ihr unterstützt uns dadurch sehr! Mit diesem Wettbewerb haben wir die einmalige Möglichkeit bis zu 10.000€, zusätzlich zu dem hier gesammelten Geld, von Google Deutschland zu erhalten. Mit diesem Gewinn könnten wir richtig durchstarten!
Also investiert, empfehlt und sprecht über uns! In wenigen Jahren könnt ihr behaupten, ihr wart einer der ersten, der von pitchbridge wusste und daran geglaubt hat!
 
We envision an online marketplace that focusses on the needs of the service providers.
Up until now we haven’t seen a marketplace for services that is provider-oriented or is able to attract the right people in order to offer high quality services. In day to day business, providers are chosen based on trust and due to their skills – not because their offer is the cheapest. With the existing online concepts in this area it all comes down to the same thing in the end: a price war between the suppliers.
We’re forging an online environment which allows suppliers to present themselves and their services the same way, they’d be able to in daily business. We introduce all the soft skills, the trust and the transparency into an online marketplace. To use pitchbridge means that
-       you know who you are specifically pitching for,
-       who you are in competition with and,
-       you are compensated for your pitching efforts even without winning it, if the job is big enough.
 
Our customers on the demand side get to experience the first central search platform for service-specific suppliers. They receive skilled and structured support with analyzing their demand and submitting their project tender. Our service actually allows you to find the right supplier based on your preferences and needs, making it possible to trust and judge supplier’s competencies.
 
Customers save themselves the time and money for initial interviews. Suppliers gain a new sales channel and are able to minimize their failure stats on quotes.
 
This service (smart utilization of time and resources, efficiently boosting matching successes) is exclusively offered on pitchbridge. The platform itself makes it money on the provision of successful matchings.
 
We, Ray and Alex, have known each other for over 13 years now. We’re creative and risk-taking and ready to leap headfirst into the shark tank. We trust ourselves with having the right skills to get it done. The stuff we don’t know, we’ll learn. The stuff we can’t do (or don’t want to) we’ll handover to trustworthy partners. We believe in ourselves and are ready to prove it – all it takes is a little bit of support, be it financially or morally. We’d like to build something that we can be proud of, something with impact, something a lot of people will benefit from.
We’d like to put value back on the map of a price-driven online market.
 
Support us by funding a presentable version of our service so that we can demonstrate its awesomeness to our future investors.
 
The collected funds help us with customer acquisition and venture capitalists. Travelling at current gas prices is damn expensive. Plus, there’s stuff like food, rent and entry fees startup founders have to consider. So guys immediately impact our ability to visit conventions, network meetings and getting a working showcase version of our service. We’ve invested our own money already but every additional Cent counts – help us get there faster and well prepared!
 
We’re happy about every believing supporter. Our perks, which are guaranteed in delivery, make a donation worth the money! Save a bunch of money by investing today and benefit from early believer rebates later on. Or just show off and tell the world that you believed early – your name (and possible website link) will be carved in bits and bytes into the depth of our platform and promotional blog.
 
Even if we don’t reach our funding goal, which we neither hope nor believe, our idea is going to happen. We’re invested deeply, time- and moneywise, so giving up is not an option. Good for you, because your perks will definitely be ready to pick next year.
 
For all of you who believe, are amused, like to share or are just a little broke right now – you can still do your part!
 
Those of you who have nothing to spare can help us heaps by spreading the word. We’re participating in a contest of Google Germany and can get up to 10.000€ in price money on top of our Indiegogo campaign.
 
If you want to help us win this thing,
click,
share,
mail,
tell however and whoever you can. 
 
One day you can tell your grandchildren that in October 2012, you’ve helped by supporting pitchbridge…and all you had to do was posting it on facebook among all those duckfaces, instagram food pics and alleged quotes in Helvetica ;)

<p>Hello everyone. My name is Bryan Calo and I’m an endorphin junkie. As of only this year, I became a fan of running and obstacle races. Most of these races obviously require physical endurance, but even more important is the mental strength and capacity to keep going even when the times get tough. I also ran my first marathon this year as a self-imposed first challenge for charity and we raised $1,300 for two local foundations here in San Diego. This is my second self-imposed challenge and it is going to take almost 5X the length of time as my first marathon. The challenge details are detailed below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why is this campaign important?</strong></p>
<p>I've done volunteer work with ""They Say It’s Your Birthday"" (TSIYB), a charity that throws birthday parties for kids in foster care. The Herrick Center is the kids foster care home that we go to and as much as our activities are fun when we do birthday parties, at the end of the day, it touches me to think what these kids have had to “endure in their lives” for them to be in the foster care home. I want to bring smiles &amp; joy to their lives, even if for just a day. I believe that with this challenge, we can collectively accomplish that goal of a real fun day for the kids.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will you help achieve?</strong></p>
<p>Your pledge donations will go towards taking <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ALL</span> the kids in The Herrick Center foster care to a day at the movies at Cinépolis Luxury Theaters in Del Mar, CA. The foster care is limited in budget as well as for activities for the kids outside of the foster care home. I am donating my efforts and my endorphin junkie craziness on the line to be able to give a day of smiles for the kids at the foster care.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What we need?</strong></p>
<p>We need to raise $1,070. All of that goes to fund a day at the movies, which will be at the Cinépolis Luxury Theaters. This theater has cushy seats, great movie and sound systems, servers that come to bring you food at a press of a button, all of which creates a fun and great movie going experience. I’ve spoken to the theater management and they are giving us a package deal for a movie ticket + snack combo. The raised money will afford to take over 30 kids plus the needed 10 chaperones for supervision for a fun day at the movies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is Bryan Calo going to Endure For Charity?</strong></p>
<p>My challenge is to finish two events, an endurance test called The SUCK and an obstacle race right after called the Rugged Maniac.</p>
<p>The first event starts at 7pm at night on 10/12/2012 and goes on for 12+hrs overnight. I will be carrying a heavy rucksack full of required gear list (such as a sledgehammer, a couple of 50-lbs sandbags, an old tire, etc.) and will be going up and down a mountain, have to do lots of running in addition to all the military style physical training drills that is expected by The Guinness Book of World Record’s Most Fittest Man: Joe Decker. By morning time of 10/13/2012, in order to officially finish, I must complete a 1.5hrs bootcamp. This event is called The SUCK <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/the-Suck/events/78394602/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.meetup.com/the-Suck/events/78394602/</a>. Right after finishing The SUCK, I must travel 1+hrs away to go to a 5K obstacle race called the Rugged Maniac <a href=""http://www.ruggedmaniac.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ruggedmaniac.com</a>. As the title goes, I will “Endure For Charity” and do all this to raise money to bring a day of smiles for kids at the foster care.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW THE CHALLENGE WORKS:</strong></p>
<p><strong>*IF I FINISH THE TWO EVENTS…</strong></p>
<p>…(hopefully uninjured and still alive) all the donated monies will help allow <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">ALL</span> the kids at the foster care for a day at the movies. I have also spoken to the director of The Herrick Center about creating and designing a thank you card with all the kids at the foster care. They will all sign this thank you card and you will get one upon completion of the two events. This will be our thank you to you for taking me on with this challenge and also for your donations that goes to a great and meaningful cause.</p>
<p><strong>*IF I DO NOT FINISH THE TWO EVENTS…</strong></p>
<p>…I hope we can still raise the $1,070 needed. But here are the kickers:</p>
<p>1) Same as above, all monies will go to the foster care kids for a day at the movies and you get a thank you card designed and signed by The Herrick Center Kids.</p>
<p>2) On top of that, I will donate $100 each to the same two local charities that work with kids in San Diego: They Say It's Your Birthday (TSIYB) and Project LOL (Love Out Loud; works with at-risk youth in downtown San Diego.)</p>
<p>3) AND…there’s “The CRAZY CONSEQUENCE Perk!!!” All people who donated will be able to submit an ""embarrassing consequence"" that I would have to do, that must be documented, and shared with all of you. From all your consequence submissions, I will select the Top 5 that I would do and from there, all of you will get to vote which is the one I will have to do. (FYI: In my first challenge in June 2012, I lost! So I had to dress in all Hello Kitty + all pink makeup and hair and then go workout wearing this Pinktacular Outfit during 2 consecutive bootcamp classes out in public where everyone can see.)</p>
<p><strong>*YOU CAN ADD YOUR EMBARASSING COMMENT ON THE COMMENTS BOX WHEN YOU DONATE</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Bryan Calo's Track Record for Charity:</strong></p>
<p>For my first challenge, which was running my first marathon, the self-imposed challenge along with the people that donated were able to raise a total of $1,300 that was split to go to two local kids charities (mentioned above) here in San Diego. The reason I choose smaller and local charities is because I want to know exactly where the donated funds go. Unlike big fundraiser charities, I can tell all the people that donated where their money exactly went and what it funded. I just feel it’s good to know what your money exactly does in order to make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Bottomline of Endure for Charity:</strong></p>
<p>As a current volunteer with They Say It’s Your Birthday, the foundation that throws birthday parties for the kids in The Herrick Center Foster Care, I've realized that I was very fortunate for how I've grown up as a child. Sure, it wasn’t perfect, but I was able to grow up in a home with two parents who are still together to this very day. When I do volunteer work at TSIYB, I can only imagine what the kids have gone through. I see that the birthday parties and the time we spent with them really brings joy to them. I believe they need more joy, more smiles, more happy memorable moments in their lives. With this challenge and for us to pool a collective effort, this is our opportunity to make something good happen. I will Endure For Chairy in order to make this day come true for the kids. So join me in this challenge, for I know if we work together, we can all make a big difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Together we can do better.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Bryan Calo</p>

<h2><strong>LETTING GO</strong></h2>
<p>Several months ago I was informed that my trademark for <a href=""http://www.greenbodygreenplanet.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""GBGP"">Greenbody Greenplanet </a>had never been secured. I was advised to change the name of my company and my product line to avoid legal disputes down the road.</p>
<p>I was completely devastated. I had just closed my salon to focus on this company full time, spent the last 3 years of my life + my entire retirement portfolio building it from the ground up, and now I was at risk of losing it all.</p>
<p>At first I blamed this difficulty on so many outlying factors —including poor legal counsel and misinformation.  But then I realized that it's my company, my responsibility and focusing on <strong>how</strong> it happened, wasn't going to change the fact that it <strong>did</strong> happen.</p>
<p>I could choose to look at this as a defeat and pick up my crayons and go home — or — I could put on my big girl pants and look at this as an opportunity to rebrand, refocus, expand and move on.</p>
<p>Since I've never been one to throw in the towel, I chose the latter:)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>THE PAST</strong></h3>
<p>I started <strong><a href=""http://www.greenbodygreenplanet.com/#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Greenbody Greenplanet Organic Hair Care"">Greenbody Greenplanet</a></strong> during my husbands second battle with cancer when I became aware of the many chemicals that were in the personal care products we use daily, and how they may be affecting our health. (You can read the entire story <strong><a href=""http://www.greenbodygreenplanet.com/our-story/#.UZ5BnIIvoWk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""My story"">here</a></strong>). I was a salon owner at the time and decided to flow my new line through my business, to make things simple during that very challenging time.<br/> <br/>As time progressed, Greenbody Greenplanet grew in popularity and along with it my passion for bringing healthier products to the masses grew as well. On March 31st, 2012, after 14 years in business I decided to close the doors to my salon and focus on my new company full time.</p>

<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>FAST FORWARD TO THE PRESENT DAY</strong></h3>
<p>In order to bring things to the next level and really be taken seriously in the beauty industry, I need to expand my line and offer more product choices such as styling aids and serums. This was my original plan for 2013.</p>
<p>I've been turned down by many salons and distributors simply because my line is too small! The beauty industry is <em>screaming</em> for clean products that work but they also want <strong>""complete""</strong> lines to offer their clients.</p>
<h3><strong>As a stylist, it's difficult to recommend a hair gel full of chemicals to your client after you've just spent 20 minutes explaining the benefits of using an organic, toxin free shampoo!</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>And as a consumer? You wouldn't trust your stylist anymore!</strong></h3>
<p>My plans for expansion in 2013 are to bring in the following items, with a few already in the testing stages:</p>
<ul>
<li>An alcohol free hair gel (first of it's kind)</li>
<li>A dry shampoo w/SPF (first of it's kind)</li>
<li>A smoothing serum (made without silicones)</li>
<li>A detangling creme</li>
<li>A hair-health treatment serum/deep conditioner</li>
</ul><p>Every product we introduce will follow our mission and purpose, be made with certified organic ingredients, absolutely no chemicals, beautiful packaging and perform at the highest level. <strong><a href=""http://www.greenbodygreenplanet.com/product-faq/#.Uai7O-vvMho"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""FAQ"">FAQ's.</a></strong></p>

<h3><strong>WHO I AM.</strong></h3>
<p>For 14 years, I was the salon owner and manager of a 10 station hair salon. I also own a seasonal business at the MN State Fair called <strong><a href=""http://statefairdos.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Fair Do's!"">Fair Do's</a></strong> ,where I won <strong><a href=""http://www.mnstatefair.org/general_info/pc_winners.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""MN State Fair"">The first People's Choice Award for Best Customer Experience in 2012. </a></strong>I used the lessons and experiences of those businesses as a base for building the strong, solid foundation of my current company.</p>
<p>My experience as a stylist has given me an inside edge in regards to consumers hair care wants, needs + concerns and I feel that I can help them achieve their goals by creating healthy products that benefit them while doing no harm.</p>

<p>My personal journey as the spouse of a wonderful man who has survived 3+ years of chemotherapy, a death diagnosis, spinal meningitis, congestive heart failure and COPD — all because of cancer — has taught me that I need to share my experiences with others and help them to know <strong><a href=""http://wisegirl.greenbodygreenplanet.com/2013/01/21/the-beauty-of-cancer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Wise Girl Blog"">there are beautiful things that transpire</a>.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I believe that everybody should have the ability to make informed choices and I don't believe that hair-stylists should have a 30% higher chance of Cancer than the general population.</strong></p>

<p>My plans this year were to expand the line, but now that I am forced to change the company name, I have to also re-brand. This campaign supports the financial costs of doing both.</p>
<p>Your support in this project is also helping so many other people who need the resources, tools, education and products to live healthy toxin-free lives!</p>
<p>Many of my customers are cancer survivors, have physical challenges or life changing diseases that have caused them to search out ways to lessen their toxic body burden, and if you watched the video you know there are so many more that need healthier options!</p>

LETTING GO
Several months ago I was informed that my trademark for Greenbody Greenplanet had never been secured. I was advised to change the name of my company and my product line to avoid legal disputes down the road.
I was completely devastated. I had just closed my salon to focus on this company full time, spent the last 3 years of my life + my entire retirement portfolio building it from the ground up, and now I was at risk of losing it all.
At first I blamed this difficulty on so many outlying factors —including poor legal counsel and misinformation.  But then I realized that it's my company, my responsibility and focusing on how it happened, wasn't going to change the fact that it did happen.
I could choose to look at this as a defeat and pick up my crayons and go home — or — I could put on my big girl pants and look at this as an opportunity to rebrand, refocus, expand and move on.
Since I've never been one to throw in the towel, I chose the latter:)
 
 
THE PAST
I started Greenbody Greenplanet during my husbands second battle with cancer when I became aware of the many chemicals that were in the personal care products we use daily, and how they may be affecting our health. (You can read the entire story here). I was a salon owner at the time and decided to flow my new line through my business, to make things simple during that very challenging time. As time progressed, Greenbody Greenplanet grew in popularity and along with it my passion for bringing healthier products to the masses grew as well. On March 31st, 2012, after 14 years in business I decided to close the doors to my salon and focus on my new company full time.
 

   
 
FAST FORWARD TO THE PRESENT DAY
In order to bring things to the next level and really be taken seriously in the beauty industry, I need to expand my line and offer more product choices such as styling aids and serums. This was my original plan for 2013.
I've been turned down by many salons and distributors simply because my line is too small! The beauty industry is screaming for clean products that work but they also want ""complete"" lines to offer their clients.
As a stylist, it's difficult to recommend a hair gel full of chemicals to your client after you've just spent 20 minutes explaining the benefits of using an organic, toxin free shampoo!
And as a consumer? You wouldn't trust your stylist anymore!
My plans for expansion in 2013 are to bring in the following items, with a few already in the testing stages:

An alcohol free hair gel (first of it's kind)
A dry shampoo w/SPF (first of it's kind)
A smoothing serum (made without silicones)
A detangling creme
A hair-health treatment serum/deep conditioner
Every product we introduce will follow our mission and purpose, be made with certified organic ingredients, absolutely no chemicals, beautiful packaging and perform at the highest level. FAQ's.
 
 
 
 
MOVING FORWARD + GIVING BACK 
The great news is that we already are a company with a strong solid foundation and a Dream Team of advisors. We just need funding to re-brand and expand! Here's where I'm at....

I have recently hired a design company in Minneapolis, Imagehaus, that specializes in rebranding (MadeSmart, Sonia Kashuk, OfficeMax...) and we are currently working on my Brand DNA
I've hired a new business attorney, Swanson Law, to secure my new trademark
Started working with the accounting firm (Laurie Besikof Lapidus and Co) to guide our growth
I will be hiring tena.cious to take over my social media marketing and re-branding this summer along with creating buzz for the product launch
I am working with Erin Giles, to help me creatively build philanthropy into my new business model (see Charity: water below)
I will be featuring ""ingredient spotlight"" and other informative 2 minute videos every month with a focus on helping others understand product ingredients, how to read and understand labels and how to make wise choices.
My WiseGirl blog will be featuring a new series called  'Cancer: A Journey From the Other Side'. With millions of people affected by cancer I believe the spouse has their own incredible stories to tell. I will be sharing my experiences of how life changing Cancer was for me and what I've learned from it —including healthy ways to live a more toxin-free life.
I have a monthly newsletter that will help keep my current customers informed on the company changes + product expansion, and some of our customers are getting ready to test our new formulas!
 
I am also very excited to be donating a portion of our company profits from the sale of our Dry Shampoo to Charity : Water, a non-profit who's mission is to bring clean and safe drinking water to every person in the world.
CHARITY WATER:

 
 
WHO I AM.
For 14 years, I was the salon owner and manager of a 10 station hair salon. I also own a seasonal business at the MN State Fair called Fair Do's ,where I won The first People's Choice Award for Best Customer Experience in 2012. I used the lessons and experiences of those businesses as a base for building the strong, solid foundation of my current company.
My experience as a stylist has given me an inside edge in regards to consumers hair care wants, needs + concerns and I feel that I can help them achieve their goals by creating healthy products that benefit them while doing no harm.

My personal journey as the spouse of a wonderful man who has survived 3+ years of chemotherapy, a death diagnosis, spinal meningitis, congestive heart failure and COPD — all because of cancer — has taught me that I need to share my experiences with others and help them to know there are beautiful things that transpire.
I believe that everybody should have the ability to make informed choices and I don't believe that hair-stylists should have a 30% higher chance of Cancer than the general population.
 
 
WHERE THE MONEY WILL GO —THE RISKS AND CHALLENGES!
My plans this year were to expand the line, but now that I am forced to change the company name, I have to also re-brand. This campaign supports the financial costs of doing both.
Your support in this project is also helping so many other people who need the resources, tools, education and products to live healthy toxin-free lives!
Many of my customers are cancer survivors, have physical challenges or life changing diseases that have caused them to search out ways to lessen their toxic body burden, and if you watched the video you know there are so many more that need healthier options!

 
There is very little risk!
The company is already up and running and creating income. Customers are loving our hair care and begging for more toxin-free products!
Our Challenges? 
Time and capital. My plans are already set in motion and if I hit my funding goal, things will manifest this November with a soft launch of our 5 new products, and then full launch with new website is scheduled for January 1st, 2014.
If I fall short of my target, I am still continuing on with my project, however the progress will be much slower.
 
 
HOW WE'LL UPDATE YOU!
Since I already have the ball rolling on my end, we'll be updating on our progress right after launch!
You'll be the first to know of our new company name, product name and have a sneek peek at the new design!
 
THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
Whether you contribute to our campaign or not, we appreciate you taking a moment to share it to your social media profiles, or pass it on to someone you know that is passionate about living toxin-free!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><b>There are over 800,000 children reported missing every year. That is over 2,000 
children every day. With over 2,000,000 women begin assaulted every year, more 
has to be done. We can do more to prevent this and the Protect Me Now Safety 
Alarm Bracelet is the answer. We have done countless hours of research, reaching 
out to consumers and asking questions and the positive response has been 
overwhelming. I am working with a dear friend in Los Angeles names Everett. He is very 
passionate and creative. After a lot of time and research we came up with a 
design that will appeal to everyone. We don't have a prototype yet due to funds. 
Having a mold specially made for our Bracelet is a bit expensive. We are in the 
process of having the alarm built and will function to our exact 
specifictions. The manufacturer has the sound recording of the scream and are 
working on the inner components and making the first alarm.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>We are creating a safer environment for women and children everywhere. This 
use of this bracelet will reduce the number of women assaulted and children 
abducted. Our goal is to make it affordable for every woman and/or parent 
regardless of income. Protection from assailants, bullies, attempted date rape, 
child predators, and many other dangerous situations.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>We are working with a  manufacturer to build a 120 decibel push button alarm 
which will be placed into a bracelet. There are a lot of personal safety devices 
but there needs to be something that is easily accesible. The alarm will have a 
2 second delay to prevent accidental set off. Once the alarm is pressed it will 
remain on for 2 minutes before it can be shut off. We do not want the assailant 
to be able to disarm the device. If the alarm is not turned off it will emit the 
120 db scream for 10 minutes before automatically shutting off. Again we did a 
lot of research and found that the best sound for the alarm would be a woman 
screaming. The siren sound on most alarms may be dismissed as a car alarm, but 
when a woman screams, everyone looks. We have the manufacturer of the bracelet 
set up and ready to go. The bracelet will be made of silicone rubber. and it 
will have an alarm that is approximately 1"" long by 1"" wide and 1/2"" thick. The 
company manufacturing the bracelet has designed a special mold that will fit 
tightly around the alarm much like a watch. The bracelet will have an adjustable 
rubber wrist strap. We are in the 
engineering process. The mold is in the process of being made, and they are 
installing the sound chip for the scream. The bracelet will cost 25.00. Our goal 
is to have them available for sale online this summer. We plan to have them in 
stores before the end of fall 2012.</b></p>

<h3>The Tania Center</h3>
<p>The Tania Integrated Rehabilitation Center seeks to provide marginalized Kenyan children with education, and equip them with skills to become contributing members of society. Situated in Kiserian, Kenya, about 35 kilometers from Nairobi, the Tania Centre is a full scale facility complete with a school, dormitories, and a playground. However, due to ever-lengthening droughts, the center struggles to irrigate the farmlands using traditional means. This forces the center to rely on donations to provide for the children during the dry season. Some girls in the Center have been victim to child marriage or Female Genital Cutting (FGC), while others face unequal treatment outside of the center. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>A Holistic Solution</h3>
<p>Rural Enhancement through Education and Design and The Feminine Alliance, have partnered together to implement a holistic solution for the Tania Center. We will install a Drip Irrigation System which will provide the students with an efficient means of irrigating their farms even during the dry season. Requiring only small amounts of water, the drip irrigation system will make the center truly self-sustaining and provide the children with increased food security. This system will be installed with the help of the children, and will also act as a means of rehabilitation. The Feminine Alliance will send regular shipments of material aid including sanitary pads, multivitamins, and iron supplements. These material aid shipments will be coupled with empowerment programs on topics like nutrition, health, entrepreneurship, and gender equality. If girls in the Tania Center wish to pursue higher level education, The Feminine Alliance will work to sponsor her financially while also providing moral support.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will provide 165 marginalized children in Kenya with increased food security and female empowerment. To make this project a reality, we need your help. Please make a contribution to this project, and a difference in the lives of the children at the Tania Center in Kenya. </p>

<p>My name is James Dortch; it has been a dream of mine for some time to have my own business. I have 17 years of experience in the hair care profession, the last 4 years I have been working from home using my garage to service my clientele. I believe now is the time to share my vision of a multicultural, unisex salon/barbershop. So in February of this year (2012) I found a building and, for the better part of 6 months I've been having renovations done to the interior, while also paying rent, which is 1600 per month. With a little help from you, banded together we can make this dream a reality. I am counting on your willingness to help, along with your generosity, to help launch a dream. </p>

Growing Food and Sustainability emerged out of two sisters’ wish to give back to the community in which they grew up. Our organization focuses on experiential education for youth in the Middleton and Madison area through projects such as gardening at a youth farm, cooking, composting, and biking--all with the aim of exploring sustainable and community-minded living practices. We believe in the power of young people and work with them to forge what we hope will be a more thoughtful and exploratory world for all. 
 
Growing Food and Sustainability gives community members the opportunity to learn about and experience sustainable agriculture, empowers young people to make positive change in their world, and provides access to fresh fruits and vegetables to those in need.  Through our summer garden camp, after school program, and involvement with the high school Ecology Clubs, our organization gives Middleton community members of all ages the opportunity to engage in environmental education and food production.   As a space where multiple age groups interact, teach, and learn together, the garden creates a greater sense of community in Middleton while encouraging youth to continually rise to the next level of responsibility and leadership.  By incorporating the gardens into class projects, we provide Middleton students with new opportunities to learn academic material in an interactive, project-based environment. 
 
In our first year, we made large strides towards making Middleton more sustainable, and we also empowered young people to make healthier choices and take a more active role in the shaping of their community.  We can’t wait to accomplish even more this year, with your help!
 
 
Training a New Generation of Youth Leaders
 
One of Growing Food and Sustainability’s core goals is to train and inspire a new generation of youth leaders to create their own solutions to the world’s challenges.  Our Indiegogo campaign is focused on raising money for stipends so that we can train youth through our summer internship program.  Last summer, two local college students participated in our internship.  This summer, we plan to select five interns to participate in this leadership development experience.  Interns learn through peer-lead trainings as well as by taking an active, hands-on role in our organization. They learn how to plan curriculum for the summer garden camp, serve as camp counselors, workshop leaders, and meeting facilitators, coordinate community workdays, harvest days, the weekly compost pick-up, and the weekly produce delivery, and will learn green entrepreneurship skills by helping to run our farmers’ market stand.   Our goal is to make sure that every graduate of our internship program leaves with the skills and knowledge to start an initiative of their own.
 
Though our experience has proven that young people of all ages do care about current social and environmental issues, we realize that summer jobs must often take precedence over unpaid programs. By providing stipends to interns, we will make sure that these opportunities for enrichment and growth are available to all.  Through our model of peer-to-peer training and collaboration, we believe that summer interns will develop leadership and organizational skills that will prepare them for the future as much or more as any summer job.
Growing Food and Sustainability, with your help, will deepen our roots in Middleton and provide young people with the opportunity to grow and thrive as leaders within their communities. We believe in the great accomplishments that can be had by planting seeds of change; through the strength of our youth, we plan to do just that--one garden at a time.
Thank you!!

<h3>What this is all about</h3>

My mom was assaulted last Monday and she lost all the money that it was supposed to be for paying her employees, she lost 42 500 pesos [3320 dollars], and when her boss knew what happend to her, she didn't help her and instead she told her that if she didn't pay the money to her employees by November 10th, she's going to sue her. [She's practically trying to send my mom to jail if she doesn't pay]<br/><br/>The problem is that we don't have that money, my parents have a lot of things to pay every single month, and they just payed my last brother's operation [They gave him a new valve].<br/><br/>I can't do much for them because I'm practically still a kid, but the only thing that maybe I can do is try to help them, so please, help me. </p>

<h3><strong>WHO IS REBEL NELL</strong></h3>
<p>Rebel Nell evolved from two proud Detroiters with a passion for making and designing jewelry.   We love the Motor City and the people who live here.  We created Rebel Nell as an opportunity to give back to the community that has given so much to us. Our mission is to employ disadvantaged women in Detroit to make jewelry, educate them on business and life management skills, and empower them to transition to an independent life. </p>
<p>We will use the money we raise during this campaign to hire our first round of women, rent the workspace, and purchase materials. We are so excited for this endeavour and we would love for you to be a part of the journey.<span> Thank you for your encouragement and support!</span></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>OUR FUNDRAISING GOAL</h3>
<p>We have set out to raise $25,000.  Reaching this goal will enable us to hire four (4) women and provide them with a monthly salary of $1500 a month for three (3) months.  We will use the remaining $6,500 for materials, tools, training and rent.  We plan to be sustainable not long after our initial fundraising campaign so that we can hire more women and continue to grow at a healthy pace.</p>
<p>We have an array of giving levels for every interest.  Regardless of your giving level, your contribution is a siginficant step forward in the future of Rebel Nell. Your generosity will help get Rebel Nell off the ground and change the lives of women ready for a transitional opportunity, one that will take them out of the shelters once and for all.  </p>

</h3>Diana has a beautiful spirit and was the person many people would call on for support and advise. She was a faithful employee of the United States Postal Service for more than 25 years and her selfless nature shined through there as well as she was a Union Steward by the end of her career. In life she suffered from <em>cystinuria (an inherited kidney disease) </em>, she was diabetic, and suffered chronic debilitating pain from a work accident where someone hit her as she was delivering mail early in her career. None of this stopped her from being kind, patient or selfless. Through it all she has been caring for her husband who suffers from multiple forms of cancer.<br/><br/><h3><b>Why we are reaching out for help</b></h3><p>Today we were informed that due to her being off work on disability for over 356 days her life insurance policy has been canceled. Apparently she failed to return a form that had been sent to her. The amount shown as the goal would be enough to cover the expenses thus far and a memorial ceremony. It is our intent to hold services outdoors, shoes opptional, at John Bryan State Park in Yellow Springs, OH as it was one of her favorite places. We further intend to acquire a plot at Byron Cemetery in Fairborn, OH and a monument to be installed there, but that is a less urgent matter. At this time her husband will keep her remains close to him until such time that they are reunited and can both be placed in the earth in proximity to other members of both sides of the family. </p><h3>What happens next?</h3><p>We will continue to work on getting her policy reinstated, as it is a clerical issue as we see it. The issue here is time; it is not fair to her loved ones if they have to wait an extended amount of time before paying last respects. We need this to help us mourn and to start healing. We will, in the case that the full life insurance policy eventually gets honored, pledge the equivalent of any funds raised here to a charity or cause in her name. This would be her wishes, in my opinion, and we would be honored to do it. <br/></p><h4>A personal contribution from me to help you see her charicter <br/>

 a grandmother to our next generation. She put every ounce of her being 
into helping others and so many are feeling the burden of this loss. I 
will continue to be the man she built me into, but I will never be able 
to fill the gap she left behind. For those I have reached out to when I 
saw you hurting as I have always done and always will, I want you to 
know it was her working through me. My mother instilled peace, love and 
compassion into me from day one and the truth is I know not how to hate,
 I don't know how to hold on to anger. I owe her everything and I am a 
part of her legacy so for those who need her still as I do, know that I 
am here for you. As she was not well known for wearing shoes, the phrase
 ""I could never fill her shoes"" may not be fitting, but the sentiment 
is. I will continue down this path she paved for me, it will hurt 
looking back now and then and not seeing those impressions of her bare 
feet next to my footprints on the path where they always used to be, but
 path will continue to be paved by me now for our children and we will 
always welcome loved ones and strangers alike to stroll along our path

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <ul> <li>Hi I am Sayem Khan, Architectural Designer from Boston, MA. Also co-founder of Generation Roots a youth club for rural children in Fondwa, Haiti.  I have lived and worked in Haiti for the last four years since the earthquake, working on building houses and schools. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul><li>Haiti has the lowest coverage of electricity in the Western Hemisphere,
only about 12.5% of the population have regular access to electricity. This does not include any rural areas because they simply don't have any access to electricity.</li></ul>
<ul><li><p>We are raising funds to purchase a compact solar system to enable these children from the youth club can have access to light to study at night, charge a laptop to learn basic computer skills, English and Math. <br/></p></li></ul>
<ul> <li>Poverty in itself is a vicious cycle, and these rural children with out access to electricity makes it impossible to get out of the cycle.  With your help we can make a small difference in a large problem, by keeping the hope and the learning enthusiasm of these children alive. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are working towards raising $600 USD to purchase:</li>
<li>A Sundaya Solar System w/ Hub and 2 DC lamps<br/>
</li>
<li>(<a href=""http://www.rpc.com.au/solar-systems/solar-lighting-systems/led-light-kits.html)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.rpc.com.au/solar-systems/solar-lighting-systems/led-light-kits.html</a>)<br/>
</li>
<li>Also a Solar World Sunmodule 50 Wp Poly Soar panel.  (<a href=""http://www.altestore.com/store/Solar-Panels/SolarWorld-SW50-Poly-50-Watt-12V-Solar-Panel-with-J-Box/p9865/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.altestore.com/store/Solar-Panels/SolarWorld-SW50-Poly-50-Watt-12V-Solar-Panel-with-J-Box/p9865/</a>)<br/>
</li> <li>For your contribution we will post a handwritten thank you note with your name on it by Generation Roots children on our Facebook Page.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>By making a contribution you will be supporting a global movement towards making solar energy more affordable and accessible.</li>
<li>On a local level you will be helping support small businesses in Haiti promote more solar energy which is much needed since using traditional fossil fuel energy to produce centralized energy and distributing it to rural families is not a reality.</li>

Also co-founder of Generation Roots a youth club for rural children in Fondwa, Haiti.  I have lived and worked in Haiti for the last four years since the earthquake, working on building houses and schools. 


Haiti has the lowest coverage of electricity in the Western Hemisphere,
only about 12.5% of the population have regular access to electricity. This does not include any rural areas because they simply don't have any access to electricity.
We are raising funds to purchase a compact solar system to enable these children from the youth club can have access to light to study at night, charge a laptop to learn basic computer skills, English and Math. 
 Poverty in itself is a vicious cycle, and these rural children with out access to electricity makes it impossible to get out of the cycle.  With your help we can make a small difference in a large problem, by keeping the hope and the learning enthusiasm of these children alive. 


    What We Need & What You Get

We are working towards raising $600 USD to purchase:
A Sundaya Solar System w/ Hub and 2 DC lamps

(http://www.rpc.com.au/solar-systems/solar-lighting-systems/led-light-kits.html)

Also a Solar World Sunmodule 50 Wp Poly Soar panel.  (http://www.altestore.com/store/Solar-Panels/SolarWorld-SW50-Poly-50-Watt-12V-Solar-Panel-with-J-Box/p9865/)
 For your contribution we will post a handwritten thank you note with your name on it by Generation Roots children on our Facebook Page.
    The Impact  By making a contribution you will be supporting a global movement towards making solar energy more affordable and accessible.
On a local level you will be helping support small businesses in Haiti promote more solar energy which is much needed since using traditional fossil fuel energy to produce centralized energy and distributing it to rural families is not a reality.
You will be supporting a micro decentralized electrification and empowerment.

Now that I've invested so much time, it should be put to good use. I was going to donate it, but the minimum length is 10 inches from the start of a ponytail which I do not have nor can I wait for. So now you get to choose my next haircut, we raise money to build wigs for children, and the world is a better place. 100% of proceeds go to Locks of Love and ANYTHING GOES. If it helps those in need to make their life just a little bit better, then I can deal with a bowl cut or combover for a couple of days. But please, no bowl cut. Not cool.</p>
<p><b>WHY IS THE MONEY NEEDED:<br/></b>It costs about $1,000 to sponsor a child who lost their hair due to injury or illness. This pays for the total cost of providing one cranial prosthesis, or wig. The retail cost of one hairpiece is between $3-6k and requires 6-10 donated ponytails to create. 100% of your donations will go to this.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WILL I GET IF I DONATE:<br/></b>You get all the fun of picking a ridiculous haircut for me and the feel-goodery of giving a child in need their self confidence back. Check out the different perks and haircuts, I hope you'll find them fun. You can pick my haircut, how long I keep it, and maybe a special appearance for some epic selfies. </p>
<p><b>WHERE DO MY DONATIONS GO:<br/></b>100% of donations go to the non-profit wig provider, Locks of Love.</p>
<p><b>WHAT HAPPENS IF THE GOAL IS NOT MET:<br/></b>Every dollar donated is going to the non-profit, regardless of if we reach the goal. But c'mon, it's only $1,000, we can do this!! </p>
<p><b>HOW DO I VOTE FOR A HAIRCUT:<br/></b>Choose your favorite haircut you'd like to see me get in the Perks, add any Special Perks, and then donate your money. One donated dollar counts as one vote toward that haircut. At the end of the campaign, the haircut perk with the most votes wins. </p><p>Any additional donation dollars will be counted as votes for whichever haircut perk you choose at time of your donation. More dollars equals more votes for the haircut you picked!</p><p style=""display: inline !important;""></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1010400/files/20141112210146-2014_Haircut_perksWEBSITE2_unlocked6.jpg?1415854906"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">VOTE:  Select a Haircut Perk and Contribute now!      --------------------------------&gt;</b>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>HOW WILL I KNOW YOU GOT THE HAIRCUT:</b><br/>Thanks to social media, it will be almost impossible to hide my new haircut even if I <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">wanted to. I'll be posting before and after photos and I work downtown with a wonderful bunch of people who love jokes and sharing them. There will be no shortage of photos and videos documenting my poor decision.</span></p>
<p><b>WHY GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE:<br/></b>I love people and the older I get, the less it is about me than it is about helping others and adding value to the world. I am always trying new things and if I can do them for a good cause, then all the better. This is fun for me. I produce special events in my spare time and have done several fundraisers with them. With my hair and your support we can do amazing things.</p>
<p><b>WHY IS THIS A WIN-WIN FOR EVERYONE:<br/></b>I already have the hair, it needs to be cut. There's already a non-profit that has been providing wigs for children in need for 15 years. There are lots of children who have lost their hair from injury or illness and need wigs. The last piece of this puzzle is YOU. You get to support the non-profit, help the children, and add some laughter to the world when people see my hair. It's a win-win-win-win.</p><p><b>WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFO ON THE NON-PROFIT:<br/></b>Glad you asked, right here: <a href=""http://www.locksoflove.org/faq.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.locksoflove.org/faq.html</a></p>

VOTE:  Select a Haircut Perk and Contribute now!      ------------------------------>WHAT'S THE STORY HERE:My name is Paul and I have not had a haircut since August 2013.  It wasn't for any reason, except maybe that I've never had a ponytail before. Now that I've invested so much time, it should be put to good use. I was going to donate it, but the minimum length is 10 inches from the start of a ponytail which I do not have nor can I wait for. So now you get to choose my next haircut, we raise money to build wigs for children, and the world is a better place. 100% of proceeds go to Locks of Love and ANYTHING GOES. If it helps those in need to make their life just a little bit better, then I can deal with a bowl cut or combover for a couple of days. But please, no bowl cut. Not cool.
WHY IS THE MONEY NEEDED:It costs about $1,000 to sponsor a child who lost their hair due to injury or illness. This pays for the total cost of providing one cranial prosthesis, or wig. The retail cost of one hairpiece is between $3-6k and requires 6-10 donated ponytails to create. 100% of your donations will go to this.
WHAT WILL I GET IF I DONATE:You get all the fun of picking a ridiculous haircut for me and the feel-goodery of giving a child in need their self confidence back. Check out the different perks and haircuts, I hope you'll find them fun. You can pick my haircut, how long I keep it, and maybe a special appearance for some epic selfies. 
WHERE DO MY DONATIONS GO:100% of donations go to the non-profit wig provider, Locks of Love.
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE GOAL IS NOT MET:Every dollar donated is going to the non-profit, regardless of if we reach the goal. But c'mon, it's only $1,000, we can do this!! 
HOW DO I VOTE FOR A HAIRCUT:Choose your favorite haircut you'd like to see me get in the Perks, add any Special Perks, and then donate your money. One donated dollar counts as one vote toward that haircut. At the end of the campaign, the haircut perk with the most votes wins. Any additional donation dollars will be counted as votes for whichever haircut perk you choose at time of your donation. More dollars equals more votes for the haircut you picked!VOTE:  Select a Haircut Perk and Contribute now!      -------------------------------->
HOW WILL I KNOW YOU GOT THE HAIRCUT:Thanks to social media, it will be almost impossible to hide my new haircut even if I wanted to. I'll be posting before and after photos and I work downtown with a wonderful bunch of people who love jokes and sharing them. There will be no shortage of photos and videos documenting my poor decision.
WHY GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE:I love people and the older I get, the less it is about me than it is about helping others and adding value to the world. I am always trying new things and if I can do them for a good cause, then all the better. This is fun for me. I produce special events in my spare time and have done several fundraisers with them. With my hair and your support we can do amazing things.
WHY IS THIS A WIN-WIN FOR EVERYONE:I already have the hair, it needs to be cut. There's already a non-profit that has been providing wigs for children in need for 15 years. There are lots of children who have lost their hair from injury or illness and need wigs. The last piece of this puzzle is YOU. You get to support the non-profit, help the children, and add some laughter to the world when people see my hair. It's a win-win-win-win.WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFO ON THE NON-PROFIT:Glad you asked, right here: http://www.locksoflove.org/faq.html
WHERE CAN I GET MORE INFO ON YOU:I'm everywhere, feel free to connect:http://instagram.com/paulsabovikhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/paulsabovikhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/paulsabovikpresents/https://www.youtube.com/user/paulsabovikpresents/videos
WHAT IF $1.00 IS TO MUCH FOR ME:Seriously. A dollar. 
IS THERE ANOTHER WAY TO HELP:Tell your friends. Sharing is caring too. Please. #PaulsNewHaircut

Project is a collaborative effort to promote inclusion and accessibility in
both the US and in Belize. Founded in 2012, the project raises funds to make
social and physical inclusion a reality. </p><h3><b>Our Story</b></h3>
<p><b>Our story begins</b> with a man named Jerome who
had grown up at and loved The Belize Zoo. While working, Jerome was injured, which
eventually led to one of Jerome’s legs being partially amputated. When he went
to The Zoo to visit after his surgery, Jerome realized that he could not
maneuver his wheelchair through the gravel pathways. <b>He could no longer access the place that meant so much to him. </b></p>
<p>So
The Belize Zoo reached out to the Inclusive Recreation Resource Center at SUNY
Cortland (IRRC) in the hopes that we would be able to help The Zoo create a <b>more inclusive environment</b> not only for
Jerome but for all of The Zoo’s patrons. </p>
<p><b>A love affair was born</b>. Working together to form The
Belize Zoo Transformation Project, The Belize Zoo and the Inclusive Recreation
Resource Center formulated a plan to not only make The Zoo more accessible but
also to promote inclusion and accessibility in the US and Belize. </p>
<p>Students

Project is a collaborative effort to promote inclusion and accessibility in
both the US and in Belize. Founded in 2012, the project raises funds to make
social and physical inclusion a reality. Our Story
Our story begins with a man named Jerome who
had grown up at and loved The Belize Zoo. While working, Jerome was injured, which
eventually led to one of Jerome’s legs being partially amputated. When he went
to The Zoo to visit after his surgery, Jerome realized that he could not
maneuver his wheelchair through the gravel pathways. He could no longer access the place that meant so much to him. 
So
The Belize Zoo reached out to the Inclusive Recreation Resource Center at SUNY
Cortland (IRRC) in the hopes that we would be able to help The Zoo create a more inclusive environment not only for
Jerome but for all of The Zoo’s patrons. 
A love affair was born. Working together to form The
Belize Zoo Transformation Project, The Belize Zoo and the Inclusive Recreation
Resource Center formulated a plan to not only make The Zoo more accessible but
also to promote inclusion and accessibility in the US and Belize. 
Students
gained interest in the project and a class was born. The first group raised
over $4000 towards the project and went down to help with the construction
efforts.     Our Fundraising Goal
We've
made some great progress towards making an accessible environment at The Belize
Zoo but our work is not done yet! 

In order to finish our
project, we
need to raise $10,000!

Money (whether we reach our goal or not) will go directly to making The
Belize Zoo a more inclusive and accessible place!

The funds will complete 5 miles
of accessible, firm, and stable pathway for all patrons, no matter their
ability, to enjoy The Zoo with!


When we’re done, The Belize Zoo will be one of the Most Accessible Places in Belize!



The
Belize Zoo Transformation Project is working. It is transforming not only a zoo
but people too. And that is what truly makes a difference. Thank you for
considering our project and for your support, in this project, and in
everything else.

<p>Hi! My name is Heather, and I live in Edmonton, Alberta.<br/><br/>Through a social worker friend, I became aware of a precious little family that really needs our help! The four beautiful children- aged 21, 19, 16, and 6- lost their mom this week when she succumbed to AIDS. This woman did a wonderful job as a mother, and left as her legacy tender, caring children who want nothing more in the world than to give their mom a funeral that honours her for all the kindness and good she contributed to the world. </p>
<p><strong><font color=""#000000"" size=""5""></font></strong> She was a single mom with very little means, and there are no funds to cover more than a casket and burial. The cost of the farewell they so hope for- flowers, food for a reception, a blanket for her in the casket, a wig to cover her hair loss- no matter how simply done, it's just completely out of reach. Funds raised will go to cover as much of that as we can.<br/><br/>The wig is so important- unfortunately, it alone will cost $500-700.<br/>There is still about $200 short on the casket.<br/>Funeral brochures (what are they actually called?!) will be about $75 to print.<br/>Flowers, candles, guestbook, misc decorating will be $100.<br/>And the rest will go to food &amp; coffee for the funeral and the wake.<br/><br/>Thank you to the church who is donating the space and the minister!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are no big perks to encourage you to donate. It doesn't change the world in any big, measurable way. But for four kids who are now completely alone in the world, this means everything. They've seen the incredible love and care their mom poured into them and into the lives of everyone she knew. They've watched her suffer through a long and horrible illness. This is their final act of love, their last opportunity to ""give mom all the things we never could in life"". <br/><br/>There is nothing in the world that matters more to these kids than being able to honour their mother. Please, please give them a final memory of her that they can be proud of as they struggle on to try to build lives alone. The impact of this in helping them to start to heal is HUGE.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you aren't able to contribute, please share this campaign far and wide. Due to the nature of the event, we don't have a long time frame to raise funds. Every little bit makes a big difference.</p>
<p>If you live in Edmonton and have availability October 6 or 7 and would like to volunteer to prep food or host/usher, that would be amazing as well- email me at <a href=""mailto:runninginthemud@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">runninginthemud@gmail.com</a><br/><br/>Thank you so, so much for your support.

By complete we mean a service that doesn’t just promote a bunch of buy recommendations only to leave you questioning which stocks to buy, how many shares to purchase or most importantly when to sell them.<br/><br/>As you’re about to read, we lead you through every step of the stock selection and portfolio management process. <br/><br/>
<h1 align=""center"">
<strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Investing made easy</span></span></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""></span>
</h1>
<br/>The main premise of investing the <i>IP Way</i> is to cut losses and let profits run. We do this by identifying rising price trends early, timing the market and knowing when to jump in or jump ship. It's investing made easy.<br/><br/>This strategy is then overlaid with a robust set of risk and money management features. Furthermore, we don’t use leverage or debt, and only invest in ordinary fully paid common shares.<br/><br/>Our systematic approach towards investing identifies companies with share price action that suggests that the value of their shares could be about to start trending higher.<br/><strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><br/></span></span></strong><div align=""center"">

It’s this approach that allows even the novice investor to invest the <i>IP Way</i>.<br/><strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><br/></span></span></strong><div align=""center"">

</div><br/>Before we get into the detail of our daily routine, it’s worth explaining where we get our investment ideas from and how our filtering process works.<br/><br/>Our stock selection process operates like a funnel.  At the top we have the largest 500 companies <i>(by market cap)</i> listed on 
the NASDAQ exchange and the 500 companies that make up the S&amp;P 500 
index. We call these two groups our 'investment universe' of companies.<br/><br/><br/><p>                         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436354587/qif7xbaicwu1takfjlfz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>At the end of each day we scan our investment universe looking for Buy Alerts. Remember - these are companies with share prices that are showing signs that they could be in the early stages of a new uptrend. <br/><strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><br/></span></span></strong><div align=""center"">
<strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">We say <i>'could'</i> as we never know until after the event</span></span></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""></span>
<br/><br/>
</div>It's these Buy alerts that will eventually populate your portfolios. Each day we also check for any Sell alerts. These Buy and Sell alerts then get published as part of our daily <i>Buy and Sell Alert Email</i> which is sent out to all subscribers.<br/><br/>So that’s the stock selection part of the process at the strategy level. Now let's take a look at our four simple steps and show you just how easy it is to invest the <i>IP Way</i><a name=""Rules"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">.</a><br/><div align=""center"">

We’ve distilled the entire stock selection and portfolio management processes into four simply rules and steps.  <br/><br/>Once you’ve decided on the amount you want to invest, you then need to decide whether to follow our Nasdaq or S&amp;P 500 strategy. Both strategies use the same methodology but have slightly different risk profiles <i>(more on that later)</i>. <br/><br/>Once that’s done, you’re ready to hit the start button. <br/><br/><p>                           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435828292/w8uf5pyfydcy52ck4bqy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Yes...they’re that simple, but to make sure you truly understand every aspect of each rule let’s discuss each one in detail:<br/><strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><br/></span></span></strong><div align=""center"">
<strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Build a portfolio of 20 stocks</span></span></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""></span>
<br/><br/>
</div>Deciding how many companies to have in your portfolio can be a tricky guessing. For us, though, the magic number is 20 with your capital split equally between each company. Here’s our reasoning:<br/><br/> Twenty companies means that you’re not over trading or relying too heavily on just one or two companies to bring home the bacon. You’ll also allow your larger individual profits to make a meaningful difference to the bottom line. <br/><br/>Don’t forget that a 100% trade profit in a 20 company portfolio makes a 5% difference to the bottom line.<br/><strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><br/></span></span></strong><div align=""center"">
<strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Never add more than two stocks each day</span></span></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""></span>
<br/><br/>
</div>The obvious reason here is that you don’t want to be burdened with having to fill all 20 places in your portfolio in just a couple of days. You're more likely to make unnecessary mistakes when under such pressure. <br/><br/>Also, you don’t want to be over-exposed to any nasty whipsaw actions at such an early stage of such a large number of trades. <br/><br/><br/><div align=""center"">
<strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Buy and Sell on the open of the next trading day</span></span></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""></span>
<br/><br/>
</div>This rule keeps any discretion out of our investment strategy. We humans are a fickle bunch and invariably start tinkering with things if given half a chance.<br/><br/>The open of each trading day not only tends to be the highest volume part of the day but it also negates the idea of having to second guess when to actually buy or sell a stock. <br/><i><b>                            </b></i><strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><br/></span></span></strong><div align=""center"">
<strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;"">Only ever sell a stock when a Sell alert is generated</span></span></strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""></span>
<br/><br/>
</div>This is another one of our cornerstone rules which is based on the premise of cutting your losses early and letting your profits run. A large number of our losses are from trades where a share price showed initial indications that it was about to start an upward trend only to falter and head in the wrong direction. <br/><br/>So, once a company makes it into your portfolio you do nothing, except collect dividends, until a Sell alert is generated for it<a name=""Steps"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">.</a>            <span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><br/>                        <b>  ____________________________________________<br/>                                </b><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: 24pt;""><br/><br/></span></span><div align=""center"">

<p>What really drives share prices up and down? There’s no doubt that positive and negative fundamentals drive share prices higher and lower, but it is positive and negative sentiment that causes the value of companies to move above and below their intrinsic values. <br/></p>Just look at what happened in 2007 and 2008. It was positive sentiment that overbalanced share prices to the high side in 2007, before negative sentiment overbalanced prices to the downside in 2008 and early 2009.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>

<br/>Let’s have a look at a couple of charts to help you visualise what I’m saying. The chart below is a monthly chart of the S&amp;P 500 – one of the benchmark indexes for the North American stock market.<br/><br/>

<br/>It clearly shows the direction of the broader market over several years. It starts with the helicon years of the Tech boom from 1996–2000 (Green), which then morphed into the Tech crash-induced bear market from 2000-2003 (Red). <br/><br/>During much of that downdraft <i>Investors Prophet</i> would have kept your powder dry – your cash locked up in a bank account earning interest. Then it would’ve been all systems go again during the 2003-2007 (Green) bull market.<br/><br/>It then shows the 2008 (Red) bear market where investing the <i>IP way</i> would have once again kept you out of trouble – thereby preserving your hard earned cash.<br/><br/>That GFC induced bear market then gave way to rising share prices during the early part of 2009 (Green), at which point our strategy again started identifying new names to be added to our Active Teams, and ultimately our portfolios (we’ll explain this process a bit later).<strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: 14pt;""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><br/><br/></span></span></strong><div align=""center"">

<br/>For most investors it’s what was, or wasn’t, done during those big downdrafts of 2000–2003 and 2008 that is the main differential when considering where the value of your portfolio stands now. <br/><br/>The second chart (below) shows how, when the conditions of the broader market are right, <i>Investors Prophet</i> identifies companies that are about to embark on an uptrend – that is prices are starting to rise.<br/><br/>

<br/>Buy alerts are only generated when a share price is deemed to be at the start of a rising trend (the lower eclipse - shaded green). Companies then remain in your portfolio until it’s deemed likely that the trend has ended at which time a Sell alert is generated (the upper eclipse - shaded red). <br/><br/>It's not an exact science and as with all strategies, there will be false starts. That's why we take the risk side of the equation so seriously and know our exit strategy before we ever enter a trade<a name=""Benefits"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">.</a> <br/>                             <b>_______________________________________________<br/><a href=""#story#Top"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_self"">Top of Campaign</a></b>     </span><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><b> <br/>             </b>                      <strong><span style=""color: #333399; font-size: large;""><span style=""font-size: 24pt;"">    <br/><br/></span></span></strong><div align=""center"">

<p>So, if you haven’t already, it’s probably time for us to take you on a walk around our website. Here we’ll explain some of the key aspects of our service and show you how to make the best use of what we’ve got on offer. <br/></p>
<p>Please remember about two of the key reasons for campaigning on Indiegogo:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>We need you to give us your wish list. What changes would you make and how you’d like the service look and operate. You'll get your chance via a survey shortly after the end of the campaign. <br/>
</li>
<li>We need to raise funds to implement the plans we have and any of your ideas that we can accommodate.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll be making changes anyway, but this is your big chance to have your say about what you really think is important. So help us make it happen.</p>

Our Step by Step Approach

We started Investors Prophet to show people that there is an uncomplicated, safe and complete way to invest. That's the IP Way.
By complete we mean a service that doesn’t just promote a bunch of buy recommendations only to leave you questioning which stocks to buy, how many shares to purchase or most importantly when to sell them.As you’re about to read, we lead you through every step of the stock selection and portfolio management process. 

Investing made easy

The main premise of investing the IP Way is to cut losses and let profits run. We do this by identifying rising price trends early, timing the market and knowing when to jump in or jump ship. It's investing made easy.This strategy is then overlaid with a robust set of risk and money management features. Furthermore, we don’t use leverage or debt, and only invest in ordinary fully paid common shares.Our systematic approach towards investing identifies companies with share price action that suggests that the value of their shares could be about to start trending higher.
We need a rising share price to make money

Importantly, this same systematic approach also allows for all discretionary elements to be stripped from the entire investing process. It’s this approach that allows even the novice investor to invest the IP Way.
Step by step process
Before we get into the detail of our daily routine, it’s worth explaining where we get our investment ideas from and how our filtering process works.Our stock selection process operates like a funnel.  At the top we have the largest 500 companies (by market cap) listed on 
the NASDAQ exchange and the 500 companies that make up the S&P 500 
index. We call these two groups our 'investment universe' of companies.                         At the end of each day we scan our investment universe looking for Buy Alerts. Remember - these are companies with share prices that are showing signs that they could be in the early stages of a new uptrend. 
We say 'could' as we never know until after the event

It's these Buy alerts that will eventually populate your portfolios. Each day we also check for any Sell alerts. These Buy and Sell alerts then get published as part of our daily Buy and Sell Alert Email which is sent out to all subscribers.So that’s the stock selection part of the process at the strategy level. Now let's take a look at our four simple steps and show you just how easy it is to invest the IP Way.
______________________


                                


Four Simple Rules

Now that you've got an understanding how the mechanics of our strategy work, it's time to show you how easy it is to follow, and what's needed to invest the IP Way. 

We’ve distilled the entire stock selection and portfolio management processes into four simply rules and steps.  Once you’ve decided on the amount you want to invest, you then need to decide whether to follow our Nasdaq or S&P 500 strategy. Both strategies use the same methodology but have slightly different risk profiles (more on that later). Once that’s done, you’re ready to hit the start button.                            Yes...they’re that simple, but to make sure you truly understand every aspect of each rule let’s discuss each one in detail:
Build a portfolio of 20 stocks

Deciding how many companies to have in your portfolio can be a tricky guessing. For us, though, the magic number is 20 with your capital split equally between each company. Here’s our reasoning: Twenty companies means that you’re not over trading or relying too heavily on just one or two companies to bring home the bacon. You’ll also allow your larger individual profits to make a meaningful difference to the bottom line. Don’t forget that a 100% trade profit in a 20 company portfolio makes a 5% difference to the bottom line.
Never add more than two stocks each day

The obvious reason here is that you don’t want to be burdened with having to fill all 20 places in your portfolio in just a couple of days. You're more likely to make unnecessary mistakes when under such pressure. Also, you don’t want to be over-exposed to any nasty whipsaw actions at such an early stage of such a large number of trades. 
Buy and Sell on the open of the next trading day

This rule keeps any discretion out of our investment strategy. We humans are a fickle bunch and invariably start tinkering with things if given half a chance.The open of each trading day not only tends to be the highest volume part of the day but it also negates the idea of having to second guess when to actually buy or sell a stock.                             
Only ever sell a stock when a Sell alert is generated

This is another one of our cornerstone rules which is based on the premise of cutting your losses early and letting your profits run. A large number of our losses are from trades where a share price showed initial indications that it was about to start an upward trend only to falter and head in the wrong direction. So, once a company makes it into your portfolio you do nothing, except collect dividends, until a Sell alert is generated for it.                                      ____________________________________________                                
Four Easy Steps


Now that you have an understanding of our rules you'll have no trouble following our easy step by step process of creating and managing your portfolio. 
We'll step you through this entire process in detail as part of our Taking Investors Prophet for a Test Drive article but it’s worth going over them here while the rules part of the process is still fresh in your mind. 

               

Decide how much to invest: Several issues come into play when deciding how much of your hard earned capital to invest. You definitely shouldn’t invest any funds that you can’t afford to lose or funds that you think you’ll need to access any time soon. We’re talking the next few years here to give your investments long enough to really work their magic. Picking which strategy to follow: A lot of people naturally go for our better performing Nasdaq strategy but there are a few things you need to consider:
The Nasdaq strategy does come with more volatility than the S&P strategy (losses and price swings tend to be slightly larger)
You don’t get the same broad representation of the economy
Dividend income is lower which is a consideration for retirees  

Start populating your portfolio with stocks: Remember that you only ever buy a stock on the open of the day after a Buy alert has been generating and you only ever buy a maximum of two stocks a day. The value of each purchase equates to one twentieth of your capital. Once you have 20 stocks you then go into our Buy/Sell rotating mode: This is when you simply sit back and collect any dividends while watching your profits grow. Remember that you only ever sell a stock when a Sell alert is generated, and yes you got it – you sell it on the open of the next day’s trading.  

                      
You get the picture

It’s as simple as that. Once you invest 
in a company you just sit back and collect any dividends until a Sell 
alert is generated for that company. When that happens you then 
follow our rotating Buy/Sell process for as long as you want to 
continue investing the IP Way. We cover this in detail in our Take Investors Prophet for a Test Drive article.                          ____________________________________________Top of Campaign                                     
Why be Proactive?


By being proactive we mean that you need to be able to side step the big down drafts and then, during the good times, be able to fill your portfolio with stocks that are on the move. 
What really drives share prices up and down? There’s no doubt that positive and negative fundamentals drive share prices higher and lower, but it is positive and negative sentiment that causes the value of companies to move above and below their intrinsic values. Just look at what happened in 2007 and 2008. It was positive sentiment that overbalanced share prices to the high side in 2007, before negative sentiment overbalanced prices to the downside in 2008 and early 2009.

It's all in the chart

Let’s have a look at a couple of charts to help you visualise what I’m saying. The chart below is a monthly chart of the S&P 500 – one of the benchmark indexes for the North American stock market.

It clearly shows the direction of the broader market over several years. It starts with the helicon years of the Tech boom from 1996–2000 (Green), which then morphed into the Tech crash-induced bear market from 2000-2003 (Red). During much of that downdraft Investors Prophet would have kept your powder dry – your cash locked up in a bank account earning interest. Then it would’ve been all systems go again during the 2003-2007 (Green) bull market.It then shows the 2008 (Red) bear market where investing the IP way would have once again kept you out of trouble – thereby preserving your hard earned cash.That GFC induced bear market then gave way to rising share prices during the early part of 2009 (Green), at which point our strategy again started identifying new names to be added to our Active Teams, and ultimately our portfolios (we’ll explain this process a bit later).
Avoiding downdrafts

For most investors it’s what was, or wasn’t, done during those big downdrafts of 2000–2003 and 2008 that is the main differential when considering where the value of your portfolio stands now. The second chart (below) shows how, when the conditions of the broader market are right, Investors Prophet identifies companies that are about to embark on an uptrend – that is prices are starting to rise.

Buy alerts are only generated when a share price is deemed to be at the start of a rising trend (the lower eclipse - shaded green). Companies then remain in your portfolio until it’s deemed likely that the trend has ended at which time a Sell alert is generated (the upper eclipse - shaded red). It's not an exact science and as with all strategies, there will be false starts. That's why we take the risk side of the equation so seriously and know our exit strategy before we ever enter a trade.                              _______________________________________________Top of Campaign                                             
Why is IP Different?

Before digging a little deeper to see how you'll start and manage your portfolio, let's first take another look at some of the key benefits of investing the IP Way. 
It’s important to remember that an average return is just that. Profits never go up in a straight line unless you happen to be Bernard Maldoff!It is also important that the way in which profits are generated doesn’t come with unrealistic levels of risk or effort. You'll often see performance figures that look great, but what isn’t mentioned are the large losses in between the odd huge profit.                                          _____________________________________                                            We don't use any leverage or debt: People forget that debt and leverage can be a double edged sword. It’s great to have a multiplier effect on your profits when things are going well, but that same multiplier effect will hound your bottom line when the going gets tough and losses start to appear. Make no mistake that will happen. Keeps you sidelined during volatile times: This is key to growing your profits over the long term. You just need to think back to 2000-2003 and 2008 to understand this. Some may say those downdrafts were a long time ago but trust me it's a matter of when rather than if we'll see one again.                                    ________________________________________

You follow 4 simple rules in 4 easy steps: Such a simple process means that even novice investors to be clearly stepped through every part of the stock selection and portfolio management processes. We tell you exactly what to do and when to do it: This one’s self explanatory. As long as you follow our prompts and make sure that you keep checking in on a daily basis, either via our daily alert emails or on the website, you’ll be right.                           ______________________________________________

Takes 5 mins a Day

You probably don’t realise how important the above graphic is. There should be a third line that goes something like this:= 5 mins a dayFor most of us it’s just no use trying to fit several hours of analysis into our already busy schedule. That’s before considering that you actually know what you’re doing.                           _____________________________________________Top of Campaign                                    
Model Portfolios


There are two main reasons for running our model portfolios. To show you just how user-friendly, and how profitable, it can be to invest the IP Way. 

It’s important to note that our portfolios are only hypothetical and that no consideration has been made for the payment of tax or transactions costs. That said neither do we include dividend or interest income in our results. Our S&P 500 and Nasdaq portfolios are identical from a strategy and investment processes point of view. The primary difference is the universe of stocks each strategy pulls its constituents from. We don't have enough space here to provide a detailed review of our portfolios but the following turquoise coloured link takes you our latest portfolio update that gives you a snap shot of what's been happening. Don't worry, there'll be plenty of links to direct you back to our campaign.
Latest Portfolio Update
We won’t talk about performance issues here, as we’ll cover them a bit further down. Also, you may ask why we only update our portfolios once a month.It was never our intention for you to follow our every move per-say, as our portfolios are mainly designed to provide a snap shot of what an IP portfolio looks like and what the issues are that need to be dealt with from month to month!                            _______________________________________________
Our Performance


It's easy to come up with a set of figures that look impressive on paper, so we've taken time to provide a detailed account of our performance and some of the key numbers and ratios to consider. One of the key aspects of any investment plan is to focus on managing risk and to be happy to watch from the sidelines during times of uncertainty. That’s exactly what Investors Prophet does, forcing you to sit on the sidelines for much of 2008, and for several months during 2010 and 2011.This ability to know when to sit tight cannot be over stated and is one of the key components of the differential between our results and those made by many others. Managing risk is pivotal to longevity in this game. 

The numbers 

The following table emphasises the point well by clearly showing just how much difference our more proactive approach can make to the value of a portfolio. It compares the results of our Nasdaq portfolio to that of the NASDAQ-100 index from January 2008 to December 2014.


 Since January 2008, just before the GFC started, we've turned $100,000 into $485,000. Many commentators, however, use January 2009 as the start date for their performance figures, which happens to be at the end of the GFC and after share prices had just fallen by 40%. 
Our Performance Page
For the purposes of our Indiegogo campaign, and due to space constraints, the above numbers are only for our Nasdaq strategy.  Now make sure you go to the performance page of our website (the above turquoise coloured link) to get a much more detailed insight into some of the key aspects of the results. I think you’ll be impressed. Don't worry, there'll be plenty of links to direct you back to our campaign.                           ______________________________________________Top of Campaign                                    
Test Drive Investors Prophet


There's nothing like taking a car for a test drive. You jump behind the wheel excited with anticipation, while wondering what you'll be thinking when you next pull into the curb. We hope this test drive will be no different and that you’ll walk away satisfied. We won’t be jumping in a car but we’ll be assuming we started the New Year of 2014 with $50,000 of cash wanting to find a home in your portfolio.We’ll be starting off with an introduction about our approach towards investing and then do some revision about some of the key aspects of our S&P 500 strategy. Then we’ll be off for the test drive before having a look at the results.

It’s a must read to really understand the logic behind investing the IP Way.The Four Ps of Investing: OK making a profit is one of them, which we’re talk about at length, but without a good understanding of the others you’re likely to only be a temporary resident of the investing community. I’ll leave you to guess what the others are and I can guarantee this special report will be an interesting read.
Daily Buy and Sell Email Alerts

Everything we do is centred on our Buy and Sell alerts. If you want to invest the IP Way then you need to keep abreast of our daily alerts. The best way to do that is to check our Daily Buy and Sell Alert emails.We highlight the number of Buy and Sell alerts for each strategy and provide a link back to the website so you can view which companies have made the lists. 
Classroom Articles

Even though we are happy to do all the strategy based work for you, it’s imperative that you continually strive to learn and to broaden your knowledge base. We’ll welcome you into the classroom and provide weekly articles that are designed to focus your attention on the issues that really count. 
Portfolio Updates

Shortly after the end of each month we publish updates for each of our model portfolios. We start off by providing an overview of what sort of mood Mr Markets been in before digging a little deeper to see what’s really been happening. These updates provide a great insight into how to manage a portfolio the IP Way.                                   ___________Contribute___________

What Do We Need?

This is where spell out our reasons for crowd funding on Indiegogo. Essentially we need to raise funds to upgrade our website and get to feedback from you. 

 The majority of the funds raised will be used to redesign the website and to make it mobile friendly. The changes will be centred on improving the functionality and speed of the service while also incorporating some of your ideas.We’re not putting a figure on the cost of any changes as we don’t know exactly what those changes will be or which ones we can afford, until we’ve heard back from you.
We need feedback
We’ve done all the hard work associated with developing and back-testing our strategy. We know it works so we now need to focus on providing the service for people like you.We want to listen to you. We’re keen to hear your suggestions about how to customise our service to best suit your needs. It’s not often that customers get to have a say about how they’d like a service to look and feel, but that’s exactly what we’re doing.So make sure you send in a comment with any suggestions and be sure to complete a small survey we’ll be sending out shortly after the end of the campaign.                                                   ___________Contribute___________


Risks/Timeline

Our campaign is slightly different to most others as Investors Prophet is already up and running which means you'll start receiving the full service from the day you fund a perk.At this stage we can't provide definitive timeline for when we expect the changes to be completed as many of them will be based on the feedback we get from you.The Special Reports will be available within one month of the campaign ending, while changes to the website will progressively be made over a six month period.
Access to website

The great thing about our campaign is that there is no waiting. You start to receive the full service from the day after you fund a perk. Even better is that your subscription period only starts from the end of the campaign. So the earlier you get started the more you get for FREE.
Risks

Investors Prophet is already up and running and the funds raised will primarily be used to improve the functionality and look and feel of the service. This, therefore, reduces most risks normally associated with designing and producing products that have yet to be completed.

<p>Today, there are many structures to separately deal with various Lilian's diseases but very few structures deal with all diseases at the same time and unfortunately they do not have the right answers for Lilian and other children with same diseases.</p>
<p>The whole small village of Cogolin in France has mobilized for Lilian and some surrounding communities did so, but now <b>we need your help so Lilian's disease can be known worldwide and globally shared with other countries.</b><br/></p>

<h3><b>What We Need</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We need to raise as soon as possible <b>about $ 15.065 to allow Lilian to follow emergency care in Barcelona, the only European center adapted to this kind of disease.</b> This <b>neuro-rehabilitation program in Barcelona</b> is called <b>""Essentis Program"".</b></p>
<p>You can visit Essentis official webpage to understand the kind of care children like Lilian are following in this center (see <a href=""http://www.metodoessentis.com/info.php?sec=142&amp;idioma=en)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.metodoessentis.com/info.php?sec=142&amp;idioma=en)</a> but you have to know that, during the sessions, the patient goes through various workshops in which posture, disability and symptoms are evaluated by different members of Essentis' team (osteopaths, acupuncturists, Physiotherapists ...) to develop a personalized program adapted to children's needs.</p>
<p>Different therapists work in coordination within the center and the team of Dr. Nazarov (myiotenofaciectomie), that of Dr. Lao (geneticist) and Dr. Cori Lopez (neurologist), Windoor (Empuriabrava), which enables a rapid response to the needs of daily patient.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The <b>Essentis patient approach is holistic</b>, meaning it is considered in its entirety.</p>
<p>Essentis is the only program we know that is able to treat all the symptoms of the disease at the same time.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1018851/files/20141116030948-Essentis_Method.png?1416136188"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>We would also <b>need SPLINTS, SPECIAL SHOES, and a GATEADOR, a support allowing children with this disease to walk with 4 legs almost alone.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1018880/files/20141116032800-Gateador.jpeg?1416137280"" src="""" style=""""/>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1018881/files/20141116032820-Gateador_2.jpeg?1416137300"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/> </p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Why $ 15.065 ?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>A <b>stay at the neuro-rehabilitation center in Barcelona costs about $ 3.800 </b>(travel from Cogolin to Barcelona included) per 15 days periods of treatment. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Lilian ideally needs 3
stays in a whole year to enable him to achieve real progress in traction,
which makes : <b>$</b> <b>3.800 x 3 curing sessions = $ 11.400.</b></p>
<p>Besides : </p>
<p>- the <b>splints we need cost about $ 1.300, </b></p>
<p>- the <b>special shoes cost about $ 200,</b></p>
<p>- and the <b>gateador costs about $ 200.</b></p>
<p><b>Subtotal needed : $ 13.100</b></p>
<p>The <b>Indiegogo fees</b> are about 15% (third party fees
included and additional currency exchange fees not included), that is <b>15% x $ 13.100 = $ 1.965.</b></p>
<p><b>Total needed = $ 15.065.</b></p>
<p>Of course we would be glad to raise a little bit more because it would allow us to offer Lilian more care for 2015 and also appropriate toys for his age for Christmas 2014.</p>
<p>Lilian's mother is a modest woman and can not afford to pay for everything. <b>Your hand would be welcome to help Lilian and help Lilian's mother, Elodie, find hope for her son.</b><br/></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the <b>French health care system does not pay back these kind of expenses because Lilian's disease is totally unknown in France.</b></p>

The Non-Profit Association ""Je cours pour Lilian"" (I
Run for Lilian) was created in November 2013 by people close to
Lilian, in the town of Cogolin, France, near Saint Tropez.
Lilian is a little smiling boy with mischievous sparkling eyes. He just wants to enjoy life and be able to run and play with his friends and cousins.He was born May 24, 2012 with a complete bilateral cleft lip and palate, severe plagiocephaly and congenital legs folded on his stomach torticollis.Thereafter, he was diagnosed with, in addition, central sleep apnea and an overly narrow occipitocervical junction with risk of compression of the spinal cord.See him trying to walk below (he is almost 2 and a half and shoud run as every little child of his age) :Since his birth his parents struggle to give him the best care but everything has a price. As time passes, the risk of psychomotor delay for Lilian increase.Lilian's mother and two of her friends are fans of running. Pushed by people around them they decided to create the Association to try to take care of (at least part of) Lilian's medical expenses.
The name of the Association was created according to
the following idea : ""Instead of running for us, why not run for Lilian
?""


Above all, our will is to do everything we can for Lilian so he can RUN one day.

The Association is committed since November 2013 to help Lilian's family and give a long-term help to other children with same diseases.
Today, there are many structures to separately deal with various Lilian's diseases but very few structures deal with all diseases at the same time and unfortunately they do not have the right answers for Lilian and other children with same diseases.
The whole small village of Cogolin in France has mobilized for Lilian and some surrounding communities did so, but now we need your help so Lilian's disease can be known worldwide and globally shared with other countries.


Even Doctor Jorandon, Lilian's Cogolin Doctor, ran in New York City Marathon this year for Lilian ! See photo below :


And many other unknown people ran marathons with the Official T-Shirt from the association ""Je cours pour Lilian"" (I Run For Lilian) :


We would like to help Lilian and children with same diseases to get a chance to find answers and solutions to heal one day. This is why we would need your help !

What We Need

We need to raise as soon as possible about $ 15.065 to allow Lilian to follow emergency care in Barcelona, the only European center adapted to this kind of disease. This neuro-rehabilitation program in Barcelona is called ""Essentis Program"".
You can visit Essentis official webpage to understand the kind of care children like Lilian are following in this center (see http://www.metodoessentis.com/info.php?sec=142&idioma=en) but you have to know that, during the sessions, the patient goes through various workshops in which posture, disability and symptoms are evaluated by different members of Essentis' team (osteopaths, acupuncturists, Physiotherapists ...) to develop a personalized program adapted to children's needs.
Different therapists work in coordination within the center and the team of Dr. Nazarov (myiotenofaciectomie), that of Dr. Lao (geneticist) and Dr. Cori Lopez (neurologist), Windoor (Empuriabrava), which enables a rapid response to the needs of daily patient.

The Essentis patient approach is holistic, meaning it is considered in its entirety.
Essentis is the only program we know that is able to treat all the symptoms of the disease at the same time.


We would also need SPLINTS, SPECIAL SHOES, and a GATEADOR, a support allowing children with this disease to walk with 4 legs almost alone.

     


Why $ 15.065 ?

A stay at the neuro-rehabilitation center in Barcelona costs about $ 3.800 (travel from Cogolin to Barcelona included) per 15 days periods of treatment. 

Lilian ideally needs 3
stays in a whole year to enable him to achieve real progress in traction,
which makes : $ 3.800 x 3 curing sessions = $ 11.400.
Besides : 
- the splints we need cost about $ 1.300, 
- the special shoes cost about $ 200,
- and the gateador costs about $ 200.
Subtotal needed : $ 13.100
The Indiegogo fees are about 15% (third party fees
included and additional currency exchange fees not included), that is 15% x $ 13.100 = $ 1.965.
Total needed = $ 15.065.
Of course we would be glad to raise a little bit more because it would allow us to offer Lilian more care for 2015 and also appropriate toys for his age for Christmas 2014.
Lilian's mother is a modest woman and can not afford to pay for everything. Your hand would be welcome to help Lilian and help Lilian's mother, Elodie, find hope for her son.
Unfortunately, the French health care system does not pay back these kind of expenses because Lilian's disease is totally unknown in France.




What you get


You get according to the amount of your donation : our deepest thanks, a Desktop Wallpaper, a movie with our thanks, Official bracelets marked ""Je cours
pour Lilian"", your name on a Facebook Film or Official T-shirts

<p><b>Short Summary</b><br/></p>
<p>My name is Stephen, I  come from Kenya
and in my village, I'm the fifth to ever study up to university level. I
graduated with a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering in April this year. I
am a role model to many of my people and I feel that I should do something that
will inspire them and change their mindset about success in life. <br/></p>
<p>Instead of
looking for a job in the city and live my life like most people have done, I
wish to start a small project back in the village that will inspire people and change their mindset about success. My sister and I have decided to start an indigenous chicken farming project. For the
last three months, we have been researching, studying and collecting relevant
information about poultry farming in our country. Right now, we have all the
necessary information and plan on how to start this project and make it
successful. As per our 5-year business plan, we need $7,000 to successfully start
the project and operate it for the first one year. We are very confident that the
project will be successful. We are one of those people who sacrifice everything to
ensure that what they focus on succeeds. </p>
<p>The main reason why we chose this project is because poultry farming is very common back at home,
only that people do not commercialize it. Therefore we want to inspire and show
them that if they decide to do it commercially and professionally, it can change their lives tremendously
</p>
<p>If we had powers, we
would reward hugely anybody who will support us but for now all we are requesting
is to give us a helping hand. We are targeting about 7000 people so that if everyone
supports us with $1, we will have achieved our target; if we get 467 people each supporting us with $15, we will have achieved our goal too. Our main belief is in crowdfunding. Thus it doesn't matter how
small or big your contribution is. Every support will mean a change to lives of many people here at home. You will forever be honored and celebrated for having been part
of this change that we wish to bring. </p>
<p>Also, please help us spread the word and join us on social media so that we can share more.</p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>What we need and what you will get</b></p>
<p>We are raising
$7,000 (capital) for general starting of our community poultry farming project.
This money will be used for constructing a poultry house, purchasing equipment,
purchasing chicks, paying for some legal fees for and catering for some
expenses during the first year of the project. We will set up the project in our
local farm back at home </p>
<p><b>You</b> will get
lasting fame and honor with your name on the gratitude wall of the project and always be
listed among the principal supporters of the project. You will also be part of
the community forever and we will establish a day which my community will be
celebrating supporters of this project on annual basis. We are hopeful that one
day, some of you will attend this event here, share the joy and see the impact
you will have made</p>
<p><b>What if</b>
we don’t reach our funding goal? The money you contribute will be used to cater
for the construction of the poultry house and purchase of equipment. You will still be supporting this local project and changing people’s
lives forever </p>
<p><b>What if</b>
we surpass our funding goal? Any money above our goal will be used to purchase
more chicks. According to our plan, we want to start with 200 chicks and increase
them to 1000 chicks in 3 years. If we get more funds than our goal, we will
increase the number of chicks to start with </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project
will support the local community in changing the mindset of people especially
youths on success in life. Youths within our community have a fixed mind that
you cannot live a decent life if you don’t have a white collar job. We are among
the less than 10 people who have studied to university level within our
community. I would really wish to help my community by inspiring them. Instead
of living in the city and only going home occasionally, we want to start a small
project back at home. We need $7,000 to start the community poultry farming project. We are confident and motivated to make this project
successful. Once we achieve that, we will have started a long journey of
transforming our community. We need your support because getting a loan here in our country when you are not employed is next to impossible. That is why we are requesting for your support, in any way. We will be humbled for any kind of support;
monetary or motivational,  </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Chicken rearing is subject to various diseases but the good news is that there are vaccines that have been discovered to overcome this challenge. We are going to run this project by ourselves and with the dedication and hard work we have, we will ensure that every challenge that comes along is handled in the best way possible. We will purchase vaccination equipment and be in contact with veterinary officers who will be visiting the farm frequently to check the health of our poultry and give recommendations.  <br/>

co-workers, bosses or organizations who would wish to make an impact on the
entire community and be honored for their support. Share this Indiegogo
campaign on your online and offline contacts. Use Indiegogo share tools to spread the word.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The faith you will have in us will be a great challenge for us to devote ourselves for the success of the project. You will help our community realize the sweetness of success and change their mindset forever. <b>Thank you in advance for your support and be blessed.</b><br/></p>

Road, offer an ethos where engagement between different cultures and
peoples occur without resort to conflict or domination. ""Difference"", in other words, should not always be associated with behaviors such as ""exile"" or ""alienation"". Rather, difference in today's international system offers a source of learning,
adaptation, absorption, circulation and co-constitution. The Global

  Rebuilding Community 
By definition the MMC is a gathering of men and a way for men to practice and to interact with each other in community.  The value of reaching out and being open to communicating and to be heard and witnessed by other men is at the core of reclaiming the self, the family, the village and the world around us. The MMC has been conducting it's annual event for 30 years and look many generations into the future as we establish new roots and honor the efforts of many men from its past.
Robert Bly, the MMC and thousands of men it has touched have been talked about on national television, countless radio programs and inside the halls of numerous universities.  Robert Bly's Minnesota Men's Conference and supporting the growth and evolution of men in today's world are inseparable. 
  Risks & Challenges 
Although the Minnesota Men's Conference has been around for a long time, we find ourselves having to evolve in a new culture with new challenges.  The MMC nearly disappeared just a few years ago due to the waining health of it's founder Robert Bly and related financial impacts.  
Through the deep commitment of the new board of directors and a the enthusiasm of a world class operational team the MMC seeks to re-establish itself and offer it's own treasures to many thousand more men.  
We need your financial contribution and word-of-mouth exposure to do that.

<p>Voici un petit aperçu des 6 projets dont je rêve jour et nuit pour cette année qui vient. Ils seront orchestrés au gré des saisons dans l'espace public.</p>
<p><b>Tendresse postale </b>: a été
inspiré par l'annonce de la disparition des facteurs à domicile et un fait divers lu sur Facebook qui racontait le manque de tendresse dans la ville. Depuis le 1er
janvier, et pendant un an, j'envoie une «lettre-banderole» par jour à quelqu'un avec qui j'ai
eu une connexion au café, sur Facebook ou dans la vie. 365 caresses postales auront été cartographiées et envoyées par la poste d'ici le 31 décembre.  Un
événement surprise impliquant les personnes à qui j'aurai envoyé une tendresse
postale est prévu en janvier 2015.  <b>Ce projet est en route.    </b>[Choisissez la contrepartie «Caresse postale» inspirée de ce projet pour répandre de la tendresse à travers le monde!]</p>

possibilité de cuisiner, de jardiner, d'une session de tricot ou autre activité pour rentrer dans

Chaque jour, du 1er au 24 décembre, à l'aide du calendrier de l'Avent conçu pour l'occasion, vous ouvrirez la fenêtre du calendrier pour connaître l'adresse où suivre le conte. 

Comme une chasse au trésor urbaine, voisins et passants seront invités à lire 24 fenêtres résidentielles transformées en 24 pages d’un conte écrit sur-mesure. Un dessin à la fenêtre retricote à la fois l’espace urbain et le maillage entre les voisins.

<p><b>La bénédiction des vélos </b>: est
né des derniers événements tragiques impliquant des cyclistes et inspiré d'une tradition que j'ai vu en Bolivie. C'est un rituel
annuel que je désire instaurer dès qu'on ressort enfin nos vélos afin de protéger
les cyclistes le temps d'une saison complète. Je vous garde la surprise mais tous les Montréalais y seront conviés!  <b>Ce
rituel aura lieu le 30 mai devant l'église Saint-Jean-Baptiste. </b>[Réservez l' «Atelier déco vélo» offert en contrepartie pour rendre cet événement encore plus festif!]</p>

<br/><p><b>Le cortège </b>: est
inspiré du fait que le Mile End compte la plus grande concentration d'artistes
en Amérique du Nord. Il permettra aux artistes de se
retrouver dans la rue avec leur oeuvre lors d'une déambulation festive pour qu'on puisse enfin voir
qui sont ces créateurs dont on parle tant. Des peintures seront portées, dessins et gravures seront dévoilés, des sculptures seront tirées sur roulettes, des masques seront portés et des performances seront itinérantes... Le tout culminera par
un happening champêtre «là où tout est possible». <b>Ce projet sera réalisé à

<br/><p><b>The Parade </b>is inspired by the fact that the Mile End is home to the biggest concentration of artists in North America. It's time that we actually see who these artists are and that we bring them and their work out of the studios! During this carnival-like parade, the artist and their work will be celebrated together. Paintings will be carried, drawings and etchings should be framed, sculptures can be wheeled, masks should be worn and performances performed... all the way to the Champ des Possibles, a field where ""tout est encore possible"". <b>This happening will wind its way through the streets of the Mile End at the end of June.</b></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The Meal </b>was inspired by an episode of MasterChef Australia I heard about. I immediately redesigned this experience for the city. The Meal is conceived and cooked in the middle of the street from ingredients foraged from neighbours' fridges and pantries. A shared, communal and collaborative experience orchestrated by a celebrated chef with and for an entire neighbourhood. Each household that invites the chef and his or her team of neighbours to collect ingredients will be entitled to a seat at the meal. One hundred names will be picked from a pot: they will be the 100 seated guests.  <b>This meal will be shared at the end of August.</b></p>

RÉPANDRE DE LA MAGIE, ENSEMBLE
J'ai besoin de votre aide pour continuer de répandre de la magie dans les rues de Montréal. J'ai prévu 6 nouveaux projets et votre
contribution est essentielle à leurs réalisation. Pour chaque don, une chouette contrepartie vous sera offerte.
Depuis 2009, je conçois et réalise des projets
participatifs à Montréal et dans mon quartier pour rassembler les voisins et leur donner
l'occasion de se raconter. Depuis la Petite fille aux allumettes sur Waverly en 2012, j'ai
orchestré 8 projets dans le Mile End dont 1 seul a bénéficié d'une subvention. 


UNE FÉE DANS LES RUES DE MONTRÉAL
Depuis 2 ans, on m’appelle la Fée du Mile End. 
J’explore mon quartier afin de créer des expériences infiltrantes,
participatives et rassembleuses qui encouragent les gens à se rencontrer et à
se raconter.  L’amour dans le Mile End, La mer, Ici un souvenir, Là où l’amour coule et Écrire une fleur ont déclenché
des rencontres inusitées et créé des liens entre voisins et passants à travers
des “dispositifs-signalétiques” sérigraphiés, cousus, imprimés au pochoir ou
étampés, attachés aux clôtures, enroulés autour des arbres, imprimés sur le
trottoir ou les vitrines et collés sur les murs.  




MA DÉMARCHE FÉÉRIQUE
J’élimine l’écran. J’amplifie le no-tech parce qu’il
est aussi poétique. Je cultive l’offrande dans un contexte marchand. Je
privilégie le relationnel et les histoires plutôt que l’économie. J’imagine de
nouvelles façons d’échanger. Je préfère les traces écrites plutôt que
numériques. Facebook, oui, mais aussi la boîte aux lettres! Je déambule dans la
ville autrement que dans le cyberespace. J’ai une responsabilité citoyenne, je
suis engagée. J’orchestre des situations de rencontre pour que les gens se
racontent. J’aime les inconnus, en français et en anglais! La machine, oui,
mais toujours en lien avec la main. Le trottoir est mon jardin.



CALENDRIER DE LA FÉE URBAINE 2014-2015
Voici un petit aperçu des 6 projets dont je rêve jour et nuit pour cette année qui vient. Ils seront orchestrés au gré des saisons dans l'espace public.
Tendresse postale : a été
inspiré par l'annonce de la disparition des facteurs à domicile et un fait divers lu sur Facebook qui racontait le manque de tendresse dans la ville. Depuis le 1er
janvier, et pendant un an, j'envoie une «lettre-banderole» par jour à quelqu'un avec qui j'ai
eu une connexion au café, sur Facebook ou dans la vie. 365 caresses postales auront été cartographiées et envoyées par la poste d'ici le 31 décembre.  Un
événement surprise impliquant les personnes à qui j'aurai envoyé une tendresse
postale est prévu en janvier 2015.  Ce projet est en route.    [Choisissez la contrepartie «Caresse postale» inspirée de ce projet pour répandre de la tendresse à travers le monde!]




Les Voisinanges : est né suite au suicide
d'un voisin. Il s'agit de mettre en place un système où des voisins pourront transformer un instant de tristesse, de découragement ou de solitude en rencontre surprenante.  Via des boîtes aux lettres jaunes
installées à travers le quartier, on vous offrira un instant de bonheur : la
possibilité de cuisiner, de jardiner, d'une session de tricot ou autre activité pour rentrer dans
un nouvel univers. Une fois testé et amélioré, ce concept pourrait s'implanter dans plusieurs quartiers de Montréal (ou ailleurs)! Ce projet est en démarrage (repérage, recrutement, prototypage). 
Même avant d'exister concrètement, cette idée a reçu
beaucoup d'attention médiatique. Vous pouvez suivre le projet sur Voisinanges. 





Un dessin à la fenêtre (les fenêtres) : est un conte de Noël qui se racontera au fil des jours dans les rues du Mile End. Chaque jour, du 1er au 24 décembre, à l'aide du calendrier de l'Avent conçu pour l'occasion, vous ouvrirez la fenêtre du calendrier pour connaître l'adresse où suivre le conte. 

Comme une chasse au trésor urbaine, voisins et passants seront invités à lire 24 fenêtres résidentielles transformées en 24 pages d’un conte écrit sur-mesure. Un dessin à la fenêtre retricote à la fois l’espace urbain et le maillage entre les voisins. La rue devient vivante, métamorphosée et chargée de magie en attendant Noël. Ce projet sera réalisé du
1er décembre au 5 janvier. [Réservez la contrepartie «Calendrier de l'Avent» qui rajoutera plein de magie à cette expérience ambulante!]





La bénédiction des vélos : est
né des derniers événements tragiques impliquant des cyclistes et inspiré d'une tradition que j'ai vu en Bolivie. C'est un rituel
annuel que je désire instaurer dès qu'on ressort enfin nos vélos afin de protéger
les cyclistes le temps d'une saison complète. Je vous garde la surprise mais tous les Montréalais y seront conviés!  Ce
rituel aura lieu le 30 mai devant l'église Saint-Jean-Baptiste. [Réservez l' «Atelier déco vélo» offert en contrepartie pour rendre cet événement encore plus festif!]


Le cortège : est
inspiré du fait que le Mile End compte la plus grande concentration d'artistes
en Amérique du Nord. Il permettra aux artistes de se
retrouver dans la rue avec leur oeuvre lors d'une déambulation festive pour qu'on puisse enfin voir
qui sont ces créateurs dont on parle tant. Des peintures seront portées, dessins et gravures seront dévoilés, des sculptures seront tirées sur roulettes, des masques seront portés et des performances seront itinérantes... Le tout culminera par
un happening champêtre «là où tout est possible». Ce projet sera réalisé à
la fin juin.





Le premier repas : est inspiré d'un épisode télévisuel de Master Chef Australie qui m'a été raconté. J'ai immédiatement eu envie de créer une expérience similaire, mais dans la vie, au coeur de la ville. Il s'agit d'un repas en plein air concocté et cuisiné en pleine rue à partir des aliments amassés chez les résidents, orchestré par un grand chef et tout un voisinage. Un projet collectif qui rassemblera tout un quartier. Le nom de chaque famille qui invitera le chef et son équipe à fouiller dans son frigo ira dans un chapeau. 100 noms seront pigés, ils seront les 100 convives!  Ce projet sera réalisé à la fin août.





LA FÉE DOIT CONTINUER D'EXISTER

Même si mes initiatives sont éphémères, elles
ont une portée durable. De concert avec les voisins, les résidents et les commerçants, chacun de mes projets participe à la vitalité sociale du quartier  Et puis on n'arrête pas de me le dire... on en veut encore!



MÊME LES FÉES NE PEUVENT VIVRE D'AMOUR ET D'EAU FRAÎCHE 


Le financement servira à la réalisation des 6 projets
décrits ci-haut. Je travaille en moyenne 3 mois à temps plein sur chacun de mes projets et je passe à travers la plupart des étapes suivantes :
·  conception /
recherche / prospection 
·  repérage
territorial et humain / rencontres 
·  évaluation de la
faisabilité d’un projet et sa pertinence / demande de soumissions 
·  fabrication de
maquettes / tests 
·  gestion
des inscriptions et informations reçues
·  stratégies de
mise en œuvre et de déploiement dans le contexte spécifique
·  correction de texte / mise en pages / graphisme / impression 
·  matériaux /
fabrication
·  démarches auprès
de partenaires ou de collaborateurs (demande de permission)
·  installation
dans l'espace public
·  stratégies de
diffusion
·  documentation
(photo + vidéo)
·  démontage




Je vous ai concocté une liste de contreparties originales et uniques. Plusieurs sont liées à des projets passés ou futurs. Vous les trouverez dans la colonne de droite. 

Que vous puissiez ou non contribuer financièrement, merci de partager ce projet avec vos voisins, vos amis, votre famille et tout ceux qui aiment la magie dans la ville! Vous pouvez utiliser les outils d'Indiegogo, Facebook, le courriel ou même la boîte aux lettres pour répandre la nouvelle.

HELP MAKE MY NEW PROJECTS HAPPEN!
I need your help to continue spreading my magic in the streets of Montreal. I've designed 6 new projects for the year to come but I need a hand... a bunch of hands actually! I've created a collection of really fabulous perks you can choose from in exchange for a donation.
Since 2009, I've been designing and orchestrating participative art projects in Montreal and in my Mile End neighbourhood. I try to provoke encounters between strangers and neighbours and design devices through which they can reveal a bit of themselves in public space. Since the Little Match Girl On Waverly in 2012, I've orchestrated 8 projects in the Mile End only 1 of which received financial support.





A FAIRY ON THE SIDEWALKS 
For the past 2 years, I have been known as la Fée du Mile End (the Mile End Fairy). My artistic actions become charged with meaning
thanks to the ties created between people during their participation. Connections are triggered by signs that
appear gradually within a chosen neighbourhood (Love in the Mile End). Whether in the form of an object, accessory or signage, and whether printed on acetate, silkscreened onto fabric, stitched or even incorporating sound, my devices can be found taped to a front door, attached to a fence, wrapped
around a tree or printed on the sidewalk (The Mile End Sea) where they reveal a little bit about peoples' stories. All these stories have the power to transform
a place, a street, a neighbourhood (Here A Memory). Neighbours finally meet. Strangers discover each other (Where Love Flows). Relationships are created. A feeling of belonging is strengthened. A community is activated. Art makes an appearance in our day-to-day life and the sidewalks bring
people together (A Written Flower).



MY FAIRY MANIFESTO

I like to get rid of the screen. I believe low-tech is sexy. Where you’re supposed to sell, I choose to gift. Stories, not economics, are at the heart of my projects. I dream up new ways to interact. I prefer printed traces to digital ones. I use Facebook, but also the mailbox. I walk the city differently than I navigate in cyberspace. I belong to a community and design projects aimed at making it a better place. I get people to meet and share their story. I love strangers, in English and in French. The sidewalk is my garden.

Meet strangers along the way! This project will take place from December 1st to January 5th. [Get the perk ""Calendrier de l'Avent"" to add loads of fun to this magical experience!] 


The Blessing of the Bikes was triggered after several accidents involving cyclists in Montreal at the beginning of the biking season. I was reminded of something very special that I witnessed in Bolivia and was inspired to adapt it and redesign it as a new protective ritual for cyclists... just as they take their bikes out again after the long winter. I won't go into too much detail (an element of surprise is fun!) but I can tell you that all bike lovers will be invited to take part in this very special event! This event is planned for May 30th in front of Montreal's Saint-Jean-Baptiste Church . [Reserve the perk ""Bike Deco"" to dress up your bike for the occasion!]

The Parade is inspired by the fact that the Mile End is home to the biggest concentration of artists in North America. It's time that we actually see who these artists are and that we bring them and their work out of the studios! During this carnival-like parade, the artist and their work will be celebrated together. Paintings will be carried, drawings and etchings should be framed, sculptures can be wheeled, masks should be worn and performances performed... all the way to the Champ des Possibles, a field where ""tout est encore possible"". This happening will wind its way through the streets of the Mile End at the end of June.



The Meal was inspired by an episode of MasterChef Australia I heard about. I immediately redesigned this experience for the city. The Meal is conceived and cooked in the middle of the street from ingredients foraged from neighbours' fridges and pantries. A shared, communal and collaborative experience orchestrated by a celebrated chef with and for an entire neighbourhood. Each household that invites the chef and his or her team of neighbours to collect ingredients will be entitled to a seat at the meal. One hundred names will be picked from a pot: they will be the 100 seated guests.  This meal will be shared at the end of August.



WHY THE FAIRY SHOULD CONTINUE TO EXIST
Even though my projects may be short-lived, their effects are long lasting. By encouraging social connections between neighbours, residents and store owners, they foster a close-knit community. And the truth is, people want more!



EVEN FAIRIES CAN'T MAKE IT WITHOUT MONEY! 
Your donations will help in every steps of the creative process for the 6 projects described above. Each time I design a new project, I go through all or most of the following steps over a three month period:
· design / research / exploration 
· scouting for locations / participants + meetings
· evaluating the relevancy and feasibility of a project / price requests 
· building prototypes / tests 
· managing registration forms / information received
· implementation in public space and specific contexts 
· proofreading / editing / layout / graphic design / printing 
· materials / production
· finding partners and collaborators / asking for permission
· installation in public space
· spreading the news / contacting media
· documentation (photo + video)
· dismantling



I have put together a collection of unique perks, many directly inspired by past projects or projects to come. I hope they will tempt you to make a donation! You will find them to the right of this text.
Even if you are unable to contribute financially, I would love for you to share this campaign with your neighbours, friends, family and anyone you know who loves my kind of city magic. You can do so through Indiegogo, Facebook, e-mail or even the mailbox... if you still have one.

Sharpe19 is an amazing person with plenty of time to help people out. Her popularity of her suits has grown over the last year or so to the point that she's started to amass a large band of followers.

Her popularity of her suits has grown over the last year or so to the point that she's started to amass a large band of followers.

Dreamfish Place Nairobi offers collaboration accommodations for change agents and entrepreneurs. On five acres near the Nairobi National Park, close yet outside the bustle of downtown Nairobi, capital of Kenya, we we also offer residencies to visiting technologists, artists and contributors in Dreamfish community.  Financially and physically,  Dreamfish Place supports the Dreamfish Cooperative.

Our Story
From San Francisco to Kenya - Dreamfish is a peer-to-peer global collaboration network distributed in 26 countries and co-owned by hundreds of women and youth entrepreneurs in developing countries and professionals that want to change the world.Many of come from the streets and margins of global society. We are creative, diversely-abled and oriented. Until now, we have operated by the tenacity, generous sweat and faith of volunteers and donors across the world. We have worked for this dream: a world where people can work like humans, together with love and respect. A world where all people can flourish in  livelihoods.  We worked together by web and phone.  In cafes and art studios. We worked late at night, after day jobs. Some of us have never met in person, yet we are close in our love for humanity. 
 
Being human, we longed for physical contact and a place to gather and share. Now, we also urgently need a way to generate sustainable funding for the cooperative to support a full-time staff, so that we can more fully serve our mission. Thus, the idea for Dreamfish Place was born. Dreamfish Place Nairobi is the first of several Dreamfish Places in the world to come. 
 
So, on April 1st,  2011, we arrived with two suitcases and a dream. Weeks later,  more Dreamfishers arrived to help. 
 
We came by long bumpy bus rides on dirt roads from Tanzania. We came by planes from Austria and California. We came from rural villages, urban slums and Silicon Valley.

 We got to work.  Joan Opiyo is telling our story. Joe Bogner, our lead volunteer developer in Ohio, is donating web hosting. Emmanuel Okyere in Ghana is offering sys admin.  Imraan Osman made a brochure and this fun illustration. Steve Martin and Johannes Klose made the videos for this campaign.  Community Leadership Summit West, a community of open source community managers, is sponsoring a year of server costs for our collaboration service, Dreamfish Pad.  
 
Camille Harris and Californian Dreamfishers have put together a load of donated household goods. African Dreamfishers have donated art. Our partners, Collaboration 4 Africa, showed up virtually to offer help.  Reach and Teach is offering distribution for our rural Maasai Dreamfishers and social impact projects benefiting from Dreamfish Place to reach an international market. 
 
In our first weeks in Dreamfish Place, we have made things happen. Rich in spirit, but still scarce in cash flow, we are swimming hard! To make furniture, we innovated, using recycled materials.
 
We reached out to people to share our dream. We hosted guests from six countries in our new guest rooms, hosted four community events, facilitated collaboration among four African social justice projects, and coached local women and youth in internet skills training.
 
Now, to realize the  potential of our dream, we are asking you to join us and help.

<p>Terra’s Temple is a sacred space and a nexus for community committed to honoring and celebrating Mother Earth, in all her forms. You can come to the Temple to rejuvenate, meditate, and heal in mind, body, and spirit. Our regular events aim to help you connect, create, and regenerate through a wide array of resources and support. Our most-attended current offering, Day of Renewal, is an open invitation to the community to visit Terra’s Temple and receive healing sessions from a diverse group of volunteer practitioners. Other offerings include a women’s Red Tent circle, lectures, drama, music, and various classes.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Terra's Temple:</h2>
<p>There was once a time when there were countless sacred places on our planet that were dedicated to the reverent aspects of Mother Nature.  Historically there were temples that offered opportunities for connecting with the various mysteries of the Earth and greater cosmos, but most have been subsumed into other structures, such as churches devoted to more institutional religions. In our modern world there are currently few sacred spaces explicitly dedicated to Mother Earth, either in the Bay Area or elsewhere.</p>
<p>We are living in a time in which global warming, mass extinction, deforestation, overpopulation, lack of clean water, hunger, poverty, war, and many other planetary wounds have peaked beyond crisis. Although here in the Bay Area, we have a plethora of citizens committed to making a positive difference in the global issues facing us, in this urban environment people are often overworked, overcommitted, and feel an absence of belonging and interconnection.</p>
<p>Terra’s Temple has created a beautiful and sacred space where people can come to rest, heal, and connect with themselves, their community and the planet. In this place they can receive blessings, participate in rites of passage ceremonies, pray/meditate, and expand their sense of self to include the larger web of life they are an integral part of. Festivals and various annual events have been creating temporary sacred spaces for years, but few permanent sacred spaces have been maintained in the urban area. It takes time, commitment, resolve to follow through, and attention not only to spirit but also to the mundane details—all of which we have successfully accomplished over the last five years.</p>
<h2>Growing Into Our Next Phase:</h2>
<p>Terra’s Temple has essentially reached the limitations of our current location to serve the community. In order to expand our capacity for Day of Renewal, host larger gatherings for popular inspirational speakers, be more accessible to the public, and simply craft a more devotional atmosphere, the Temple must spread its branches and grow. The Temple has thrived in its current incarnation for five years, but sustainable service has been our priority, not profit, so we’re reaching out and asking the community for help to achieve the next phase of our vision.</p>
<h2>We Found a Potential New Space!</h2>

<p>We have already identified an available property in Berkeley, California that would be a perfect new home for Terra’s Temple. As you enter the space, which was once the Little Chapel of the Flowers, you breathe into high vaulted ceilings and are struck by light streaming through a stained-glass image of two trees intertwined in mutual support. The architecture is humbly elegant, simultaneously intimate and reverent, a rare find indeed. An additional wing of the building provides multiple rooms for healing offerings, and there is even more connected space that the Temple could potentially blossom into in the future. The space is beautiful and spacious with the added bonuses of being more accessible, closer to public transportation (Ashby BART) and improved parking for cars and bikes.</p>
<p>After spending the past several months scouring for potential real estate, we now have a very tangible goal, and not only the passionate conviction in our mission, but a destination address, concrete numbers to work with, and a deeply considered business plan to back it up. Terra’s Temple is already making progress towards incorporation and receiving official 501(c)(3) non-profit status, but we need additional funding to complete and file the paperwork. We have identified the need for three paid positions in order to move forward with sustainability and success. Expanding capacity and services will require hiring a part-time administrator, a part-time events co-coordinator and a part-time trainer and manager. Moving into the new space will require down payment of first and last month’s rent and a security deposit. And because we are committed to shepherding the Temple through this growth process with pragmatism, we’re seeking funds to not only make this initial move, but also to give us a reasonable buffer for a couple of months as we build momentum, spread the word about our expanded capabilities, fill the calendar with additional events, and increase membership.</p>
<h2>What We Need:</h2>
<p><span>We need $39,660 to launch this next phase of our growth. Unfortunately we will also need an additional $3000 to cover the overhead percentage of using this fundraising website. $2700 of funds raised will cover our incorporation and non-profit preparation and filing. $20,600 will cover the security deposit and 3 months of initial rent for the new space. $1,000 will cover moving expenses, and $15,360 will cover the first few months of managerial and administration salaries until our programs become self-sustaining.</span></p>
<p>If by chance we don't reach our full goal, whatever money is raised will be prioritized towards the following:</p>
<p>Initial $2700 raised -&gt; Non-profit designation<br/>Next $5000 raised -&gt; Admin position<br/>Additional $ -&gt; Suspense account towards new space</p>
<h2>Help us take the leap!</h2>
<p>There are times in life when you’ve been preparing, planting seeds, watching the skies, and waiting until that right moment for what seems like forever. And then out of the blue, the opportunity you’ve hoped for presents itself, your dreams suddenly become real, you’re forced to confront your fears of change, and you either take that leap of faith, or you step back and wait another cycle. We’ve waited long enough, and we’re ready. This is Terra’s Temple’s leap, and with your help, we can land in this magical new sacred space and welcome even more of the community to share in healing, connection, and collaboratively creating all that your Temple can become. </p>
</div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>If you can’t contribute directly, there are still ways you can help!</p>
<p>Spread the word!!! We need this to go as far as it can! You can use the sharing tools, Facebook, and other social media!</p>
<p>Also, we can always use toilet paper--Just saying. Plus volunteer help, there is so much to do to make a Temple function. If you have skills, we'll put them to use!<br/>Please get in touch at (510) 601-6198 or info@terrastemple.com.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For those of you who don't know us, our names our Sam and Megan.  I am 33 years old and Sam is 46 and we have been married for 4 years.  We have been trying to have a baby for 3 years and last year we started fertility treatments.  We went through all of the testing and did 3 rounds of IUI's (which is a basic fertility treatment) with no success.  Our doctor informed us that IVF was the next step and he felt our chances were very good.  The cost of IVF is $22,000.  We were disappointed because this was something we knew we would not be able to afford.  We started researching our options and found a private grant that we applied for.  We made it to the top 10 out of 400 applications but they could only give away 5.  Again, we picked ourselves back up and started looking into adoption or foster care.  Then on Valentine's Day 2012 through a series of coincidences and fate, we received a call from the fertility clinic that we have been given a $12,000 grant and have two years to use it!  We have regained our hope and we just need a little bit of help to get the rest of the way.  We have listed our goal as $10,000 but any money that is contributed will go to the cost of the IVF which we are hoping to do towards the end of the year.  Asking for help is not something we are used to doing, we work hard but we are so close to this dream that we feel if there were ever a time to reach out, it's now.  We are very excited about becoming parents, we hope that if you can't contribute that you will help us spread the word.  We appreciate it and well so does the cat...</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>Hi! My name is Asya, I am 15 years old and am the owner and designer of <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/stinkyfeetgurlz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Stinky Feet Gurlz</a>.  I started <strong>She Is Worth It!</strong>, a foundation that brings awareness and action to Child Sex Trafficking AS WELL AS funding (paying for) unprocessed, backlogged rape kits, to help make a difference in all of our towns. I have been trying to partner with a few organizations to gain my 501(c)(3) status but after a few difficulties with potential board members, I decided to try and raise the money on my own.  That's where crowd funding comes in.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many children (as young as 9) are forced to perform sexual acts up to 25-30 times a day. The United States is a major hub for these children and we are seriously lacking in EDUCATION .  We plan to start here, in the United States <em>first</em>, visiting schools and educating our youth before working our way into other countries.</div>
<p>Right now, across America, there are approximately 400,000-500,000 <strong>untested</strong> rape kits sitting in police evidence storage facilities and crime labs.</p>
<p>I'm ready to change those numbers.  Will you help me?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So...where will your money go? Excellent question! We are totally transparent:</p>
<ol>
<li>First and foremost, we need our 501(c)(3) status.  That alone will cost us about $2,000. </li>
<li>We need a better website and online presence.  Right now we are using a free site, built by ourselves, and unfortunately, it shows. That should cost $500 or more.</li>
<li>And if, God willing, there have been very generous donors and we have money remaining, we will use that to fund our first rape kits which cost between $1,000-1,200 each.</li>
<li>And from there, we will work our way into every county and state until every official recognizes that children are <strong>NOT</strong> prostitutes, they are victims who need rehabilitation, hope and love. I need funds to help me travel to schools all across America to educate our youth on the dangers of these predators and WHO they are targeting.  Our youth MUST become aware in order to protect themselves!</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>$6,200 is our first goal, but even if we don’t reach our entire goal, we’re going to use every single dollar to its fullest potential to get our registered 501(c)(3) status and the other items that will launch this cause into something national and someday global.</li>

<h2><strong><br/> What Drives Me.<br/></strong></h2>
<p><strong><br/></strong>First, as a father of three young children I have concerns about their privacy and security. Not only in regards to how they access the internet and who they communicate with but also in regards to future privacy issues that could arise as consequence of how we (their parents) post images today.  </p>
<p>On March 11th, 2011 a major earthquake struck off the North West Coast of Japan sending a massive tsunami inland devastating communities and  hundreds of thousands of people and inundating the Fukushima Nuclear Power Facility. My family and I were living in Fukushima City at that time. Fortunately for us we did not live close enough to the coast to incur any damage but we had our own surprise in store as the nuclear plant spewed radioactive fallout right to our front doors. </p>
<p>Months later I visited the tsunami sites where I once took my family for a day at the beach and fresh seafood and saw the extent of things. I realized how easily everything can be taken away, erased. I realized it is not important just to save data and back it up some where, you also need to connect others to it or it will become lost.</p>

 What Drives Me.
First, as a father of three young children I have concerns about their privacy and security. Not only in regards to how they access the internet and who they communicate with but also in regards to future privacy issues that could arise as consequence of how we (their parents) post images today.  
On March 11th, 2011 a major earthquake struck off the North West Coast of Japan sending a massive tsunami inland devastating communities and  hundreds of thousands of people and inundating the Fukushima Nuclear Power Facility. My family and I were living in Fukushima City at that time. Fortunately for us we did not live close enough to the coast to incur any damage but we had our own surprise in store as the nuclear plant spewed radioactive fallout right to our front doors. 
Months later I visited the tsunami sites where I once took my family for a day at the beach and fresh seafood and saw the extent of things. I realized how easily everything can be taken away, erased. I realized it is not important just to save data and back it up some where, you also need to connect others to it or it will become lost.
Second, (like I can actually put these in order) is as a father of three I have always been very weary of posting pictures of my kids on social sites because once online, exposed, those pictures can be collected my anyone and used for any purpose. I feel that as a parent one must take responsibility in protecting their children online just as one would if walking in a crowded shopping center. To help parent do this I want to provide ways share pictures just as quickly and conveniently as one would do on a social network while keeping their children’s privacy intact",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

(en Francais en dessous)

Here is our facebook page.
 My wife and I are going back to Belgium at the end of June.
After serving a year and a eight months at Host as manager, I feel it is time for a new step for us.
Our dream is to open my own coffee shop in our hometown Tournai. We would do that, just the two of us and serve exquisite coffee, teas, cakes and pastries.   What We Need & What You Get Even though we have some savings to invest, we would need an extra £10.000  £5000 would go toward equipment: a good espresso machine, 2 grinders, some side equipment.
 The other £5000 would go toward furniture, decoration, building a nice bar.    The Impact After having been trained by World Champion and US Champion Barista and working in different top quality coffee shop in Los Angeles (Taza, Coffee by the boks, Rose City Coffee), Antwerp (KoffieKlap, Caffenation) and last but not least HOST in London, where I managed to feature in London Best Coffee, on London Best Coffee Map and in London Coffee Guide, I would like to put all that baggage toward opening my own shop and serving the best coffee.
We want to create a space where community and creativity are encouraged, where people want to come to meet others or just to spend some relaxing time. I would like to facilitate new monastic meetings in the space before and after business
    Risks & Challenges Tournai being a smaller city, the main risk would be that it is not successful enough. 
That being said, we would be the first real coffee shop in town (and the best of course) and being from that city, my wife and I are already well connected there.

<div>Hello World!</div>
<div>My name is Elle. I'm an Atlanta based artist and entrepreneur. Originally from Tulsa, OK,  I came to Atlanta to continue my personal transformation and to live my dream of becoming a business owner and vocalist.  Southern hospitality; the history; culture; business climate, music and film industries, and the canopy of trees over the city are aspects of Atlanta that attracted me.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I've been an entrepreneurial creative for most of my adult life. Cultivated in church and refined by Jazz, my voice has taken me to to Asia and Africa where I lived abroad for 8 years--mostly in Ghana and Japan. Fitness, dance and yoga instruction, along with my Reiki practice, have sustained me as well. My ability to <span style=""background-color: initial;"">market my talent and skills successfully, and </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">ultimately serve customers well, has helped me </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">build positive relationships and amass clientele. </span>

</div><div>
<br/><div>Everyday I am growing in awareness, maturity and self love as a woman awakening to her divine purpose. Now is the time to fully embrace my spiritual, artistic and entrepreneurial journey as I take on the challenge of running a consignment boutique and recording the album that I have always wanted to. The call to look within, empower women and girls, and encourage practices that sustain and protect the natural Earth has inspired me to intentionally pursue my passion and creatively become the change agent who I know I am. </div>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The seeds of intention for Psycho Sisters Outlet Boutique have been planted.  I affirm endless profitable transactions and positive interactions with the community I serve and aim to help women express themselves through fashion.</span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I have already started operating the store and making online sales as well. This fundraising campaign is to help me buy the store and reimagine it. </div>

</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The store had a soft launch 45 days ago. Being in Little 5 Points, I have seen increased foot traffic as summer approaches, leading the clothes to practically sell themselves from the time I open the doors to close. Without marketing or the shop receiving the proper care and attention that it deserved  prior to me taking over, the store has broke even and then some. The former owner and Psycho Sisters partner has experienced a sudden life change and now needs to sell it before leaving the country at the end of the month. My challenge is to raise $25,000 BEFORE May 26th. Sudden? Possibly so. But I believe that the opportunity would not have presented itself this week if I unable to seize it. (Side Note: The shop owner and original Psycho Sisters founder interviewed many interested parties to sell the shop to, Other people had money in hand but they chose me based on how our intentions for the shop and our outlook on life align.)</span></div><div>Set up costs the that seller needs to recoup:</div><div><br/></div><div><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">$6500: Initial Set Up costs leading up to and since the soft launch- </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Mannequins, racks, paint, clothes, hangers, shelves, etc.</span><br/>

</li>
</ul></div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">$10,100 buys the store. If, for some reason we fall short of $25,000, paying $10,100 to  buy the shop is top priority. (Keeping in mind that I am already in the shop and operating as the owner--sink or swim I'm all in and moving forward with this)</span><br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>The shop is set up and operating but is a blank canvas. The remaining $14,900 will go towards business costs, rent, essential equipment, clothing stock, marketing, and minor cosmetic upgrades that will give the shop personality. </div><div><br/></div><div><ul>

Friends who contribute $50, $75, and $150 or more will receive the opportunity to attend an outdoor yoga class, jazz concert or both, led by me, with raw vegan refreshments included.  </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p>I'm a young woman who left the midwest to travel the world in search of herself. In silence what I found was my voice  and a strengthened connection to the Earth and my higher self. Now I've landed in Atlanta and am poised to make my dreams my reality in the city that embodies THE DREAM. </p>
<p>I'm taking on entrepreneurship and expanding creatively as a woman and as an artist. I want to film the experience this summer as I take over the shop, live in Little 5 Points and explore the city. I plan to share my journey with you online and in person when we meet for yoga, jazz and community building  with the hope that it inspires you to wake up to your divine purpose, find your authentic voice and live into being what makes you come alive. I plan to reach out to organizations that are at the intersection of fashion, faith, the arts, women's health, entrepreneurship and sustainability to build a movement that showcases the City of Atlanta in a positive and attractive way while inspiring personal and communal transformation </p>
<p>As I film the progression of the store I will also include beauty and health tips; yoga instruction; motivational speaking and healthy food choices. </p>
<p>I'm excited this project will require me to use all of the tools that I have acquired in my life experience.  I'm forced to be present, grateful, authentic, vulnerable, focused, organized and living in the now. Life is a bunch of fleeting moments and I want to catch the feeling of everyone of them. I want the shop and the lifestyle I promote to be inspirational and supportive of women. The store is likely the most affordable, trendy clothing store in Little 5 Points. I will definitely reach out to women's shelters and girls programs to seek out ways we can work together.</p>
<p>I will also be adding natural products like vegan lip balm to the store and promoting conservation in the Little 5 Points retail district by giving shoppers who bring their own reusable bag to use while they shop a discount.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Psycho Sisters has been around for 25 years and is a staple in Atlanta fashion. The founder of Psycho Sisters and the former owner of the outlet store that I am taking over have been very supportive of this transition. We have a great space in Little 5 Points. We're heading into the busy summer season when tourist and locals alike are out and about in Atlanta. We have a steady supply of unique, fashionable and affordable clothes. With the flagship store already established, I have 25 years of resources and mentorship available to me. Yes, as an entrepreneur there will seen and unforeseen challenges that arise but I am thankful and appreciative that I have so much support around me and all parties involved want this to be a success. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I need your help to raise the capital quickly.  When we do I will move forward in updating the business' licenses and taxes, implementing technology for proper accounting and  inventory systems, and making some cosmetic upgrades. Beyond that it's all marketing and serving customers excellence daily.</span></p>
<p>In 2 weeks we need $25,000. I'm excited and blessed to be in this situation. </p>
<p>I liken it to new home construction--the house has been built and now I get to customize it with the colors, flooring, faucets, doors etc that I want.</p>
<p>I quit my job. I moved to the Inman Park/Little 5 Points neighborhood and the store came to me. I attracted it now I must have the faith to embrace it fully.  I've taken the risk, now I'm rising to the challenge. Are you with me!?  </p>

</div></div>","ABOUT ME : ELLE
Hello World!
My name is Elle. I'm an Atlanta based artist and entrepreneur. Originally from Tulsa, OK,  I came to Atlanta to continue my personal transformation and to live my dream of becoming a business owner and vocalist.  Southern hospitality; the history; culture; business climate, music and film industries, and the canopy of trees over the city are aspects of Atlanta that attracted me.

I've been an entrepreneurial creative for most of my adult life. Cultivated in church and refined by Jazz, my voice has taken me to to Asia and Africa where I lived abroad for 8 years--mostly in Ghana and Japan. Fitness, dance and yoga instruction, along with my Reiki practice, have sustained me as well. My ability to market my talent and skills successfully, and ultimately serve customers well, has helped me build positive relationships and amass clientele. 


Listen to the Music @ https://soundcloud.com/evolution-liberated

Everyday I am growing in awareness, maturity and self love as a woman awakening to her divine purpose. Now is the time to fully embrace my spiritual, artistic and entrepreneurial journey as I take on the challenge of running a consignment boutique and recording the album that I have always wanted to. The call to look within, empower women and girls, and encourage practices that sustain and protect the natural Earth has inspired me to intentionally pursue my passion and creatively become the change agent who I know I am. 

The seeds of intention for Psycho Sisters Outlet Boutique have been planted.  I affirm endless profitable transactions and positive interactions with the community I serve and aim to help women express themselves through fashion.

I have already started operating the store and making online sales as well. This fundraising campaign is to help me buy the store and reimagine it. 
What I Need & What You Get

Context, Funding Needed & Where It's Going:
The store had a soft launch 45 days ago. Being in Little 5 Points, I have seen increased foot traffic as summer approaches, leading the clothes to practically sell themselves from the time I open the doors to close. Without marketing or the shop receiving the proper care and attention that it deserved  prior to me taking over, the store has broke even and then some. The former owner and Psycho Sisters partner has experienced a sudden life change and now needs to sell it before leaving the country at the end of the month. My challenge is to raise $25,000 BEFORE May 26th. Sudden? Possibly so. But I believe that the opportunity would not have presented itself this week if I unable to seize it. (Side Note: The shop owner and original Psycho Sisters founder interviewed many interested parties to sell the shop to, Other people had money in hand but they chose me based on how our intentions for the shop and our outlook on life align.)Set up costs the that seller needs to recoup:

$6500: Initial Set Up costs leading up to and since the soft launch- Mannequins, racks, paint, clothes, hangers, shelves, etc.


$3600: Deposit and 1 Month Rent @ $1800.00 per


$10,100 buys the store. If, for some reason we fall short of $25,000, paying $10,100 to  buy the shop is top priority. (Keeping in mind that I am already in the shop and operating as the owner--sink or swim I'm all in and moving forward with this)
The shop is set up and operating but is a blank canvas. The remaining $14,900 will go towards business costs, rent, essential equipment, clothing stock, marketing, and minor cosmetic upgrades that will give the shop personality. 

Business Costs: Business License; Insurance; Registration with the Sec. of State for tax purposes: $1000.00 


Rent: $1800.00 to put me ahead my 1st month


Essential Equipment: $3400.00: iPad point of sale system; iMac for bookkeeping and online store; Camera and Alarm Installation; safe; DSLR camera, tea kettle


Clothing: The store gets new clothes every week on consignment. I need to spend $2500.00 on buying clothes from the public and opening accounts with new wholesalers so I can get 100% of the profits from a section of clothes in the shop to combine with the 60% I get from the consignment shipment every week.


Marketing: $1500.00: Website; Facebook and online ads; SEO; premium online seller accounts; flyers; promotion; branding


Cosmetic Upgrades: $4700.00: Flooring; signage; curtains; storage containers; decor. 

To show my appreciation for your contribution I will share my gifts with you throughout the summer. Friends who contribute $50, $75, and $150 or more will receive the opportunity to attend an outdoor yoga class, jazz concert or both, led by me, with raw vegan refreshments included.    
The Impact 
I'm a young woman who left the midwest to travel the world in search of herself. In silence what I found was my voice  and a strengthened connection to the Earth and my higher self. Now I've landed in Atlanta and am poised to make my dreams my reality in the city that embodies THE DREAM. 
I'm taking on entrepreneurship and expanding creatively as a woman and as an artist. I want to film the experience this summer as I take over the shop, live in Little 5 Points and explore the city. I plan to share my journey with you online and in person when we meet for yoga, jazz and community building  with the hope that it inspires you to wake up to your divine purpose, find your authentic voice and live into being what makes you come alive. I plan to reach out to organizations that are at the intersection of fashion, faith, the arts, women's health, entrepreneurship and sustainability to build a movement that showcases the City of Atlanta in a positive and attractive way while inspiring personal and communal transformation 
As I film the progression of the store I will also include beauty and health tips; yoga instruction; motivational speaking and healthy food choices. 
I'm excited this project will require me to use all of the tools that I have acquired in my life experience.  I'm forced to be present, grateful, authentic, vulnerable, focused, organized and living in the now. Life is a bunch of fleeting moments and I want to catch the feeling of everyone of them. I want the shop and the lifestyle I promote to be inspirational and supportive of women. The store is likely the most affordable, trendy clothing store in Little 5 Points. I will definitely reach out to women's shelters and girls programs to seek out ways we can work together.
I will also be adding natural products like vegan lip balm to the store and promoting conservation in the Little 5 Points retail district by giving shoppers who bring their own reusable bag to use while they shop a discount.
    
Risks & Challenges

Psycho Sisters has been around for 25 years and is a staple in Atlanta fashion. The founder of Psycho Sisters and the former owner of the outlet store that I am taking over have been very supportive of this transition. We have a great space in Little 5 Points. We're heading into the busy summer season when tourist and locals alike are out and about in Atlanta. We have a steady supply of unique, fashionable and affordable clothes. With the flagship store already established, I have 25 years of resources and mentorship available to me. Yes, as an entrepreneur there will seen and unforeseen challenges that arise but I am thankful and appreciative that I have so much support around me and all parties involved want this to be a success. 
I need your help to raise the capital quickly.  When we do I will move forward in updating the business' licenses and taxes, implementing technology for proper accounting and  inventory systems, and making some cosmetic upgrades. Beyond that it's all marketing and serving customers excellence daily.
In 2 weeks we need $25,000. I'm excited and blessed to be in this situation. 
I liken it to new home construction--the house has been built and now I get to customize it with the colors, flooring, faucets, doors etc that I want.
I quit my job. I moved to the Inman Park/Little 5 Points neighborhood and the store came to me. I attracted it now I must have the faith to embrace it fully.  I've taken the risk, now I'm rising to the challenge. Are you with me!?

</h3><h3></h3><p></p><p>Last summer, my partners and I started <a href=""www.youthleadershipcollective.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Youth Leadership Collective</a> with the motivation of engendering students with leadership based on their personal and community development. There are a host of successful leadership programs tailored to give students public speaking skills, event management experience, and business acumen, but while students are told they can make a change and given skills they can use, they need an impassioned why and how.</p><p>In addition to discovering effective methods of delivering these intangible qualities and lessons to youth, Youth Leadership Collective is committed to reforming the way students view extracurricular activities in their high school careers. Entrepreneurship, although a powerful tool for change, has also disillusioned students from their high school clubs and cultures and has brought attention to ""robotic volunteerism."" Other organizations fill in this void with dances and parties, but we don't want to give up on the regular old service club. We want to rejuvenate and revolutionize student leadership and bring back wholesome leadership development, bonding, and focused community change to schools.</p><p>We want to build a culture of leadership based on humanity: interaction with and caring for others and the recognition and creation of strong self-identity, in schools, outside schools, and beyond. One of the ways we will do this is through our high school student-run (as all our programs will be) youth leadership summer camp, Generation 2014.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3>

 THE YOUTH LEADERSHIP COLLECTIVE STORY
Last summer, my partners and I started Youth Leadership Collective with the motivation of engendering students with leadership based on their personal and community development. There are a host of successful leadership programs tailored to give students public speaking skills, event management experience, and business acumen, but while students are told they can make a change and given skills they can use, they need an impassioned why and how.In addition to discovering effective methods of delivering these intangible qualities and lessons to youth, Youth Leadership Collective is committed to reforming the way students view extracurricular activities in their high school careers. Entrepreneurship, although a powerful tool for change, has also disillusioned students from their high school clubs and cultures and has brought attention to ""robotic volunteerism."" Other organizations fill in this void with dances and parties, but we don't want to give up on the regular old service club. We want to rejuvenate and revolutionize student leadership and bring back wholesome leadership development, bonding, and focused community change to schools.We want to build a culture of leadership based on humanity: interaction with and caring for others and the recognition and creation of strong self-identity, in schools, outside schools, and beyond. One of the ways we will do this is through our high school student-run (as all our programs will be) youth leadership summer camp, Generation 2014.
 WHAT´S DIFFERENT ABOUT GENERATION 2014?

Full-fledged Passion - The way we see each year that we will create the camp is to ""Give delegates (campers) an experience just as good, or even better than you had."" Our training entails a ton of personal investment, and this empowers our camp team to serve a greater and unified purpose.

Flexible and Multi-faceted Curriculum - With extensive leadership camp and conference experience, our team will not only develop a comprehensive camp curriculum, but also be open to whatever best practices should be used through effective feedback systems and collaboration with other youth leadership organizations such as YLA and CASC.

Greater Personal Development through Community - A number of the camp activities and traditions within Generation 2014 entail a significant amount of imbuing unity and bonding between various camp groups. We take a very serious approach to group dynamics and relationships and how these will expedite leadership development.

Sustained Impact - I was thoroughly impressed our camp counselor interviewees who stated that they wanted to keep in constant contact with the delegates. They want to see lives they changed continue to put the motivations and convictions gained from camp to use.

Extended Empowerment through Accessibility - A huge problem with youth leadership programs is the attrition caused by inaccessibility to leadership opportunities. Selective interview processes for teams following leadership programs create false hierarchies that say ""We just taught you how to be a leader, but you're still not good enough."" While YLC cannot create an optimal executive leadership team of 100 students, we CAN and WILL provide challenging and crucial leadership opportunities through an unrestricted catalog of mentorship programs, event committees, SASSI, and sustained dialogues inside and outside schools.

 THE COSTS
We've set the registration fee to attend this 5-day, 4-night camp at $350. This only covers lodging, food, and transportation. Other leadership camps can run for only 3 or 4 days and cost from $400-$600, but we wanted to make this opportunity as affordable for everyone, whether they demonstrate financial need or not.With a total of 100 participants, we're expecting delegates to request approximately $5000 in financial aid based off of past leadership camp experiences, and we want to meet this need 100%.Our team of 22 high school peer counselors is already committed to raising a total of $7000 to create a fund for the high ropes courses activities that aren't covered by the registration fee, staff backpacks, camp t-shirts and lanyards, special equipment and gift costs, and a portion of the financial aid. This leaves about $3000 in scholarship funds to be raised, and my partners and I are already financially supporting this camp through venues for preparation days, supplies, transportation, food for camp counselors, and covering the cost for insurance and organizational fees.The $2000 goal is not all we intend to fundraise, but this is our online fundraising goal. If you can support through services or in-kind donations that would also help tremendouslyOf course, to pursue a sustainable business model we will be furiously seeking out grants from corporations and foundations come May and I am currently meeting with nonprofit professionals such as the CEO of OneOC and the youth advisor for Youth Leadership America, but until then we are waiting on the IRS to approve our 501(c)3 application submitted in November and need to guarantee that we will meet this need.
 HOW CAN I BE A PART OF THIS MOVEMENT?
All supporters are sending a message to the camp counselors, delegates, and YLC members by telling them ""we believe in your leadership development and want to see you accomplish your goals."" One of the greatest things I've learned is effective framing of simple messages like that can go very, very far.
All supporters who give $25 or more will have the opportunity to BE A PART OF GENERATION 2014 even though they won't physically be present. I will message you with details regarding each perk and the specific impact you will make, since we want to keep as much of the camp activities a surprise as possible.
