The Impact
 In this impersonal digital age, Phonographic Memory brings people together to talk, listen and share a piece of ourselves over vinyl records. Once a month at the Bernal Heights Library we bring people of different ages and backgrounds together who would otherwise have no contact. What we've created in San Francisco can be mirrored anywhere in the world, and through a combination of live events and digital components like the podcast and videos, we believe we can create a global community through a shared love of music. 

   Risks & Challenges We see no risks and a mountain of attainable challenges; we just need the resources. The people and stories are there, we just need to get to them.    Other Ways You Can Help Spread the word! Let the music lover in your life know about us; the vinyl aficionado, the storytelling seeking individuals who thirst to hear humans be human, and those looking to explore the things that bond instead of isolate us.

<p>Note: A little bird told me that the ""Back It"" button is separate from the perks associated with this campaign, so make sure to click on the specific perk level if you want them so I know who to give them to! Thanks!</p>
<h3>Happy New Year!</h3>
<p>I am extremely excited to finally be releasing this project. I've been dreaming of this my whole life, especially over the last year as I discovered a sound (and a producer that allowed me to pursue that sound) that felt genuine and exciting and conducive to who I am and who I want to be as an artist. And now I finally feel ready to pursue it with every ounce of energy in my body.</p>
<p>But of course, as a college student, doing a project like this the right way is extremely expensive. I'm looking to raise between $600-800, with any extra funds going to fun extra things like maybe merch? bonus tracks? VINYL? Wow. The rest will go towards paying Andrew Novoa for the countless hours he puts in to arranging and mixing and mastering, as well as paying any other featured musicians on the tracks, and creating professional physical copies and securing copyrights for each of the songs. It's a lot to take on, but I know the end result will be worth it all and I can't wait to share it with all of you.</p>
<p>I would be beyond grateful for any and all donations that you can give. I know there are so many of my friends and family that have supported me and my music for a long time, and I have never taken that support for granted. I want to create art that is meaningful and professional and that reaches as many people as possible, and of course that is never a one-man journey.</p>
<p>In addition, if you cannot donate (or if you yourself are a struggling musician/artist, in which case I do not want nor expect your donation), sharing this campaign is EQUALLY as beneficial to me getting the word out about this project. </p>
<p>The EP will have 6 tracks total. Expected release will be April 2017. EP will be released on all music selling platforms. Live performances and other fun things to come with it! AAAHHH!! :DDD</p>
<p>Thank you thank you thank you (to anyone who read this far)! Here's to an amazing year ahead! </p>

We feel that it fully captures the essence of our band and the passion we feel for the music we make. We've come to the point in our careers where the creation of a full length album is the only thing we feel will project us to the next level of this endeavor.

Because of that, we could really use your help, and anything that you could contribute would not go unnoticed or unappreciated! We'll be setting up perks based upon different tiers of contributions.

The band consists of Casey Creveling on guitar/vocals, A.j. ""Charles"" Foulke on bass, and Austin Albright on drums. We have been playing together for over a year, and have become very passionate about the band and our music. Unfortunately, the odds seem to be stacked against us. It's hard to become established in the music scene, especially if you don't have anything to market yourself with. Also, we're all college students, which means our windows of opportunity are closing. If we don't make serious headway in the next few years, it will become harder and riskier to keep doing what we love with the same level of passion and devotion. That's where all of you lovely people come in.</span></p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our Goal</span></h3><p>The aim of our campaign is to raise enough money to record a 3-song EP.

The band consists of Casey Creveling on guitar/vocals, A.j. ""Charles"" Foulke on bass, and Austin Albright on drums. We have been playing together for over a year, and have become very passionate about the band and our music. Unfortunately, the odds seem to be stacked against us. It's hard to become established in the music scene, especially if you don't have anything to market yourself with. Also, we're all college students, which means our windows of opportunity are closing. If we don't make serious headway in the next few years, it will become harder and riskier to keep doing what we love with the same level of passion and devotion. That's where all of you lovely people come in.   Our GoalThe aim of our campaign is to raise enough money to record a 3-song EP. The recordings will primarily be used for marketing purposes. They will showcase our sound for venues and promoters in the hopes of landing us more gigs. We can also use them to start building a fan base. When visitors check us out online, they can hear something other than old basement demos. We're looking to raise $500 which will be enough to cover:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Help me (award winning singer songwriter Kiya Heartwood) record ""The Living Tree,"" an all acoustic solo CD, and help me build a community website for you, my listeners.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need your help to record ""The Living Tree,"" an all acoustic solo CD.  I also have a vision of us building a community website  called "" The Caravan"" where you can access all my music, from rough demos of new songs to the orchestrated music, choir pieces and earth-centered worship services I've written and co-written. Other resources will be available to members including chord charts, lyrics, resources for writers, my blog, poetry and group surveys where Caravan members can participate, if they like,  in the development of future projects such as CD's, and DVD's.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You and I both know that music is music, but I've run into lots of folks who make divisions where there don't necessarily have to be any.  Some fans of rock and pop music who like what I've written for my bands, Radio Cafe or Stealin Horses, don't necessarily embrace the folkier, political or acoustic aspects of my solo CD's or the songs of my duo Wishing Chair. The choir and more classical pieces I've written since studying composition confuse some even more. I like that I am a wide writer and yet I struggle to define (in terms the music business would understand) what kind of songwriter I really am and to describe my music so it can get to the people who need and want it.  By offering you all of my music and by creating the Caravan  I will integrate my spiritual understanding of art and craft with the nuts and bolts of making a living.</p>
<p>The Caravan is a member based website offering the committed listener full access to all my music as well as additional features and resources to build a virtual community. I want to know who I'm writing for and create a way for us to get to know each other. My writing is practical; I want to be of use to you in your life. What do you struggle to express? What change do you work for, and how might this music become a part of that?</p>
<p>Many supporters say they love hearing me perform at house concerts and songwriter festivals with just my guitar. They are always asking if I have a CD that sounds like that. I've always had to say no until now. It's time to begin this next chapter of my music with a stripped down collection of new and old songs. </p>
<p> I am working on two rock projects later this year. One is a special project with my former bandmates in Stealin Horses and the other is a band called Pie Tramps with former 4 Non Blondes bassist Christa Hillhouse and Australian drummer Clinno Bugger here in Austin. These projects are exciting and rowdy and fulfilling on the rock and roll end of things. This all acoustic singer songwriter project will be exciting in a completely different soul fulfilling way. I hope you will join me in this adventure!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can help by posting links to this campaign and spreading the word with the Indiegogo support tools.You can send me suggestions for old songs you'd like rerecorded on the solo project or any thoughts about performance venues or elements that could be added to the Caravan website.  My old guitar has cracked, and its sound is gone. I know there is another guitar coming to me, but I'm not sure what its path will be. You could keep your fingers crossed for me and my next guitar to find one another. I will tell you all about it on ""The Caravan"".  Thank you for your continued support!</p>

Opera singers are quite similar to non-profit arts organizations where earned income is only a portion of the total yearly operating budget.  I myself, have been a cater waiter, actor at birthday parties, freelance writer and paid studio audience member in order to fund my operatic career.  With the cost of each audition ranging from $35 to $50 dollars, voice lessons being approximately $150 and coachings costing about $75 a pop, many aspiring opera singers spend more time trying to fund the cost of the career vs. having a career. </p>
<p>The great singers of the past had individual sponsors who would help fund their<br/>careers, but in today’s world, those who support the arts tend to donate to organizations versus individuals.  However with websites like indigogo.com, ""creatives"" have found a way to fund projects ranging from marketing a new recording project to securing funds for a European audition tour.  In 2011 I successfully funded a Kickstarter.com project entitled “Rogues and Scoundrels:<br/>Rethink the Recital” which I performed on April 8, 2011 in Columbus, Ohio to a full house.  “Rogues and Scoundrels"" takes the recital format and mixes in elements of narration, performance art and cabaret.  It is currently in negotiations to be performed in the 2014-2015 season.</p>
<p>I have been fortunate that the last three seasons have been filled with wonderful singing engagements and have allowed me to make the bulk of my living as a singer. During the 2012-13 season I spent $<strong>1,108.67</strong> in audition expenses (fees, accompanists and travel) and am expecting to nearly double that with auditions in New York as well as throughout the United States.

<p>Since I see myself as the CEO of Eric McKeever, Inc., I believe that I must look at my career very much like a business person would look at a corporation.  Many companies have investors who help build capital so that the business can succeed.  My goal is to raise <strong>$2000</strong> to cover a majority of my projected audition and preparation expenses.  <strong>Funds raised will be used directly for audition and audition related expenses</strong>.  I am seeking ""investors"" who believe in my talent and would like to be part of the success of Eric McKeever, baritone.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Being an opera singer takes extraordinary talent, incredible discipline and a great deal of luck. Opera singers are quite similar to non-profit arts organizations where earned income is only a portion of the total yearly operating budget.  I myself, have been a cater waiter, actor at birthday parties, freelance writer and paid studio audience member in order to fund my operatic career.  With the cost of each audition ranging from $35 to $50 dollars, voice lessons being approximately $150 and coachings costing about $75 a pop, many aspiring opera singers spend more time trying to fund the cost of the career vs. having a career. 
The great singers of the past had individual sponsors who would help fund theircareers, but in today’s world, those who support the arts tend to donate to organizations versus individuals.  However with websites like indigogo.com, ""creatives"" have found a way to fund projects ranging from marketing a new recording project to securing funds for a European audition tour.  In 2011 I successfully funded a Kickstarter.com project entitled “Rogues and Scoundrels:Rethink the Recital” which I performed on April 8, 2011 in Columbus, Ohio to a full house.  “Rogues and Scoundrels"" takes the recital format and mixes in elements of narration, performance art and cabaret.  It is currently in negotiations to be performed in the 2014-2015 season.

<p>My name is Chad Brawley. I'm a Christian musician from Houston, Texas that is committed to using the arts to serve all people. </p>
<p>God has used my background, educational experiences and passion for ministry to push me forward into this season of service. As a Director of Worship Arts for many years, I've noticed that congregations participate most (musically) when songs are relevant, pitched with them in mind, have great music and theologically sound lyrics. This project includes all of these elements....intentionally.</p>
<p>The WeWorshipProject is designed to serve the Body of Christ with music that encourages personal/corporate participatory, passionate and purposeful expression of love and worship to God. With this project, it's our goal to get as many people as possible singing and participating in personal and corporate worship..regularly. We'd like for this music to energize the worship culture/atmosphere in churches all across the world. Heartfelt praise and worship brings such LIFE to life. Literally, lives will be changed for the better!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; Why</strong></p>
<p>We are in need of $15,000 to complete the project. The live recording was last winter in Houston, Texas. The event was AMAZING! Talented musicians and vocalists blended their gifts and worshipped God in passionately. Now the post production process is underway. We are recording overdub vocals, adding horn and string arrangements, mixing and etc. All of these procedures are very expensive, as they are quite lengthy and involve studio time and multiple fees. Your help will enable us to complete this huge project WITH EXCELLENCE.</p>
<p>There will be a fresh debut concert in the winter of 2012. You are absolutely invited to join us! (more details to follow) </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>God the father is so in love with us and desires close relationship. Music can be used as an excellent tool of expression to and worship of God. I've seen lives changed over time because of passionate and heartfelt connection with the Father though prayer, scripture and the use of music in the life of the believer. I've seen the Holy Spirit use His Word coupled with music to influence the hearts of non-believers as well. Additionally, we've been charged with the responsibility and opportunity to celebrate with music! </p>

<p>All donations are valuable and important to us. We are very grateful for each of them.

(The movie features a cameo appearance by Steve of Claire on a Dare, so check it out!)(You can find music from our earlier EP below) Meet the IllustratorClaire on a Dare is thrilled to announce our collaboration with the talented Timothy Tang. His beautiful illustrations will bring the story of Deitor and Claire to life in vivid imagery.  His work will be included with the record.

<p class=""p2"">My name is Dave. Hi.  I have been making music since childhood and it has always been a dream of mine to do it for a living somehow.  2013 has been a land mark year for me.  I've lost my job, booked a small tour, sold all of my belongings and will be living out of my Jetta for the next few months while I tour until I can afford to pay rent somewhere and call this music thing I love to do, a career. </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">What I need is help funding the remaining travel expense that I can not already cover myself.  This campaign, when funded, will enable me to perform the gigs I have already booked as well as covering fuel costs, merchandise costs that I will be selling, and any repairs that may come up. Oh and possibly some ramen noodles at times :) </p>
<p class=""p2"">I have been custom making shirts for a few weeks to sell as merch and give as perks for those who contribute.  I've also constructed and painted a custom backdrop to tour with that one lucky contributor will own at the close of the tour.  I'm giving songs, banners, stickers, and a plethora of other awesome rewards to contributors.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Even if I don't reach my goal, the funds are still going to everything I have already mentioned.  Keeping love on the road!  </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">The Impact is unmatched in my opinion. I am taking a huge step with faith that this will be successful for me, that my dream will become my reality. That every movement thus far has lead to this movement and hence justifies such a leap.</p>

<p class=""p2"">-KEEPLOVE</p></div>","Short Summary
My name is Dave. Hi.  I have been making music since childhood and it has always been a dream of mine to do it for a living somehow.  2013 has been a land mark year for me.  I've lost my job, booked a small tour, sold all of my belongings and will be living out of my Jetta for the next few months while I tour until I can afford to pay rent somewhere and call this music thing I love to do, a career. 
What We Need & What You Get
What I need is help funding the remaining travel expense that I can not already cover myself.  This campaign, when funded, will enable me to perform the gigs I have already booked as well as covering fuel costs, merchandise costs that I will be selling, and any repairs that may come up. Oh and possibly some ramen noodles at times :) 
I have been custom making shirts for a few weeks to sell as merch and give as perks for those who contribute.  I've also constructed and painted a custom backdrop to tour with that one lucky contributor will own at the close of the tour.  I'm giving songs, banners, stickers, and a plethora of other awesome rewards to contributors.
Even if I don't reach my goal, the funds are still going to everything I have already mentioned.  Keeping love on the road!  
The Impact
The Impact is unmatched in my opinion. I am taking a huge step with faith that this will be successful for me, that my dream will become my reality. That every movement thus far has lead to this movement and hence justifies such a leap.
If you choose to contribute, I will be blessed and truly forever in debt to you.  No amount of money could reflect the meaning of your support and so can never be repaid. 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you choose not to contribute monetarily, yet still want to support.  Please share this cause/campaign with all of your friends, and around your social networks.  That in itself out values money if you ask me.  I truly thank you for your time in checking out my campaign and I hope to see you all out on the road this summer.

<p>Many of you are familiar with our band and we thank you for your continued support. But for those that aren’t, <strong>Darrow Chemical Company</strong> comes from the ashes of several namesake underground bands. Past member projects include <strong>Mister Monster</strong>,<strong> Gotham Road</strong>, <strong>Michale Graves Band</strong> (Ex Misfits), <strong>Blitzkid</strong> and <strong>The Doomsday Prophecy</strong>. <br/><br/> This band was started in late 2009 and we have prided ourselves on being a hard working DIY band from that moment. Since October 2011 <strong>Darrow Chemical Company</strong> has released 2 studio EP’s and 1 live EP on our own label, <strong>W.H.B. Records</strong>. A split 7” on <strong>No Balls Records</strong> (Germany) and a Second Pressing of our 1<sup>st</sup> Studio EP in cassette format (<strong>W.H.B. Records</strong>). We also embarked on a self booked, financed and promoted national tour, not to mention a pretty impressive line of DIY merchandise. <br/><br/> To this point, we have been able to operate our careers through our own resources and funding. We’re pretty proud about what we’ve been able to accomplish over the last decade. We have established long term relationships and have met great friends all over the globe as a result. <br/><br/> With that said, we think we’re capable of offering the fans so much more in terms of quality of music, promotion, merchandise and volume of touring if we had investors to help us reach the necessary financial platform. <br/><br/><strong>Darrow Chemical Company</strong> is in the pre-production process of their 3<sup>rd</sup> studio EP and planning their 2<sup>nd</sup> US tour to support it. The band needs a reliable tour van. We also look to step up the production value of our recordings, want to provide new merchandise and want to ensure a successful round of tours and EP with adequate promotional materials.</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>This is where you, the fans, and Indiegogo come into play!</strong></p>
<p>We look at this as an opportunity for us to achieve all of our goals and an opportunity for you to invest in a project and group of musicians that you believe in.

<p>- Graphics, artwork and layout for EP<br/><br/> - Digital distribution costs and physical pressing of the EP</p>
<p>- Backdrop and a few other production items to enhance our live performance<br/><br/> - New/additional merchandise and restocking of the old merchandise. (We have some really cool ideas)<br/><br/> - Promotional Items such as tour posters, postcards, flyers, street team incentives/mailers, etc… (This is mandatory and can get pricey!)</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Hi, my name is Espen Solheim, a Norwegian artist that's been keeping himself busy both with music, visual art and writing for quite some time.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>For those of you new to crowdfunding, it should be quite self evident how things work.

The Impact
We believe that the ability of the arts to deepen our experience as human beings relies strongly on our willingness to remain open to, and support the music of our time.  Our ensemble's name, ""Mimesis"" means reflection, and refers to the way in which the arts reflect our experience as intellectual, emotional, and social beings.

<p></p><div>
My name is Rob Sweitzer.  I am a member of and keyboardist for the band known as MAE (Multisensory Aesthetic Experience) (<i>Tooth &amp; Nail Records</i> 2003 - 2007)(<i>Capitol Records</i> 2007-2008).  MGIFOS is my new project.  ""M29"" is my EP of songs scheduled to be recorded and co-produced with Dave Elkins (MAE, Schematic) in Nashville, TN at 4115 Studios in November 2014.
<br/><br/>After having been an active member of MAE in both writing and domestic and international touring, due to personal reasons and intra-band tension, I left MAE in 2008 to focus on home life back in Virginia and to pursue my own path in music. Unfortunately, shortly after my return to Virginia, I began to suffer depression which led to a mountain of unfinished demos and the inability to sustain a healthy home life.<br/><br/>
In 2010, after some critical discussions with MAE leading to amends being made, I returned to contribute to the <i>(e)vening</i> EP, play keys on the ""Goodbye, Goodnight"" Tour as well as the <i>Destination: Beautiful</i> Anniversary shows in our hometown of Virginia Beach, Virginia in February 2013.<p></p>
<p>Although things seemed to be comparatively better for me at that point, it was not long after those shows in 2013 that the ongoing and undiagnosed depression caught up with me and reached an apex resulting in my attempt to find peace beyond this life.  As the philosopher Schöpenhauer once said, and I paraphrase, my fear of death was outweighed by my fear of living (or, really, the exhaustion of trying and my perceived failure to live).  Fortunately, a friend intervened and helped prevent what would have been an irreversible event.</p>
<p>It's taken some time, some heartfelt reflection, and some proactive measures to deal with a very dark time in my life.  I haven't reached nirvana and I don't think I ever will, but I have learned that challenges in life are not obstacles, or at least they don't have to be, but rather are opportunities to grow and become a stronger living being for myself and for others around me.</p>
<p>This EP - ""M29"" contains songs that capture my reflections on life and death, the meaning of existence, the strength of love, the peculiar relationship between light and dark, the universal calling of something tremendously larger than myself to know and be known, to love and be loved, the ongoing internal war between myself and God (or the interpretation of God by others and institutions as established truth), among other things.</p>
<p>It is my sincerest desire to share these songs with you with the hope that the content and the music will let you know that you are not alone in your individual and personal journey to find who you are.  The darkness serves the light in finding your way, one does not exist without the other and they both serve to help in learning the lessons you need to be stronger for yourself and ultimately for those with whom you may cross paths both now and in the future.</p>

<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We are hoping to leverage existing relationships and resources
to bring our product to market with minimal funding. We are in the process of
collecting information regarding future costs including web development,
android development, music acquisition costs, etc. Our initial analysis
projects funding of $250K to fully launch the product. To date, we are 100%
bootstrapped with all development work done in-house and a total of $6k raised
through Duke University competitions. <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crowdtunes/id596984616?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Check out our current prototype available now on the Appstore.</a></p>
<p>The proposed $25,000 raised in this competition will be
allocated in the following ways.</p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>$15,000 for product
development including existing product optimization and Android/HTML5
development.</p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>$10,000 legal analysis
validating our existing music licensing strategy and intellectual property.</p>
<p>In the event we are unable to collect the entire $25,000, have
no fear, your investment will be put to good use. We plan to release an alpha version of our
product in late January with several permanent installations planned at bars
and restaurants near you.  As these
installations occur, we will let you know so you can head out with your friends
to impose your will and music tastes on the entire bar with your preloaded
credits and new CrowdTunes swag.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We really want to impress upon you that this is much more than
just a crazy idea.  We have built a
working prototype and tested this concept several times throughout the fall of
2013 with great success. The atmosphere
was frenetic with patron socialization increasing significantly.  In fact, we had an unsolicited investment
offer from one of the bar owners and inquiries to install CrowdTunes
permanently when fully commercialized by several others.</p>
<p>Let’s be real.  We aren’t out
here to save the planet or cure world hunger. We believe the jukebox is ripe for innovation considering the evolving
technical landscape in all venues we frequent on a daily basis. We are sick of being subject to Taylor Swift
and Miley Cyrus out at the bars with our buddies when in reality we are looking
to enjoy a taste of the 80’s and something like Asia – “Heat of the Moment”. Furthermore, at 1:30 AM as the bar is coming
to a close and you just can’t go home without hearing Will Smith’s “Gettin’
Jiggy Wit It”, have no fear. CrowdTunes
provides the transparent and dynamic marketplace to get your song playing
immediately.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Unable to contribute, but still want to help? Great – we still need you! </p>
<p>Next time you are at your favorite watering hole and college
bar, let the owner or manager know about CrowdTunes. Let them know about the ease of installation,
the improved customer experience, and
the potential to transform music from a cost center to a profit driver. Furthermore, handsome referral bonuses are
awarded for new bar installations!</p></div>","Short Summary

no fear, your investment will be put to good use. We plan to release an alpha version of our
product in late January with several permanent installations planned at bars
and restaurants near you.  As these
installations occur, we will let you know so you can head out with your friends
to impose your will and music tastes on the entire bar with your preloaded
credits and new CrowdTunes swag.
The Impact
We really want to impress upon you that this is much more than
just a crazy idea.  We have built a
working prototype and tested this concept several times throughout the fall of
2013 with great success. The atmosphere
was frenetic with patron socialization increasing significantly.  In fact, we had an unsolicited investment
offer from one of the bar owners and inquiries to install CrowdTunes
permanently when fully commercialized by several others.
Let’s be real.  We aren’t out
here to save the planet or cure world hunger. We believe the jukebox is ripe for innovation considering the evolving
technical landscape in all venues we frequent on a daily basis. We are sick of being subject to Taylor Swift
and Miley Cyrus out at the bars with our buddies when in reality we are looking
to enjoy a taste of the 80’s and something like Asia – “Heat of the Moment”. Furthermore, at 1:30 AM as the bar is coming
to a close and you just can’t go home without hearing Will Smith’s “Gettin’
Jiggy Wit It”, have no fear. CrowdTunes
provides the transparent and dynamic marketplace to get your song playing
immediately.

Other Ways You Can Help
Unable to contribute, but still want to help? Great – we still need you! 
Next time you are at your favorite watering hole and college
bar, let the owner or manager know about CrowdTunes. Let them know about the ease of installation,
the improved customer experience, and
the potential to transform music from a cost center to a profit driver. Furthermore, handsome referral bonuses are
awarded for new bar installations!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Depuis que l'idée est née il y a environ deux ans de cela dans l'appartement de la rue Denault à Sherbrooke, beaucoup de choses se sont produites. Nous avons premièrement créé un ""prototype"" d'atelier qui nous a permis de s'accoutumer avec la gestion d'un atelier. Dans la dernière année et demie, environ 50 personnes différentes ont payé une cotisation mensuelle pour utiliser le petit atelier de la rue Denault. Une quinzaine de formation ont été organisées pendant ce temps, touchant plus de 180 personnes. Le concept mis de l'avant par l'association ""La Petite Fabrique"" fut un grand succès et a permis à l'organisation de se faire connaître à Sherbrooke.</p>

<div>L'année 2014 fut très chargée pour La Fabrique. Étude de marché, plan d'affaire, création de partenariats, structuration à l'interne, recherche de locaux, financement, stratégie de communication... beaucoup de travail a été fait. Un des importants jalons que nous avons franchi l'automne dernier est la fondation de la coopérative. Le 9 septembre dernier, La Fabrique a passé d'association à coopérative de solidarité, faisant ainsi son apparition dans le paysage sherbrookois comme nouvelle entreprise. À l'assemblée d'organisation, 23 personnes étaient présentes afin de cofonder la coopérative.</div>

<div>Tout ce travail, c'est pour converger vers l'idée que nous avions dès le départ : créer un atelier de 10 000 pieds carrés à Sherbrooke. Et cette idée est très proche de se réaliser. Depuis la fondation de la coopérative, plusieurs membres se sont joints à la coopérative. Tous et toutes travaillent afin de faire aboutir le projet le plus rapidement possible.

Le concept mis de l'avant par l'association ""La Petite Fabrique"" fut un grand succès et a permis à l'organisation de se faire connaître à Sherbrooke.


Atelier de fabrication de savon - La Petite Fabrique
L'année 2014, une GROSSE année
L'année 2014 fut très chargée pour La Fabrique. Étude de marché, plan d'affaire, création de partenariats, structuration à l'interne, recherche de locaux, financement, stratégie de communication... beaucoup de travail a été fait. Un des importants jalons que nous avons franchi l'automne dernier est la fondation de la coopérative. Le 9 septembre dernier, La Fabrique a passé d'association à coopérative de solidarité, faisant ainsi son apparition dans le paysage sherbrookois comme nouvelle entreprise. À l'assemblée d'organisation, 23 personnes étaient présentes afin de cofonder la coopérative.

Assemblée générale d'organisation - ArtFocus
Nous avons donc énormément travaillé pour nous rendre où nous sommes aujourd'hui. Notre travail a d'ailleurs été remarqué à plusieurs reprises pendant l'année. Nous nous sommes mérités le deuxième prix au niveau national du Concours québécois en entreprenariat dans la catégorie économie sociale, nous avons remporté le prix de la catégorie Relève, jeunes entrepreneurs lors du Gala découvertes coopératives organisé par le Conseil québécois de la coopération et de la mutalité, le Prix du jury lors du concours Ensemble, on va plus loin organisé également par le CQCM et finalement un prix lors du Change Maker Challenge d'Ashoka Canada.
Tout cela, tout en continuant de faire rouler La Petite Fabrique, où des membres viennent régulièrement réaliser leurs projets!

La Fabrique s’en vient!
Tout ce travail, c'est pour converger vers l'idée que nous avions dès le départ : créer un atelier de 10 000 pieds carrés à Sherbrooke. Et cette idée est très proche de se réaliser. Depuis la fondation de la coopérative, plusieurs membres se sont joints à la coopérative. Tous et toutes travaillent afin de faire aboutir le projet le plus rapidement possible. Nous avons trouvé un local au centre-ville de Sherbrooke qui pourrait accueillir nos installations.
Notre objectif est donc d'ouvrir nos portes à l'hiver 2015, mais pour cela, on a besoin de vous!!!



Présentation aux membres intéressés aux espaces de créations individuels
Pourquoi 7 500$?
Nous sommes bien conscients que La Fabrique ne verra pas le jour seulement avec 7 500$, mais c’est ce dont nous avons besoin en ce moment pour que le projet devienne réalité. Ce montant nous permettra de débloquer le reste de notre financement (prêts et subventions qui nous ont été octroyés), en plus de fournir un capital essentiel à l'achat d'outils et à la réalisation des travaux d'améliorations de nos nouveaux locaux.

<p>       My name is Dariusz (Dar-oosh) or Darek for short if you'd like. I'm a father and freelance, lead, art and programming developer for SoundRunner. I'm a Polish immigrant to the US at the age of 4 and have always had a strong passion for all things tech (like many software developers have!). SoundRunner is a game I've always wanted to see created and is inspired by games like Gunstar Heroes, Megaman, Audiosurf, Metroid, and Cave Story.  </p>
<p>      I started a campaign on KickStarter a while back which didn't meet it's goal but showed me something very important, and that's that, there are people who are interested in my project! So I decide to revamp my campaign and lower my goal so that I could make enough to pay for the Greenlight submission fee and let interested people give the game a shot. </p>
<p>     So the goal is small but any contributions past the goal will be used towards development in the sense that it will open up more time for me to develop as life goals like my son's college fund, and savings for a house will be built up and I won't need to work part-time work as frequently.</p>
<p>   I appreciate all contributions, but I also appreciate comments and people letting me know if the game is interesting, so if you can't contribute but want to give me a hoo-rah then give me a hoorah! </p>

<p>Previously I would have put the money into purchasing a new machine, since the one I currently have is an older machine. But as I thought about it, I no longer thought it was really a development requirement.  So, I've decided to focus all my efforts on getting the Steam Greenlight Submission Fee covered so that I can put the game up on Steam and give people the opportunity to give it a try pre-release. <br/><br/>Money past $100 will go towards living expenses, medical bills with some investment into my current machine to extend it's life.<br/><br/>I would make the goal lower however the minimum is $500.<br/><br/></p>

<p><b>SoundRunner</b> is a video game in which the player plays Botty.  Who is Botty? Botty was part of your system's Viral Defense System but something went horribly wrong and a slew of viruses,malware, worms and horrible nasty stuff broke into the system and destroyed the V.D.S.  With that they completely eviserated Botty's companions and took down the system.<br/> Botty tripped right before the fight and fell straight into the Recycle Bin. This saved him however as one of the Bits who worked the Recycle Bin found him there and fixed him up in the aftermath of the chaos.  With the damage done to Botty his Circuit Platform Generator was destroyed. Klerp, the Recyle Bin Bit that saved Botty, could only find and Audio File Modulatorand hacked it into Botty. This allowed them to save Botty but his ability to move freely was destroyed in the process.<br/>All hope seemed lost until the Viruses reached the system's music files and began dumping them into the Bin. One of the files hit Botty's C.P.G and fused with his circuits, suddenly platforms began to spawn.  However the sound caused them to be differently and act unstable. This coupled with the fact that they would crumble after time led to new worries.<br/>Klerp gathered parts and altered Botty, replacing one of his arms with a File Grabber and replaced his wheels with two bipedal legs to increase his speed. The allowed him to move through the platforms before they crumbled. At the end of the audio file the final platform remained, so Klerp attached a tracking device to Botty to allow them to use his Quick Transfer Manager Cannon to shoot Botty to his last platform and continue his journey towards the viruses plagueing the system. New hope arose for the system, the only question that remains is, is it too late to stop the absolute formatting of the Bit's world?<br/><br/><b>The Gameplay</b></p>

<p><b>[Please Note the Blue Aura in the video is for Debugging the Sound Analyzer]</b></p>
<p>Players will pick a song and hop into the Q.T.M cannon once the song is done being converted (conversion only happens once). They are then launched to an initial platform where they begin their run. As they run enemies, platforms, and obstacles spawn to try and stop the player. Powerups also spawn to help the player.  At the end of the level the player is graded based on their Accuracy, Remaining Health, Speed  and Distance covered. This leads to a Grade and multiplayer for how many Bitcoins they received for their run. <br/>Players can replay songs for additional distance scores, bitcoins or to just get a higher grade on a large difficulty. (Each song allows you to slide a difficulty slider that alters how much a song affect a level, how quickly enemies spawn and the rate of power ups. <br/>Players can use Bitcoins to buy weapons, abilities, upgrades and cosmetic changes.<br/><br/>During the initial song selection phase the player has access to a Town Hub where they can purchase upgrades and change their appearance and equip difference weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>As the player builds up distance they eventually unlock a boss fight. Boss Fights, like platforming segments are also affected by music. One a Boss Fight is complete the player unlocks a new level with different enemies, aesthetics, obstacles and greater bitcoin earnings. </p>

<p><br/>Each Weapon will have 3 different levels. The weapon gains XP while running through the level and killing enemies without taking damage. Taking damage causes the weapon to lose XP. This leads the player to have to be cautious while running with a full-powered weapon, as even though the full-powered weapons are overpowered, taking damage kills the players momentum and causes them to have to rebuild their weapon. </p>
<p>Current weapons designs are below:</p>
<p><b>Standard Issued File Remover (Complete)</b> - Chargeable projectile that does okay to high damage depending on the charge. At full charge it will deflect bullets it passed through.  (The players starts with this weapon)<br/>Level 1: Fire a single bullet, explodes on enemies or platforms<br/>Level 2: Gain a slight homing capability, the bullets curve slightly towards enemies.<br/>Level 3. Increases homing range, the bullets also go through platforms and explode on the first enemy.</p>
<p><b>The Cursor </b>- Fires a cursor at the enemy rapidly by holding down the mouse button.<br/>Level 1 - Cursor takes 3 bullets to kill a small enemy, and the fire rate isn't great.<br/>Level 2 - Cursor takes 2 bullet to kill a small enemy and the fire rate is a little better</p>
<p>Level 3 - Cursor one shots small enemies and fires like a gattling gun. It also allows the player to levitate a bit off the ground if fired downward towards a platform.<br/><br/><b>Mouse Trail <b>(Complete) </b></b>- A trail of Byte plasma follows your recital, any enemy it touches explodes. Constantly hovers around your mouse, you must slice through enemies to cause damage. Does high damage but disintegrates after a while.<br/>Level 1: Fire up to one orb that rotates and disintegrates after it strikes two enemies.<br/>Level 2: Fire up to two orbs that rotates around the cursor and disintegrate over time.</p>
<p>Level 3: Fire up to three orbs that rotate around the cursor and take a while to disintegrate. </p>
<p><b>Cut and Paster</b> - Absorbs an enemy and allows you to shoot it as a projectile, as the enemy is fired it's standard bullet pattern is also fire from it at enemy's as it passes by. Collision with another enemy destroys this projectile along with whatever enemy it hits. Damage is based on enemy's size and statistics.</p>
<p><b>Overclocker</b> - Slows down time around the player and shields them, fires off a circle of bullets. Falls under a countdown timer, once the timer is reached, there is a recharge period. Between recharges acts as an unchargable Standard Issue File Remover. </p>
<p><b>Enemies</b> will vary among the different levels in the game.  On the first level, for example, the primary enemy will be a Damaged Byte. Which is a Byte that was infected with the virus and now mindless fires at anyone who comes close. While other levels will begin to have more complex and complicated enemies such as a Bad Sector which will only take damage when their weak spot is showing. <br/><br/>Some Enemies are Below:<br/><br/><b>Damaged Byte:</b> Damaged by a virus on the system, what's left of these Bytes attacks you mindlessly.  (Small Enemy)<br/><br/><b>Malware:</b> This enemy will take your projectile and turn it against you if you fire at them at the wrong time. (Medium Enemy)<br/><br/><b>Spyware:</b> This enemy will cloak itself and trace your movements for a little bit before revealing themselves and trying to slash at you. (Medium enemy)<br/><br/><b>Worm:</b> This enemy will slow your movement down if they touch you and weigh you down, forcing you to try and shake them off. (Small Enemy)<br/><br/><b>Trojan:</b> Should this enemy succeed in touching you it will flip your controls and confuse you momentarily (Medium Enemy)<br/><br/><b>Bad Sector:</b> A large enemy shielded by a thick memory wall. Shooting them in the head does critical damage (Large Enemy)<br/><br/><b>Root Kit</b>: This enemy will mimic your moves backwards and attempt to run into you and explode (Medium Enemy)<br/><br/><b>Spam:</b> This enemy will constantly puff smoke to blind your vision while you try to traverse the level. (Medium Enemy)<br/><br/><b>Obstacles </b>will block your path from time to time to give the level some depth and more challenge between fighting enemies. Some Obstacles are listed below:<br/><br/>Some Obstacles are Below:<br/><br/><b>Moving Pathway:</b> These pathways are pretty common for audio files, they move with the sound wave, you'll have to use them to get across gaps or jump over them.<br/><br/><b>Memory Leak</b>: Your modulator will malfunction momentarily and spawn a vertical wall, shoot the center or dash through the center to cause it to explode and get out of your way.<br/><br/><b>Overheating Component:</b> Your pathway is too hot, use your grapple to run over the top segment and avoid crashing.<br/><br/><b>Compromised Sector:</b> A sphere will spawn between two platforms modifying the gravity around them. Watch your jumps, or send a few of your projectile sin to destroy it. </p>
<p><b>Bosses </b>will be revealed in Klerp's PC once the player has accumulated enough distance from running along pathways. These bosses are all viruses that are based off actual Historical viruses. The bosses health will be determined by the length of a song/difficulty, a higher difficulty means a longer hard boss fight. The player must try to kill the boss before their song ends. If you fail however, you can always shoot back up and try again with another song or the same one. Boss performance will also be graded like platform level performance and include bonus rewards for high grades. Check out some of the bosses below:<br/><br/><b>The Creeper:</b> The Creeper was one of the first viruses ever created, it's main purpose was to show that vulnerabilities do exist in computer systems and can be exploited. It would replicate and display the message ""I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!"".  It was later removed by the Reaper. Though it did nothing more than display a message, it seems all the corruption in the system has caused the Creeper to become empowered.  The Creeper will fire projectiles with the beat of the music and block it's vulnerable eye from time to time forcing the player to jump onto it's revolving platforms, where it will open it's eye and attempt to fire a beam at the player.</p>
<p><b>The Wabbit: </b>This boss is based of a virus which would replicate itself until it started to clog a system's memory and performance. This Boss creates miniature copies of itself that the player must try and continually destroy between taking advantageous shots at the boss.<br/><br/><b>Animal</b>: This boss will frequently pause the battle to continue a game of Simon. If the player wins a round the boss takes double damage between attacking. If the player gets it wrong the boss spawns a couple of adds.</p>
<p><b>Elk Cloner:</b> This virus used to dominate the Apple II. It's grown bitter in age over everyone's idea that Apple has never and cannot have viruses. The Elk Cloner will require the player to hop across moving platforms while avoiding his large removable storage projectile. Between projectiles he will occasionally sob uncontrollably in frustraiton causing the platforms to stop moving and slews of enemies to spawn. </p>
<p><b>King Virus: </b>Very little is know about the leader of the attack on the system. This final boss will combine the moves of all the other viruses into one last epic showdown. Can you defeat the Virus King?</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to look over my indiegogo. Let me know what you think of my project!</p>
<br/><br/>
</div></div>","Hello Everyone!
       My name is Dariusz (Dar-oosh) or Darek for short if you'd like. I'm a father and freelance, lead, art and programming developer for SoundRunner. I'm a Polish immigrant to the US at the age of 4 and have always had a strong passion for all things tech (like many software developers have!). SoundRunner is a game I've always wanted to see created and is inspired by games like Gunstar Heroes, Megaman, Audiosurf, Metroid, and Cave Story.  
      I started a campaign on KickStarter a while back which didn't meet it's goal but showed me something very important, and that's that, there are people who are interested in my project! So I decide to revamp my campaign and lower my goal so that I could make enough to pay for the Greenlight submission fee and let interested people give the game a shot. 
     So the goal is small but any contributions past the goal will be used towards development in the sense that it will open up more time for me to develop as life goals like my son's college fund, and savings for a house will be built up and I won't need to work part-time work as frequently.
   I appreciate all contributions, but I also appreciate comments and people letting me know if the game is interesting, so if you can't contribute but want to give me a hoo-rah then give me a hoorah! 
   
 
Previously I would have put the money into purchasing a new machine, since the one I currently have is an older machine. But as I thought about it, I no longer thought it was really a development requirement.  So, I've decided to focus all my efforts on getting the Steam Greenlight Submission Fee covered so that I can put the game up on Steam and give people the opportunity to give it a try pre-release. Money past $100 will go towards living expenses, medical bills with some investment into my current machine to extend it's life.I would make the goal lower however the minimum is $500.




SoundRunner is a video game in which the player plays Botty.  Who is Botty? Botty was part of your system's Viral Defense System but something went horribly wrong and a slew of viruses,malware, worms and horrible nasty stuff broke into the system and destroyed the V.D.S.  With that they completely eviserated Botty's companions and took down the system. Botty tripped right before the fight and fell straight into the Recycle Bin. This saved him however as one of the Bits who worked the Recycle Bin found him there and fixed him up in the aftermath of the chaos.  With the damage done to Botty his Circuit Platform Generator was destroyed. Klerp, the Recyle Bin Bit that saved Botty, could only find and Audio File Modulatorand hacked it into Botty. This allowed them to save Botty but his ability to move freely was destroyed in the process.All hope seemed lost until the Viruses reached the system's music files and began dumping them into the Bin. One of the files hit Botty's C.P.G and fused with his circuits, suddenly platforms began to spawn.  However the sound caused them to be differently and act unstable. This coupled with the fact that they would crumble after time led to new worries.Klerp gathered parts and altered Botty, replacing one of his arms with a File Grabber and replaced his wheels with two bipedal legs to increase his speed. The allowed him to move through the platforms before they crumbled. At the end of the audio file the final platform remained, so Klerp attached a tracking device to Botty to allow them to use his Quick Transfer Manager Cannon to shoot Botty to his last platform and continue his journey towards the viruses plagueing the system. New hope arose for the system, the only question that remains is, is it too late to stop the absolute formatting of the Bit's world?The Gameplay

[Please Note the Blue Aura in the video is for Debugging the Sound Analyzer]
Players will pick a song and hop into the Q.T.M cannon once the song is done being converted (conversion only happens once). They are then launched to an initial platform where they begin their run. As they run enemies, platforms, and obstacles spawn to try and stop the player. Powerups also spawn to help the player.  At the end of the level the player is graded based on their Accuracy, Remaining Health, Speed  and Distance covered. This leads to a Grade and multiplayer for how many Bitcoins they received for their run. Players can replay songs for additional distance scores, bitcoins or to just get a higher grade on a large difficulty. (Each song allows you to slide a difficulty slider that alters how much a song affect a level, how quickly enemies spawn and the rate of power ups. Players can use Bitcoins to buy weapons, abilities, upgrades and cosmetic changes.During the initial song selection phase the player has access to a Town Hub where they can purchase upgrades and change their appearance and equip difference weapons and abilities.
As the player builds up distance they eventually unlock a boss fight. Boss Fights, like platforming segments are also affected by music. One a Boss Fight is complete the player unlocks a new level with different enemies, aesthetics, obstacles and greater bitcoin earnings. 
     Weapons will be available for purchase at each locations town hub. They'll cost Bitcoins and once purchased can be equipped in a load-out screen before the level begins.   


Each Weapon will have 3 different levels. The weapon gains XP while running through the level and killing enemies without taking damage. Taking damage causes the weapon to lose XP. This leads the player to have to be cautious while running with a full-powered weapon, as even though the full-powered weapons are overpowered, taking damage kills the players momentum and causes them to have to rebuild their weapon.

Collision with another enemy destroys this projectile along with whatever enemy it hits. Damage is based on enemy's size and statistics.

Until April 8th</strong><br/><br/>Since our campaign has been a success, we have decided to use Indiegogo's InDemand option and keep the pre-orders of <i>Waves</i> and of its related articles open for 14 more days. <br/><br/>We will use this extra time to introduce <i>Waves</i> further to you, now in its FINAL ALBUM SOUND ! For example, we are working on a making-of video for first single <i>Soulmates</i>.<br/><br/>The extension leaves you more time to discover <i>Waves</i> and its universe, to make your pre-orders and hopefully, to share the campaign to your friends.<br/><br/><strong>The money from your pre-orders and donations (BACK IT button) are exclusively used to support Eilera's activities.</strong><br/><br/><br/>We are grateful for your support &lt;3 Eilera &amp; the Team<br/><br/><strong>......<br/><br/><br/>The STORY behind Eilera’s NEW ALBUM Waves :</strong></p><p>(Version Francaise au-dessous)</p><p>On several occasions in the past, I was recommended or asked to make an acoustic/Folk-Rock album. And each and every time I declined, simply because I had no interest in making such an album. </p><p> </p><p>During the summer of 2017 however, <strong>I took a road-trip along the Ocean coast</strong> that would change my mind about this.<br/><br/>In those times I felt exhausted from the lack of humanity I had been experiencing in the city. I needed to feel alive again. I instinctively directed myself towards the Ocean. And the Ocean, after three weeks of feeding my body and soul, became the source of new songs.<br/> </p><p><i>It became clear to me, as i was working on the album, that i was creating something which i could bring back with me to the city, try and rebalance the dehumanization process with an organic force.</i></p><p> </p><p>I decided that those songs would be acoustic, in order to match best with the muse that had inspired them.</p><p> </p><p>As the demos of the songs developed however, together with the 4 main musicians on the album, its four guests and sound engineer, I decided that some of them shall remain acoustic and totally naked and that others shall have more instrumental layers.</p><p> </p><p>In the end, this album is not ‘my Kurt Cobain album’ ;) , as I’d first predicted it would be. I have witnessed its transformation, from the 'ugly little duck' it originally was, into a beautiful swan..<br/> </p><p>It is an album in the continuity of my work <i>- my 5th!</i> , at a certain time in my life. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>The MUSIC</strong></u></p><p> </p><p>The music in Waves evolves between <strong>acoustic Folk music </strong>and <strong>Folk-Rock</strong>, with a <strong>touch of Celtic magic</strong>.</p><p> </p><p>Importantly for me, the album had to build a bridge between past and present musical times, as to become <strong>a Folk-Rock album of the modern times</strong>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong><u>The concept and the lyrics :</u></strong></p><p> </p><p>I worked on the 3 main sources of waves in this world : </p><p>sea, emotions and sound. </p><p> </p><p><i>All of them are a source of energy that feeds the soul. </i></p><p> </p><p>The Ocean is the ultimate 'Force tranquille'.<br/>At times appeasing, it can also crush us and our boats.<br/><br/>It is an eternal source of mystery and adventure, but also, if we think more rationally, it is a source of food and of energy.<br/><br/> </p><p><i>The Ocean feeds both the body and the soul.</i></p><p> </p><p><strong>What I did with this album, was to capture this energy into 11 songs, which anybody, at any time and in any place, will be able to take through his/her headphones.</strong></p><p> </p><p><u>Tracklist</u> <br/><br/>1.

With love, Eilera</i></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>Why did I open this Crowdfunding?</strong></u></p><p> </p><p>At this point, I am an <strong>independent musician</strong>. I write my songs, compose their basis, add the final arrangements, after the musicians have brought their parts. I coordinate international teams of a minimum of 10 people - for arrangements and recordings, mixing and mastering and I am in charge of most of the production work. Then I make sure that the albums are distributed and promoted.</p><p><br/><br/> I finance my project myself, mostly thanks to other day jobs I take. I often hit financial limits, which sadly prevents me from creating as much as i would like to and from giving my fans as much as I would like to give them. - This is the only reason why I don’t tour. </p><p> </p><p>For a long time, I was reluctant to open Crowdfundings.. <i>Why? Maybe because of silly pride? </i></p><p> </p><p>But nowadays, I see how crowdfunding can be a fantastic adventure that <strong>unites myself and my fans into creating more, for all of us.</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>How do finances work in the making of an album?</strong></u></p><p> </p><p>Waves is my 5th full-length album. I have also had 2 Eps published. </p><p> </p><p>Depending on the album you make, the budget varies considerably. My album 'Fusion', for instance, cost about 30 000€ to make and about another 20 000€ to promote. Those costs at the time were paid by a record label.<br/><br/>An epic album, which includes the contribution of an orchestra, would easily cost 200 000€. </p><p>Not to mention the costs of all the gear that we need to play and record music.</p><p> </p><p>For my 'Face Your Demons' album, of which much was recorded live in studio, the making costs + the humble promotion after, came over 10 000€. <strong>A big part of this album was financed thanks to my fans' support! &lt;3</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><i>One can make the best album in the world. If it does not get promoted and talked of after its release… only a few will ever hear of it. <strong>Hence the importance of promotion, of the sharing of posts by fans in the internet, and by talking with their friends. </strong></i></p><p> </p><p> </p><p><u><strong>How can you get involved in this project?</strong></u></p><p> </p><p>By <strong>pre-ordering</strong> your favourite<strong> PERK(S)</strong> from this page, in the perk column which you find in the above-section.

Until April 8thSince our campaign has been a success, we have decided to use Indiegogo's InDemand option and keep the pre-orders of Waves and of its related articles open for 14 more days. We will use this extra time to introduce Waves further to you, now in its FINAL ALBUM SOUND ! For example, we are working on a making-of video for first single Soulmates.The extension leaves you more time to discover Waves and its universe, to make your pre-orders and hopefully, to share the campaign to your friends.The money from your pre-orders and donations (BACK IT button) are exclusively used to support Eilera's activities.We are grateful for your support <3 Eilera & the Team......The STORY behind Eilera’s NEW ALBUM Waves :(Version Francaise au-dessous)On several occasions in the past, I was recommended or asked to make an acoustic/Folk-Rock album. And each and every time I declined, simply because I had no interest in making such an album.  During the summer of 2017 however, I took a road-trip along the Ocean coast that would change my mind about this.In those times I felt exhausted from the lack of humanity I had been experiencing in the city. I needed to feel alive again. I instinctively directed myself towards the Ocean. And the Ocean, after three weeks of feeding my body and soul, became the source of new songs. It became clear to me, as i was working on the album, that i was creating something which i could bring back with me to the city, try and rebalance the dehumanization process with an organic force. I decided that those songs would be acoustic, in order to match best with the muse that had inspired them. As the demos of the songs developed however, together with the 4 main musicians on the album, its four guests and sound engineer, I decided that some of them shall remain acoustic and totally naked and that others shall have more instrumental layers. In the end, this album is not ‘my Kurt Cobain album’ ;) , as I’d first predicted it would be. I have witnessed its transformation, from the 'ugly little duck' it originally was, into a beautiful swan.. It is an album in the continuity of my work - my 5th! , at a certain time in my life.   The MUSIC The music in Waves evolves between acoustic Folk music and Folk-Rock, with a touch of Celtic magic. Importantly for me, the album had to build a bridge between past and present musical times, as to become a Folk-Rock album of the modern times.  The concept and the lyrics : I worked on the 3 main sources of waves in this world : sea, emotions and sound.  All of them are a source of energy that feeds the soul.  The Ocean is the ultimate 'Force tranquille'.At times appeasing, it can also crush us and our boats.It is an eternal source of mystery and adventure, but also, if we think more rationally, it is a source of food and of energy. The Ocean feeds both the body and the soul. What I did with this album, was to capture this energy into 11 songs, which anybody, at any time and in any place, will be able to take through his/her headphones. Tracklist 1. Andada2. Aquarius3. Sea Widow4. Soulmates5. She Makes Waves6. Roll with the Waves7. Rebellious Town8. Shades of Blue9. Une Vague10. Lili 11. La Quest  The visuals : I wanted the album cover to : breathe free, respect a balance between the old Celtic Folk-Rock world and our modern times.  I wanted it to start from a very natural / spontaneous-looking photograph. This one was taken with my oldest colleague when it comes to photographing me: my sister, Emilie.  An international teamwork : WAVES gathers the work of 15 persons in total, from France, Finland and Chile. We have been working on this project for over 14 months now. ----------> The Team :Eilera - songwriting, vocals, programming, production- location : France & Finland  Roni Seppänen - guitars - location : FinlandLoïc Tézénas - guitars - location : FranceDominique Dijoux - piano, Rhodes and synths - location : FranceToni Paananen, drums - location : Finland GUEST MUSICIANS :Sami Hinkka (Ensiferum, Metal De Facto) fretless and 6 strings bass- location : FinlandZé Javier (Jaco Dada) , acoustic guitar - location : ChileJuho Martikainen (The Hollow, Puer) contrabass - location: FinlandPereg ar Bagol (Celtic Bastard, Skiltron, Boisson Divine) Accordéon Diatonique, Boha, vocals - location : FranceSOUND & VISUALS :Tero Kinnunen (Nightwish) - recording and co-production location: FinlandJakke Viitala - pre-mixes - location: FinlandJustine Florio - illustration - location : FinlandDavid Letelier - illustration and animation - Location : Chile The RECORDING of the album was done in several home-studios of France, Finland and Chile.The drums were recorded in Moon Unit Studio (Helsinki), with assistance from Jan Rechberger.

On one of the happiest days of my life, as we we celebrated with joy, pride and Champagne, the final day of the making of Waves - January 2019We are proud to present this new album to you today, with all the great work that has been done by everyone, in spite of all the unexpected, good and bad, we've met on our way.I am overly glad that this is a shared experience, with people from North, Middle and Southern Earth, and with You, actors of this campaign! Let's keep connected with the humanity and the wildness inside of each of us. With love, Eilera  Why did I open this Crowdfunding? At this point, I am an independent musician. I write my songs, compose their basis, add the final arrangements, after the musicians have brought their parts. I coordinate international teams of a minimum of 10 people - for arrangements and recordings, mixing and mastering and I am in charge of most of the production work. Then I make sure that the albums are distributed and promoted. I finance my project myself, mostly thanks to other day jobs I take. I often hit financial limits, which sadly prevents me from creating as much as i would like to and from giving my fans as much as I would like to give them. - This is the only reason why I don’t tour.  For a long time, I was reluctant to open Crowdfundings.. Why? Maybe because of silly pride?  But nowadays, I see how crowdfunding can be a fantastic adventure that unites myself and my fans into creating more, for all of us.  How do finances work in the making of an album? Waves is my 5th full-length album. I have also had 2 Eps published.  Depending on the album you make, the budget varies considerably. My album 'Fusion', for instance, cost about 30 000€ to make and about another 20 000€ to promote. Those costs at the time were paid by a record label.An epic album, which includes the contribution of an orchestra, would easily cost 200 000€. Not to mention the costs of all the gear that we need to play and record music. For my 'Face Your Demons' album, of which much was recorded live in studio, the making costs + the humble promotion after, came over 10 000€. A big part of this album was financed thanks to my fans' support! <3  One can make the best album in the world. If it does not get promoted and talked of after its release… only a few will ever hear of it. Hence the importance of promotion, of the sharing of posts by fans in the internet, and by talking with their friends.   How can you get involved in this project? By pre-ordering your favourite PERK(S) from this page, in the perk column which you find in the above-section.

Par exemple, nous travaillons en ce moment sur la vidéo making-of du premier single Soulmates.L'extension vous laisse plus de temps pour découvrir Waves et son univers, pour passer vos pré-commandes et nous l'espérons, pour partager la campagne auprès de vos amis. L'argent de vos pré-commandes et de vos donations (Bouton BACK IT en haut de page) est exclusivement utilisé en soutien aux activités d'EileraMerci pour votre soutien <3 Eilera & l'Equipe.....Lorsque vous avez besoin de ressentir la LIBERTÉ et la BEAUTÉ de l'OcéanPlongez dans l'histoire des personnages qui peuplent les côtes Celtiques de Waves, rebelles et romantiques, chaque fois que vous aurez l'envie de vous évader de journées froides et deshumanisées.  L’HISTOIRE du nouvel album d’Eilera, Waves : A plusieurs reprises par le passé, on m’a demandé ou recommandé de faire un album acoustique / Folk. Chaque fois je refusai. Je n’étais simplement pas intéressée par faire un tel album. Durant l’été 2017 cependant, je fis un ‘Road-Trip’, un voyage en voiture, le long de la côte océanique, qui allait changer mon ressenti sur le sujet. Je me sentais fatiguée du manque d’humanité que j’avais pu expérimenter à cette époque. J'avais besoin de me sentir à nouveau en vie et, d’instinct, je me tournais vers l’Océan.  Après trois semaines durant lesquelles il me nourrit corps et âme, celui-ci devint source d'inspiration pour de nouvelles chansons. Alors que je travaillais sur l’album, il m’apparut clairement que j’étais en train de créer une pièce que je pourrais rapporter avec moi à la ville, qui aiderait à ré-équilibrer le processus de déshumanisation excessive avec une force organique.  Je décidais que ces chansons seraient acoustiques, afin de s’apparenter au mieux avec la muse qui les avait inspirées. Alors que les démos des chansons prenaient forme cependant, avec les 4 musiciens principaux de l’album, ses 4 invités et ingénieur-son, je décidai que certaines chansons resteraient purement acoustiques et que d’autres contiendraient davantage de couches instrumentales. Au final, cet album n’est pas ‘mon album Kurt Cobain’ ;) , comme je l’avais d’abord envisagé. J'ai assisté à sa transformation, du ""vilain petit canard"" qu'il était à l'origine en cygne majestueux. C’est un album dans la continuité de mon travail - mon 5ème ! , à un moment donné de ma vie.   La MUSIQUE La musique dans Waves évolue entre pure musique Folk et Folk-Rock, avec une pointe de magie Celtique. Il était important pour moi que l’album soit un pont entre les temps/musiques passés et présents, afin d’être un album Folk-Rock des temps modernes.  Le concept et les paroles : J’ai travaillé sur les 3 principales sources de vagues (waves) dans ce monde: Les mers, les émotions et le son. Toutes sont source d’énergie pour l’âme. L’Océan est la force tranquille ultime. Parfois apaisant, il peut aussi détruire nos embarcations et nous engloutir. Il est une source éternelle de mystère et d'aventures, mais aussi, d'un point de vue plus rationnel, il est source de nourriture et d'énergie. L’Océan nourrit le corps et l’âme. Ce que j’ai accompli avec cet album, est de capturer cette énergie et de la transformer en 11 chansons dont chacun pourra se nourir, à n’importe quel endroit et à n'importe quel moment qu'il le désire, à travers ses écouteurs.   Liste des chansons : 1. Andada2. Aquarius3. Sea Widow4. Soulmates5. She Makes Waves6. Roll with the Waves7. Rebellious Town8. Shades of Blue9. Une Vague10. Lili 11. La Quest   Travail VISUEL : Je voulais que la pochette de l'album respire la liberté et qu'il respecte un équilibre entre l'ancien monde Rock-Celtique et nos temps modernes. Je voulais aussi qu'elle germe à partir d’une photo au ressenti naturel / spontané. Cette photo a été prise par ma plus vieille collaboratrice lorsqu’il s’agit de mes photographies : ma soeur Emilie.  Une EQUIPE de travail INTERNATIONALE : WAVES rassemble le travail de 15 personnes au total, originaires de France, Finlande et du Chili. Nous travaillons sur ce projet depuis plus de 14 mois.  ————————> L’Equipe : Eilera - écriture, chant, programmation, production- localisation : France, FinlandeRoni Seppänen - guitares - localisation : FinlandeLoïc Tézénas - guitares - localisation : FranceDominique Dijoux - piano, Rhodes et synthèse - localisation : FranceToni Paananen - batterie et percussions - localisation : Finlande MUSICIENS INVITÉS :Sami Hinkka (Ensiferum, Metal De Facto) Basse fretless et basse 6-cordes- Localisation : FinlandeZé Javier (Jaco Dada) - guitare acoustique - localisation : ChiliJuho Martikainen (At The Hollow) - contrebasse - localisation : FinlandePereg ar Bagol (Celtic Bastard) - Accordéon Diatonique, Boha, vocals- localisation : FranceSON & VISUELS :Tero Kinnunen (Nightwish) - enregistrement et co-productionlocalisation: FinlandeJakke Viitala - pré-mixes - localisation : FinlandeJustine Florio - illustration - localisation : FinlandeDavid Letelier - illustration & animation - localisation : ChiliL'ENREGISTREMENT de l'album s'est fait dans plusieurs home-studios en France, Finlande et au Chili.La batterie a été enregistrée au Moon Unit Studio (Helsinki), avec l'assistance de Jan Rechberger.

Prise cloture d'un des plus heureux jours de ma vie, durant la célébration du dernier jour de production de Waves, avec de la joie, de la fierté et du Champagne - Janvier 2019Nous sommes fiers de vous présenter ce nouvel album aujourd'hui, qui contient tout l'excellent travail que chacun a produit, avec toutes les bonnes et mauvaises surprises que nous avons rencontrées en route.  Je suis particulièrement ravie que cette expérience soit une expérience partagée, avec des personnes du Grand Nord, du Grand Sud et de la Terre du Milieu, ainsi qu'avec Vous, acteurs de cette campagne ! Restons connectés avec l’humanité et la liberté sauvage à l’intérieur de chacun de nous. <3 Eilera  Pourquoi ai-je ouvert cette campagne de Crowdfunding ? Au jour d'aujourd'hui, je suis une musicienne indépendante. J'écris mes chansons, je compose leur base et ajoute les arrangements, après que les musiciens aient apporté leur propres parties. Je coordone des équipe internationales d'un minimum de 10 personnes - pour les arrangements, les enregistrements, mixes et masterings et je suis responsable de la majorité du travail de production. Je m'assure ensuite que les albums sont promus et distribués. Je finance mon projet moi-même, en partie grâce à d’autre jobs que je prends. Je rencontre souvent des limites financières, qui malheureusement m'empêche de produire autant que je le voudrais et de donner autant à mes fans que ce que je le souhaiterais. Ceci est la seule raison pour laquelle je ne tourne pas.  Pendant longtemps, j’ai évité d’ouvrir une campagne de Crowdfunding. Pourquoi? Peut-être par simple fierté? Mais aujourd’hui, je vois combien un Crowdfunding peut-être une aventure fantastique qui m’unie avec mes fans vers un objectif commun.  Comment fonctionne le financement d’un album? Waves est mon 5ème album. J’ai aussi deux autres mini-albums publiés. En fonction du style d’album que l'on fait, le budget peut varier fortement. Mon album ‘Fusion’, par exemple, a couté environ 30 000€ à faire et environ 20 000 € de promotion. Ces coûts avaient été pris en charge par une maison de disque à l’époque.Un album épique qui inclue la participation d'un orchestre coutera facilement 200 000€. Sans parler du coût du matériel d'enregistrement et des instruments. Pour mon album ’Face Your Demons’, dont la grosse majorité avait été enregistrée en Live en studio, le coût de l’album + de l’humble promotion qui a suivi, se sont approximativement élevés à 10 000€. Une grosse partie de cette somme a été financée grâce au soutien de mes fans ! <3 Un artiste peut faire le meilleur album du monde. S'il n'est pas promu à sa sortie, peu de personnes en connaitront l'existence. D'où l'importance majeure de la promotion, du partage sur internet par les fans et par la paroles, avec leurs amis.  Comment pouvez-vous devenir acteur de ce projet ? En faisant une pré-commande de votre article favori sur cette page, dans la colonne intitulée PERKS. Tout achat est sécurisé. OU BIEN Si vous souhaitez faire une simple donation à ce projet, vous pouvez cliquer sur le bouton Back It, situé en haut de cette page. Quels sont les autres moyens de participer ? Chaque PARTAGE sur internet avec votre réseau aide à faire parler de cette campagne et peut contribuer à attirer de nouveaux fans vers notre communauté. Ceci nous aide donc ENORMEMENT ! PARTAGEZ cette campagne tous les quelques jours avec votre réseau d’amis et relations sur internet.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We are an independent 5-piece hybrid rock band from New Orleans, LA. The opportunity of a lifetime has dropped into our laps! We have the chance to work with our favorite producer, Taylor Larson. He has produced/recorded such bands/artists as Periphery, I See Stars, and Jason Richardson.</p>
<p>This is absolutely surreal for us. Of all the times we've called upon you, this is a time we truly need your help most. With your support, we can raise the money needed to fund the last leg of our recording goal. Normally we would never ask anyone to donate money. However, after selling gear, saving money, and doing numerous odd jobs, our goal is still slightly out of reach.  Now we are turning to you guys to help us obtain our current objective.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise funds to cover a small portion of the cost of recording and travel expenses to Washington, DC, so we can have our new single recorded and produced by Taylor Larson at his studio!</p>
<p><br/>Perks for Spylights fans will include items like:</p>
<p>(1) A limited edition, first-ever run Spylights t-shirt with original artwork by Josh Dartez </p>
<p>(2) A personalized and signed 11x17 album art poster on thick matte card-stock paper</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We're selling excess gear and taking time off of our jobs to seize this opportunity. All of us in Spylights share the same dream of playing music full-time, and this is the biggest opportunity for our band (and personal careers) to date. Without risk there is no reward, and we are ready to take our music to the next level with, in our opinion, the most versatile and talented producer in the world.

<h3>My name is James Taylor, Jr. I am a singer/songwriter living in the Detroit area.</h3>
<p>A brief history of me: I started singing as soon as I could talk, began writing poetry when I was 6, and writing songs when I was 12. My sister recorded her first demo when she was 18 (I was 14), recording a song I wrote when I was 13. At age 16, I began performing my own songs at school, talent shows, and contests. For 3 and a half years, I was in the queerwave band (the)fundamentalists, and I spent a year and a half in a variety band. Aside from performing and recording as a solo artist, I co-created a group with Kylee Remington called Remington Taylor. I minored in music at Eastern Michigan University, which entailed lots of voice lessons, ensembles, special concerts, functional piano, and music theory.</p>
<p>I currently have several singles and an EP available on all streaming and digital music services, most of which were self-produced or produced in home studios. However, this year, I started working with an amazing producer, Kevin Wesley Williams of Wesmix, who co-founded and produces the band ELSIE BINX. My single ""Pride (Stripped)"" was originally recorded for my album ""PRIDE"" which we are still working on. Since things were shut down for a while, I decided to work on some different music. That's where ""hi / jt"" comes in.</p>
<p><strong>""hi / jt""</strong> is a collection of eclectic pop songs with influences from many other genres, from rock to musical theatre. Two of these songs, I never thought I'd record, and ""Just Stay Home"" has been re-recorded and re-imagined slightly. Not only have I had a lot of fun making this record and working with some amazing musicians, but I am grateful that all these musicians have expressed their joy at working on this album as well. So special thanks to Kevin Wesley Williams, Darin Curtis, Phil Steuer, Erin Accomando, and Jen Read for all their amazing work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's where your contribution goes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over $2,000 goes into studio time an mixing. Time is still accruing as we put the final touches on the songs.</li>
<li>Another $1,000 goes to the musicians for their work on percussion and drums, bass, guitars, and vocals.</li>
<li>Any additional funds go right back into the music. I have already spent money working on ""PRIDE"" and ""You Don't Have to Hurt (Jingle Mix and Acoustic/Ukulele)"". Anything extra will simply go right back into the studio (those that aren't taken by the indiegogo fees).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what I have to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handwritten thank you notes for every single one of you.</li>
<li>Unique ""JTJR"" Pride stickers.</li>
<li>The songs. Level of contribution will determine how many songs you get for FREE PRIOR, to release.</li>
<li>I will hold a special private video premiere for a select few as well as higher contributors to this campaign. This will likely be in early February.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's why I need your help.</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a local artist! Local music scenes are rough nowadays and there are very few smaller labels scooping up musicians and helping them move forward. We rely solely on the generosity and support of INDIVIDUALS.</li>
<li>I work very part-time, as I've dedicated most of my life to this endeavor. I've even cleaned out my savings account. Without support, I may not be able to continue making art.</li>
<li>""hi / jt"" and the music I write is meant to CONNECT to people. Love, heartbreak, trauma, joy. We all share the human experience and I want to share that with others.</li>
<li>My next album, ""PRIDE"", is an album that embraces, shares, and is inspired by LGBTQ+ history. Stopping at ""hi / jt"" would be a disappointment to me, but I feel like ""PRIDE"" could be a record that people will connect to on a higher level.</li>

<p><strong>Songs have been a key source of strength in all of humanity's struggles...and I'm sure in many of your personal ones as well. My goal as an artist is to continue the tradition of song-writing as an expression of truth, a stepping stone towards freedom and a way of connecting with our place and purpose in the world....If you already know you want to contribute to this campaign, please skip ahead and check out the ""perks"" and contribute!</strong></p>
<p>For the past 15 years I've been making music and poetry dedicated to social and personal healing and transformation. I've performed across Canada and the E.U., self-produced four albums of original work and been blessed to make my living as an independent female artist without ever compromising the integrity of my work. <strong><i>This has all been made possible by people like you who believe in what I do and who truly value music with a message!</i></strong></p>
<p>My most recent album, Passage, released in 2015, led me to a year of incredible encounters and to a major step up in my career...as well as a whole new collection of songs!</p>
<h3><strong>Tell Me More About This New Album!?</strong></h3>
<p>The songs on this album are much more personal than any I have yet released. Why? Because I've come to realize that being unapologetically who I am is one of the ways I can inspire others to discover their own ""true natures"". For me, the last couple of years have been about trusting myself to remain aligned with my authentic self and values while becoming more ""visible"" as an artist. <strong>These songs speak to the power of truth as a tool for profound transformation. They celebrate the combined fragility and resilience of Life and Love in their many facets.</strong></p>
<p>The album will include songs in English, French as well as Irish Gaelic...plus some surprises ;). It's worth knowing that language revitalization is a focus in all of my projects...To me each language provides a unique perspective and experience of the world. Being exposed to languages and cultures other than our own is, in my view, a key piece to cultivating inter-cultural harmony globally and de-constructing the illusion of ""otherness"" that keeps us separate and alienated from one another...</p>
<p>On the musical front, I'm going to be collaborating with accomplished Montréal musician and producer Cédric Dind-Lavoie on arrangements and production.  We'll be working with all acoustic instruments and working with two other incredible musicians who I've had the pleasure of performing with over the past year, Estelle Lavoie on kora (the west african harp) and Anais Constantin on cello. I honestly can't say enough about how much I love working with these folks, but I know that you'll enjoy the results once you get to hear them!</p>
<p>Because <strong>my music is very much inspired by my connection to the land</strong> I'll be continuing the tradition of recording my albums at Pierrot Paradis Studios near where I grew up in the  Lac-Mégantic area of eastern Québec.</p>
<p><strong>When Will it Be Done?</strong></p>
<p>We aim to release the album in March or April 2018. <strong>Those of you who contribute to the campaign however will get the digital versions of the songs weeks before everyone else! </strong>You'll also be kept up to date regularly as the project moves forward and will be the first to know when we have a launch party organized...</p>
<h3><strong>""Perks"" and How They Work</strong></h3>
<p>Perks are basically a way of giving back to you in thanks for supporting my work! It's all part of that grand ol' cycle of giving and receiving. Here's what I'd like to offer you... </p>
<p><strong>EARLY RELEASE DIGITAL ALBUM and THANKS!</strong></p>
<p>You'll receive the full digital version of the album, with lyrics and album artwork as well as a thank you note from yours truly.</p>
<strong>THE REAL DEAL</strong><p>Pretty self-explanatory! You get...a physical copy of the album! Autographed and delivered to your doorstep.</p>
<p><strong>THE ALBUM PLUS...</strong></p>
<p>A physical copy of the album autographed and delivered to your doorstep with a personal thank you note PLUS handwritten copies of  lyrics and chords for two songs from the album!</p>
<p><strong>THE FAN PACK</strong></p>
<p>You'll get a signed copy of the physical album, I'll write you an original poem just for you (in English or in French, you choose!)you get to choose a song you'd like me to perform at the album launch (which I'll video and send to you if you can't come in person) PLUS you'll get a home-made darkroom print of a black &amp; white photo of one of some of the album artwork!</p>
<p><strong>ALWAYS WANTED A SONG WRITTEN FOR YOU?</strong></p>
<p>It would be my absolute pleasure to write a song for you or someone who you care about! If you have lyrics that you'd like me to put to music, I can do that. If you need something written from scratch, I can do that too! You'll also get the digital pre-release with lyrics and artwork!</p>
<p><strong>HOUSE CONCERT + YOU CHOOSE MY SET LIST!</strong></p>
<p>Invite me to your house or a friends house to play! And on top of that, you can choose what songs you want me to play ! You'll also get the digital pre-release of with artwork and lyrics. (Note: *If you live outside of Quebec and Ontario we'll need to figure out the transportation and housing side of things, but otherwise just allow a couple month leeway for scheduling. )</p>
<p><strong>PATRON OF THE ARTS</strong></p>
<p>When I say you will have my eternal gratitude, I do mean it.  As a Patron of the Arts you will have your name in the album liner notes along with many many many thanks on all my social network platforms (OR choose to remain anonymous if you prefer...)! You'll also get 10 autographed physical copies of the album to share with your circle or friends.</p>
<h3><strong>The Details</strong></h3>
<p>Having made 4 of these album things by now, I know that in the end, it's going to cost a minimum of $7,000 to $10,000. I've never aimed to cover all my costs with a crowdfunding campaign before but this time I figured I'd see if we can make it happen together :)</p>
<p>This amount goes into; paying musicians and my co-producer for their time in rehearsals and in studio (to say nothing of the amount of unpaid individual practice time they're putting in!); hiring a sound engineer to record us and renting the studio space; paying a graphic artist to make the case look pretty and legible; mixing and mastering the album (this basically means making sure all the elements on the album can be heard properly and sound their best, PLUS making sure the album meets industry standards and can thus maybe, hopefully get some radio play and reach more people!); printing physical copies of the album (because I know a lot of you still do love having actual cds to play!I sure do...). And of course, that doesn't include any of the promotion once the album has been released, renting a space to do a launch party or paying the musicians for their time on stage if we end up performing the songs live. Phew...</p>
<p><strong>Your support is absolutely essential to making this all happen!</strong></p>
<p>That being said, I've chosen to use the ""flexible funding"" model that Indiegogo offers so that if ever I don't reach my goal of $7,000 I will s<i>till </i>make the album happen no matter what! Reaching my goal will of course speed up the process as I won't need to fundraise in other ways, but in either case, the album will get made, and you will get it :)</p>
<h3><strong>""What Other Ways Can I Contribute?""</strong></h3>
<p>If you would really love to support this project but can't contribute financially, no worries! I have definitely been there :) You can help by sharing this campaign with all your friends and family, and by sharing my music with anyone you think might appreciate it! Thank you for your support in whatever form!</p>
<p>Many many thanks to everyone who has been part of this amazing journey thus far!</p>
<h2><strong><u>Version française</u></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Les chansons ont permis à l'humanité de traverser plusieurs moments sombres de notre histoire... elles t'ont sûrement accompagné à travers plusieurs de tes luttes personnelles ! Mon but en tant qu’artiste est de continuer la tradition des chansons qui nous mènent vers notre vérité, vers la liberté d'être et nous donnent un sentiment d’appartenance, une raison d'être dans ce monde parfois turbulent. Si tu sais déjà que tu veux contribuer à ce projet, vas voir les « perks » et contribue!</strong></p>
<p>Je fais de la musique depuis 15 ans en sachant que l’art est essentiel à la transformation personnelle et globale… Elle nous aide à créer, jour après jour, un monde plus paisible et conscient pour les générations à venir. J'ai fait des tournées à travers le Canada et l'Europe, j’ai autoproduit quatre albums et j’ai eu la chance de faire ma vie comme femme artiste indépendante sans compromettre mes valeurs profondes. <strong>À la base, ma musique a toujours été rendue possible par des gens comme toi, qui croient que la musique peut toucher des cœurs et influencer des changements positifs dans le monde.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Dis m’en plus sur cet album!</strong></h3>
<p>Les chansons de cet album sont beaucoup plus personnelles que celles d'avant. Pourquoi ? Parce qu'avec le temps, je réalise qu’être moi-même, sans excuse ni compromis, est ma façon d'inspirer les autres à découvrir qui ils sont vraiment. Pour moi, les dernières années m'ont appris à rester authentique tout en acceptant de me rendre plus visible en tant qu’artiste.<strong> Ces chansons parlent du pouvoir de la vérité comme outil de transformation. Elles célèbrent la fragilité et la résilience de la Vie et de l'Amour.</strong></p>
<p>L’album va inclure des chansons en anglais, en français et en gaélique irlandais...et quelques surprises en plus ! La revitalisation des langues ancestrales est un point central dans tout mon travail...Pour moi, le contact avec des langues et des cultures autres que la nôtre est la clef pour créer un monde de paix et d'harmonie interculturelle.</p>
<p>Pour ce qui est de la musique, je vais collaborer avec un musicien et réalisateur accompli: Cédric Dind-Lavoie. Nous allons travailler avec Estelle Lavoie à la kora (une harpe de l’Ouest africain) et Anais Constantin au violoncelle. Tu ne peux pas imaginer à quel point j'adore travailler avec ces gens-là, mais je sais qu'en écoutant l’album, tu vas entendre le résultat !</p>
<p><strong>Ma musique est inspirée de ma connexion avec la Terre</strong>, c’est pourquoi je compte continuer la tradition d'enregistrer mes albums près de là où j'ai grandi, dans le studio de Pierrot Paradis, dans la région de Lac-Mégantic.</p>
<p><strong>Ça sera fini quand ?</strong></p>
<p>On prévoit de lancer l'album en mars ou avril 2018. Ceux et celles qui participent à sa création recevront la version numérique plusieurs semaines avant tous les autres !</p>
<h3><strong>C’est quoi les « Perks »?</strong></h3>
<p>Les « Perks » sont une manière de vous redonner quelque chose pour souligner votre appui à mon projet !</p>
<p><strong>PRÉ-ACHAT de l'ALBUM &amp; REMERCIEMENTS !</strong></p>
<p>Reçois l'album numérique avant son lancement officiel, avec les paroles et l'oeuvre artistique de la pochette de l'album, en plus d'un remerciement personnalisé !</p>
<p><strong>LA VRAIE AFFAIRE</strong></p>
<p>L’album physique autographié, envoyé directement chez toi, avec un remerciement personnalisé.</p>
<p><strong>L'ALBUM PLUS...</strong></p>
<p>L’album physique autographié, envoyé directement chez toi, avec un remerciement personnalisé PLUS les textes et les accords de deux chansons tirées de l'album écrite à la main.</p>
<p><strong>LE FAN PACK</strong></p>
<p>L'album physique, un remerciement personnalisé, un poème écrit par moi-même juste pour toi, choix d'une chanson que t'aimerais que je joue au lancement (je vais le filmer et t'envoyer le vidéo si tu peux pas venir en personne) PLUS une photo argentique noir et blanc tirée du livret de l'album fait dans une chambre noire maison !</p>
<p><strong>UNE 'TITE TOUNE JUSTE POUR TOI</strong></p>
<p>Peut-être que personne ne t’a jamais écrit une chanson, ou peut-être t'as quelqu'un de spécial pour qui t'aimerais que j'écrive de quoi. Je peux t'en écrire une au complet ou je peux mettre tes paroles en musique. Plus une copie numérique de l'album incluant les paroles et l'oeuvre artistique de la pochette de l'album, en plus d'un remerciement personnalisé !</p>
<p><strong>CONCERT DE MAISON +</strong></p>
<p>Oui, je viendrai faire un concert dans ta maison ! De plus, tu décides quelles chansons tu veux que je chante! Inclus une copie numérique de l'album accompagnée des paroles et l'oeuvre artistique de la pochette de l'album, en plus d'un remerciement personnalisé !)</p>
<p><strong>MÉCÈNE DES ARTS</strong></p>
<p>Premièrement, t'aurais ma gratitude éternelle. De deux, je t’offre une place dans la pochette de l'album avec ton nom et, si tu désires, ta photo, et cela, sur tous mes réseaux sociaux ! Tu vas aussi recevoir 7 copies de l'album physique pour donner à tes proches.</p>
<h3><strong>Les détails</strong></h3>
<p>Ayant déjà réalisé quatre albums avant celui-ci, je sais qu'à la fin de tout, ça va couter entre 7000 $ et 10,000 $. Je n'ai jamais tenté de couvrir tous mes frais avec une campagne de socio-financement, mais je crois qu'ensemble, on est capable de le faire !   </p>
<p>Ce montant sera utilisé pour: payer les musiciens et mon co-réalisateur pour leur temps en studio et en répétitions (pour ne pas parler de tout leur temps de pratique personnelle!); engager un ingénieur de son et louer le studio; engager un artiste graphique pour créer la pochette et la rendre belle et lisible; faire le mixage et l'édition des pistes audio (ce qui veut dire s'assurer que tous les éléments de l'enregistrement sonnent le mieux possible ET s'assurer que l'album accote les standards de l'industrie musicale pour qu'il puisse, on l’espère, passer à la radio et rejoindre plus de monde !) ;faire des copies physiques de l'album (parce que je sais qu'il y en a beaucoup d'entre vous qui aime toujours avoir des vrais cd, tout comme moi...). Et bien sûr, tout ça n'inclut pas la promotion de l'album, la location d'un espace pour faire le lancement ni le cachet des musiciens si on décide de faire un spectacle live pour le lancement ! Fiou...</p>
<p><strong>C'est pour ça que vos contributions sont absolument essentielles pour que l’on puisse réaliser tout ça !</strong></p>
<p>Ceci étant dit, j'ai choisi l'option du «financement flexible» offert par Indiegogo afin que même si nous n’atteignons pas notre but, nous puissions tout de même faire avancer l'album ! </p>
<h3><strong>Est ce qu'il y a d'autre manière que je peux contribuer?</strong></h3>
<p>Oui! Même si vous pouvez pas contibuer de manière financière au présent, partagez la campagne avec vos amies et votre famille! J'apprécie les contributions de toutes formes :)</p>
<p>Un gros merci à tous les gens qui ont fait partie de mon cheminement à date!</p>

Being exposed to languages and cultures other than our own is, in my view, a key piece to cultivating inter-cultural harmony globally and de-constructing the illusion of ""otherness"" that keeps us separate and alienated from one another...
On the musical front, I'm going to be collaborating with accomplished Montréal musician and producer Cédric Dind-Lavoie on arrangements and production.  We'll be working with all acoustic instruments and working with two other incredible musicians who I've had the pleasure of performing with over the past year, Estelle Lavoie on kora (the west african harp) and Anais Constantin on cello. I honestly can't say enough about how much I love working with these folks, but I know that you'll enjoy the results once you get to hear them!
Because my music is very much inspired by my connection to the land I'll be continuing the tradition of recording my albums at Pierrot Paradis Studios near where I grew up in the  Lac-Mégantic area of eastern Québec.
When Will it Be Done?
We aim to release the album in March or April 2018. Those of you who contribute to the campaign however will get the digital versions of the songs weeks before everyone else! You'll also be kept up to date regularly as the project moves forward and will be the first to know when we have a launch party organized...
""Perks"" and How They Work
Perks are basically a way of giving back to you in thanks for supporting my work! It's all part of that grand ol' cycle of giving and receiving. Here's what I'd like to offer you... 
EARLY RELEASE DIGITAL ALBUM and THANKS!
You'll receive the full digital version of the album, with lyrics and album artwork as well as a thank you note from yours truly.
THE REAL DEALPretty self-explanatory! You get...a physical copy of the album! Autographed and delivered to your doorstep.
THE ALBUM PLUS...
A physical copy of the album autographed and delivered to your doorstep with a personal thank you note PLUS handwritten copies of  lyrics and chords for two songs from the album!
THE FAN PACK
You'll get a signed copy of the physical album, I'll write you an original poem just for you (in English or in French, you choose!)you get to choose a song you'd like me to perform at the album launch (which I'll video and send to you if you can't come in person) PLUS you'll get a home-made darkroom print of a black & white photo of one of some of the album artwork!
ALWAYS WANTED A SONG WRITTEN FOR YOU?
It would be my absolute pleasure to write a song for you or someone who you care about! If you have lyrics that you'd like me to put to music, I can do that. If you need something written from scratch, I can do that too! You'll also get the digital pre-release with lyrics and artwork!
HOUSE CONCERT + YOU CHOOSE MY SET LIST!
Invite me to your house or a friends house to play! And on top of that, you can choose what songs you want me to play ! You'll also get the digital pre-release of with artwork and lyrics. (Note: *If you live outside of Quebec and Ontario we'll need to figure out the transportation and housing side of things, but otherwise just allow a couple month leeway for scheduling. )
PATRON OF THE ARTS
When I say you will have my eternal gratitude, I do mean it.  As a Patron of the Arts you will have your name in the album liner notes along with many many many thanks on all my social network platforms (OR choose to remain anonymous if you prefer...)! You'll also get 10 autographed physical copies of the album to share with your circle or friends.
The Details
Having made 4 of these album things by now, I know that in the end, it's going to cost a minimum of $7,000 to $10,000. I've never aimed to cover all my costs with a crowdfunding campaign before but this time I figured I'd see if we can make it happen together :)
This amount goes into; paying musicians and my co-producer for their time in rehearsals and in studio (to say nothing of the amount of unpaid individual practice time they're putting in!); hiring a sound engineer to record us and renting the studio space; paying a graphic artist to make the case look pretty and legible; mixing and mastering the album (this basically means making sure all the elements on the album can be heard properly and sound their best, PLUS making sure the album meets industry standards and can thus maybe, hopefully get some radio play and reach more people!); printing physical copies of the album (because I know a lot of you still do love having actual cds to play!I sure do...). And of course, that doesn't include any of the promotion once the album has been released, renting a space to do a launch party or paying the musicians for their time on stage if we end up performing the songs live. Phew...
Your support is absolutely essential to making this all happen!
That being said, I've chosen to use the ""flexible funding"" model that Indiegogo offers so that if ever I don't reach my goal of $7,000 I will still make the album happen no matter what! Reaching my goal will of course speed up the process as I won't need to fundraise in other ways, but in either case, the album will get made, and you will get it :)
""What Other Ways Can I Contribute?""
If you would really love to support this project but can't contribute financially, no worries! I have definitely been there :) You can help by sharing this campaign with all your friends and family, and by sharing my music with anyone you think might appreciate it! Thank you for your support in whatever form!
Many many thanks to everyone who has been part of this amazing journey thus far!
Version française
Les chansons ont permis à l'humanité de traverser plusieurs moments sombres de notre histoire... elles t'ont sûrement accompagné à travers plusieurs de tes luttes personnelles ! Mon but en tant qu’artiste est de continuer la tradition des chansons qui nous mènent vers notre vérité, vers la liberté d'être et nous donnent un sentiment d’appartenance, une raison d'être dans ce monde parfois turbulent. Si tu sais déjà que tu veux contribuer à ce projet, vas voir les « perks » et contribue!
Je fais de la musique depuis 15 ans en sachant que l’art est essentiel à la transformation personnelle et globale… Elle nous aide à créer, jour après jour, un monde plus paisible et conscient pour les générations à venir. J'ai fait des tournées à travers le Canada et l'Europe, j’ai autoproduit quatre albums et j’ai eu la chance de faire ma vie comme femme artiste indépendante sans compromettre mes valeurs profondes. À la base, ma musique a toujours été rendue possible par des gens comme toi, qui croient que la musique peut toucher des cœurs et influencer des changements positifs dans le monde.
Dis m’en plus sur cet album!
Les chansons de cet album sont beaucoup plus personnelles que celles d'avant. Pourquoi ? Parce qu'avec le temps, je réalise qu’être moi-même, sans excuse ni compromis, est ma façon d'inspirer les autres à découvrir qui ils sont vraiment. Pour moi, les dernières années m'ont appris à rester authentique tout en acceptant de me rendre plus visible en tant qu’artiste. Ces chansons parlent du pouvoir de la vérité comme outil de transformation. Elles célèbrent la fragilité et la résilience de la Vie et de l'Amour.
L’album va inclure des chansons en anglais, en français et en gaélique irlandais...et quelques surprises en plus ! La revitalisation des langues ancestrales est un point central dans tout mon travail...Pour moi, le contact avec des langues et des cultures autres que la nôtre est la clef pour créer un monde de paix et d'harmonie interculturelle.
Pour ce qui est de la musique, je vais collaborer avec un musicien et réalisateur accompli: Cédric Dind-Lavoie. Nous allons travailler avec Estelle Lavoie à la kora (une harpe de l’Ouest africain) et Anais Constantin au violoncelle. Tu ne peux pas imaginer à quel point j'adore travailler avec ces gens-là, mais je sais qu'en écoutant l’album, tu vas entendre le résultat !
Ma musique est inspirée de ma connexion avec la Terre, c’est pourquoi je compte continuer la tradition d'enregistrer mes albums près de là où j'ai grandi, dans le studio de Pierrot Paradis, dans la région de Lac-Mégantic.
Ça sera fini quand ?
On prévoit de lancer l'album en mars ou avril 2018. Ceux et celles qui participent à sa création recevront la version numérique plusieurs semaines avant tous les autres !
C’est quoi les « Perks »?
Les « Perks » sont une manière de vous redonner quelque chose pour souligner votre appui à mon projet !
PRÉ-ACHAT de l'ALBUM & REMERCIEMENTS !
Reçois l'album numérique avant son lancement officiel, avec les paroles et l'oeuvre artistique de la pochette de l'album, en plus d'un remerciement personnalisé !
LA VRAIE AFFAIRE
L’album physique autographié, envoyé directement chez toi, avec un remerciement personnalisé.
L'ALBUM PLUS...
L’album physique autographié, envoyé directement chez toi, avec un remerciement personnalisé PLUS les textes et les accords de deux chansons tirées de l'album écrite à la main.
LE FAN PACK
L'album physique, un remerciement personnalisé, un poème écrit par moi-même juste pour toi, choix d'une chanson que t'aimerais que je joue au lancement (je vais le filmer et t'envoyer le vidéo si tu peux pas venir en personne) PLUS une photo argentique noir et blanc tirée du livret de l'album fait dans une chambre noire maison !
UNE 'TITE TOUNE JUSTE POUR TOI
Peut-être que personne ne t’a jamais écrit une chanson, ou peut-être t'as quelqu'un de spécial pour qui t'aimerais que j'écrive de quoi. Je peux t'en écrire une au complet ou je peux mettre tes paroles en musique. Plus une copie numérique de l'album incluant les paroles et l'oeuvre artistique de la pochette de l'album, en plus d'un remerciement personnalisé !
CONCERT DE MAISON +
Oui, je viendrai faire un concert dans ta maison ! De plus, tu décides quelles chansons tu veux que je chante! Inclus une copie numérique de l'album accompagnée des paroles et l'oeuvre artistique de la pochette de l'album, en plus d'un remerciement personnalisé !)
MÉCÈNE DES ARTS
Premièrement, t'aurais ma gratitude éternelle. De deux, je t’offre une place dans la pochette de l'album avec ton nom et, si tu désires, ta photo, et cela, sur tous mes réseaux sociaux ! Tu vas aussi recevoir 7 copies de l'album physique pour donner à tes proches.
Les détails
Ayant déjà réalisé quatre albums avant celui-ci, je sais qu'à la fin de tout, ça va couter entre 7000 $ et 10,000 $. Je n'ai jamais tenté de couvrir tous mes frais avec une campagne de socio-financement, mais je crois qu'ensemble, on est capable de le faire !   
Ce montant sera utilisé pour: payer les musiciens et mon co-réalisateur pour leur temps en studio et en répétitions (pour ne pas parler de tout leur temps de pratique personnelle!); engager un ingénieur de son et louer le studio; engager un artiste graphique pour créer la pochette et la rendre belle et lisible; faire le mixage et l'édition des pistes audio (ce qui veut dire s'assurer que tous les éléments de l'enregistrement sonnent le mieux possible ET s'assurer que l'album accote les standards de l'industrie musicale pour qu'il puisse, on l’espère, passer à la radio et rejoindre plus de monde !) ;faire des copies physiques de l'album (parce que je sais qu'il y en a beaucoup d'entre vous qui aime toujours avoir des vrais cd, tout comme moi...). Et bien sûr, tout ça n'inclut pas la promotion de l'album, la location d'un espace pour faire le lancement ni le cachet des musiciens si on décide de faire un spectacle live pour le lancement ! Fiou...
C'est pour ça que vos contributions sont absolument essentielles pour que l’on puisse réaliser tout ça !
Ceci étant dit, j'ai choisi l'option du «financement flexible» offert par Indiegogo afin que même si nous n’atteignons pas notre but, nous puissions tout de même faire avancer l'album ! 
Est ce qu'il y a d'autre manière que je peux contribuer?
Oui! Même si vous pouvez pas contibuer de manière financière au présent, partagez la campagne avec vos amies et votre famille! J'apprécie les contributions de toutes formes :)
Un gros merci à tous les gens qui ont fait partie de mon cheminement à date!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Tű Fokán Művészeti Fesztivál (június 27-július 1.)</h3>
<p>Idén hatodik alkalommal rendeznénk meg ezt a non-profit eseményt, immár másodszor <i>Garábon</i>. A nyitott és dinamikusan fejlődő kis település egy zsákfalu a <i>Nógrád</i> megyei <i>Pásztó </i>közelében.</p>
<p>Mi egy csapat önkéntes vagyunk. A legtöbben anyagi ellenszolgáltatások nélkül, pusztán ételért és szállásért, akár saját anyagi eszközeinket is belerakva hozzuk létre ezt az élményt, amiben hiszünk,</p>
<p>Az összművészeti fesztivál egyik különlegessége, hogy egy település ad neki otthont, melynek tereit öt napon át, az ott élőkkel közösen használhatjuk. Ez segít abban is, hogy megvalósuljon a fesztivál fő célja, hogy párhuzamos valóságok találkozhassanak egymással.</p>
<p>Felejtsük el a <i>státuszt</i> és dolgozzunk <i>ritmusokkal</i>! Találjuk meg ebben a térben idén is azt a közös ritmust, amit élvezhetünk! Lépjünk ki a félelemnek abból a légköréből, ami ma körülöttünk van, együtt egy szerethető fesztivál keretein belül, rengeteg apró dialógust teremtve!</p>

<li>Ezen kívül több izgalmas magyar fellépő lesz a fő színpadon, különböző alternatív közegekből.  Fellép többek között a <strong>""Kampec Dolores""</strong> és a <strong>""Nunki Bay Starship""</strong>. A Közös térben a délután során izgalmas fél-akusztikus, meditatív és kísérletező produkciókat láthatunk.  Mesemondás és lakásszínház is lesz idén.Esténként pedig egyszemélyes akusztikus programokat hallhatunk a természetben, fáklyafénynél.</li>

<p>Hi friends/family/fans/lovers/dreamers,</p>
<p>You know us as Sub-Radio, an independent pop band that's been playing the DC area for years and has earned a reputation as one of the most high-energy shows in the city. We're also six friends who have been chasing the dream of being a ""real band"" since high school -- and we need your help.</p>
<p>In 2019, we'll be recording our second EP in Los Angeles with Dylan Bauld of Flor -- a really talented producer who really understands our sound. We've never had a clearer vision of our sound and style and we think these are some of the best songs we've ever written. This EP is going to be fun, expressive, exciting, and colorful. We're also in the process of booking dozens of dates across the country to support the release.</p>
<p>As a truly independent band, there are so many hurdles to success -- and a big one is money. Our community of fans and friends has gotten us this far, and we're asking for your help to push us over the top in 2019.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Specifically, we need to raise $15,000 to support all our activities this year. That includes recording, mixing, and mastering our entire EP (~$10,000); producing a music video for a single off the EP (~$4,000); and supporting ourselves and covering basic costs during a tour later in the year. Even if we hit that goal, we'll still be digging into our own pockets throughout the year. </p>
<p>Needless to say, we can't do this on our own. So your help is critical in helping us achieve this dream.</p>

My name is Jacob Zachary.</b> <div>
<br/><div>I live in Memphis, TN with my beautiful wife Aimee and two darlin' kids Iley &amp; Ezra. I've been writing and performing music for over 15 years now. I recorded some things in my infancy as a singer/songwriter, got to tour a bit along the way, and grew up alongside a community of some of the greatest artists I've ever had the privilege of knowing while living in Baton Rouge, LA.  Within the last few years, I feel like I've made my best music, and I think it's time to prove this claim with something everyone can hear, see, and touch. I am looking into 2015 with the hopes of making my first record in over ten years, but I need your help!<br/><br/><b>I'll get right to it...</b>
</div>
<div>I need a minimum of about <b>$5000</b> to make this record. Unfortunately, that's a whole lot more than I've ever been able to save on my own, which is about $17. Obviously, I need to be able to shoot a little higher to reach my goal of <b>$5000</b>, so I've partnered with Indiegogo in the hopes that through the wonderful exchange of your pledges for my meager incentives, we can work together to help bring these songs from my six little strings and a can straight to your pretty little ears. </div>
<div>   The most exciting part of this project for us is that we are making this record at the legendary Sun Studio here in Memphis, TN - the place where artists such as Elvis, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis got their start. Here's a short video documenting the history of this special space. </div>
<div></div>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FSalq2Xl5YrI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSalq2Xl5YrI%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FSalq2Xl5YrI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><div>
<br/><b> My only risk is not reaching my goal.</b>
</div>
<div> The good news there is that Indiegogo will let me keep your pledges and let you keep your incentives either way. Should I not reach my goal, either a smaller project will be considered, or production on the intended record will just have to be delayed until the rest of the funds can be raised by another means.

</div></div>","***UPDATE*** Well, never too late I guess (2 months later) WE DID IT! CONGRATULATIONS CONTRIBUTORS! You successfully pushed a campaign well passed it's goal. There is some new bittersweet news to report however ... CHECK OUT MY BLOG. CLICK HERE! ALSO, you can still listen to live bootleg tracks from my FUNDRAISER CAMPAIGN AWARENESS SHOW @ CHELSEA'S in BATON ROUGE, LA from back in DECEMBER. CLICK HERE!**************************************************************************** Hello All, and Happy New Year! My name is Jacob Zachary. 
I live in Memphis, TN with my beautiful wife Aimee and two darlin' kids Iley & Ezra. I've been writing and performing music for over 15 years now. I recorded some things in my infancy as a singer/songwriter, got to tour a bit along the way, and grew up alongside a community of some of the greatest artists I've ever had the privilege of knowing while living in Baton Rouge, LA.  Within the last few years, I feel like I've made my best music, and I think it's time to prove this claim with something everyone can hear, see, and touch. I am looking into 2015 with the hopes of making my first record in over ten years, but I need your help!I'll get right to it...

I need a minimum of about $5000 to make this record. Unfortunately, that's a whole lot more than I've ever been able to save on my own, which is about $17. Obviously, I need to be able to shoot a little higher to reach my goal of $5000, so I've partnered with Indiegogo in the hopes that through the wonderful exchange of your pledges for my meager incentives, we can work together to help bring these songs from my six little strings and a can straight to your pretty little ears. 
   The most exciting part of this project for us is that we are making this record at the legendary Sun Studio here in Memphis, TN - the place where artists such as Elvis, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis got their start. Here's a short video documenting the history of this special space. 


 My only risk is not reaching my goal.

 The good news there is that Indiegogo will let me keep your pledges and let you keep your incentives either way. Should I not reach my goal, either a smaller project will be considered, or production on the intended record will just have to be delayed until the rest of the funds can be raised by another means. The better news is that there's no such thing as over-reaching my goal either. Should I happen to find 1 or 5,001 of you in the most charitable mood of your lives, exceeding my goal is obviously the greatest possible outcome of this campaign, and here's why:The budget for making a record is not considering of just 2 or 3 things as you might think. There are a great many expenses throughout three phases of production (pre, pro, and post). For a minimum of $5000 I will be able to hire a producer and book the time I need for me and 9 other players to record about 10 songs in a short span of a few days.

Let's make a GREAT record!

I've made three records, including one with my former band, The Divorcees. That album won an East Coast Music Award in 2008 for Country Album of the Year. I've toured across Canada twice and played to crowds of over 15,000 people.

<p><strong>THE NEW RECORD</strong></p>
<p>This album is a new musical path for me, and one of the most exciting steps I have ever taken in my career as a songwriter. In collaboration with my writing partner, Helena Berlin, I’ve written over 20 songs for this record. I’m currently paring this material down to ten songs that best evoke the themes of this record: passion, fear, violence and longing.</p>
<p><span>With ballads ranging from a man's haunted past to settlers fleeing a barren wilderness, this album explores the murder ballad tradition, pushing it beyond its archetypical borders. This album will, at times, walk in step with country music as well. It will tell stories and use some traditional instruments and chord structures. It will also attempt to defy those familiar traditions.</span><br/></p>
<p><span>It is important that this campaign succeeds so that I can enlist Dale Murray, a dear friend and award-winning producer, to help realize the sonic vision for this record. This past winter, I sat with Dale and played him the first rough demos for this record. He was enthusiastic about helping me find the right sounds and atmospheres for this album so that I can tell these stories.  Dale is a talented multi-instrumentalist and the winner of 2009 Music Nova Scotia Award's Producer of the Year. He also took home Musician of the Year. Most recently he won the 2012 Music Nova Scotia Award for Country/Bluegrass Recording of the Year for his album Dream Mountain Dream, and the 2012 East Coast Music Award for Audio Professional of the Year.</span><br/></p>

If you are generous enough to contribute to my campaign, this will help pay not only for Dale Murray's production and mixing expertise and the mastering costs, but also for the talented musicians who will help me bring this album to life. This is a costly undertaking, but with your help, the money raised will ensure this album's ghosts and haunted souls will resonate with listeners who share an affinity with stories from life's darker side. If we are fortunate enough to attain more funds than the projected goal, that money will be used to manufacture CDs and to hire a promotional company to ensure that the album gets the exposure it needs.</p><p><span>On the right hand side of this page, you will see Perks and Incentives that I will be offering in return for your generous donations.</span><br/></p><div>

This campaign is to raise funds to maintain the operations of hipfresh.  hipfresh is an entertainment and artistic news website dedicated to documenting what's hip and fresh in music, art, and culture.  hipfresh has been in existence for 2 years, providing interviews, stories, videos, and concerts featuring famed artists such as Talib Kweli and DJ Hi-Tek, Monie Love, Tech N9ne and Krizz Kaliko, Gamble and Huff, Georgia Anne Muldrow, Dudley Perkins, and Camp Lo.
hipfresh is an outlet for independent artists to showcase their art to the world.  We do not charge artists to have their music or content posted on the site. Any videos that we film of the artists (hipfresh Chronicles, the 7D Sessions, hipfresh Shorts, etc.) are all done free of charge. Although, the content is free, the writers who create the content are financially compensated for each article, video, review, etc.  Therefore, it is imperative that hipfresh receives as much support as possible from supporters like you.  Your contribution goes directly towards paying our writers and videographers, and funding hipfresh events.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>We are a determined 5 piece Rhythm &amp; Blues band from Hamilton, Ontario Canada. We love traveling around playing festivals, private functions, and venues and sharing the classic Rhythm &amp; Blues sound!</p>
<p>Andre Bisson the frontman, guitar player, writer, and arranger of the band started this band while in college so that he could play his favourite classic 60's &amp; 70's Rhythm &amp; Blues songs along side other musicians just like him. He has made 3 CD's, with his originals on ""Rhythm &amp; Blues Experience"" (2009) which was nominated for ""Blues Recording of the Year"" for the Hamilton Music Awards. ""Rhythm &amp; Blues Christmas"" (2010) which is a collection of Christmas songs in the style of R&amp;B, Swing, Funk, and Soul. ""Beyond the Covers"" (2011) is a collection of great songs by the Beatles, CCR, The Temptations, and more, arranged by Andre Bisson. He is now working on 2 more CD projects for another cover CD and a Blues CD of his originals to be released in 2012.</p>
<p>The band members are all graduates of Mohawk College for the Applied Music program and exceptional musicians here in Ontario. Our tenor saxophone player Francis Smith is still continuing his education at University of Toronto for a Music Degree, and our drummer Matt Burns and bass player Brad Cheeseman are continuing at Humber College in Toronto for their Music Degrees. Our trumpet player Loretta Hale continues study the music business, teach, and perform. </p>
<p>The UK and Ireland have always been a dream for our band, to perform in Festivals and the many blues venues overseas to make new friends and spread our Canadian touch to another continent! We hope this will be our 1st of many tours overseas.</p>
<p><strong><em>We will be going to the UK August 13-23, 2012 to perform for the Bentworth Blues Festival in Bentworth, Hampshire UK, The Sunflowerfest in Hillsborough, Lisburn (Northern Ireland), Cardiff, Wales UK at the Blue Dragon Club, the Worcester Beer, Cider &amp; Perry Festival, Worcester, Worcestershire UK as well as other venues across the UK.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>We are also going to Ireland from September 7-9, 2012 for the Harvest Time Blues Festival in Monaghan, Ireland! <a href=""http://www.harvestblues.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.harvestblues.com/</a></em></strong></p>

This would give us the amazing opportunity to give this band a great beginning to tour extensively and bring our music to everyone that has supported us. We would like to share Andre's music to as many Rhythm &amp; Blues lovers possible!</p>

I want my music to remain untainted and your donations keep the pure fun, excitement, and love in my music. No one wants to be told how to live their life or accomplish their dreams. This is a way for me to do everything I want with this album without a label, or a manager, or a stylist dictating my choices. Imagine how freeing that is!!!!
Other Ways You Can Help
Sometimes you just don’t have it and that’s fine by me. There are other ways you can help me!!!!

Spread the word about me, my music, and my campaign. (I mean really spam the hell out of people)

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p> Hello, my name is Joseph Thomas - When on stage I usually go by Assasin or Poetic Assasin.  Over the past two years I have been working on four different CDs, working on concepts, scraping ideas, listening to instrumentals, and overall making sure that I didn't rush the process of creating quality material. I still like physical CDs, I know there are people that prefer to get it over the computer, so that option will be available too. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>First of all, if you’re reading this – thank you for stopping by and checking out what I’m up to!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About Myself and The Album</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For those who don’t know me, I am a singer-songwriter from Baltimore, Maryland. I’ve been performing since I was about 2 years old and have been recording, touring and writing music pretty much all my life. Besides touring across the US, I was a finalist on Season 4 of the NBC show America's Got Talent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m starting to record my third studio album this Summer. I’ve been working on writing, pre production and funding for the album for a while now and the time has finally come to hit the studio!  I’m really excited for everyone to hear the new album!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why I’m Doing This &amp; What’s In It For You</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Basically, the costs of making a professionally done studio album can be extremely expensive – and coming up with the funds as a touring musician can be quite difficult. Paying for the studio, mixing, mastering, producer, artwork, musicians, travel, etc can cost a fortune! The amount I’m shooting for desnt cover all  of the cost but is a huge step in the right direction… But every little bit helps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, by donating to a level of the campaign, you will get the record before ANYONE else, you will also get very cool and unique perks that only supporters like yourself will have access to. You will allow this record to happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you so much for all of your support,</p>

<p><br/><strong>THE REAL DEAL</strong>: the last three Sweatstocks were put on with funds from our 2009 Knight Arts Challenge grant and support from a beer company.  Our Knight funding period for that is over and the beer company ain't around this year.</p>

<h3>Freedom Rockers,</h3>
<p>What's up everyone???  I am Andrea, an inspirational freedom rocker who brings music to spiritual venues.  Originally, I grew up in Kentucky with horses and mint juleps....not that I drank them. hahahhahahah</p>
<p>I am so super excited to announce that I am going into the studio again! Whooooooooooo hoooooooooooo!  Here's the deal:  My vision of transformation, love and freedom has guided me to write a new series of songs.  These new songs  have a hip hop influence!  I have been writing music for years and it has usually been rock n roll. Rock on!  Now, I am expanding into the world of beats.  This is way outside of my box and it pushes my creativity in a beautiful new way. I love the freshness of the beats and it sharpens my edge. It's such a great way to reach the next generation and inspire towards spiritual principles.</p>
<p>Here's where you come in. I can't do it alone.  In the past, I have spent so much money on recording that I could hardly pay for daily living expenses. I'm sure some of you understand the incredible expense involved in studio time, musicians, mastering, and replicating  CDS (not to mention artwork and hours of rehearsing).  That's why musicians have chased the infamous 'record deal' , in hopes of having funds to do their CD the way they want.  Yet the record deal is a hefty loan from labels that the musician is required to pay back.   WELL, let's move up to 2013 where indie artists are doing it with their fans' and friends' help. Yeah!! This means so much to me that I am ready to levitate! ahahahha Yes and I want you to do it with me!! I even want to write a song with you.  There is a special perk offered where we can write a song together. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!</p>
<p>Additionally, a percentage of funds raised will be given to Rickie Byars-Beckwith's winter/summer arts school for children.  The Kuumba Arts camp is a mobile creative experience for youth and their families.  Visit Kuumbainmotion.org Let's help kids to learn music, math and movement in a creative way that actually WORKS! Are you in?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this far! You will see perks along the side of this page where you can be a part of my dream.  Any amount is greatly appreciated. xoxoxoxo Let's rock out together in a funky way! HA!</p>
<p>Here's where the funds go:</p>
<p>recording </p>
<p>musicians  </p>
<p>mixing, mastering</p>
<p>replicating the cd </p>
<p>artwork  </p>
<p>marketing and promotions</p>
<p>donation to Kuumba School for children- % of amount raised</p>
<p><strong>You may also mail a check to</strong> : PO BOX 3821 Redondo Beach, CA 90277</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This will be an EP or short CD.</p>
<p>If you are inspired to help out by promoting:  you can share this page on  Facebook or your twitter account. I appreciate any help or promo you are able to give!! Rock on Freedom Fighters!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This campaign runs from the 1st day of spring until DERBY DAY May 4, 2013. This is an all or nothing campaign. No funds will be taken unless the financial goal is met.</p>

Here's where you come in. I can't do it alone.  In the past, I have spent so much money on recording that I could hardly pay for daily living expenses. I'm sure some of you understand the incredible expense involved in studio time, musicians, mastering, and replicating  CDS (not to mention artwork and hours of rehearsing).  That's why musicians have chased the infamous 'record deal' , in hopes of having funds to do their CD the way they want.  Yet the record deal is a hefty loan from labels that the musician is required to pay back.   WELL, let's move up to 2013 where indie artists are doing it with their fans' and friends' help. Yeah!! This means so much to me that I am ready to levitate! ahahahha Yes and I want you to do it with me!! I even want to write a song with you.  There is a special perk offered where we can write a song together. WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
Additionally, a percentage of funds raised will be given to Rickie Byars-Beckwith's winter/summer arts school for children.  The Kuumba Arts camp is a mobile creative experience for youth and their families.  Visit Kuumbainmotion.org Let's help kids to learn music, math and movement in a creative way that actually WORKS! Are you in?
Thanks for reading this far! You will see perks along the side of this page where you can be a part of my dream.  Any amount is greatly appreciated. xoxoxoxo Let's rock out together in a funky way! HA!
Here's where the funds go:
recording 
musicians  
mixing, mastering
replicating the cd 
artwork  
marketing and promotions
donation to Kuumba School for children- % of amount raised
You may also mail a check to : PO BOX 3821 Redondo Beach, CA 90277
 
This will be an EP or short CD.
If you are inspired to help out by promoting:  you can share this page on  Facebook or your twitter account. I appreciate any help or promo you are able to give!! Rock on Freedom Fighters!

<p><strong>About Lisa Bell</strong></p>
<p>I am a <a href=""http://www.lisabellmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>singer-songwriter</strong> </a>based in Boulder, Colorado and I know that music can can make the world a better place. For the past 11 years, I have been writing and performing music that makes a difference through positive, empowering lyrics at venues throughout Colorado and most recently, across the country and internationally. I have co-produced all of my CD projects and have had the opportunity to work with some outstanding musicians along the way.</p>
<p>My new CD, “The Italian Project,” will be the product of a beautiful dream come true; one that embodies love, hope, and the overriding positive message that we can truly achieve anything we set our minds to. The songs speak of hope and getting past the fear in order to move forward and become the best person we can be. For this project, I have assembled an uber talented “virtual” band of musicians from Colorado and Italy for what will be our most amazing sound yet.</p>
<p>This will be my fourth CD and the first transatlantic project that includes collaboration with my new friends and immensely talented musical colleagues in Italy. Along with <a href=""http://www.hippietendencies.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lisa Simmons</a> in Italy and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BobjStory?ref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bob Story</a> here in Boulder, we have been writing songs via Skype for the past year and a half. Throughout the writing process, we used a theme of positive messages and beautiful stories of change, manifestation and empowerment. Some of the songs are uplifting. Others share important stories such as the challenges of homelessness, racism and our societal fears. All are designed to make the listener take heart and take action.</p>

<p>I am The Crooked Cowboy, leader of the project. I began C.C. 13 years ago with the clear intention to focus on Intercontinental Western Music from the 50's, 60's &amp; 70's including soundtracks, songwriters, experimental artists, jazz and orchestral; everything having to do with Western Music, and to reach a vast audience thru classic recording techniques derived from those very eras. So far, it's working. I just released our debut album on Neurotic Yell Records and the response has been overwhelming. This funding is to go towards our Sophomore effort, to be released either by NYR or another company, which I am not short on offers for.</p>
<p>Through the travels of recording and performing much over the years, I have learned so much from so many different people.  It has made a solid foundation for me to share my knowledge and teach up and coming writers, producers and recording artists, and has also made for enormous payoffs for the sacrifices I have made over the years to pursue excellence in the crafts I have chosen. Each and every person and experience in life ends up in a song. A true song catcher knows this and allows themselves to take it all in. All of it! All of my compositions are written with somebody in mind, or multiple persons in one song.</p>
<p>Earlier this year I suffered a massive heart attack and I have vowed to myself and to my friends to release this music I have written, for those very people I speak of. By contributing, you become a part of the record as well. I have always been about community efforts when it comes to music, which is why I once led a 37 piece orchestra to a live show in east Los Angeles: to bring people together through the power of music.</p>
<p>Above is a video from our last live show here in Los Angeles on November 3, 2012 at the Overpass. There are many videos on You Tube, Vimeo and Tumblr that wouldn't all fit on this page, but if you google Crooked Cowboy &amp; The Freshwater Indians you will get pages full of years of hard work. Any questions you have please feel free to ask, just message me. I love talking about music, art and film. I'm sure I will end up meeting many of you as travel is in the works, and we will be traveling to promote this very album. We can take that video you just watched and rock any town we venture into. Wish us luck on this new fundraising journey , and power to positve music!

<b><i>About my campaign and why it’s important to me:</i></b> </h4>Well, friends, I'm excited to create this next project, and I am looking for your collaboration and support. It takes an abundance of resources to create a high-level music project.<br/>This
 recording project is totally devoted to the Bhakti crowd - lovers of 
chanting to the divine. My writing style isn't pure kirtan - I create hybrid tunes of mantra and English lyrics that relate to
 the concept of the chant. People love hearing these chant tunes at yoga classes and kirtans. I am honored to share my 
inspirations with others and  humbled by how many people are moved by my music.<br/><br/>In case you are not familiar with my work, you can listen to some samples of my previous projects here: <a href=""http://vibedeck.com/jimbeckwith/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jim Beckwith music</a><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/457563/files/20140324194101-Lovelution-art_thumb.jpg?1395715261"" src="""" style=""width: 227px; height: 227px;""/></p><h4><b><i> </i></b></h4><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h4><b><i>What contributors will help me achieve:</i></b></h4><p></p><p>I want to create a new offering on par with the other well-known artists in the genre of kirtan and chanting. I know many of those artists and have played with most of them, 
including Jai Uttal, Bhagavan Das, Saul David Raye, David Newman, Dave Stringer,
Girish, Brenda McMorrow, Govindas and Radha, C.C. White, Shantala, DJ 
Drez and Sean Johnson and the Wild Lotus Band. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/457523/files/20140324192000-14644_350328820371_350320895371_10287405_5440483_n.jpg?1395714000"" src="""" style=""width: 395.112px; height: 267px;""/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact - &amp; What You Get!<br/>
</h3><p>Your contribution will get you some fabulous <b>perks!</b>
 These range from in-progress mixes, to CDs sent to you before anyone 
else hears them, to me flying to your town to give a concert in 
your house or studio. It will also help me continue to inspire a lot of people with these new great songs. <br/></p><p>As I travel to different 
places and share my music with others, so many people tell me how much 
they continue to listen to my music and how much it inspires them daily.
 Nothing could make me happier than to hear that. I am certain that this
 group of song chants is my best work to date, and I can't wait to get 
it out! Thanks so much in advance for your support and belief in what I 
do. It's so great to bring something into the world that inspires and 
heals. I feel so lucky and blessed to do what I do. Jai Ma! Jai Hanuman!
 Jai Sri Lakshmi!</p><p><br/></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What it Takes to Make it Happen</h3><p>I have
 already begun work on the project and have been investing my personal 
funds, as well as some good-faith extensions in time to pay for my 
services (studio and musicians). I have recorded my guide 
tracks and then taken it to the high-end studio and recorded all the 
fabulous bass and drums with my friends David Watts and Matthew
 Hufschmidt, as well as harp on on one sweet tune with Jennifer Sparks. 
Looks like there will be 9 tracks, maybe 10.</p><p>Here's the estimate:<br/></p><p>• Studio Recording at high-end studio - $3k - 46 hours @$65/hr<br/>• Recording and Mixing at home studio - $3k - many hours<br/>• Studio Musician Fees - $2k<br/>• Mastering - $1k<br/>• graphic design and photography - $700<br/>• Replication - 2000 CDs - plus shipping $2.3k<br/><b><br/>If I raise $12k, I only get $11,160.

<b>History of Jim Beckwith's Music for Yoga</b>: </h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/457552/files/20140324193140-with_Janet_Stone_big_crowd.jpg?1395714700"" src="""" style=""width: 457.5px; height: 305px;""/></p><b>I've been specializing in making music for the yoga crowd for abut seven years</b> and have focused on developing techniques and musical material for it full-time since then. I've played with many of the nation's top teachers, including Shiva Rea, Saul David Raye, Seane Corn, Desiree Rumbaugh, Dana Flynn, Hemalayaa Behl, Kia Miller and Tommy Rosen. I have also been leading kirtan at various venues including the infamous Bhakti Shala in Santa Monica. I have played various festivals, including my own very successful set last year at Bhakti Fest with an invitation for this fall as well! Quite a few Yoga Journal Conferences under my belt as well!<br/><br/><b>I have been a music producer for 20+ years</b>, making music products for 
artists and commercial TV and film projects, all the while keeping up 
with the tools and technology to make great sounding products. Before 
stepping out to create my own dream creation of making music for yoga 
and singing more in the world, I finished a whole lot of projects for 
others. I've been a singer/songwriter for many years. I have 6 CDs available to date, but none that address the genre of kirtan chanting fully. This is the next step in my evolution of making 
music for yoga. <br/><br/>Somehow I have some magic in this voice and I'm so grateful to be able to share it. It is a gift. I never forget that and I also realize it doesn't last forever - one reason I want to capture it and share as much as possible. Name drop: I sat with Placido Domingo, Jr. a few years ago to listen to a bit of my music and he said ""Your voice is like - a refined 'Sting'"". It is really nice to have our talents acknowledged :)<br/><br/><h3><b>About Jim: </b></h3><p><b>Jim Beckwith</b> (Hanuman Das) is an accomplished musician, songwriter 
and teacher. His love of music and yoga inspired him to focus on 
bringing live music to yoga classes. Jim's music is soulful and 
evocative of healing and inner awakening. He mixes mantra chants and 
English lyrics with a melodic and accessible tapestry of sound, exotic 
instrumentation and undulating rhythms. A compelling lyricist with a

Read it here:CROWDFUND THIS! ‘Sound Colorist’ Jim Beckwith’s Debut Chant CD Fuses Kirtan With Original Lyrics (Interview, Photos)
About my campaign and why it’s important to me: Well, friends, I'm excited to create this next project, and I am looking for your collaboration and support. It takes an abundance of resources to create a high-level music project.This
 recording project is totally devoted to the Bhakti crowd - lovers of 
chanting to the divine. My writing style isn't pure kirtan - I create hybrid tunes of mantra and English lyrics that relate to
 the concept of the chant. People love hearing these chant tunes at yoga classes and kirtans. I am honored to share my 
inspirations with others and  humbled by how many people are moved by my music.In case you are not familiar with my work, you can listen to some samples of my previous projects here: Jim Beckwith music What contributors will help me achieve:I want to create a new offering on par with the other well-known artists in the genre of kirtan and chanting. I know many of those artists and have played with most of them, 
including Jai Uttal, Bhagavan Das, Saul David Raye, David Newman, Dave Stringer,
Girish, Brenda McMorrow, Govindas and Radha, C.C. White, Shantala, DJ 
Drez and Sean Johnson and the Wild Lotus Band. The Impact - & What You Get!
Your contribution will get you some fabulous perks!
 These range from in-progress mixes, to CDs sent to you before anyone 
else hears them, to me flying to your town to give a concert in 
your house or studio. It will also help me continue to inspire a lot of people with these new great songs. As I travel to different 
places and share my music with others, so many people tell me how much 
they continue to listen to my music and how much it inspires them daily.
 Nothing could make me happier than to hear that. I am certain that this
 group of song chants is my best work to date, and I can't wait to get 
it out! Thanks so much in advance for your support and belief in what I 
do. It's so great to bring something into the world that inspires and 
heals. I feel so lucky and blessed to do what I do. Jai Ma! Jai Hanuman!
 Jai Sri Lakshmi!What We Need & What it Takes to Make it HappenI have
 already begun work on the project and have been investing my personal 
funds, as well as some good-faith extensions in time to pay for my 
services (studio and musicians). I have recorded my guide 
tracks and then taken it to the high-end studio and recorded all the 
fabulous bass and drums with my friends David Watts and Matthew
 Hufschmidt, as well as harp on on one sweet tune with Jennifer Sparks. 
Looks like there will be 9 tracks, maybe 10.Here's the estimate:• Studio Recording at high-end studio - $3k - 46 hours @$65/hr• Recording and Mixing at home studio - $3k - many hours• Studio Musician Fees - $2k• Mastering - $1k• graphic design and photography - $700• Replication - 2000 CDs - plus shipping $2.3kIf I raise $12k, I only get $11,160. Fundraising isn't free, so I really would like to get above the goal. Let's go! Thank you ALL!
History of Jim Beckwith's Music for Yoga: I've been specializing in making music for the yoga crowd for abut seven years and have focused on developing techniques and musical material for it full-time since then. I've played with many of the nation's top teachers, including Shiva Rea, Saul David Raye, Seane Corn, Desiree Rumbaugh, Dana Flynn, Hemalayaa Behl, Kia Miller and Tommy Rosen. I have also been leading kirtan at various venues including the infamous Bhakti Shala in Santa Monica. I have played various festivals, including my own very successful set last year at Bhakti Fest with an invitation for this fall as well! Quite a few Yoga Journal Conferences under my belt as well!I have been a music producer for 20+ years, making music products for 
artists and commercial TV and film projects, all the while keeping up 
with the tools and technology to make great sounding products. Before 
stepping out to create my own dream creation of making music for yoga 
and singing more in the world, I finished a whole lot of projects for 
others. I've been a singer/songwriter for many years. I have 6 CDs available to date, but none that address the genre of kirtan chanting fully. This is the next step in my evolution of making 
music for yoga. Somehow I have some magic in this voice and I'm so grateful to be able to share it. It is a gift. I never forget that and I also realize it doesn't last forever - one reason I want to capture it and share as much as possible. Name drop: I sat with Placido Domingo, Jr. a few years ago to listen to a bit of my music and he said ""Your voice is like - a refined 'Sting'"". It is really nice to have our talents acknowledged :)About Jim: Jim Beckwith (Hanuman Das) is an accomplished musician, songwriter 
and teacher. His love of music and yoga inspired him to focus on 
bringing live music to yoga classes. Jim's music is soulful and 
evocative of healing and inner awakening. He mixes mantra chants and 
English lyrics with a melodic and accessible tapestry of sound, exotic 
instrumentation and undulating rhythms. A compelling lyricist with a 
voice that soars from high to low with the greatest of ease, Jim is a 
devoted yogi and musician who focuses on Bhakti - the great yoga of the 
heart. ""Jim Beckwith is a sound healer and shaman. He opens 
healing doors with his beautiful voice and array of musical talents. He 
can cover such a wide range through his music that it's always inspiring
 and great fun to play with him. I highly recommend Jim's soulful music,
 voice and vibe with all those seeking healing conscious music."" ~ Saul David Raye, Yoga TeacherOther Ways You Can Help - Post it!

<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>    Hello, my name is Chas Helge, and I am a Doctor of Musical Arts Degree Cello Performance student at the University of Oklahoma. On behalf of myself and the 25 consortium cellists who have already committed to the commission of this cello concerto, we thank you for your support.</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>    For my last degree recital at OU, I have commissioned a new cello concerto by composer Gene Knific. This piece is brand new multi-movement work scored for solo cellist and string chamber orchestra (2 vn1, 2vn2, 2va, 2vc, and 1db) and will be premiered in fall of 2017 at the University of Oklahoma. </span><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The commission is funded by consortium. I have given $500 of my own funds and each cellist has </span>pledged<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> at least $25 individually. Additionally,</span></font> all the cellists have signed on with the intent of learning, performing, and/or teaching the concerto in the future.</p>
<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>    This model of consortium and crowdsourcing a cello concerto for string chamber orchestra accomplishes three objectives:</p>
<p>  First, it reduces overhead costs by using chamber string orchestra. More cellists can put together an ensemble of this size with ease. This also makes the group more flexible and nimble. We can bring a concerto like this to non-traditional venues more easily than a full orchestra and with more impact than a soloist or quartet. </p>
<p>   Secondly, it greatly amplifies the impact of the new work. Rather than having an isolated event (the premier), one performance replicates into many performances. Additionally, teachers can give it and teach it to their students. Thus, we are also building a larger network of stakeholders, performers, and audience members than could be connected by one cellist.</p>
<p>  Thirdly, if we can prove that this can be done with a concerto, then why not genres of our repertoire? We want to turn the most logistically challenging, technically difficult, and artistically ambitious genre of our repertoire into a powerful and flexible tool for as many cellists as possible to use. We hope that other artists will apply and build up our model to commission their own works.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>    We need at least $1,100 to fund our premier ($1,000 plus $100 for Indiegogo processing fees). That's a $100 honorarium for each musician of the orchestra and the conductor. If we raise more than our goal, we can schedule another rehearsal and/or increase the individual pay of the musicians.</p>
<p>    By investing in our project, either the commission or premier, you will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1, $5...     Our Eternal Gratitude</li>
<li>Level 2, $10...  MP3 Recordings of the Premier (+ Level 1 Reward)</li>
<li>Level 3, $25...  Commission Credit in Solo Part and Score (+ Level 1, 2 Rewards)</li>
<li>Level 4, $50...  Video Recording of the Premier  (+ Level 1, 2, &amp; 3 Rewards)</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Consortium</h3>
<p>    We are honored to have assembled such a diverse and international collection of students, teachers, performers, composers, arrangers, conductors, and academics. By supporting project, you help to bring this music, not only to the audience of the premier, but future audiences across the nation and globe. </p>

<p>7th Street Big Band was conceived in the depths of East San Jose by our drummer and fearless leader, Gabby Horlick. Gabby had always dreamed of starting a big band, and in 2013, she was finally able to to make it a reality. It’s been a difficult journey, but four years later, we’re still going strong—and still rehearsing in Gabby’s living room.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve had time to establish ourselves, it’s time to take our next big step: recording an album. Our debut album, “Off Cinderella Lane,” will feature entirely new compositions and arrangements written and performed by young, up-and-coming musicians. We’re not your grandparents’ big band—we’re bringing some of the hippest beats and rhythms to the table, and we’re ready to get funky.</p>
<h3><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491883482/mk8dtvktfrg15jkwvdnz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></h3>
<h3>
<br/><strong>The Music</strong>
</h3>
<p>Our band is incredibly tight-knit. We’re not just colleagues; we’re close friends, and those friendships are what brought many of us to join this band in the first place. We know from experience that making music with people you know and trust is not only more fun, it results in better music.</p>
<p>We’re also a very diverse band. We have many members who are people of color and/or children of immigrants. Additionally, while women continue to be underrepresented in jazz, we are proud to be led by a woman, and we have five women members total. We believe that when certain groups of people are left out or left behind, their potential artistic contributions are lost, and both performers and listeners suffer. We are proud to represent the many ways one can be “American” while coming together to play America’s original musical genre—jazz.</p>
<p>While we are proud of jazz’s American heritage, we also believe that it’s a living art form which continues to evolve. “Off Cinderella Lane” will feature original compositions written by seven different band members, each with their own unique style and perspective. There will be some swing tunes, but this is not an album of straight-ahead jazz. Our composers draw on a variety of influences and incorporate styles ranging from hip-hop to reggae.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491883751/u6rsslnffwwt1mchz15l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>The Budget</strong></h3>
<p>Our total budget is $8,000. Here’s what that will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio Time: This October, we will be spending three full days at 25th Street Recording in Oakland, CA.</li>
<li>Mixing &amp; Mastering: Once we’re done recording, we’ll need an audio engineer to make sure everything sounds just right. (No auto-tune, we promise!)</li>
<li>Promotion: There’s no point to making an album if we can’t share it with our awesome fans! This includes promotional videos, advertising, and the cost of producing posters and T-shirts.</li>
<li>Artwork: The amazing artist Ellen Hoffman has painted our album artwork, which features everyone in the band. We’re happy to have such a personalized look and feel to the album, and excited for the opportunity to showcase such a talented artist.</li>
<li>Duplication: The CDs aren’t going to print themselves!</li>

<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Overall, our band members are pretty young. Many of us are still in college. We think of this as an asset, because it means we have a fresh perspective and room to grow. But, there are also downsides. We don’t have the money or resources that come with age and a more established career. This makes embarking on a big project like this risky and a little scary. But it’s a risk we feel compelled to take, because we truly believe in this band and this album.</p>
<p>Over the past few years, we’ve overcome a lot of hurdles. A big band is…well, big! There are twenty of us all together. Communicating, planning rehearsals, and scheduling gigs can be a bit like herding cats. Even finding a rehearsal space is a challenge. Four years in, we still rehearse in Gabby’s living room!</p>
<p>Finding paying gigs for a group of twenty people can seem nearly impossible. This band is not a full-time job for any of us. We all have many other obligations: day jobs, school, and other musical endeavors. This is truly a labor of love.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Broke like no joke? Want to advocate the sound, but still need to support yourself? We get it. It only takes a click or two to spread the word like the spread on your mama’s deli sandwiches. And remember, every little bit helps. We appreciate your love in any form, and celebrate that you love us hooligans in the first place. Also, don’t forget to follow us on social media to hear about our upcoming events and other antics straight from the source.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Laura. A singer, musician and songwriter. I've been working on my debut solo album and it's nearly finished! But I need your help to wrap it up and get it out there. I've released music before with <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lakimeramusic/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">laki mera</a> and God's Boyfriend but this will be my first outing as a solo artist. I've been working hard and I'm so excited to finally let people hear it and with your help we can make that happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How's it going to sound...?</h3>
<p>I believe there are some people out there who will love this album (even if I do say so myself)! Sound wise there are a lot of similarities with <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86MFU7IG3NA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">laki mera</a> and I know the sound quality of the finished product will be top notch 'cause I've got co-producer <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/andreagobbimusicproduction/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Andrea Gobbi</a> on the case! </p>

<h3>The Money Stuff</h3>
<p>Up to this point I've self funded all the recording - it's taken a couple of years. This has included studio time, equipment hire and bringing in some amazing musicians to add drums, brass and strings. </p>
<p>Apart from a couple of tiny things to record there is now mixing and mastering to be done.</p>
<p>The remaining costs look like this:<br/>Mixing incl. studio time + engineer = £2900<br/>Mastering = £450<br/>CD pressing, licencing and download set-up = £1500<br/>Materials for the perks = £300<br/>(this is a rough estimate and depends entirely on what perks people go for...)<br/>Postage and packaging of CDs and perks = £400<br/>(again, this depends on how many people manage to support the campaign!)</p>
<p>Working Total = £5550.</p>
<p>As I'm going for the flexible funding option this means if I don't reach my target I can still access any money raised and put it towards these costs. This album will be finished by hook or by crook!!</p>
<p>As a graphic designer with a textile degree I'm turning my hand to art and design to provide some unique rewards for those of you who wish to give a bit more. I will hand embroider lyrics, have some limited edition prints made of the album artwork (one lucky person could also own the original!) and there will also be t-shirts which I will design myself. Click on each perk to see full details of what you'll receive.</p>
</div><div><h3>You can help by sharing...</h3></div><div>
<p>Any money raised through the campaign will be a huge help but if you can't afford to pre-order this album you can still help by sharing this campaign on any social media with anyone you feel may be interested. Either way, thanks for reading this far! Onwards and upwards...</p>

<h3>Too Much Joy's First New Album In 24 Years</h3>
<p>Remember Too Much Joy? Way back in the '90s, the <i>Village Voice</i> (remember the <i>Village Voice</i>?) said, ""These guys were sarcastic before Pavement knew how to smirk. And they nail the hard-pop thing that made Green Day a household product. They're the lost big brothers of indie's sweet 'n' nasty contingent, redolent with wit and wet with musical spit. They'll make you slam and think at the same time.""</p>
<p>Too Much Joy never broke up, they just sort of stopped playing shows or releasing records. Until now.</p>
<p>Equal parts bored and inspired in quarantine, they asked each other why they'd never recorded certain old songs of theirs they remembered fondly, and started swapping ideas for new tunes. Before they knew it, they had a couple dozen tracks in varying stages of completion. Some of them were written when they were in their twenties; some of them were written yesterday; some of them are still unfinished while Tim types this instead. </p>
<p>Their somewhat ridiculous goal: complete the album in time for Christmas 2020.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>They've already begun recording for the new album. But the more people who pre-order it now, the better it will sound, because they'll be able to spend more time in the studio and master the results properly, and the prettier it will look, because they can hire an actual designer to create a cover and booklet, instead of relying on Tim's rudimentary Photoshop skills and atrocious taste in fonts.</p>
<p>The album's tentatively titled <i>Last Century</i>, because half the songs were written in the literal last century, while the other half were written in what metaphorically feels like it might be humanity's last century. Something about the juxtaposition of songs they composed as callow kids and songs that are just now springing to life feels good and true and right, as if the tunes are having a conversation with one another. The old songs challenge the new ones to be louder and faster, while the new ones scoff at how naive those old ones were. You can hear some of them already <a href=""https://toomuchjoy.bandcamp.com/album/new-memories"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Announcing their intentions publicly is mostly just a way to give them a genuine deadline so they don't spend too much time bickering about who needs to be louder in the mix. But it's good news for fans of the band, or anyone who enjoys loud, literate, slightly snotty but secretly earnest music. To wit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everyone who contributes gets the album before it's officially released!</li>
<li>Folks who contribute at higher levels get rough mixes of selected songs even before that!</li>
<li>You can also attend a Zoom hangout with the band, if hearing them make fun of Jay interests you.</li>
<li>Ever wanted to be in a song? That, too, is possible! </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>The band has set a goal of $5,000, because that's what the designer and the mastering engineer will cost. If they raise more, they might be able to swing a limited-edition vinyl release. If they raise less, maybe they can bargain with the designer and the engineer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Important Caveats</h3>
<p>Plans can change! The album could take longer to complete than anticipated, or the band might decide the old songs aren't as good as the new ones (or vice versa), or change the title and concept halfway through. Such is the nature of any creative endeavor.</p>
<p>But you will be getting a record, when it's completed. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We hope you can help the band make their somewhat humble dream a reality by donating. But if money's tight, or if you'd simply prefer to wait until the record actually exists to purchase it, you can still assist them by sharing news of this project as far and wide as you're able.</p>
<p>We thank you either way.</p>

<h3>You've Released Projects Before, Why is This One Special?</h3>
<p>The project, simply put, will establish a case for <strong>Rhys Langston as a multidisciplinary artist whose ideas are the limit, not the medium</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the<strong> audio will be more musically refined and pop-sensible</strong> than any release thus far</p></li>
<li><p>the <strong>book will </strong><strong>show the literary strengths and instincts of his lyrics, </strong>written to stand alone as poetry</p></li>
<li><p>an<strong> introductory absurdist manifesto</strong> will frame the work in a contemporary and (increasingly) surreal cultural context, stylistically teetering between prose poetry and parodic academic discourse.  </p></li>
<li><p>the e-book will <strong>feature audio that can be played, paused, rewound, and fast-forwarded as the text is read through</strong> </p></li>
<li><p><strong>an interactive glossary at the end </strong>will provide caveats and hints for cross-references and subtextual scavenger hunts. </p></li>
<li><p>the yet-to-be-unveiled<strong> album cover </strong>will showcase<strong> Rhys Langston's technical and aesthetic sleight of hand in the art of painting, </strong>as a work unto itself</p></li>

<p>With these intents, the album and book serve to gather crossover interest from unlikely sources, like those interested in music but not poetics, and vice versa.  As he figures on track 8 of the album, <strong>he might just be the Spotify-friendly poet laureate of his living room. </strong></p>
<p>It as well is an<strong> intentional stab at the reasoning for segregating art forms</strong>, and a proposal for <strong>the challenges in communicating various levels of depth in an age of diminished attention spans. </strong></p>
<p>This is all surely big talk, so trust others' praise for Rhys Langston's early artistic attempts:</p>

<p>You, the people, will be directly aiding<strong> the ascension of Rhys Langston's </strong>fledgling venture<strong> Black Market Poetry </strong>and<strong> the mythos of Langstónia.</strong>  So as to not run the personal well too dry, we have come up with the figure of $2,000 to help launch these ideas from our hard drives to your physical and digital hands. <strong> Please consider supporting a small Black business. </strong>Though other hands with connections and means might help us in circulating the work,<strong> the peer-to-peer support and backing is truly the only way for this potentially transformative art to take hold.</strong></p>

<h3>If You Cannot Donate Right Now/Want to Help Otherwise</h3>

<li><p>Wait a few days, and <strong>blindly donate without checking your bank balance</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Let your friends</strong>, enemies, lovers, coworkers, second cousins twice removed, twice moved across the country,<strong> know about this</strong> (that means <strong>by phone, text, Cambridge Analytica dossier, a post with male-presenting nipples on Instagram, etc.)</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Listen to Rhys Langston's music on streaming services</strong> to get his numbers up, under fealty to the nobles of intangible media forms</p></li>

You've Released Projects Before, Why is This One Special?
The project, simply put, will establish a case for Rhys Langston as a multidisciplinary artist whose ideas are the limit, not the medium.

the audio will be more musically refined and pop-sensible than any release thus far
the book will show the literary strengths and instincts of his lyrics, written to stand alone as poetry
an introductory absurdist manifesto will frame the work in a contemporary and (increasingly) surreal cultural context, stylistically teetering between prose poetry and parodic academic discourse.  
the e-book will feature audio that can be played, paused, rewound, and fast-forwarded as the text is read through 
an interactive glossary at the end will provide caveats and hints for cross-references and subtextual scavenger hunts. 
the yet-to-be-unveiled album cover will showcase Rhys Langston's technical and aesthetic sleight of hand in the art of painting, as a work unto itself

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
With these intents, the album and book serve to gather crossover interest from unlikely sources, like those interested in music but not poetics, and vice versa.  As he figures on track 8 of the album, he might just be the Spotify-friendly poet laureate of his living room. 
It as well is an intentional stab at the reasoning for segregating art forms, and a proposal for the challenges in communicating various levels of depth in an age of diminished attention spans. 
This is all surely big talk, so trust others' praise for Rhys Langston's early artistic attempts:

Rhys Langston as The Cover Story of LA Record Magazine Winter 2016/17 Issue
Passion of the Weiss on R.L.'s Aggressively Ethnically Ambiguous Album

What Your Contribution Will Mean to Us!!
You, the people, will be directly aiding the ascension of Rhys Langston's fledgling venture Black Market Poetry and the mythos of Langstónia.  So as to not run the personal well too dry, we have come up with the figure of $2,000 to help launch these ideas from our hard drives to your physical and digital hands.  Please consider supporting a small Black business. Though other hands with connections and means might help us in circulating the work, the peer-to-peer support and backing is truly the only way for this potentially transformative art to take hold.
 

If You Cannot Donate Right Now/Want to Help Otherwise

Wait a few days, and blindly donate without checking your bank balance.
Let your friends, enemies, lovers, coworkers, second cousins twice removed, twice moved across the country, know about this (that means by phone, text, Cambridge Analytica dossier, a post with male-presenting nipples on Instagram, etc.)
Listen to Rhys Langston's music on streaming services to get his numbers up, under fealty to the nobles of intangible media forms
Stick your head out the nearest window and yell, ""I'm broke as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!""

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Y Axes are a San Francisco-based indie outfit who play a unique blend of dreamy, synth-glossed pop and rhythmically robust rock.</p>
<p>Having initially formed as a recording project by vocalist Alexi Rose Belchere and guitarist Devin Nelson, the duo decided to take on the project full time after premiering a set of songs at their space and prom-themed joint birthday party in July 2011. Bassist Jack Sundquist and drummer Paul Conroy and joined in 2015 and early 2018 respectively to contribute their groovy and heavy rhythms to the quartet’s energetic recorded and live performance.</p>
<p>Alexi’s lyrics cut through the intricate riffs of guitarist Devin, while bassist Jack and drummer Paul lock up the rhythm with double-bass kicks and slaps. They combine intricate instrumentations and ethereal vocal melodies to create pop that is simultaneously frantic, anthemic, heartbreaking, and hard-hitting.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>""No Waves"" is our most expansive record yet and we're so excited to share it with you! Unfortunately, we have several outstanding costs to settle and so much we still want to accomplish, <strong>and we need your help!</strong><br/><br/>With your financial backing, we hope to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finish all outstanding album production and settle all recording costs</li>
<li>Press the album to CD, Vinyl, as well as attain worldwide digital distribution</li>
<li>Promote our upcoming release and tour through the help of industry PR and marketing professionals</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Y Axes has been a band for 5 years and ""No Waves"" will be our fourth full-length album. We've cut our teeth playing in clubs and house shows all over the San Francisco Bay Area and California. The reason we've now decided to finally crowdfund an album is because ""No Waves"" *is* the record we truly believe will take us to new heights! Obtaining the much-needed financial backing for this record release makes all the difference in reaching new audiences, opening new opportunities, and touring in new cities where we've never had a presence.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's no secret that there's little money in being a musician, and living in San Francisco as a musician is a challenge in and of itself! As a band, we risk the possibility that we will not secure the funding needed to publish this record on our target release date (early 2019), or that we won't secure enough to press it on vinyl. Regardless, we love writing music and performing and are dedicated to utilizing every penny we receive on sharing this album with our fans!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>Short on cash? No problem!</strong> Share our campaign and our music with friends and on social media. Every share will be rewarded with a free download for our new single Empty Space, just tag us or use the hashtag #theYaxes. <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Every little bit helps! </span></p>

<p>The collective outfit Crippled Black Phoenix are touring Europe in March and April, along with Soft Kill and Fotocrime.

</div></div>","Crippled Black Phoenix - Support the Tour!
The collective outfit Crippled Black Phoenix are touring Europe in March and April, along with Soft Kill and Fotocrime. Since touring with 8 musicians from various countries (the UK, Sweden, the USA), getting them together for rehearsals and then putting them on the road is not cheap, and since we do not want to borrow money from our record label, we are offering some special perks and rewards so that you can help us complete the tour and also feel good about getting something unique back in return.  A full list of tour dates are listed below, underneath the package options.  Even if you're not contributing, come out to a show and say hi!  Getting this behemoth on the road is always a tricky proposition, but there's nothing we'd rather be doing.
 
Here's what we are offering to backers, while quantities last:

A new and exclusive T-shirt design, limited to 100 shirts, available in your custom size (from S to XXL), for €30.  This shirt will not be sold at our live shows or re-printed!
Hand-written lyrics to your favorite Crippled Black Phoenix song, written out for you by CBP founder Justin Greaves, limited to the first 40 backers, for €25.  You pick the song.

<h3>Carol Abbe Smith - Festival Chair</h3>
<p>I have been producing and hosting Jazz events and workshops in the Pioneer Valley of Western Massachusetts for over 10 years. Aside from producing, I am a jazz musician and have been fortunate to work with many of the best regional and national artists. I am also fortunate that we have a lineup of incredible musicians ready to perform at this premier Jazz Festival. I have a great team working with me to make this festival a success as well as a starter grant from Easthampton City Arts+. Team members Ruth Griggs, Marcia Morrison, Theora Gilliam, Kathy Service, Fred Andresen, George Kaye, and Wayne Roberts hope that by making our campaign goal, we will be able to make this festival totally free to the public while paying our participating musicians what they are worth.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Campaign Goal</h3>
<p>In order to the make this a free festival, we have to raise a minimum of $10,000. We have received a grant from Easthampton City Arts+ for $2,500. The vast majority of the money raised will be for paying the professional musicians ($9000), with the rest going to pay for space rental, programs and advertising.</p>
<p>We hope to have some generous local sponsors help us reach our goal. If we fail to raise enough total money, we will keep the daytime events free and the evening concert at a minimum ticket price.</p>
<p>Any amount raised will help us reach our goal.  Think of what you would be willing to pay for just <i>one</i> band concert.  At the Easthampton Jazz Festival, you will get a <i>full day of music presented by at least 10 bands</i>!</p>
<h3>The Venues</h3>
<p><strong>Eastworks</strong> (116 Pleasant St) is a 500,000-square-foot converted mill building in the heart of Easthampton housing celebrated artists, creative entrepreneurs, local and national businesses, restaurants and residents.  The festival will be on the first floor in the 121 Club and in the spacious hallways.</p>
<p><strong>Easthampton High School</strong> Auditorium (70 Williston Ave) is in the all new High School and is a state-of-art performance space.</p>
<h3><strong>The Music</strong></h3>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I was born and raised in the musically rich city of Hamilton Ontario and grew up listening to artists like Teenage Head, Edgar Breau and Fred Purser and The Washingtons. I was inspired by the guitar playing of Brian Griffith and the writing and producing of Daniel Lanois. </p>
<p>I spent most of the early 90's playing in Hess Village with Creepin' Chester while I studied jazz at Mohawk College. I continued to play throughout the years, but didn't really start songwriting again until I took part in Lori Yates' Creative Genius Songwriting Workshop a few years ago. I write about personal experiences, love and loss and my respect and admiration for nature and the human spirit. I'm happiest when I'm creating.</p>
<p>The current project I am working on, and asking you to support is a solo record in the Folk/Singer-songwriter vein. Two of the songs have competed in The CBC Searchlight Contest. The most recent one, ""That's What I Would Do"" advanced to the third round as a Hamilton Regional Finalist. Have a listen: <a href=""https://www.reverbnation.com/jamieshea/song/23151350-thats-what-i-would-do"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.reverbnation.com/jamieshea/song/231...</a></p>

</div><p> </p></div>","About Me
I was born and raised in the musically rich city of Hamilton Ontario and grew up listening to artists like Teenage Head, Edgar Breau and Fred Purser and The Washingtons. I was inspired by the guitar playing of Brian Griffith and the writing and producing of Daniel Lanois. 
I spent most of the early 90's playing in Hess Village with Creepin' Chester while I studied jazz at Mohawk College. I continued to play throughout the years, but didn't really start songwriting again until I took part in Lori Yates' Creative Genius Songwriting Workshop a few years ago. I write about personal experiences, love and loss and my respect and admiration for nature and the human spirit. I'm happiest when I'm creating.
The current project I am working on, and asking you to support is a solo record in the Folk/Singer-songwriter vein. Two of the songs have competed in The CBC Searchlight Contest. The most recent one, ""That's What I Would Do"" advanced to the third round as a Hamilton Regional Finalist. Have a listen: https://www.reverbnation.com/jamieshea/song/231...
 

I love to write songs that have meaning.
I want to share them with as many people as I can.
I'm recording my first album and need your financial support.

 
What I Need & What You Get

I've managed to save some money from gigs over the past year, and have two of the ten songs recorded in sessions from previous years. I'm looking to raise $5000 to pay for the remaining studio sessions, production and design.

I'll take whatever you can afford to give me
Perks include the record itself, private performances and access to my blog that takes you behind the scenes for every one of my recording sessions 
I fully expect to reach or surpass my flexible funding goal, but if I don't, I will still make the best record I can.


 
The Impact your contribution will make

Your financial support will buy me the time I need to make sure the project is done properly. I won't have to rush through and make compromises.
You'll be supporting the arts in a time when cuts are being made in our name.
You will be making a powerful statement. Do something positive with your money.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you're strapped for cash, you can still make a difference by spreading the word to music lovers like yourself.

Word of mouth goes a long way. ""Hey, Jamie Shea's making a record!"" is a great way to start a conversation with your music-loving friends.

This will be the fourth year of the festival and it is always the hard to raise funding. The PVD Folk Fest won the Motif Magazine Award for BEST FESTIVAL in RI for 2016! We have do have some funding but require much more to make the event a success. There are a LOT of hidden costs, as well as the obvious ones in producing a festival. We must cover advertising, staging, tents, sound, lights, sanitation, licenses, talent fees and many other production costs. Hear In Rhode Island is a non-profit organization and is experienced with festival and event production. HIRI started and ran the Hear In Rhode Island Festival from 1994-2001. That festival presented over 100 acts on four stages during the two day event. Hear In RI also produced a stage at the Newport Folk Festival for nine years. For the past six years HIRI has been producing the Downtown Sundown Series at Roger Williams National Memorial in downtown Providence. This successful series involves 5-6 shows spaced out over the summer months. Roger Williams National Memorial is a beautiful park and is the actual location of the original Providence settlement back in 1636.  In addition to all the previously mentioned events, HIRI has produced many other shows, CDs, workshops and more. HIRI is a certified non-profit organization operating under the 501(c)(3) code. All donations are tax deductible. We have set up different levels of sponsorship that make it easy for you to help. There are also perks involved such as t-shirts, pins, signed posters and more. Please check for specific levels for the specific perks.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>My name is Eyal Vilner and I’m a jazz musician and composer based in NYC. I play saxophone, clarinet and flute. For the past 10 years I’ve been leading my 18-piece big band, writing new arrangements of jazz classics, composing original music and conducting the band. I see the big band as another one of my instruments through which I try to express myself.</p>
<p>I was born in Tel Aviv, Israel and moved to New York when I was 21 to complete my studies at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music. I started the big band the following year,  and since then, we’ve been fortunate to perform regularly at many NYC major jazz clubs like Jazz at Lincoln Center - Dizzy’s Club, Smalls, Birdland, Swing 46 and The Django. The band tours frequently in Israel and has performed at venues including the Tel Aviv Museum, the Jerusalem Theater and the Red Sea Jazz Festival. Our last three albums; <i>Introducing the Eyal Vilner Big Band</i>, <i>Almost Sunrise </i>and <i>Hanukkah</i> made it to the top of the jazz radio charts in the US and Canada and received rave reviews.</p> <h3>What’s special about this album?</h3>
<p>In the past few years, we’ve started playing more and more for swing dancers. This has really influenced the way I play and write music. I fell in love with the dance and have become really passionate about the connection between musicians and dancers in the swing world. In this album we strive to create something new in this genre and tell our story through these aesthetics. Together with professional dancer and international instructor Gaby Cook and a group of amazing dancers we started a weekly jam in NYC where dancers and musicians get together to improvise and learn about each other’s language and art form, inviting artists from different backgrounds to collaborate and create something beautiful together. This exchange between dance and music, movement and sound, feels so refreshing and new - yet so natural and familiar. It feels like we’re bringing it back to where jazz and swing dancing grew up and developed together, influenced and inspired by one another. It feels like we’re bringing it back home.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>Recording an album is not cheap, let alone an 18-piece big band album! Our goal for the campaign is $15,000, which is the minimum we need in order to make it happen. The money raised in this campaign will help pay for the musicians, 2 days at the recording studio, mixing, mastering, artwork and design, and printing the new album.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Tax Deductible</h3>
<p>All contributions are fully tax-deductible through our long-term partnership with the America-Israel Cultural Foundation, excluding the cost of goods and services received.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Who’s in the band?</h3>
<p>The Eyal Vilner Big Band is an 18-piece jazz orchestra that includes some of the finest musicians in New York City. Some of them have joined the band within the past few years, and some I grew up with, and we’ve been playing jazz together since we were teenagers in Tel Aviv! Our two featured vocalists are the amazing Brianna Thomas and Brandon Bain! I absolutely love their singing and storytelling and they bring such great energy and vibes to the band.</p> <p><strong>The musicians:</strong></p>
<p>Brianna Thomas &amp; Brandon Bain - vocals</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Bryan Davis - lead trumpet</p>
<p>James Zollar - trumpet and flugelhorn</p>

I'm a singer-songwriter from Athens,Ga, and I am looking to pursue the making of my first record.</p><p>The past few years of my life have very much been a journey of self discovery and perseverance.

<h2><strong>My Story</strong></h2>
<p><strong>My name is Michelle Daly and I am singer and songwriter from Dublin, Ireland.  </strong></p>
<p>I am classically trained singer and began performing as a child at festival competitions throughout Ireland.  As a teenager I relocated to the UK to study music and voice. I have always been heavily influenced by jazz and soul music and from a young age began writing my own songs. While in London,  working as a voice teacher and opera singer, I self-funded and released my debut EP <i>Melodramas</i> with co-writer Michael Parle in 2014, which we performed together on the London circuit. </p>
<p>Since relocating to Berlin a few years ago I began working on new material with my collaborator composer Michael Edwards and have been performing at the regular smoky Berlin joints and top Jazz venues.  </p>

<p>My influences span from the jazz and soul vocalists of the early 20th century to neo-soul/trip hop vocalists of the 90's/early 00's.

The instrumentation will be mainly acoustic and I will be exploring richer textures on this album.</p>

<h2><strong>The Project</strong></h2>
<p>Cape Town Swing is a volunteer-run, non-profit organization lead by a group of local dancers dedicated to organising swing dance events in the area. <i>Echoes of Sophiatown</i> extends from our aim to build community through a shared interested in dance and to foster an appreciation for swing dance, music, and history.</p>
<p>The story of swing dance and music in South Africa is a rich one that parallels the story of swing in America, in both its origins within black communities and its expression of systemic injustice. And yet, few in the international dance community (and even the greater South African community) are familiar with its heroes and the remarkable music they made.</p>
<p>The social and political oppression of black South Africans under the apartheid regime left much of the South African swing era from the 1930s through the 1950s undocumented. Few music recordings, photographs, video footage, or historical records of any kind are publicly available, if they exist at all. Those artifacts that do exist are largely gathering dust in private collections and archives, waiting to be rediscovered.</p>
<p>Sophiatown was a hub of black culture similar in some ways to Harlem in New York. Swing music flourished in this multi-cultural suburb until the apartheid government bulldozed the entire neighbourhood and replaced it with a whites-only area. Much of the culture was lost and the bands were dispersed but a few recordings remain.<br/><br/>Our team has identified a list of songs by various local artists and in different states of integrity. This  project will begin the process of preserving and reviving this music by transcribing, recording, and performing 30 original South African swing songs, which will be made available to a new generation of music and dance appreciators.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $12,000 for the <i>Echoes of Sophiatown</i> project to serve three objectives:</p>
<p><strong>1) Music</strong><br/>We aim to transcribe 30 songs that can be performed and recorded for a wider audience. Our local swing band, The Pebble Shakers, will debut the compilation at our annual dance festival, Mother City Hop (<a href=""http://www.mothercityhop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mothercityhop.com</a>), in March 2019.</p>
<p>We will be releasing the list of songs in 3 batches of 10.<br/>The first 10 songs are listed below and can be heard at <a href=""http://www.pebbleshakers.co.za/#echoes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.pebbleshakers.co.za/#echoes</a>:</p>
<p>Swazi Stomp - African Swingsters - SPONSORED by Simon<br/>Third Avenue Special - Alexandra All Star Band - SPONSORED by Christine<br/>Skokiaan - The Bulawayo Sweet Rhythm Band<br/>Lo Tsosi - Damuza Mdledle<br/>Unomeva - Dolly Rathebe<br/>Diepkloof Ekhaya - Jazz Dazzlers - SPONSORED<br/>Dipsy Doodle - Manhattan Brothers<br/>Sweet Talk - Manhattan Brothers - SPONSORED<br/>Kalla’s Special - Spokes Mashiyane - SPONSORED<br/>Boogie Woogie Wam - Walter Theletsane</p>
<p><strong>2) History</strong><br/>Our team will research, compile, and document the stories of the artists and the events around the creation of the songs we are transcribing.</p>
<p><strong>3) Art </strong><br/>To accompany the music and pay tribute to the musicians, we will be curating a collection of artwork and photography that is either from the time period or inspired by the era. An exhibition of the collection will be held in March 2019.</p>
<h3><strong>Perk Highlights</strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>Echoes of Sophiatown</i> on Vinyl </strong>-  a limited edition record featuring a selection of the songs we transcribe, performed by the Pebble Shakers (50 available at $40)</p>
<p><strong>Art Prints</strong>: a limited edition print of one of the three featured artworks from the <i>Echoes of Sophiatown</i> exhibition (10 available of each artwork at $100).</p>
<p><strong>Sponsor a song</strong>: for $350 you can help cover the costs for one of the transcriptions and have you name appear on the record cover, e.g.:<br/>""Meadowlands Boogie,"" sponsored by Frankie Manning.</p>
<p><strong>Sneak Peak Event</strong>: an intimate listening session with the Pebble Shakers before their big show in March 2019 (25 available at $12)</p>
<p>Our target reflects the cost of a minimalist approach to transcribing and recording the minimum number of songs required to have an all-South African swing set list.  If we are unable to reach our target we will need to go back to the drawing board. We are not willing to do this project in a way that would compromise the quality or pay less than full respect to the musicians from the era or those involved in the transcription.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p><i>Echoes of Sophiatown</i> serves two communities, different in scale, but with overlapping interests.</p>
<p>The international swing dance community takes pride in the preservation and celebration of history and culture of the music and dance we love. We do this implicitly every time we take to the dance floor, and great effort has been taken to document, share, and honor the tapestry of stories, music, and people that define our culture. Currently missing from this tapestry is the story of South African swing, which is suffused with exciting rhythms, personalities, and a culture all its own. The revival of South African swing promises to enrich our dancing and our understanding of the music that makes it possible.</p>
<p>More importantly however is the greater South African community, and in particular, the people who's culture the apartheid government tried to destroy. Nearly 25 years since the democratisation of the country, South Africans are still exploring our national and cultural identity, comprised as it is of so many languages, traditions, and  histories. Vital to the process of figuring out where we are headed as a society is understanding where we came from. The South African swing era represents one cultural moment, a single piece in the bigger puzzle of our national heritage, that can be a source of pride, learning, joy, and, as it was originally, a way to bring people together. In this regard, we want <i>Echoes of Sophiatown</i> to shine a light on the unsung heros of our musical past and to be a source of joy and connection in our fractured society.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>Our first priority in this project is to honor the original South African artists who, consequent to their political marginalisation, were not just under-recognised but under-compensated for their work. We face real challenges in determining the copyright status of the music we want to preserve, as well as in ensuring that we pay the artists at the heart of this project (and their families) proper respect both in spirit and in monetary terms.</p>
<p>We understand that our goal to perform and record song covers raises concerns about a) profitability and b) cultural appropriation. We want to be clear that we are not interested in turning a profit on this music for our organisation, or any of us individually. Our aim is to make this music available to the public in a sustainable way, while covering the costs of production. We are also interested in finding ways for the original artists to receive monetary rewards for the fruits of their original music.

Cape Town Swing is a volunteer-run, non-profit organization lead by a group of local dancers dedicated to organising swing dance events in the area. Echoes of Sophiatown extends from our aim to build community through a shared interested in dance and to foster an appreciation for swing dance, music, and history.
The story of swing dance and music in South Africa is a rich one that parallels the story of swing in America, in both its origins within black communities and its expression of systemic injustice. And yet, few in the international dance community (and even the greater South African community) are familiar with its heroes and the remarkable music they made.
The social and political oppression of black South Africans under the apartheid regime left much of the South African swing era from the 1930s through the 1950s undocumented. Few music recordings, photographs, video footage, or historical records of any kind are publicly available, if they exist at all. Those artifacts that do exist are largely gathering dust in private collections and archives, waiting to be rediscovered.
Sophiatown was a hub of black culture similar in some ways to Harlem in New York. Swing music flourished in this multi-cultural suburb until the apartheid government bulldozed the entire neighbourhood and replaced it with a whites-only area. Much of the culture was lost and the bands were dispersed but a few recordings remain.Our team has identified a list of songs by various local artists and in different states of integrity. This  project will begin the process of preserving and reviving this music by transcribing, recording, and performing 30 original South African swing songs, which will be made available to a new generation of music and dance appreciators.
What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise $12,000 for the Echoes of Sophiatown project to serve three objectives:
1) MusicWe aim to transcribe 30 songs that can be performed and recorded for a wider audience. Our local swing band, The Pebble Shakers, will debut the compilation at our annual dance festival, Mother City Hop (www.mothercityhop.com), in March 2019.
We will be releasing the list of songs in 3 batches of 10.The first 10 songs are listed below and can be heard at www.pebbleshakers.co.za/#echoes:
Swazi Stomp - African Swingsters - SPONSORED by SimonThird Avenue Special - Alexandra All Star Band - SPONSORED by ChristineSkokiaan - The Bulawayo Sweet Rhythm BandLo Tsosi - Damuza MdledleUnomeva - Dolly RathebeDiepkloof Ekhaya - Jazz Dazzlers - SPONSOREDDipsy Doodle - Manhattan BrothersSweet Talk - Manhattan Brothers - SPONSOREDKalla’s Special - Spokes Mashiyane - SPONSOREDBoogie Woogie Wam - Walter Theletsane
2) HistoryOur team will research, compile, and document the stories of the artists and the events around the creation of the songs we are transcribing.
3) Art To accompany the music and pay tribute to the musicians, we will be curating a collection of artwork and photography that is either from the time period or inspired by the era. An exhibition of the collection will be held in March 2019.
Perk Highlights
Echoes of Sophiatown on Vinyl -  a limited edition record featuring a selection of the songs we transcribe, performed by the Pebble Shakers (50 available at $40)
Art Prints: a limited edition print of one of the three featured artworks from the Echoes of Sophiatown exhibition (10 available of each artwork at $100).
Sponsor a song: for $350 you can help cover the costs for one of the transcriptions and have you name appear on the record cover, e.g.:""Meadowlands Boogie,"" sponsored by Frankie Manning.
Sneak Peak Event: an intimate listening session with the Pebble Shakers before their big show in March 2019 (25 available at $12)
Our target reflects the cost of a minimalist approach to transcribing and recording the minimum number of songs required to have an all-South African swing set list.  If we are unable to reach our target we will need to go back to the drawing board. We are not willing to do this project in a way that would compromise the quality or pay less than full respect to the musicians from the era or those involved in the transcription.
The Impact
Echoes of Sophiatown serves two communities, different in scale, but with overlapping interests.
The international swing dance community takes pride in the preservation and celebration of history and culture of the music and dance we love. We do this implicitly every time we take to the dance floor, and great effort has been taken to document, share, and honor the tapestry of stories, music, and people that define our culture. Currently missing from this tapestry is the story of South African swing, which is suffused with exciting rhythms, personalities, and a culture all its own. The revival of South African swing promises to enrich our dancing and our understanding of the music that makes it possible.
More importantly however is the greater South African community, and in particular, the people who's culture the apartheid government tried to destroy. Nearly 25 years since the democratisation of the country, South Africans are still exploring our national and cultural identity, comprised as it is of so many languages, traditions, and  histories. Vital to the process of figuring out where we are headed as a society is understanding where we came from. The South African swing era represents one cultural moment, a single piece in the bigger puzzle of our national heritage, that can be a source of pride, learning, joy, and, as it was originally, a way to bring people together. In this regard, we want Echoes of Sophiatown to shine a light on the unsung heros of our musical past and to be a source of joy and connection in our fractured society.
Risks & Challenges
Our first priority in this project is to honor the original South African artists who, consequent to their political marginalisation, were not just under-recognised but under-compensated for their work. We face real challenges in determining the copyright status of the music we want to preserve, as well as in ensuring that we pay the artists at the heart of this project (and their families) proper respect both in spirit and in monetary terms.
We understand that our goal to perform and record song covers raises concerns about a) profitability and b) cultural appropriation. We want to be clear that we are not interested in turning a profit on this music for our organisation, or any of us individually. Our aim is to make this music available to the public in a sustainable way, while covering the costs of production. We are also interested in finding ways for the original artists to receive monetary rewards for the fruits of their original music. We are currently engaging with the legalities and practicalities of this challenge and will continue to post updates on our progress in this regard.
Although we represent a largely white community, this is an unfortunate reflection of our segregated city and something we are actively trying to change. We have been, and will continue to be, consulting with the communities where this music originated and the few musicians from the era that are still alive. So far, the response has been largely one of joy and support. 
A portion of the funds we raise will be used in tracking down the original artists and their families.  The legal tangle around music rights and royalties is not trivial but we hope to find a means to channel any additional income we raise towards these communities in a sustainable manner.

<h3><strong>From Tuxedos to Kilts</strong></h3>
<p>My life in music started on the stage of the Bass Hall with the Ft. Worth Opera.  I was a classical singer for 13 years in the US and abroad, but in my heart I always served two masters. </p>
<p>Growing up listening my grandfather and his friends play traditional bluegrass, it wasn't a far leap from there to find the traditional music of Ireland, and there, I found a home.  Upon leaving the opera, I continued to play traditional music in local area pubs and renaissance festivals around Northeast Texas until I moved to upstate New York.  Since transitioning to the Northeast, I have discovered a vibrant culture of traditional music, not only Irish, but American, and Canadian as well.  Having the pleasure of knowing and playing with numerous outstanding musicians makes this collaboration all the more rich.  It has been an amazing musical adventure, and this album is a map of my journey.  </p>
<h3><strong>Every journey needs some gas money</strong></h3>
<p>The goal is to continue to keep my projects like this as lean as possible, without sacrificing quality.  To that end I'm asking for $2,000 to get this album off the ground.  Your support will help to fund the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recording and mixing time with Blue Sky studios (the engineer is also an Irish musician, so mixing the style is second nature).</p></li>
<li><p>Album mastering.</p></li>
<li><p>Paying the other musicians for their time and travel expenses.</p></li>
<li><p>Compensating the fantastic graphic designer (who has worked with me on a previous classical album) for the album artwork and layout. </p></li>
<li><p>Initial print run of CDs.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Tread the road together</strong></h3>
<p>Creating this work has been on my mind for several years now. I challenged myself to put together an album that will evoke the full range of emotions captured in the stories these songs tell.  Re-energizing the arrangements with the help of fellow musicians and singers, this collection will be a labor of love.</p>
<p>Your support will help to make this a success, and your contribution comes with its own perks as well:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A heartfelt “Thank You”</p></li>
<li><p>Early access to the digital album</p></li>

<h3><strong>Your “Voice” is just as helpful</strong></h3>
