<h3>Who I am and this campaign</h3>
<p>Heyo, </p>
<p>My name is Andy Chew. I'm a singer/songwriter living in New Hampshire most of the last decade but originally from Rhode Island. I've worked as a studio potter, carpenter and currently as a medical professional who is always pursuing my true love of music as a side hustle. </p>
<p>I've always loved the music of a lot of 60's and 70's artist and have been waiting for the moment when I felt ready to go into the studio and bring the right set of songs to a producer to make an album. I figured the music of that time period was all recorded in the analog format to tape and I would like to do my best to capture some of that aesthetic in this studio album. Its definitely become a huge life goal to make a real analog album and print it to vinyls.</p>
<p>Life's short and I don't want to look back at it and say I didn't try to follow my biggest passion. I have an obsession with recording and writing and have been doing so on my own in my home for a decade now. The first couple homemade albums made a bigger splash than I ever expected them to online and so I'm really hopeful for whats next while also realistic about the amount of effort and hard work it takes to make a cohesive and well done album.</p>
<p>With the help of your contribution I will be able to take a lot of songs I've developed for years at home and bring them into a much more professional production. My hope is this will bring more recognition to the songs and help them reach a larger audience. I will never stop recording and enjoying making music, it's definitely a lifelong obsession. </p>
<p>I've always wanted to make music that captured atmosphere. Just the other day I was walking around Salem, Massachusetts in the autumn air and could feel the heaviness of the place. Later upon coming home, I felt like I could channel that energy into a song. This is the process of most all of my music and I'm passionate about the history, and atmosphere of the old towns and forest I grew up around. The music itself is usually a blend of ethereal harmonies with acoustic instruments, octave mandolins, banjos, etc... </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>For a smaller amount contribution you'll get the digital album!</p>
<p>And for the various larger amounts you can get 1 or more of the album on CD!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've felt that history, nature and all things that are beautiful inspirations in life are things worth preserving in songs. </p>
<p>I never expected my first two album to go as far as they did with thousands of streams and downloads. So I'm very excited to see the potential of something recorded by professionals in the highest quality format.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If I cannot reach my goal I will use what I have to start recording a project and release the album in parts as I raise enough for each individual section. </p>
<p>Recently I've seen a lot of other artist such as Trevor Hall do a similar tactic with his album ""The Fruitful Darkness"" which was released over the course of 6 months in four parts. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute thats totally ok!</p>
<p>I've certainly been there before myself. Some other ways you can help are  by sharing the campaign, streaming my homemade albums (Embers, From the Ruins, Golden Leaves) online and sharing/adding them to playlist so they get more streams and potentially bring more listeners who might help with the campaign!</p>
<p>Thank you for anything you do!</p>

<h3>A ""TINY"" Part of the Story...</h3>
<p>Two years ago, Arvie and Bunny decided to cash in their retirements, pay off all their debts, give away most of their possessions, move from South Carolina to Tennessee, and build a ""Tiny House"" in the peaceful woods about an hour outside of Nashville.  Going ""TINY"" has offered Arvie the opportunity to focus completely on songwriting and artwork which has helped alleviate some of the suffering from chronic migraines and  surprisingly culminated in the opportunity to sign with an independent label here in Nashville.   With this tremendous prospect on the horizon, Arvie and Bunny need to return to the studio here in Nashville to record their new songs and remaster some of their previously recorded songs. </p>

<h3>Your Part of the Story...</h3>
<p>Arvie and Bunny  both believe in hard work, coming from families that have been farmers, mill workers, members of the Armed Forces, and educators.  For many years, Arvie was also a teacher in schools with high levels of poverty, and Bunny is a social worker and published author, dedicating her career and writings to improving the quality of life, health, and mental health of her clients and readers.  They will never forget their roots and appreciate how hard it is to earn money and support a family.  With that being said, they pledge to use each penny given with the greatest care and precision, with the goal of making a positive change in the world always in the forefront of their minds.  Arvie and Bunny have also created several perks for those who partner with us to make this dream come true.</p>

<h3>Our Risks and Challenges...</h3>
<p>The music industry is ever changing and evolving.  There are no guarantees that a song or an album will be a top 40 hit or even recoup the money spent on recording and production.  However, the one sure thing is that if even one person is moved by a song, if even one life is changed, then that song becomes priceless and timeless.  We do this, not for the money and not for the fame, but for the privilege of seeing someone changed. </p>

<h2>5 Guys One Soul</h2>
<p>Hey there. We are Great again. We are five musicians from germany that play music for almost all of our live and have come to the point where we want to release our first album together.</p>
<p>Our influences are mostly in the 70s/ 80s hard rock scene like Savatage, Black Sabbath, Scorpions, Guns N Roses, WASP and Aerosmith. When we met for our first rehearsal we had no exact idea how we would sound so we did experiments in every direction and you will hear that in our debut album- in the positive way! Check out this demo:</p>
<p><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user-339482416/great-hit-mix"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/user-339482416/great-hit-mix</a></p>
<p>From ballads to to metal hymns, everything is in.</p>
<p>You want to score with your girl? We've got the ballad.</p>
<p>You had a really great night? We've got the triumphal Metal- Hymn</p>
<p>You got fired because you were late for work? We've got fast aggressive Rock</p>
<p>So you go drinking with your friends? We've got the Feel-Good Rock-Classic</p>
<p>The party ends at the campfire? We've got the acoustic guitar song that everybody can sing along, even in the worst mental condition</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Are we there yet?</h2>
<p>We nearly finished the recording of the album and are about to send it to a Producer to mix it and do the final mastering. And here's where you have to support us: Since this part of the production process is quite expensive we would like to ask you for support to reach that goal!</p>

<p>We will run the campaign for 60 days. In the meantime, we will hopefully finish mixing and mastering of the album so we can start to order the perks in march. Some of the perks will need more time so we are optimistic that we are able to send the stuff in May.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><i>""Ron is a highly accomplished multi instrumentalist whose talent and knowledge of Scottish       music is apparent in both the rehearsal room and on stage.""</i> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Iain Gillie, Managing Director of PW Productions Ltd.</strong></p>
<p><i>""Ron has a fantastic knack for producing a catchy rhythm with his guitar that can make a played out traditional tune seem completely refreshed and new again."" </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">        <strong>Alisdair McLaren, Director of The National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Born and brought up in the small, coastal village of Findochty in the North East of Scotland, my musical journey began when receiving fiddle and piano lessons at primary school. During my teenage years, I received tuition from Donald Barr and then James Alexander, both of whom were incredibly inspirational, supportive, and encouraging. I will be forever grateful to the opportunities that Donald and James both gave to me as a youngster. </p>
<p>Fast forward a couple of years, and the reason I play guitar today is down to one man. Innes Watson. A never ending source of creativity, imagination and expressiveness, Inness' genius inspired me at a gig he once did with Ross Ainslie in the Piping Centre, and from then on my journey as a guitarist and accompanist began... </p>
<p>Being an accompanist is amazing, it truly is. I feel so lucky to be able to play with such a diverse range of incredibly talented musicians, and seeing how this can influence and shape you as a player. This is where the idea for this project came from. I wondered what it would be like, and how it would sound to bring some of these skilled professionals together, all with their own ideas and creative outlooks, but to have myself at the core, as the continual musical thread that would link everybody together.</p>
<p>In some ways it would almost be like a compilation album, brining together some of my favourite people I've worked with over the years and having it all in one place, but in other ways, it may well spark something entirely new and creative. It would also be an album ran by someone who is accompanist, whose project it is, but they are never really at the forefront, just in the background holding everything in place and making everything stick together, just as an accompanist should do. That in itself is something that appeals to me and is quite unique and I'm not really sure it has been done that much before... </p>
<p>Any amount that you could donate to this project would mean so much to me, as I'd love nothing more than to share music with some of the finest young musicians in the country, all in one place, and I'd be eternally grateful for your support.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Costs... </h3>
<p>Although I will be investing my own money, realistically, it'll be in the region of £10,000 to cover all the costs for this album. Main costs include... </p>
<ul>
<li>Musicians fees</li>
<li>Studio fees (recording, engineering, mixing, mastering) </li>
<li>Printing / Distribution </li>
<li>Artwork / Design</li>
<li>Promotional material / PR &amp; Marketing</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I know this may seem like a lot, but I can't stress enough how eternally grateful I would be to those of you who decide support this project. Anything that you feel you could donate towards this would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Rewards for if you do decide to donate include... </p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-orders (signed and unsigned)</li>
<li>PDF's of sheet music </li>
<li>Guitar lessons </li>
<li>Fiddle lessons</li>
<li>Tune compositions</li>
<li>Gig tickets </li>
<li>House concerts / small performances </li>
</ul>

In some ways it would almost be like a compilation album, brining together some of my favourite people I've worked with over the years and having it all in one place, but in other ways, it may well spark something entirely new and creative. It would also be an album ran by someone who is accompanist, whose project it is, but they are never really at the forefront, just in the background holding everything in place and making everything stick together, just as an accompanist should do. That in itself is something that appeals to me and is quite unique and I'm not really sure it has been done that much before... 
Any amount that you could donate to this project would mean so much to me, as I'd love nothing more than to share music with some of the finest young musicians in the country, all in one place, and I'd be eternally grateful for your support.

<h3>Welcome! </h3>
<p>Hi there, I’m Michelle! Welcome to the <i>Overcomer</i> campaign!</p>
<p>About me: I’m a Vocalist, Composer, Voice Over Artist, Entertainer, and Cancer Survivor based in San Diego, CA--at least for now ;)  Last October, I celebrated 25 years cancer-free!</p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign will wrap up on this year's National Cancer Survivor Day, June 6th, which is always a day to celebrate!</p>
<h3>What's it all about?</h3>
<p><i>Overcomer</i> is a rock song I wrote, which feels like part rallying cry and part theme song for cancer survivors/thrivers, people living with diseases or chronic illnesses and conditions, and anyone who's been struggling in life. You are not your struggles--you are an Overcomer!</p>
<p>In supporting this campaign, you're actually becoming a partner in the project--helping to make it possible to record the song in LA and be filmed there as part of a young adult cancer survivor documentary. And when else will you have the opportunity to help make a rock song possible?! :)</p>
<p>NOTE: Recording, filming, and photography are TBD until things are a little more stable in the world, regarding the pandemic. The campaign is happening now to make sure we can proceed with it all when the time is right--hopefully a little later this year. </p>
<p>Song mockup in the works, too--stay tuned! ;)</p>
<h3>Why Overcomer?</h3>
<p>For years, I felt like I was failing at life--because the side effects of my cancer treatment kept getting the best of me. Since childhood, I’ve struggled with long-term side effects of my cancer treatment--the most impactful of them being chronic fatigue and chemo brain (aka brain fog), and chronic back pain with past muscle spasm episodes. </p>
<p>After numerous dropped college classes, dropped semesters, college changes, moves, and failed jobs over the years--plus the brain fog getting more invasive these past few years and a scary gut health issue--it's been wearing on me. I felt like a failure and an imposter, too. On the outside, it looked like I was doing well, but on the inside, I felt so insecure, and struggled with bouts of depression, too.</p>
<p>Then one day, I decided to give myself a reframe--and everything started to shift. Last Fall, I saw a comment that a past teacher wrote on a post I'd made involving a cancer charity. She said, ""Michelle, you are an overcomer."" I read that a few times--considering what an overcomer is. Could that really be me? In the following weeks, I kept thinking about that word and finally decided to try it on.</p>
<p>Reframing myself as an ""Overcomer"" was a total game-changer.</p>
<p>I realized that life had dealt me a lot of challenges, and I've worked so hard to overcome them--but I never really gave myself credit for that. Can you relate? I have a feeling that a lot of you reading this are Overcomers, too.</p>
<p>Join me on this journey. Take a leap of faith. Start calling yourself an Overcomer, and see how your view of yourself and the world changes. You can do it! :)</p>
<p>This campaign has 2 sides—the Fundraising side and the Community side.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Fundraising:</h3>
<p>Funds raised here will go toward the costs for my new song, Overcomer, including recording costs, musician stipends, and professional photography.</p>
<p>I’m keeping the budget pretty tight, so the perks I’m offering are digital, instead of me sending you a bunch of stuff that'll collect dust in your home! The other bonus of digital is that this campaign isn’t generating crazy amounts of packaging and trash—it’s zero waste!</p>
<p>Estimated costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording costs: Recording studio hours, Mixing hours, Mastering fee</li>
<li>Musician stipends</li>
<li>Professional photography of recording session &amp; for single cover</li>
</ul>
<h3>Community:</h3>
<p>On the Community side of things, join me in creating a reframe for anyone who’s been struggling in life. Maybe it’s you. I want to know—What’s your story? How would the way you think about yourself and your life change if you started to think of yourself in a more empowering way—as an Overcomer? (Facebook group coming soon!)</p>
<p>It’s my hope that this campaign will also bring more awareness about young adult cancer survivors and some of the challenges we face as a result of our cancer treatments. There are also many people who live with chronic diseases and conditions, like my dad, with Parkinson's Disease. <i>Overcomer </i>is for also for my dad, and all of you, too.</p>
<p>Many of my friends are survivors and thrivers who continue to have tests, scans, surgeries, and treatments so they can keep busy living life! They're some of the most incredible people I know, contributing to the inspiration for this song. Together, we have all kinds of *fun* side effects--since cancer treatment is the *gift* that keeps on giving--and despite what some of us have been told, we're not ""too young"" to be experiencing them!</p>

Hi there, I’m Michelle! Welcome to the Overcomer campaign!
About me: I’m a Vocalist, Composer, Voice Over Artist, Entertainer, and Cancer Survivor based in San Diego, CA--at least for now ;)  Last October, I celebrated 25 years cancer-free!
This Indiegogo campaign will wrap up on this year's National Cancer Survivor Day, June 6th, which is always a day to celebrate!
What's it all about?
Overcomer is a rock song I wrote, which feels like part rallying cry and part theme song for cancer survivors/thrivers, people living with diseases or chronic illnesses and conditions, and anyone who's been struggling in life. You are not your struggles--you are an Overcomer!
In supporting this campaign, you're actually becoming a partner in the project--helping to make it possible to record the song in LA and be filmed there as part of a young adult cancer survivor documentary. And when else will you have the opportunity to help make a rock song possible?! :)
NOTE: Recording, filming, and photography are TBD until things are a little more stable in the world, regarding the pandemic. The campaign is happening now to make sure we can proceed with it all when the time is right--hopefully a little later this year. 
Song mockup in the works, too--stay tuned! ;)
Why Overcomer?
For years, I felt like I was failing at life--because the side effects of my cancer treatment kept getting the best of me. Since childhood, I’ve struggled with long-term side effects of my cancer treatment--the most impactful of them being chronic fatigue and chemo brain (aka brain fog), and chronic back pain with past muscle spasm episodes. 
After numerous dropped college classes, dropped semesters, college changes, moves, and failed jobs over the years--plus the brain fog getting more invasive these past few years and a scary gut health issue--it's been wearing on me. I felt like a failure and an imposter, too. On the outside, it looked like I was doing well, but on the inside, I felt so insecure, and struggled with bouts of depression, too.
Then one day, I decided to give myself a reframe--and everything started to shift. Last Fall, I saw a comment that a past teacher wrote on a post I'd made involving a cancer charity. She said, ""Michelle, you are an overcomer."" I read that a few times--considering what an overcomer is. Could that really be me? In the following weeks, I kept thinking about that word and finally decided to try it on.
Reframing myself as an ""Overcomer"" was a total game-changer.
I realized that life had dealt me a lot of challenges, and I've worked so hard to overcome them--but I never really gave myself credit for that. Can you relate? I have a feeling that a lot of you reading this are Overcomers, too.
Join me on this journey. Take a leap of faith. Start calling yourself an Overcomer, and see how your view of yourself and the world changes. You can do it! :)
This campaign has 2 sides—the Fundraising side and the Community side.

Fundraising:
Funds raised here will go toward the costs for my new song, Overcomer, including recording costs, musician stipends, and professional photography.
I’m keeping the budget pretty tight, so the perks I’m offering are digital, instead of me sending you a bunch of stuff that'll collect dust in your home! The other bonus of digital is that this campaign isn’t generating crazy amounts of packaging and trash—it’s zero waste!
Estimated costs:

Recording costs: Recording studio hours, Mixing hours, Mastering fee
Musician stipends
Professional photography of recording session & for single cover

Community:
On the Community side of things, join me in creating a reframe for anyone who’s been struggling in life. Maybe it’s you. I want to know—What’s your story? How would the way you think about yourself and your life change if you started to think of yourself in a more empowering way—as an Overcomer? (Facebook group coming soon!)
It’s my hope that this campaign will also bring more awareness about young adult cancer survivors and some of the challenges we face as a result of our cancer treatments. There are also many people who live with chronic diseases and conditions, like my dad, with Parkinson's Disease. Overcomer is for also for my dad, and all of you, too.
Many of my friends are survivors and thrivers who continue to have tests, scans, surgeries, and treatments so they can keep busy living life! They're some of the most incredible people I know, contributing to the inspiration for this song. Together, we have all kinds of *fun* side effects--since cancer treatment is the *gift* that keeps on giving--and despite what some of us have been told, we're not ""too young"" to be experiencing them!

<h3>SONGWRITER'S JOURNEY</h3>
<p>I love a song that took guts to write. A song that feels like relief when you listen to it. Feels more like medicine in the form of a melody. A song that makes you feel validated, understood. That's what has driven my songwriting over the years, the literal years it's taken me to bring forth these 10 songs for my debut studio album.</p>
<p>It's time to make this record; it's time these songs are connected with their audience; it's time to give these songs back to the world and people that helped me write them. They're about bravery &amp; vulnerability; heartbreak &amp; hope; friendships &amp; family. Songs driven by deep human emotions and experiences. Songs meant to make my listeners - to make YOU - feel and feel seen.</p>
<h3>RECORDING IN NASHVILLE</h3>
<p>Singer-songwriter and producer Mary Bragg will be producing the record and bringing these songs to life. Mary's ""Violets as Camouflage"" was rated one of NPR's 10 Best Albums of 2019. We'll be recording 10 tracks in Nashville, TN in the studio of Josh Kaler (Josh's former clients include Marc Scibilia, William Fitzsimmons, Matthew Perryman Jones, Jump Little Children, among others.) A host of professional session musicians will give my little baby songs color and depth.</p>
<h3>PRE-ORDER THE ALBUM</h3>
<p>I believe these songs are important, not just to me, but to people who seek validation; to listeners who need space to feel vulnerable; to anyone who needs a boost of courage. It's one thing to make this album, and another thing entirely to ensure this album reaches listeners' ears. By pre-ordering this album, you're helping ensure the successful distribution of these songs. </p>

<p>Hello, my name is Cam Kimbrough.
I am a Hill Country Blues artist from North Mississippi.
My Grandfather is Legendary Hill Country Bluesman, Junior Kimbrough. I grew up
around Grandaddy’s juke joint as a little boy not even old enough to ride a bike
yet. I would watch as my dad, Kenny Malone Kimbrough played the drums and sat
behind him trying to mimick his movements, not knowing at the time that the
music that was being played would become famous for it's own origin. It would
be several years until I actually sat at a drumset and played—or, attempted to
play at this small Baptist church in Potts Camp, Ms where I was born and
raised. I was thirteen years old when me and my dad went to Beale street in
Memphis, TN where we ran into Lightnin Malcolm, an associate of my dad’s who
gave me my first opportunity to play the drums in front of a crowd. It was at
that moment that I realized that I had a passion for music. </p>
<p>Several years passed until I
would meet back up with Lightnin again when he would ask me to tour with him as
his drummer. We recorded an album and toured everywhere from east to west coast
performing in front of audiences of five folks to thousands of people. During
this tour I realized I wanted nothing more than to continue this lifestyle as a
musician so, I began teaching myself to play guitar and studying more about the
craft of the hill country blues. I have performed with Robert Belfour, Eric
Deaton, Cedric Burnside, R.L. Boyce, Gary Burnside, Joe Ayers, Homemade Jamz,
and Leo Bud Welch.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>About The Campaign </h3>I’m starting this campaign because I am now ready
release my first solo blues project: the Head for the Hills EP. Over the course of a few years,
I have put together a small home studio which has enabled me to record my own
music.  I’ve written and recorded 6 new
songs and now that the tracks are recorded, I am ready to take the final steps
in the completion of this project. Head for the Hills has 5 tracks and 1 bonus
track at the end. This EP is important to me because this is the beginning of
my chance to keep my grandfather’s legacy going. I put my soul into this music.
It is truly the first time I have ever put this much energy and this much of
myself into a project. Whether I get famous like him or not, I really want to
make Grandaddy proud in hopes that he smiles down from the heavens. 

<p>North Mississippi Hill Country
music is on the brink of extinction and contributors will help keep this unique
style of music alive. There’s not very many current artists playing this style
of music and I want to contribute to the culture and the art as well as play a
part in introducing a new generation to this music that I love so much and
leave behind a legacy for my own children.</p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Goals &amp; Perks</span><br/>
</h3>My goal for this project is $2000. The money will help pay for the mixing and mastering of the tracks, the manufacturing of the EP (getting it pressed up), the disc artwork and layout, copyrighting, promotion, packaging and shipping. I am hoping to reach my goal and
then some. If I exceed my $2,000 campaign, any money received over the initial
goal, will be used to help me upgrade my home studio and buy pampers for my
newborn! :-)   There are some really great perks if you help out! If you pledge anything from $10 to $1000, you could receive perks such as signed copy of the EP, a guitar or a personalized song written by yours truly. If I do not reach my entire funding goal, the funds raised will be put towards the mixing and mastering of the EP. I really appreciate any
help in funding this project.<p></p>
<h3>The Impact </h3>I want this project to give people hope in the fact that there is still real music to come; music with substance, true emotion and life experiences. This project is important because it is a continuation of a culture that reminds us that Blues is in everything. It surrounds us and reminds us that there is still light at the end of the tunnel.</div><div>

<p>After a career in professional basketball and teaching a fire that had been lit as a child had somehow erupted into a full out blaze. In 2009 I formed Sweaty Llama Music (an idea that was actually envisioned in 2001). Within the first year in my hometown of Cleveland, Ohio I produced two full albums an EP and a host other songs for a few artists. 2012 would be the year where crazy met faith. I decided to sell my house and everything in it except my musical equipment and my son's bedroom set and moved my family to California with the mission of maximizing my abilities as an artist. Since the move I have built many new and lasting relationships in the music industry and earned the respect of my peers. I have been on four tours around the world playing drums for some very creative and  diverse artists. I gained a wealth of knowledge in my experiences but one of the lessons that I treasure most is that people need each other especially in areas where they are limited. Although I've self produced, mixed and mastered over 5 Albums and EP's for some very talented artists, my vision was never a problem but I realized that my resources and my own skill set in certain areas were limited. This time around I would love to incorporate the personnel of the experts to independently create the quality of music that will actually be able to stand along and push the threshold of today's mainstream music and  compete with award winning artists alike. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need</h3>
<div>The Goal is to raise $30k in 30 days. The costs will be allocated in these categories:</div>
<ul>
<li>Recording: I recorded my first solo album in my closet due to limited resources. It got the attention of listeners from around the world through iTunes, Spotify and other online outlets. Although I am extremely grateful for each and every listener, I felt like the project would have been a better experience for the listener if I had recorded it the way I had envisioned in a professional studio. </li>
<li>Mixing: THE MIX IS ONE ELEMENT YOU CANNOT COMPROMISE! I also mixed my first album which wasn't terrible but when stacked next to my competition (award-winning artists, mixing engineers and producers) the results are night and day in terms of sonic quality. With your support I get to delegate these critical elements of a successful album to the proper professionals. </li>
<li>Mastering: The final polishing of the recording.</li>
<li>Manufacturing: There are still music enthusiasts who like hard copies (cd and vinyl) of their music.</li>
<li>Artistic Collaboration: On this album I want to feature some talent that perhaps you've heard of as well as turn you on to some talent that you may not know.</li>
<li>Marketing: For a record label some of their mid to high profile artists can get marketing budgets into the tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. I believe that this project will be a matter of getting it into the right hands. I will be allocating funds to a publicist who will in turn present it to some of the more reputable blogs in an effort to create awareness for the project.</li>
<li>Visuals: Songs that have strong visual campaigns gives the songs an added level of awareness and support. I already have some unique concepts constructed for a few of the songs and will be collaborating with videographers to bring them to fruition.</li>
<li>Perks: I have some cool perks that you can get your hands on. The perks range from a facebook high-fives, to t-shirts and signed merch all the way to me cooking one of my favorite meals for you! You'll find them listed below.</li> <li>If I do not reach the goal then I will return to the closet finish the album and gas up the Uber car! Any funds received short of the goal will go towards Mixing and Mastering. These two may be the most critical elements of any musical project and cannot be compromised! </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>With your contribution to this project you have the unique opportunity to put an under-the-radar artist into the light and show the world that collaborations of this format can help unlock the creator's full potential. The purpose of this project:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>To display my musical talents and ability to coordinate a quality cast of individuals who are dedicated to producing quality art. </p>
</li> <li>
<p>To execute an industry ready and quality recording using what is considered to be a low budget. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
</p>
<p>To help create sustainably of future work for the artists and personnel used in the creation of this project. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
</p>
<p>To inspire the aspiring art creators of mine and future generations with the message of anything is truly possible with a little help. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
</p>
<p>To inspire the hearts of the listener to play an active role in the Loveolution!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul>
<li>Not securing collaborations: To overcome this obstacle I have a large network of highly competent and qualified individuals that will be more than ready to step in if I am unsuccessful in securing any of the envisioned collaborations due to budget or availability. </li>
<li>I've already taken the risks for you. I left my hometown with no other plan but to succeed and maximize my abilities as an artist. It's been nothing but a wonderful learning experience and adventure. Now all I need is a boost to show what I can really do with the appropriate resources.</li>
<li>Please feel free to research me @DameDrummer or DameTheDrummer, check out my social media outlets to check my consistency and even reach out to people that you see associated with me if you want an extra level of comfort in trusting me with your contribution.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you cannot contribute financially please share!!!</p> <ul> <li>Help spread the word for 30 days. Let people know that you're interested. Who knows the may take interest too. Word of mouth is still the #1 form of advertising! </li> <li>Indiegogo has some really cool sharing tools so use them as much as you'd like for 30 days until we hit the goal.</li> </ul> </div> <p>And that's all there is to it.</p></div>","About Me

I also mixed my first album which wasn't terrible but when stacked next to my competition (award-winning artists, mixing engineers and producers) the results are night and day in terms of sonic quality. With your support I get to delegate these critical elements of a successful album to the proper professionals. 
Mastering: The final polishing of the recording.
Manufacturing: There are still music enthusiasts who like hard copies (cd and vinyl) of their music.
Artistic Collaboration: On this album I want to feature some talent that perhaps you've heard of as well as turn you on to some talent that you may not know.
Marketing: For a record label some of their mid to high profile artists can get marketing budgets into the tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars. I believe that this project will be a matter of getting it into the right hands. I will be allocating funds to a publicist who will in turn present it to some of the more reputable blogs in an effort to create awareness for the project.
Visuals: Songs that have strong visual campaigns gives the songs an added level of awareness and support. I already have some unique concepts constructed for a few of the songs and will be collaborating with videographers to bring them to fruition.
Perks: I have some cool perks that you can get your hands on. The perks range from a facebook high-fives, to t-shirts and signed merch all the way to me cooking one of my favorite meals for you! You'll find them listed below. If I do not reach the goal then I will return to the closet finish the album and gas up the Uber car! Any funds received short of the goal will go towards Mixing and Mastering. These two may be the most critical elements of any musical project and cannot be compromised!     The Impact With your contribution to this project you have the unique opportunity to put an under-the-radar artist into the light and show the world that collaborations of this format can help unlock the creator's full potential. The purpose of this project:  
To display my musical talents and ability to coordinate a quality cast of individuals who are dedicated to producing quality art. 
 
To execute an industry ready and quality recording using what is considered to be a low budget. 




To help create sustainably of future work for the artists and personnel used in the creation of this project. 




To inspire the aspiring art creators of mine and future generations with the message of anything is truly possible with a little help. 




To inspire the hearts of the listener to play an active role in the Loveolution!



Risks & Challenges 
Not securing collaborations: To overcome this obstacle I have a large network of highly competent and qualified individuals that will be more than ready to step in if I am unsuccessful in securing any of the envisioned collaborations due to budget or availability. 
I've already taken the risks for you. I left my hometown with no other plan but to succeed and maximize my abilities as an artist. It's been nothing but a wonderful learning experience and adventure. Now all I need is a boost to show what I can really do with the appropriate resources.
Please feel free to research me @DameDrummer or DameTheDrummer, check out my social media outlets to check my consistency and even reach out to people that you see associated with me if you want an extra level of comfort in trusting me with your contribution.

<h3>A Little Bit About Us</h3>
<p>Well, hello there! We are Scarlet Cord, an Alternative Rock band from the island of Oahu, Hawaii. We have performed at a variety of venues including Ala Moana Center, Crossroads, Waikiki Shell, and multiple local bars. Recently, we have opened up for two popular, national bands: Hawthorne Heights and The Wonder Years.</p>
<p>We are in the process of recording our first full length album. We've been working hard in and out of the studio and we are super excited for you to hear the finished product. By donating funds to us through this campaign, you grant us more time in the studio and provide us with the capital to manufacture and distribute physical copies of the album.</p>
<p>Our first single off the album: Grandma, is available to stream for free at our website <a href=""http://scarletcordband.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://scarletcordband.com</a> as well as Spotify. It is also available to purchase on Amazon, iTunes, and other major online retailers. We are extremely excited and very close to completing our album, but we can't do it without your help! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal And Your Rewards</h3>
<p><u>Our goal</u> is to raise $1000, and <strong>all of it will</strong> (regardless of if we reach it or not)<i> </i>go into the production of our album, whether it be studio time or manufacturing physical copies of our album.</p>
<p><u>Your rewards</u>* come in a whole bunch of forms! Check it out:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 donations will recieve a personalized thank you email and drawing from Preston, Evan, Reese, and David </li>
<li>$10 donations will have their name in the credits of our album</li>
<li>$25 donations will receive a signed copy of the album. </li>
<li>$50 donations will receive a Scarlet Cord T-Shirt</li>
<li>$100 donations and Scarlet Cord will cover any song of your choice. </li>
<li>$150 donations will receive free concert tickets to our paid shows for the year of 2017</li>
<li>$200 donations will receive a personal dinner (with up to 3 other people) cooked by the band </li>
</ul>
<p>*Donating $25 will get you the respective reward as well as the rewards under it. (eg. $20 donations will receive the $10 and $5 reward etc.) </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Simply put: having an album is the first huge step towards making our ""local music"" into perhaps ""national music"" or even ""international music."" This as a result would give us the privilege of living primarily off of the money we make from our music and other merchandise. The best and most humbling part about it is it wouldn't be just us who would have gotten ourselves to that place. It would have started with you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>As a band that needs help financially, we completely understand if you aren't in a position to give. If that's you, but still would like to help, there are still many things crucial to the success of this campaign anyone can help us with!</p>

If contributions end up not covering all expenses, though, then the contributions received will be applied first to final mixing, then mastering, etc…The remaining costs will be covered by hook or by crook, so rest assured this album will be coming to you soon!Here is a detailed list of perks for each level of contribution:$20 preorder copy of Morning Stars$60 preorder signed copy of Morning Stars$80 preorder signed copy of Morning Stars + signed copy of American Bittersweet & World On Fire$100 all of the above + copy of handwritten lyrics for all songs on Morning Stars plus a t-shirt with the album cover (see the cover image for this campaign and the video)$200 all above + Shutterfly book of photos taken by acclaimed photographers Aaron Farrington and Jack Roebuck of me and the musicians in the studio recording$300 all above + copy of album the full GarageBand demos of Morning Stars I recorded prior to the studio recordings – these are intimate recording demos of the songs that will be featured on the final album$400 all above + your name in the album credits for Morning Stars$500 all above + I will record a fully arranged song for you – you pick, cover or original$750 all above + I will write and record a song for you (you provide me subject and theme)$1000 all above + a free private show (if out-of-state then pick a location in Virginia or pay travel fare) or I will co-write a song with you and record a demo of it with you.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you want to help but are not in a position to contribute financially, don’t worry!

</h3>Hello everyone, we're Black Label, a local band from Maastricht, the Netherlands. For five years, we've been making music together, and we've already recorded our first demo. Since we started the band, we've played over 100 shows and recorded a 5-track demo and 2 singles. Now, we're looking to record a 5-track EP, and we need your help to make it a reality!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What's in it for us, and what's in it for you?<br/>
</h3>We're keeping our expenses very simple. We are going to record the EP at the same recording studio we also used to record our 2 singles. At €400 per song, that's a €2000 budget we're going for.<br/><br/>Should we raise more than €2000 (haha, I know, right?), we'll put that money to funding the perks we're offering, and if we have money left after that, we're going to record a video for one of our songs!<br/><br/>For every level of contribution that you're willing to make to this cause, you'll receive a reward. These rewards range from a digital download of the EP, all the way to Black Label writing, recording and performing a song just for you!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Why it's important to fund your music scene...<br/>
</h3>Local bands, unlike the big bands with big labels behind them, are comprised of just regular Joes like you and I. Recording an EP takes time and money. We can put in the time, but the money is a challenge for us. Shows are unpaid more often than not, where we play just for the exposure and the good times, and the band is costing is money rather than making it.<br/><br/>We also want to keep a level of independence. Signing to a record label takes away a degree of freedom, and we believe that artistic and personal freedom is what rock 'n roll is all about. So we look to the community, the fans, the headbangers, the moshers, those who share our passion for music, to help us realise our goals.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What could possibly go wrong?<br/>
</h3>We've kept our goals modest, and we want to see how well this goes before committing to more serious projects. The worst that could happen is that we don't raise our €2000 goal, in which case we pay a little bit more to Indiegogo. The money we do raise goes into the recording process, naturally, and we'll have to chip in ourselves for as much as we can.<br/><br/>Even if we do not reach our goals, we are 100% determined to honour our commitments and give the perks to those who contributed to our cause!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help...</h3>We know that some of you, like us, share the passion for the music, but don't have a lot of money to spend.

The more people become aware, the easier it will be for us to make this a reality. Indiegogo has a lot of very handy sharing tools for all kinds of social media!<br/><br/>Come visit our shows!

<h3>Hi,</h3>
<p>I am Ireen Bill - a Female Bassist, Double Bassist, Singer, Songwriter and Girl-Child/Women Empowerment Advocate, from Nigeria, Africa.</p>

<p><i><strong>My brand stands to showcase the creativity, beauty and strength of the african woman </strong>and my</i> <i>music generally features strong African vocals , lyrics and percussions, laced with electric bass solos, bass lines and double bass grooves.</i></p>
<h3><i>You Gotta Be Stronger Than A Horse!</i></h3>

<p>TO BE A FEMALE IN AFRICA = CHALLENGING.</p>
<p>TO BE A FEMALE BASSIST, DOUBLE BASSIST AND SINGER = EXTRA-CHALLENGING.</p>

<h3><i>Here's a little part of my story......</i></h3>
<p><i>Years Ago, I fell in love with Music and the Bass. The passion grew so strong and  it gave me a purpose in life; one that would help people get better in every way, through my music.</i></p>
<p>Suddenly In 2010, I was involved in a ghastly motor accident that left 2 dead.</p>
<p>I was bedridden for months, almost giving up, gained a lot of weight, depression, anxiety and fear set in!</p>
<p>But my love for the bass and music, and the love from those my bass-playing and music inspired, gave me a reason to keep pushing, kept me motivated and got me up on my feet.</p>
<p>The bass, music and love revived me, and it has the power to do so for everyone out there;</p>
<p>This is my story; my message and this is why I need you to join me touch the world through my talent and music.</p>
<h3><i>Being Unique is Never Easy......... </i></h3>
<p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473450938/v7d7j3tuw6zx7hkqybjt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p>
<p><i><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;'>Sometimes you have to stand alone, not following the crowd, if you must be unique.</span></strong></i></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;'>I decided to be different and never giving up; even while faced with numerous challenges ranging from :</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of readily available - genuine support systems and backing for talented African females.</li>
<li>Fear of the unknown when I dumped my certificate as a graduate,to tread the path less travelled, with hopes of a fulfilling future.</li>
<li>Fear of the unknown, as i ventured into a future of majoring on an uncommon big thick- stringed instrument called the double bass ( which some people still call the big violin - like seriously??), yes and i have had to carry my 4/4 double bass on my back severally - you better believe it, see for yourself * </li>
</ul>

<ul><li>Fear of the unknown as I took up the electric Bass Guitar (which is a far cry from a sustainable income career),<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;'> while working on my singing and songwriting skills simultaneously.</span>
</li></ul>
<h3>What keeps me going has been :</h3>
<p>Everyone who has been entertained and inspired by my brand, talent and music.</p>
<p>Also, The young girls which my brand has given hope to, inspiring them to be creative, beautiful and strong - while achieving great feats and pursuing their dreams, no matter the limitations and challenges.</p>

<p>And its on this foundation that my Annual Girl-Child/Children Support Project was built.</p>
<h3>African Bass Charity Concert (ABC Concert)</h3>
<p>Talking about my passion for the Girl-Child/Children Support, every year i mark my birthday (28th September) with a charity project for children who have nothing and no one.</p>
<p>But this year, with your help - we ll be reaching out to helpless and homeless children in Nigerian internally Displaced Persons (IDP)  camps , through donations and the African Bass Charity Concert (<strong>ABC</strong>). </p>
<p><strong>ABC Concert</strong> will hold after the campaign, and your contributions - as little and easy as ABC-  will make a difference in the lives of these children..</p>
<h3>ITS JUST YOU AND ME!</h3>

<h3><i>So Here Is What We Are Gonna Do</i></h3>
<p>I want us to cover the costs of writing, recording, mixing, and mastering the B.I.L.L EP album to global standards and that is so expensive for an individual to fund.</p>
<p>The Funds will be spent On:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording Costs <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;'>For Studio Time, Gear, Engineers, Musicians, Backups, Production fees</span>
</li>
<li>Mixing &amp; Mastering.</li>
<li>Making Your Billonier T-shirts and Other Perks.</li>
<li>Charity Bass Concert And Donations to Children In IDP Camps</li>
<li> Initial CDs run for backers! </li>
<li>Transportation/Moving My Instruments and Gears For recording.</li>
<li>Indiegogo Fees</li>
<li>Web-related fees</li>
<li>Packaging, design et al.</li>

</div><p><strong>LOVE YOU MY BILLONIERS!</strong></p></div>","Hi,
I am Ireen Bill - a Female Bassist, Double Bassist, Singer, Songwriter and Girl-Child/Women Empowerment Advocate, from Nigeria, Africa.
My music borders on afropop with a rich mix of Afrobeats, Urban Highlife and Jazz. My fans and music lovers are called BILLONIERS*.

My brand stands to showcase the creativity, beauty and strength of the african woman and my music generally features strong African vocals , lyrics and percussions, laced with electric bass solos, bass lines and double bass grooves.
You Gotta Be Stronger Than A Horse!

TO BE A FEMALE IN AFRICA = CHALLENGING.
TO BE A FEMALE BASSIST, DOUBLE BASSIST AND SINGER = EXTRA-CHALLENGING.
As an African Female, most times you are expected to be normal ; doing all the normal things which the society expects of a woman.....
*sips tea*.
But that ain't gonna be me. I no go gree! ( pronounced i wont agree) *frowning face* Because i am ready for the challenge!

Here's a little part of my story......
Years Ago, I fell in love with Music and the Bass. The passion grew so strong and  it gave me a purpose in life; one that would help people get better in every way, through my music.
Suddenly In 2010, I was involved in a ghastly motor accident that left 2 dead.
I was bedridden for months, almost giving up, gained a lot of weight, depression, anxiety and fear set in!
But my love for the bass and music, and the love from those my bass-playing and music inspired, gave me a reason to keep pushing, kept me motivated and got me up on my feet.
The bass, music and love revived me, and it has the power to do so for everyone out there;
This is my story; my message and this is why I need you to join me touch the world through my talent and music.
Being Unique is Never Easy......... 

Sometimes you have to stand alone, not following the crowd, if you must be unique.
I decided to be different and never giving up; even while faced with numerous challenges ranging from :

Lack of readily available - genuine support systems and backing for talented African females.
Fear of the unknown when I dumped my certificate as a graduate,to tread the path less travelled, with hopes of a fulfilling future.
Fear of the unknown, as i ventured into a future of majoring on an uncommon big thick- stringed instrument called the double bass ( which some people still call the big violin - like seriously??), yes and i have had to carry my 4/4 double bass on my back severally - you better believe it, see for yourself * 


Fear of the unknown as I took up the electric Bass Guitar (which is a far cry from a sustainable income career), while working on my singing and songwriting skills simultaneously.

What keeps me going has been :
Everyone who has been entertained and inspired by my brand, talent and music.
Also, The young girls which my brand has given hope to, inspiring them to be creative, beautiful and strong - while achieving great feats and pursuing their dreams, no matter the limitations and challenges.

And its on this foundation that my Annual Girl-Child/Children Support Project was built.
African Bass Charity Concert (ABC Concert)
Talking about my passion for the Girl-Child/Children Support, every year i mark my birthday (28th September) with a charity project for children who have nothing and no one.
But this year, with your help - we ll be reaching out to helpless and homeless children in Nigerian internally Displaced Persons (IDP)  camps , through donations and the African Bass Charity Concert (ABC). 
ABC Concert will hold after the campaign, and your contributions - as little and easy as ABC-  will make a difference in the lives of these children..
ITS JUST YOU AND ME!

This music is ours, It's just you and me, no record label drama.
Its time for Ireen Bill and you the Billoniers to create something magical together!
Welcome to the Billoniers Club (Ireen Bill Fans ONly)!!!!
 I ,my manager and my team, promised ourselves to deliver nothing short of unique and magical contents to you my special billoniers.
( YASS!!! IREEN BILL'S fans, lovers and supporters are called BILLONIERS)

So Here Is What We Are Gonna Do
I want us to cover the costs of writing, recording, mixing, and mastering the B.I.L.L EP album to global standards and that is so expensive for an individual to fund.
The Funds will be spent On:

Recording Costs For Studio Time, Gear, Engineers, Musicians, Backups, Production fees

Mixing & Mastering.
Making Your Billonier T-shirts and Other Perks.
Charity Bass Concert And Donations to Children In IDP Camps
 Initial CDs run for backers! 
Transportation/Moving My Instruments and Gears For recording.
Indiegogo Fees
Web-related fees
Packaging, design et al.

Funds raised above the goal (stretch goals) will be directed towards higher production level, marketing, shooting a video, and helping those kids on a larger scale.
So, the more backers i get, the better chances i get at Bridging the Gap; touching the world and those children in the IDP camps.

If you can find the time to watch our video you'll see how our hard work and determination made Red Victor 3 the Worlds Fastest Street legal Car.  This success ignited American interest, and the title finally went stateside in 2014. We want to throw everything at regaining this title, and offer a real feel good project that the British people can get behind!</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>To have a serious shot at reclaiming the title as the Worlds Fastest Street Car we need to raise £50,000.</p><p>After losing the record to Larry Larsen, We were able to raise funds through our Facebook page and the creation of the Red Victor 5 Second Members Club, to fund our first package of upgrades to Red Victor. That work has been completed, and we made our first shake-down passes in May this year.  This new setup was a giant step forward for us and we ran the 1/4 mile in 6.37 seconds @ 234mph setting new personal bests for the car. This equates to 0-60mph in 1 second, and 0-234mph in 6.3 seconds!</p><p>Now we want to unleash the full potential of Red Victor in Bahrain, and not only reclaim the record but to smash it!</p><p>The dull reality is that the task of going fast costs a lot of money.  The money we are looking to raise will let us:</p><ul>
<li>Ship the car to Bahrain,</li>
<li>Relocate the team for 5 meetings,</li>
<li>Get a significant spares package,</li>

If you can find the time to watch our video you'll see how our hard work and determination made Red Victor 3 the Worlds Fastest Street legal Car.  This success ignited American interest, and the title finally went stateside in 2014. We want to throw everything at regaining this title, and offer a real feel good project that the British people can get behind!What We Need & What You GetTo have a serious shot at reclaiming the title as the Worlds Fastest Street Car we need to raise £50,000.After losing the record to Larry Larsen, We were able to raise funds through our Facebook page and the creation of the Red Victor 5 Second Members Club, to fund our first package of upgrades to Red Victor. That work has been completed, and we made our first shake-down passes in May this year.  This new setup was a giant step forward for us and we ran the 1/4 mile in 6.37 seconds @ 234mph setting new personal bests for the car. This equates to 0-60mph in 1 second, and 0-234mph in 6.3 seconds!Now we want to unleash the full potential of Red Victor in Bahrain, and not only reclaim the record but to smash it!The dull reality is that the task of going fast costs a lot of money.  The money we are looking to raise will let us:
Ship the car to Bahrain,
Relocate the team for 5 meetings,
Get a significant spares package,
Fund fuel, tyres, oil and spark plugs for the hungry engine
and to have a little in reserve in case we need to run any repairs!

<h3>MASSIMO KYO DI NOCERA BIOGRAPHY</h3>
<p>When I was a child I was feeling the Music as something higher and softer that, at the same time, could be part of my daily life and it could be with me in the ordinary activities, something accessible in every moment. I started my path of listening, studying and experimenting, passing through the channels that were available for me in that moment – in a friend’s garage, a guitar teacher from the parish church, and local concerts. During this growth I realized that the ""Musical World"" was polluted from a twisted thought of the society that influences a big part of the music business. I come away from it and I spent a period of loneliness venturing to the meditation, not knowing that the meditation itself would bring me back the Music and the Life. Now, I simply do the same things as ever, but with a different quality. I cannot find any better words than saying that my vision has been cleaned up: the mirror is the same, but the dust and the smudges that were darkening the image are gone away. I use the Music to dance and reconnect to myself and to the earth. I let myself go in the listening and I flow in the vast spaces that the Music brings to me. I spend many moments even listening to the Nature, which gives me the Infinity. And when I play and sing, my notes are like rays pursuing that Infinity.</p>

<h3>Family of God Story</h3>
<p>    There was a long period of time where I settled… I thought that I was never going to write and produce another album again. And I came to terms with that because I honestly wasn’t sure if I wanted to pour my heart out like that again. It’s much more comfortable writing songs and having other people sing them. But, I continued to write because it’s always been my passion and my offering to God. And as I kept writing I really felt the Lord’s leading and guidance to record again. Out of that, this collection of songs that I’m calling “Family of God” was born. <br/>    The majority of these songs were written from conversations I’ve had with people in my church and the many different circumstances that they are in. I believe this is one of the main reasons I have felt lead by the Lord to release these songs. Even starting with the title track, it was written as I was thinking about a couple in my church who is currently going through the adoption process. That got me thinking about how amazing it is that we have been invited into God’s family. There’s a song titled “Satisfied In You” that was written with a couple men in my life group, and as we talked about what was going on in our church, we realized the magnitude in which we all try and satisfy our hearts and souls and the need for love with insubstantial things. Yet, all we need to be satisfied is the love from our God.<br/>    Another set of songs were written about my own family. I’m a year into my marriage and songs were born out of that transition and joy. Songs about how to rely on God in my marriage. Trusting that He’s in control and that He’s sovereign.<br/>    With any family, we have victories and struggles. And we are forced to deal with these realities that I believe God has allowed us to go through. With the Family of God, I have wrestled heavily with questions filled with doubt and unworthiness. Appropriate questions about love and faith. Some with answers. And sometimes the only answer I can give is to surrender and sing, “God I trust You.” I sing about these thoughts throughout this album.<br/>    It’s been quite the journey in my head and in my heart to finally realize that God is really guiding this process to release these songs. I have full confidence that He will provide all that I will need to release this album. My hope is that you would partner with me in what our God is doing. I ask that you would ceaselessly pray for me and this album. Pray that my heart would be protected from earthly desires. I would love to write worship music for other artists as a full time job, but my aim here is to just to simply follow the Lord’s leading. Please pray for me and my wife as this will take away some of our time together. I can’t neglect my responsibilities and I need to be provide for my family. Though writing songs is my passion, my wife comes before music. I know that the amount of money I am trying to raise may seem a little daunting, but I with full faith believe that money is no obstacle for our God, nor anything else for that matter. Below I will provide the information on where each dollar is needed. Please ask any questions. I try to be a man of full transparency.<br/>    Would you please pray and consider what you could give to this project.<br/>    Thank you for taking the time to hear what the Lord is doing in my life. I’m excited. Thanks!</p>

<h3>So, 13K? Where's it all going?</h3>
<p>I am basing this estimate off of 13 tracks. Some are hard costs, and others are estimates and ranges.

<h3>I<strong>ndiegogo Is Where Low Country Hill Started</strong>
</h3>
<p>A remarkable thing happened to me three years ago.  With inexplicable courage, I decided to test my budding passion for songwriting by making a record.  I had some inkling that I would be in for a wild ride but could never have predicted both the rigour and joy that came with working with a producer, seasoned musicians and later performing in front of audiences.</p>
<p>In order to go ""above ground,"" I launched an Indiegogo campaign to fund my project. And to my jaw-dropping astonishment, 135 generous souls showed their belief in my artistic goal by contributing $8660 to the campaign!  That groundswell of support brought tonnes of energy to my first solo recording experience.  And without overstating the case, I'd say that making the record was one of the most creatively inspiring and joyful experiences of my life.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What Supporters Helped Accomplish</strong></h3>
<p>Thanks to the backing of my community of support, I was able make a record of artistic consequence with talented producer and musician, Dave King.  One music blogger called the record ""a provocative experimentation in sound and shape, featuring sonic sculptures with a sense of experimentation but grounded with heart and soul, and evoking the subdued comforts of a warm abode amidst a cold, punishing but beautiful landscape"" (Kent Heberling, Those Who Dig).  It was a  privilege to co-create with musical family and friends on the project.  I was also overjoyed to work with Pat Sansone from Wilco and Bill Dillon (Joni Mitchell, Peter Gabriel) who brought incredible artistry to their performances.   Both musicians are musical icons to me so I count myself blessed to have made music with them.  Lucky me!</p>
<p>The record received critical praise and was nominated for a 2015 Hamilton Music Award in the Roots/Solo category.  Low Country Hill was also a Hamilton regional finalist in CBC Searchlight 2015.  The favourable reception of the record also enabled me to perform over 50 concerts throughout Ontario and beyond.  I welcomed the challenge of translating the nuanced, expansive full-band sound on record into intimate, solo performances.  An added perk to performing was meeting so many music-loving, open-minded people, especially off the beaten path.  Some bookings even took me down logging roads and through May snow storms.  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What's Next?</h3>
<p>I'm sure it's no secret to you that mixing art and commerce successfully is a long shot.  No doubt I've felt the bump and grind of that dance in the last few years of promoting my debut record.  Yet, I feel that Low Country Hill has some unfinished artistic business and making another record is key to following that curiosity.  </p>
<p>It will cost about <strong>$12,000</strong> to make this new recording.  That's a lot of money.  But it quickly gets put to good use for studio, producer and musician fees, mixing and mastering costs as well as marketing and promotion.  I am asking you to help raise<strong> $8000</strong> of that amount with your EP pre-order contribution (see ""Perks"" for pre-order contribution amounts).  Fingers crossed that I'll have some success with an application for an artist development grant; the same goes for landing a few bookings in the new year.  Both of these revenue streams will also be of help in funding the project.</p>
<p>If we do not achieve the goal of raising $8000, I want to assure you that I will stretch your contributions to make a compelling record that still reaches for ambitious, artistic goals.  I want to make you proud to be part of this adventure.</p>
<p>If you have already supported me in the first Indiegogo campaign, I am very grateful to you for helping me get to this point of my artistic development. I am mindful that it's a big ask to request your support once more. So, if you do consider backing me a second time, I can only say thank you again and again for believing in my work.  If you came to enjoy Low Country Hill through live performances or listening to the record, I hope you will consider backing my campaign for the first time.</p>
<p>Thanks for giving this your energy and thought.  I look forward to sharing the music with you in the new year and sincerely hope it resonates with you. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With appreciation,</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, </p>
<p>My name is John Curry. I am a musician from Houston, TX.  My musical story starts when I was first around 4 years old learning the piano and singing as much as I possibly could. That eventually evolved and I began to play the guitar. I never gave much thought that music would take me anywhere but boy was I wrong. I signed my first record deal with a rock band from Houston called goneblind. We thought we had hit the big time but we were in for a rude awakening. After a bad deal, in which the label dropped us without even releasing our record, we were left to find ourselves struggling once again. We, as a band, were later picked up by Scott Stapp (Creed) to play the roles of writing, recording, and touring artists. Once again things fell apart and I began to resent music so much that I quit playing for years. After my life almost completely falling apart, I realized I was doing all of it for the wrong reasons! I started searching myself and really paying attention to what was going on around me. I decided to try to make a change. Make a change through music. I want to speak to people who feel like all hope is lost and relay the message that ""We can all truly change and make a difference"" and that we are all ""Still the Same"".</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise $5000.00 try continue with the ""Still the Same"" project. I have already spent around $6000 and have run out of funds to continue to promote my message and record and release more songs and videos. </p>
<p>Through the money that has already been spent the song has been added to more than 70 radio stations across the country and the video has been seen all across the world. I have also recieved 11 different licensing deals with MTV, Discovery Channel, TLC, OWN, A&amp;E, and NASCAR.</p>
<p>The $5000.00 will be spent as follows:</p>
<p>$1,300 left for radio promotions team Tinderbox Music</p>
<p>$800 for the company that obtained the licensing agreements</p>
<p>$1500 for recording, mixing, and mastering of the new song ""Stand With Me""</p>
<p>$1000 for shooting the new video for ""Stand With Me""</p>
<p>$400 for duplication of CD's</p>
<p>The perks are as follows:</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Houston Musician’s Song on Race…A View from the</p>
<p>Most Diverse American City</p>
<p>Houston, TX, : Local singer/songwriter John Vincent Curry, living in the most diverse city in the country, has released a new song and music video called ""Still the Same"" to inspire positive change in behavior and discussions on race. Tensions are high across the country with racial disparities in the criminal justice system. Shooting deaths of law enforcement spiked 78% in the first half of 2016 vs year ago with the killing of eight officers in Dallas and BatonRouge. In addition, the current presidential campaign has unleashed anger about race andimmigration. Americans are saying things about one another and to one another that have previouslybeen considered out of bounds.“We should be setting an example for the rest of the world and instead we are so far away from what America should stand for. We are all human and no matter our race or culture, the core of a person isthe same,” said John Curry.John Curry grew up in Lafayette, LA and while in high school he remembers the rhetoric and racialtension when David Duke, a former leader of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was running for governor. While Duke largely avoided explicit racial campaigning, he appealed to the frustrations and resentments of white voters. To Curry, the discourse during the campaign seemed regressive and out of touch. “It’s not the color of a man that defines him… it’s the actions in which he leads his life,” states John Curry. Since 1997, John Curry has made his home in Houston. Curry is currently the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist for the Houston band, Hounds of Jezebel. From 1999 – 2007, he was a member of the band goneblind, when they landed a recording deal with RoadRunner Records and toured nationally. The band garnered the attention of national recording artist, Scott Stapp, the lead vocalist of Creed, and was recruited to record and tour with Stapp. Still the Same song and video was produced by former goneblind/ Scott Stapp bassist, Mitch Burman who has operated music venues for 20 years in Houston and is an owner of Heights Guitar Tech. As a Caucasian man residing in Houston, Curry has been a part of the big diversity shifts. As of 2010, Houston metropolitan area is the most racially/ethnically diverse large in the nation, narrowly surpassing the New York metropolitan area, according to the Kinder Institute for Urban Research. The Anglo population represents a declining share of the Houston metropolitan area. In 1990, Anglos were more than half the population (57.9 percent), but by 2000 they decreased to slightly less than half the total population (48.2 percent), and by 2010 they were only 39.7 percent of the metropolitan population. At current rates of population change, Latinos are poised to become the Houston region’s largest racial/ethnic group. Among the five most populous metropolitan areas in Texas, Houston stands out for having no racial/ethnic majority and nearly equal percentages of the two largest race/ethnic groups (Latinos and Anglos). Curry is married and lives with his wife Samantha and their teenage son. They decided early on to raise their son in the city so that he could experience Houston’s tremendous racial diversity and the many cultures that knit the city together. The beat of the city suits John Curry. Houston’s feeling was squarely captured in the non-partisan mayoral election when African American candidate, Sylvester Turner, used the slogan “We’re All in this Together” and was elected in 2015. Still The Same, a message rooted in Houston, hopes to bring the country together.</p>
<p>Still the Same was recorded at Digital Warehaus Productions with engineer, Stephen Finley. It was mixed by multi-platinum producer, songwriter, John Kurzweg, best known for his work with Grammy artist band, Creed. The video was shot and edited by Amir Valinia, Director / Producer and President of AV1 Productions, and Jerry Lynch provided stage production, lighting and sound.</p>

<p>I realize that not everyone has the ability to contribute monetarily but there are many ways that you can help. Be proactive in your community. Volunteer your time, whether it be at a physical place or bring sack lunches to the homeless. Educate yourself on what's going on not only in your community but around the world.

<p>We are two people who love the Lord, have a passion for music, travel, and reaching as many people we can.  We have each been writing constantly for the past 2 years and when we met we realized that together we complement each others voices and style of playability. Our heart is to share what The Lord has done in each of our lives sharing hope, purpose and destiny.</p>
<p>We have decided to be called The Undefined. The reason for this you may ask is that we are not defined by this world we are defined by the Lord and only the Lord! not labels of Christianity, Messianic Judaism , or anything else, only that we would be known as lovers of the Lord God Yeshua Jesus!</p>

<p>My name is Keith Morrison.  I've run a professional recording studio ""Wee Studio"" in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland for 9 years.</p>
<p>This campaign is to film 60 traditional Scottish and Irish tunes at a slow pace so instrumentalists can slowly play along to learn the tune.</p>
<p>Not only will this be a LOT of fun to learn.  You will get a blast out of performing the same tunes with others.  It also enhances the local music scene and culture.  Which in turn will be fantastic for tourism, well being and the community</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need £1080 funding in total.  This covers:</p>
<p>-Studio Recording Time (Audio and Video)</p>
<p>-Post Production (Audio and Video)</p>
<p>-Performer/Tutor Fees</p>
<p>-Organisation and Delivery fees.</p>
<p>All of those videos will be uploaded onto YouTube to be easily streamed.  Also if you pledge £10 you get to download the video files to save and if you pledge £20 you get the video files and the sheet music to play along to.</p>

Wherever I am, art and music are at the centre of my life.I am very lucky to have a band comprising me (vocals / guitar), Joe Sharp (vocals / bass), Bob Turley (lead guitar) and Jamie Shaw (drums).--------------------In addition to these characters, there will be guest appearances on the album by other fine musicians, singers and artists!We have been working very hard on our new material and we are thrilled about the direction we find ourselves travelling in. It has involved a lot of time and effort and every second has been worth it. We are now ready and raring to go forward with this new album.The project will not be cheap. By paying for what we are offering in advance, you can really make a difference and help make this dream a reality.--------------------Where will the money go?All of the money raised will go towards the following:
Studio recording
Mixing
Mastering
CD and vinyl manufacture
PR
In reality, this will add up to more than £3000, but this amount will be enough to enable us to realise the project.As well as buying the album on CD and vinyl, there are a whole host of other perks for you to pick from. For instance, you can buy a book of lyrics, handwritten and signed by Dan, or you can have us play in a location of your choosing!--------------------Here's one we made earlier...In 2015, we released our debut LP, Of The Sea. This was partially made possible by crowdfunding. We are very proud of the result, which you can listen to HERE.--------------------ChallengesOne of the things we learned from our first album is not to rush things. When you work on something very closely, sometimes you need to take a step back, before returning later with fresh ears. That is why we will not be imposing a strict deadline on ourselves. It will be ready when it's ready!You can track the progress of the campaign on our Facebook page.This project will be a success because we are a band of good people, talented musicians and inspired creators (if we do say so ourselves).--------------------Other Ways You Can HelpWhatever you are able to contribute will mean a lot to us. You can also help massively by sharing this project with others. On this website, there are a number of tools to help you do this. Spreading the word is vital and will be hugely appreciated!---------- www.dankorn.co.uk",5.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hello, my name is Gareth. I work for <a href=""http://www.carousel.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Carousel</a> in Brighton, a charity that supports learning disabled artists.</p>
<p>I first met Daniel Wakeford in 2011, by which time he had been working with Carousel for a couple of years. He already knew that he wanted to make music the focus of his life, and that one day he would become a ‘famous pop star and a legend’.</p>
<p>Daniel has come a very long way since that first meeting; working with his song writing partner, Tom Cook, he has written well over a hundred songs, ten of which were recorded for his album last year <a href=""https://danielwakeford.bandcamp.com/album/the-songs-of-gigs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>The Songs Of Gigs</i></a><i>. </i> He represented the UK at the Song For Europe in Sweden in 2013 and last year Daniel completed a nine-date tour of the UK. The tour gained Daniel new exposure in mainstream media including interviews for <a href=""https://inews.co.uk/essentials/lifestyle/people/daniel-wakeford-the-undateables-music-interview/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">two national papers</a> and led to him being called ‘a legend and an inspiration’ by BBC Radio’s 6Music’s Marc Riley.</p>
<p>But Daniel’s music is a new discovery for many of his fans. In January 2017, his fourth appearance on Channel 4’s <i>The Undateables</i> featured Daniel going on tour and showcased his track <i>Playboy Girls</i>. The response was immediate and overwhelming. By the beginning of March, Daniel’s Facebook page had over 40,000 fans, he had accumulated over 125,000 plays on Spotify and <i>Playboy Girls </i>had topped the Spotify UK Viral Chart.</p>
<p>It is perfect timing for Daniel to be propelled in to the next stage of his career; he has the songs, the talent, the fans and certainly the potential to go all the way. This hike in popularity has happened very quickly. We’ve had many gig offers and requests from promoters and fans right around the UK. Carousel has been able to help Daniel make some of these opportunities happen by allocating funds from our core funding, but we can’t help Daniel to do all he wants to do without additional support.</p>
<p>That’s where we hope Daniel’s fans can help out…</p>
<p>Touring is an expensive feat for any artist to undertake. Costs are massively increased when supporting artists who have additional needs and who are vulnerable adults. Additional planning time, extra care support while on the road and longer, less gruelling schedules are just some of the things that we need to take in to account to ensure touring works for Daniel.</p>
<p>An average show costs £1,525.</p>
<p>Currently Daniel has committed to 5 shows, 3 of which have sold out at 200 capacity venues. The average ticket price has been £8. We’ve been working very closely with promoters and have been able to strike favourable fees, but once all expenses for venues have been factored in, we are still doing each show at a loss.</p>
<p>I believe that Daniel has already made a massive impact in challenging people’s expectations of people who have a learning disability, but at his live shows, audiences experience first-hand what is so inspiring about Daniel. Sure - he is a lovely, jolly and hugely charismatic individual – but on stage, he becomes a professional, a leader, the man in control of an entire room. He is in his element.</p>
<p>If we reach our £15,000 target, it will enable Daniel to perform ten gigs, in new places, to his new fans and allow him to show the UK what a talent they have in Daniel.</p>
<p>But this is just the start of the journey; if we raise more than our target, Daniel has lots of plans that we can help make real – a music video for Playboy Girls is top of the list - closely followed by a push for Eurovision stardom!</p>
<p>So please, have a look over the fantastic perks on offer and give if you can. If you can’t, there are plenty of other ways to support Daniel – follow his progress online by liking his <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/thedanielwakeford/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a>, listen to his <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/19eyvtrOXNOOm0Duas5ZDW"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">album</a>, tell your friends and come to a gig!</p>
<p>Whatever you do, you’ll know you were on board at the beginning of the journey.</p>

PART OF A BIGGER VISIONAll of our talents, experience and dreams are wrapped into this project.  Everything we've ever done has prepared us for this. 
 The Community Square is owned and operated by the Ocracoke Foundation. 
 They are thrilled to have a musical element in the Square that will 
attract locals and visitors in such a magical way.  The ultimate plan for the Community Square project is that as debt service is reduced and 
eventually eliminated, the Ocracoke 
Foundation will ensure that the income from the Community Square will 
become a permanent endowment for the Ocracoke community, and the property will be protected in perpetuity.  We are 
delighted to be a part of such a wonderful vision - a permanent community endowment!WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM OUR FRIENDSThe best thing you can do to help is to spread the word in every way you can.  There are Indiegogo Share Tools that can help you make noise about our campaign.
(Lou, Marcy and Martin at the first Coyote Plus One show May 2015 by Sundae Horn, click here for article written about this wonderful moment!)LEAP OF FAITHTaking on the stewardship and expense of a physical location
 is a huge leap of faith for us financially, but we are not afraid; we 
are informed by our years of experience, the solid success of Coyote's 
music, our musical partnership with 
Martin Garrish and the support of our community.  This concept has a
 life of its own already, we're just trying to hang on to its tail.  Our music, teaching and writing, along with our connection to community, is tried and true.  It DOES take a village and we are, gratefully, at the heart of this one.  This ... is love.Please visit, in person or on a web broadcast, there will be music and an open door waiting for you.

It started out me writing my own songs after playing in bands for many years. I had just come to New York and went through many big changes at the same time - and the loss of very close family members... but writing songs was a great way for me to deal with it. After the first record was done, I put a band together and since then, we have been playing live all over New York City and a bit in Germany, as well! Now the third album is finally finished - I only need to get the money together for the mastering and production cost of making CDs or Vinyl.</p>
<p>All the songs come from a truly deep and authentic place, and my band mates help me create the musical outcome of this! I am really proud of this one because it sounds really good. The first album, I recorded in my bedroom with a laptop and a SM 58 microphone. The drums, I recorded in my friends kitchen with 2 microphones! On the second album, things started sounding much better because I had learned to be a better recording and mixing engineer at that point- drums were recorded with 4 microphones! Now on this album, we went to my friend and occasional bass player Jonathan Granoff's studio in Brooklyn, and recorded the drums with 9 microphones and all sorts of fancy equipment! Besides, my drummer Yoshio Kobayashi is an amazing drummer and many of those songs we've been playing live, so we all had a feel for it when we recorded them. </p>
<p>I mixed and polished everything, and now it is so close to being finished and released to the public, only we need to go to the mastering studio, which will cost $1000 for this 12 song and 53 minute album! The mastering will be done by the amazing Alan Douches at WestWestSide Studios upstate New York. He had mastered the previous records ""rarara"" and ""tomorrow's far away"" as well, and did an excellent job - he is a true master, no pun intended! :) </p>
<p>Still, many songs deal with loss of people in my life - I hope it can be helpful to other people that go through a similar time. But there are also joyful songs about life, love, friendship and the seasons, so please join in and sing along!</p>
<p>I have tried to find a record label who would be interested in putting it out, that could hopefully pay for the mastering, but unfortunately, no record label said yay! But when we play live, and when I play the mixes to our friends and fans, people like it and keep encouraging me to follow through and finish it on my own. Finishing a record is always an important thing, it feels like the next stage of some kind. It's like giving birth to your creative ideas, and releasing it to the world, like a mama bird releasing its little birdies! So I can move and start working on the next record!<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
</div><div>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>
<p><strong>The finances</strong></p>
<p>Mastering will be $1000, if I make 100 CDs via CDbaby, thats about $300. Making vinyl, which would be amazing, would cost around $1800. The cost of PR for a record is tricky - it starts at $1000 and the sky is the limit - or, in a more down to earth music world, probably between $1000 and $5000. </p>
<p>Obviously, we take what we get and will be grateful and happy for any amount. The first and foremost will be the mastering. If there's not enough money now, there will be a digital release. Then the next expense should probably be the PR, so whatever stays left will be invested in that, and if there is money left after the minimum PR campaign, CDs and Vinyl shall be pressed and spread around!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will you get in return?</strong> </p>
<p>First of all, the knowledge that you helped and supported me! Also, the more you choose to donate, the bigger and better the reward you get! From receiving a digital release or signed copy of the CD, to having me/us play a private concert in your home! If you are unable to donate, maybe you can share this page and we will send you gratitude and love back through the ether! You can send me a message at doro@dorotheatachler.com if you have any questions, or if you want to sign up to our mailing list!</p>

<p>Hi!  I'm Toni.  I'm a dancer, singer-songwriter, workshop facilitator, founder of JourneyDance™ and creator of the Embodied Transformations Method for personal growth and development.  For the last 20+ years I have used movement and expression to help people get out of their minds and into their bodies and move into a new story.  My goal has been to create a wave of inspiration where people learn to love themselves, connect with their joy and find their personal power! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516079795/tyfswqudgmn9j1s7as6a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As I work with people, I find such a range of sadness and joy in the world.  I have started using songwriting and singing to release my own emotions and connect with people's stories.  Almost every song on this upcoming debut album was written in response to emotions I needed to express.  My title track Never Too Late was written to inspire those who feel they have lost their dreams, or that the pain of their past holds them back from fully living.</p>

<p>Two years ago I began sharing my music publicly during workshops and at open mic events.  I got some wonderfully positive responses and someone generously introduced me to my producer Jason Samonik.   We immediately clicked and became writing and musical partners.  He took my folky guitar songs and my piano ballads and turned them into epic musical pieces.</p>

<p>It's been a challenging process to uplevel my work and jump deeper into sharing my voice and message. For me, the voice is my most vulnerable place to share myself.  I'm pushing myself to my edge recording these songs, performing them and deciding to share them with the public.</p>

<p>This campaign is to help raise money for producing and completing this long-awaited project.  It's been a labor of love!  I just finished writing the last song for the album, Made From Love, about how my divorce impacted my sons.  I know many people will relate to it.  With your help, I can get these messages out into the mainstream!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Recording and production is a costly yet totally worthwhile venture.  I've loved every minute of it!  I've also spent a ton of my own personal money on this labor of love and I now need to raise funds to continue paying my producer to bring these songs to life on my first album.</p>

<p>You can probably tell I love connecting with people.  Your donation means so much to me because you will become a part of this project and getting it out to the world!!  I've created a bunch of perks as my way of saying thank you for your generous contributions.  There are even a few perks where we can connect directly, like songwriting workshops.</p>

<p>The goal I selected will allow me to complete a full CD of 11 songs.  If I don't reach my full goal, I will use the funds I do raise to work on as many tracks as I can and release them as singles.</p>

<h2>About Us, and Why This Matters So Much</h2>
<p>I run the DMT Tapes FL digital album archive, a collection of albums and artists that have come together to preserve an important piece of the vaporwave (and assoc. genres) community. The vaporwave scene began informally in 2010 and DMT Tapes FL has been proud to enter that rich genre history in late 2014; to this day, we are approaching 500 albums, and by the time the event of this campaign begins, we will be several dozen albums past that.</p>
<p>Preserving two things have always been important to our mission at DMT-FL: the first is to uphold the right for our entire roster to be preserved and archived, enjoyed by all who enjoy the pursuit of musical discovery; the second is to be a safe keep for artists wishing to have their music be a part of something larger than its individual release. Bringing together the fanbases of hundreds of vaporwave &amp; electronic artists has been a proven success across the middle and late 2010s, and when Vaporwave is Alive, pt. 1 occurred in January of 2016, it created a resonant effect on our listenership that has not stopped in the 2+ years since.</p>
<p>I wish to conduct a sequel to this event, one of extreme magnitude that has benefited all artists on the label both past, participating, and future. In addition to having this exposure boost for all releasing artists, I would love to pay each artist an equal fee via Paypal as a thanks for meeting the deadline of such a time-intensive event.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have seen it many releases come onto DMT Tapes FL that has received loads of listenership, but those who contributed funds were so low that there could be $3 across 3+ years. The model of promoting and supporting free listenership has led to DMT-FL having a 98% $0 download rate. This IndieGoGo would supplicate funds up-front, so that rather than waiting and hoping that each album gets equally supported (which doesn't ever happen), we have the ability to pay all artists on the release day. If an artist never makes the money in contributions back, it will not matter, as they will be happily paid within the very same few minutes after an album will go live.</p>
<p>I have come up with $625 based on the estimate of there being roughly 30 releasing artists; the $25 over 600 is to off-set the 5% IndieGoGo campaign fee. I would like to pay artists as close to $20 apiece, over if we happen to go over our goal and under only if we fail. I will see to it that every artist gets at least $10 in this event even if we fall short by some several hundred.</p>
<p>The perks are cheesy. We've always been digital-based because many of us lack the physicality, aptitude or ability to do things outside the computer-based realm. Nevertheless, I hope those of you who opt for the things we've come up with are able to enjoy them for what they're worth.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Only Contribute If You Both Can AND Wish</h3>
<p>If you love vaporwave music, if you love some or any or all of the hundreds of DMT Tapes FL artists you've met in 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, and if you hope to see an continuance of artists feeling like it is worth it to participate in widescale events that test the limits of their artistic fortitude, this is exactly the campaign for you to support. Vaporwave music has a rich history that will be remembered for generations to come, and this event will be remembered as an important cog in the machine of its being. Please consider being a part of its likeness today.</p>
<h3>Potential Impact</h3>
<p>The first Vaporwave is Alive, pt. 1 was conducted across the entire month of January 2016. In November of the same year, YouTube creator and world-record holder  for subscribers (both then and now) PewDiePie discovered our content and the music that came out during this event. He proceeded to plug and link his 50 million subscribers to our pages, flooding our downloads and plays stats in a way that they still look minorly effected 2+ years later. Albums from the last Vaporwave is Alive period also attracted the attention &amp; support of major players such as The Needle Drop, historic vaporwave label Ailanthus Recordings.</p>
<p>Conducting a sequel to an event that enriched this label so much is the most rational and necessary action I can take for bettering the position of every album &amp; artist who has released on DMT Tapes FL. By contributing to us here, you are now a part of that esteemed history.</p>
</div><h2>Artist Eligibility &amp; Selection</h2><p>Any and all artists who have a correspondent relationship with a member of DMT Tapes FL administration (e.g. any releasing artist on the label, artists/people who have reached out on social media to our channels in the past, etc.) will be eligible to apply for the July 2018 festival. I would love to bend time and space to create a day in July for every artist, but we are limited to 31 days. If we exceed this number in terms of eligible interested artists, we will have to determine by random draw which artists have been accepted. Please understand that this is the fairest way to accommodate what might be hundreds of artists who may be interested. It is also to be noted that a few artists have been guaranteed spots prior to this event being confirmed as happening, so the random draw will be around 25 people. Those who don't get into for July 2018 will be allowed to release in June or August; EVERY artist who asks to be in will get to release for DMT-FL as long as they are okay with accepting a consolation release date in the case of us running out of days.</p><p>Due to the nature of this campaign, albums coming out in months other than July cannot presently be paid upfront for. We know that our network understands this (hence the need for a crowdfund at all).</p><div> </div><div>
<h3>Ways to Help Without Spending a Single Cent</h3>Listen to the music, tell the artists on social media that they're doing amazing work, make a playlist of your favorite songs and share it with friends or family or your social network, share the link to this campaign, or simply enjoy a nostalgic memory about how much music means to you. The spirit of what we're doing at DMT Tapes FL is larger than simply listening to what we have to offer. We hope you bring the joy and love of music into your life everywhere you go.</div></div>","About Us, and Why This Matters So Much

<p>«<i>Bonjour
à tous, je m’appelle Eric Clermontet et je suis passionné de musique et de digital. Vous avez peut-être vu mon nom apparaître sur quelques pochettes de disques des années 80/90, à l’époque où j’étais UNO et je réalisais et produisais des albums comme ""Osez Joséphine"" d'Alain Bashung, et ceux de Stephan Eicher, Mory Kante, Luna Parker, Jean-Louis Aubert, Bill Deraime, Viktor Lazlo et bien d’autres </i><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">! </i></p>
<p><i>C’est pour créer des histoires digitales, qu’en 2008 j’ai fondé E2C2, une agence de storytelling digitale pionnière des réseaux sociaux d’entreprise et professionnels et ce n'est qu'en 2015 que grâce aux demandes de mes amis musiciens et professionnels de la production musicale que je pouvais enfin associer mes 2 grandes passions, </i><i>la création musicale et le digital en un seul et même projet :<br/><br/></i></p>

<h3><b>QU’EST-CE QUE GO4MUZIK?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Aujourd'hui, un projet musical c'est bien plus que de la musique.</p>
<p>Ce sont des musiciens et des professionnels avec qui collaborer pour créer une œuvre qu'on n'aurait pu finaliser tout seul. Ce sont aussi des auteurs, des compositeurs, des interprètes, des managers, des éditeurs, des tourneurs, des managers, des avocats, des techniciens qui vous aideront à mener à bien votre projet…</p>
<p>Et enfin, un projet musical c'est un public, une communauté dont les attentes doivent être nourries par des créations de qualité !</p>

«Bonjour
à tous, je m’appelle Eric Clermontet et je suis passionné de musique et de digital. Vous avez peut-être vu mon nom apparaître sur quelques pochettes de disques des années 80/90, à l’époque où j’étais UNO et je réalisais et produisais des albums comme ""Osez Joséphine"" d'Alain Bashung, et ceux de Stephan Eicher, Mory Kante, Luna Parker, Jean-Louis Aubert, Bill Deraime, Viktor Lazlo et bien d’autres ! 
C’est pour créer des histoires digitales, qu’en 2008 j’ai fondé E2C2, une agence de storytelling digitale pionnière des réseaux sociaux d’entreprise et professionnels et ce n'est qu'en 2015 que grâce aux demandes de mes amis musiciens et professionnels de la production musicale que je pouvais enfin associer mes 2 grandes passions, la création musicale et le digital en un seul et même projet :







QU’EST-CE QUE GO4MUZIK?

Aujourd'hui, un projet musical c'est bien plus que de la musique.
Ce sont des musiciens et des professionnels avec qui collaborer pour créer une œuvre qu'on n'aurait pu finaliser tout seul. Ce sont aussi des auteurs, des compositeurs, des interprètes, des managers, des éditeurs, des tourneurs, des managers, des avocats, des techniciens qui vous aideront à mener à bien votre projet…
Et enfin, un projet musical c'est un public, une communauté dont les attentes doivent être nourries par des créations de qualité !


GO4MUZIK est une plateforme collaborative qui permet aux artistes de solliciter une communauté de professionnels passionnés qui proposent leurs compétences: c’est également un réseau social qui permettra aux professionnels de se connecter entre eux et de trouver des opportunités de travail grâce à leur expérience et à leur réputation




COMMENT ÇA FONCTIONNE ?
GO4MUZIK  est une application qui créé un cadre professionnel de mise en relation

Pour les Artistes en recherche de collaborations professionnelles et/ou de prestations
Pour les Professionnels en recherche d’opportunités de collaboration
Pour les Pros et les Artistes une mise en relation sécurisée avec les prestataires de services de l’industrie musicale (avocats, manager, tourneur, salle de spectacle, etc...)




RETROUVEZ NOS PARRAINS* SUR GO4MUZIKils sont notre source d’inspiration et sans leur soutien actif rien n’est  possible





* Hubert, tu nous manques, on penses à toi très fort
OSEZ, OSEZ
 




OK ! MAIS POURQUOI JE DEVRAI M’ABONNER A GO4MUZIC ?

En image parce que ça raconte l'histoire plus efficacement pour les créateurs/créatifs



Et pour les professionnels










POUR QUI ?





POUR QUOI FAIRE* ?
* Quelques exemples










MERCI A VOUS !
Nous avons besoin de votre soutien pour concrétiser ce projet !
Lisez ce qui suit  pour voir comment. !

NOS OBJECTIFSEn créant GO4MUZIK pour le public nos objectifs sont :

De créer un réseau social professionnel de la musique
De proposer aux créateurs une offre de services de professionnels dont la réputation est validée et commentée par la communauté
De permettre aux professionnels de se connecter et de trouver les meilleures opportunités de collaboration
D’agréger et de présenter l’offre créative musicale à l’industrie musicale dans sa globalité
De permettre aux éditeurs et diffuseurs audio-visuels de solliciter de nouveaux talents par de concours et des appels à candidature
De rompre l’isolement des créatifs en les connectant aux meilleurs professionnels et aux meilleures pratiques
De sécuriser les offres entre artiste et prestataires

Nous pensons
que GO4MUZIK peut créer la
révolution digitale que tous les professionnels attendent pour développer leurs
activités musicales - et nous n’avons jamais été aussi prêts de faire de cette
révolution une réalité.





CE DONT NOUS AVONS BESOIN
ET CE QUE VOUS POUVEZ FAIRE POUR NOUS AIDER


Notre idéal de financement est de 150 000 €.
Néanmoins,
conscients du caractère incertain de la démarche, nous avons prévu de pouvoir
faire progresser le projet même si nous collectons moins, cela prendra juste
plus de temps, de négociations et plus de chance… 
(note: nous saurons aussi faire
avec plus que l’objectif…)

Terry Burns and Ron Kristy met  in Nashville, where they were both  already independent, successful songwriters and musicians. They were married in 2004, and began creating music together in 2011 in Ithaca NY. “Burns and Kristy” was born out of their musical union… and one thing they knew early on was that spiritual music would be an important part of their musical journey together. They both felt that in these difficult times, the healing power of music can help create harmony, connection, and peace in people and in the world.          <br/></p><p>Terry and Ron's wish is to bring this CD into your hearts and homes, and to reach out to spiritual centers and teachers who are interested in bringing messages of peace and understanding to others.

Terry Burns and Ron Kristy met  in Nashville, where they were both  already independent, successful songwriters and musicians. They were married in 2004, and began creating music together in 2011 in Ithaca NY. “Burns and Kristy” was born out of their musical union… and one thing they knew early on was that spiritual music would be an important part of their musical journey together. They both felt that in these difficult times, the healing power of music can help create harmony, connection, and peace in people and in the world.          Terry and Ron's wish is to bring this CD into your hearts and homes, and to reach out to spiritual centers and teachers who are interested in bringing messages of peace and understanding to others. They see this CD being sold in yoga and meditation centers, retreat centers, churches, and workshop settings where community and sustainability are the focus.

While other initial previewers from in and out of the sound room have picked their favorite songs based on musical style, it is difficult to put her music in one specific genre since it integrates rock, funk, soul, electronic, and even classical sounds. Her music has recieved some great responses and is unique in that it does mix multiple types of genres.</p><p>Two Steps<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XlFphWAXqAM"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FXlFphWAXqAM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXlFphWAXqAM&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FXlFphWAXqAM%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div>The song “Two Steps” stands out as a catchy tune that mixes funk rhythms and integrates a syncopated chorus and fun dance beat. The song’s final mix was done by multi-platinum and grammy nominated engineer, Benny Steele, who has mixed songs and worked with top artists such as Justin Bieber, David Guetta, Jason Derulo, and Pitbull. He describes Darling’s writing as “Classic” and proclaims her as an “incredible singer/songwriter”. <i>(<a href=""http://soundbetter.com/profiles/21759-alice-d/reviews"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://soundbetter.com/profiles/21759-alice-d/reviews</a>)</i><i>   </i>               <br/><p></p><div>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>While “Two Steps” offers a funk inspired guitar rhythm, the song “What I Want” composes differently, much like a rock song, including two rhythm guitars and a lively pop beat. The music sounds light, the vocals are soulful, and most of the instrumentation comes from a synthesizer keyboard to create a fresh vibe.</p>
<p>Another track on the album called “Euro” is an electronic dance song with a heavy kick drum beat. It is unique in a way that does not contain the repetitious loops associated with typical electronic music. This instrumental arrangement incorporates horns and violins, and the bulk of the song features the synthesizer keyboard which gives off a sweeping and uplifting melody.</p>
<p>“I’ll Say It”, in which New York Advertiser Richard Ferelli (Greengage Associates) describes as “Haunting”, denotes a classical influence. The arrangement stirs the emotions and is reminiscent of a movie score. Joining Darling on the single are singer Reggie Honere, who counters in a duet, and classically trained violinist Yoed Nir.</p>
<p>When the album is complete, Darling says her next step is to tour the country for the album release and continue to write and produce songs full time.</p>

</p><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">IVA is a crossover project that I started in 2004 after I’d been cast to sing on Late Night with Conan O’Brien. At the time I was studying classical voice at Juilliard, but wanted to say even more as an artist. I created the name IVA to represent a woman living at her full potential who inspires others to do the same. I began to explore all aspects of my voice to express myself and my music.</span><br/></p>
<p>IVA has been evolving for twelve years now. Six of those I spent in Sweden, where I was a pop star on national radio and television while singing at the Royal Opera of Stockholm. I was in Billboard magazine and on the front page of magazines and newspapers in Sweden. But financial woes at the Royal Opera prompted me to return to the U.S. to continue to develop my sound, this time with a band. </p>
<p>I have faced many challenges as an artist, both financial and mental when setbacks have shaken my confidence. Despite adversity, this past year I’ve made some important breakthroughs. I released my third album, “Leap”, to my first U.S. radio play on NPR and tastemaker stations. The Vasa Order of Sweden also recognized me with an award for my unique contributions to culture as a classical and popular artist. The Swedish-American of the Year award has gone to Ann Margaret, Buzz Aldrin, Chief Justice Rehnquist and this year to Nils Lofgren of Bruce Springsteen’s E-street band. It was a true lift to my career at a challenging time in my personal life.</p>
<p>Creativity has always come with an investment of heart and soul, but the financial returns have not been so easy. The market for music has changed a great deal, and illegal downloading has made it difficult to make money from recordings. Many record labels have shut down, or taken on less projects. Crowdfunding has made it possible for independent artists to turn to their own fan base for support, and listeners can be valuable contributors to the creative process. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My last album was funded by a successful Kickstarter campaign, when we raised $15,000, 150% of our goal. The support was overwhelming, a huge lift knowing I had so many people behind me. Your contribution for this new album will make it possible for us to record and promote our album with some of the best people working in the music industry, building upon our work from the last album. You will also help touch the hearts of the people who hear IVA, and help that feeling reach many more listeners. </p>
<p><b>THE TEAM</b></p>
<p>This year I’ve had the opportunity to work with two pivotal musicians at the top of their game - <b>Jaron Olevsky</b> and <b>Trey Pollard</b>. The sound they gave my songs motivated me to start this album project. Jaron Olevsky and I were introduced at Philly’s Milkboy studios and Jaron helped me with my piano arrangements until he demoed one of my new songs in his new home studio. The sound was incredible and we decided to do more. </p>
<p>Meanwhile I had gone to the World Cafe Live to see Natalie Prass perform. I fell in love with her record after a voice student of mine played it for me. Trey Pollard, who’s gorgeous arrangements frame her songs, was playing guitar and we spoke after the concert. I sent him a few of my new songs and we agreed to work on them together. Dream come true here!</p>
<p>Here are Jaron and Trey’s bios so you can get to know them better:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Jaron Olevsky</b> is a multi-instrumentalist and producer in Philadelphia. He’s played in Bluenote and Republic Records artist Amos Lee’s band for over a decade as bass player and now as keyboardist and Music Director. They have toured with Norah Jones, Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, Paul Simon, Merle Haggard, Van Morrison, John Prine, Dave Matthews Band, Adele, the Zac Brown Band, Jack Johnson, The Avett Brothers, and David Gray. I just heard his music direction live at Amos’s most show and it is just perfect. We’ll be recording in his home studio and at gorgeous new studio Rittenhouse Soundworks in Germantown, PA. </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Trey Pollard</b> is a guitarist, arranger, producer and pedal-steelest and will write the arrangements for the new songs. He co-produced and arranged Natalie Prass’s breakthrough album, released last summer, which was recognized at one of the Best New Albums by music review website Pitchfork. It was his arrangements on this album that truly blew my mind, and I am so thrilled that he will work on my songs for this album. I’ll be driving down to Spacebomb studios in Richmond, Virginia, be there for the recording of the arrangements with Trey and their crew of musicians.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>And, of course, my amazing band will be a part of the album. Sam Nobles will play bass, Matt Scarano will play drums, and Nate Gonzalez will add guitar. In addition Jim Hamilton, who built the gorgeous Rittenhouse Soundworks studio, will play percussion on the album. </p>

anyone tapping their foot to a song or sound or humming a tune in our heads
that brings back memories. Music is and has been
alive and well. Music drives our lives and has great effect on all of us in
one-way or another. It has been scientifically established  that music does indeed have healing power. Music may well be considered the universal
language. </p>

<h4><b>The Story</b></h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The healing power of music has been
referenced for centuries. Throughout history the idea of music as a healing
modality was well founded in Chinese, Egyptian and Greek history, suggesting
music is comforting, soothing and restorative for the soul.</span></h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/>Contemporary research shows that
music therapy benefits patients with stress, psychological and physical
problems. This brings about a sense of well being which helps manage illnesses
of all kinds.  Renowned Dr. Oliver Sachs,
neurologist, claims “music is the pathway in all patients”.  </span></h4>
<p><a href=""http://www.oliversacks.com/books-by-oliver-sacks/musicophilia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.oliversacks.com/books-by-oliver-sacks/musicophilia/</a><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">  </b></p>
<p>A recent study in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, published in the UK, concluded that people
with depression who listened to music at least one hour each day reported a
reduction of symptoms of up to 25%. Another study by researchers at the
Cleveland Clinic in the US found that music helps ease unrelenting,
non-malignant pain in patients. Music has also been found effective in managing
pain caused by cancerous conditions in the body and procedural pain such as
chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Dr. Diana Vetter, a lead surgery researcher at the University
of Zurich in Switzerland, said “Informing
our patients before scheduled surgeries of the positive effect of music on
their wellbeing could be a low cost intervention that may enhance wellbeing and
possibly faster recovery”.</p>
<p>To assess
the impact of music on surgical outcomes, Vetter and colleagues analyzed data
from 47 studies, including 26 that looked at the effect of music before
procedures, 25 looking at music in the operating room, and 25 looking at music
during recovery. Overall, music was linked to about 31 percent less pain, 29
percent lower odds of using pain medication, and 34 percent less anxiety. In addition,
music was tied to 40 percent lower blood pressure and 27 percent lower heart
rate. </p>
<p>""There now seems to be enough
evidence to support the formal adaptation of music interventions in clinical
guidelines."" said
Marianne van der Heijden, a researcher at Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia
Children's Hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.</p>
<p>Music
interventions shouldn't be difficult to provide at all and could be realized by
creating awareness among hospital staff, patients and their family members
about the positive effects of music,"" van der Heijden added. <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/music-not-just-good-soul-good-body-180422525.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://news.yahoo.com/music-not-just-good-soul-good-body-180422525.html</a></p>

<p><b>The Story Continued</b></p>
<p>Music Therapy is an established health
profession in which music is used to address physical, emotional, cognitive,
and social needs of individuals. Music therapy also provides avenues for
communication that can be helpful to those who find it difficult to express
themselves in words. Research in music therapy supports its effectiveness in
many areas such as: overall physical rehabilitation and facilitating movement,
increasing people's motivation to become engaged in their treatment, providing
emotional support for clients and their families, and providing an outlet for
expression of feelings. </p>

<p><strong><span>Top 12 brain-based reasons
why music works in therapy, </span></strong><strong>by
Karen Merzenich, writer-editor Brain HQ from Science Post, May 10, 2013</strong></p>
<p>1. 
<b>Music is
a core function in our brain.</b> Our
brain is primed early on to respond to and process music. Research has shown
that day-old infants are able to detect differences in rhythmic patterns.Mothers across cultures and throughout time have used
lullabies and rhythmic rocking to calm crying babies. From an evolutionary
standpoint, music precedes language. We don’t yet know why, but our brains are
wired to respond to music. </p>
<p>2. 
<b>Our bodies entrain to rhythm</b>. Have
you ever walked down the street, humming a song in your head, and noticed that
your walking to the beat? That’s called entrainment. Our motor systems
naturally entrain, or match, to a rhythmic beat. When a musical input
enters our central nervous system via the auditory nerve, most of the input
goes to the brain for processing. But some of it heads straight to motor nerves
in our spinal cord. This allows our muscles to move to the rhythm without our
having to think about it or “try.” It’s how we dance to music, tap our foot to
a rhythm, and walk in time to a beat. This is also why music therapists can
help a person who’s had a stroke re-learn how to walk and develop strength and
endurance in their upper bodies.</p>
<p>3. 
<b>We have physiologic responses to music</b>. Every
time your breathing quickens, your heart-rate increases, or you feel a shiver
down your spine, that’s your body responding physiologically to music.
Qualified music therapists can use this to help stimulate a person in a coma or
use music to effectively help someone relax.</p>
<p>4. 
<b>Children (even infants) respond readily to music</b>.
Any parent knows that it’s natural for a child to begin dancing and singing at
an early age. My kids both started rocking to music before they turned one. And
have you seen the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikTxfIDYx6Q"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YouTube video of the baby dancing to Beyonce</a>? Children learn through music, art, and play, so
it’s important (even necessary) to use those mediums when working with children
in therapy.</p>
<p>5. 
<b>Music taps into our emotions</b>. Have
you ever listened to a piece of music and smiled? Or felt sad? Whether from the
music itself, or from our associations with the music, music taps into our
emotional systems. Many people use this in a “therapeutic” way, listening to
certain music that makes them feel a certain way. The ability for music to
easily access our emotions is very beneficial for music therapists.</p>
<p>6. 
<b>Music helps improve our attention skills</b>.
I was once working with a 4-year-old in the hospital. Her 10-month-old twin
sisters were visiting, playing with Grandma on the bed. As soon as I started
singing to the older sister, the twins stopped playing and stared at me, for a
full 3 minutes. Even from an early age, music can grab and hold our attention.
This allows music therapists to target attention and impulse control goals,
both basic skills we need to function and succeed.</p>
<p>7. 
<b>Music uses shared neural circuits as speech</b>.
This is almost a no-brainer (no pun intended), but listening to or singing
music with lyrics uses shared neural circuits as listening to and expressing
speech. Music therapists can use this ability to help a child learn to
communicate or help someone who’s had a stroke re-learn how to talk again.</p>
<p>8. 
<b>Music
enhances learning</b>. Do you remember how you learned
your ABCs? Through a song! The inherent structure and emotional pull of music
makes it an easy tool for teaching concepts, ideas, and information. Music
is an effective mnemonic device and can “tag” information, not only making it
easy to learn, but also easy to later recall.</p>
<p>9. 
<b>Music
taps into our memories</b>. Have
you ever been driving, heard a song on the radio, then immediately been taken
to a certain place, a specific time in your life, or a particular person? Music
is second only to smell for its ability to stimulate our memory in a very
powerful way. Music therapists who work with older adults with dementia have
countless stories of how music stimulates their clients to reminisce about
their life.</p>
<p>10. 
<b>Music is
a social experience</b>. Our
ancestors bonded and passed on their stories and knowledge through song,
stories, and dance. Even today, many of our music experiences are shared with a
group, whether playing in band or an elementary music class, listening to jazz
at a restaurant, or singing in church choir. Music makes it easy for music
therapists to structure and facilitate a group process.</p>
<p>11. 
<b>Music is
predictable, structured, and organized–and our brain likes it</b>! Music often has a predictable steady beat,
organized phrases, and a structured form. If you think of most
country/folk/pop/rock songs you know, they’re often organized with a
verse-chorus structure. They’re organized in a way that we like and enjoy
listening to over and over again. Even sound waves that make up a single tone
or an entire chord are organized in mathematical ratios–and our brains really
like this predictability and structure.</p>
<p>12. 
<b>Music is
non-invasive, safe and motivating</b>.
We can’t forget that most people really enjoy music. This is not the most
important reason why music works in therapy, but it’s the icing on the cake.</p>
<p><b>The Evidence On Music Therapy Continued</b>,
from Evidence – Based Living, Cornell University </p>
<p>We’ve all
heard the idiom, “Music is good for the soul.” But, according to the evidence,
it’s good for your health as well.</p>
<p><a href=""http://archpedi.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1712579"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A new study published in the <i>Journal of the American Medical
Association</i></a> found that children admitted to
the emergency department who listened to music during routine procedures showed
less distress and reported lower pain scores than those who didn’t listen to
music.</p>
<p>The study
included a total of 42 children aged 3 to 11 years who had an IV line placed.
Half of them were randomly selected to listen to music selected by a music
therapist during the procedure. Health care providers reported that it was
easier to insert the IV line in children who were listening to the music and health
providers also reported more satisfaction with the placement compared to those
who did not listen to music.</p>
<p>Those are
some convincing results, but still only a single study. So we went looking for
systematic reviews on the impact of music in medical settings. It turns out,
there is plenty more evidence showing the positive effects of music on
health.  Among them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006911.pub2/abstract"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A 2011 review published in the Cochrane libraries</a> found music therapy and music medicine
     interventions can help cancer patients. The review found some positive
     effects of music on anxiety, pain, mood, quality of life, heart rate, respiratory
     rate, and blood pressure.</li>
<li>Another <a href=""http://summaries.cochrane.org/CD004517/music-therapy-for-depression"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cochrane review published in 2009</a> looked for studies measuring whether music
     therapy is useful in treating depression. The reviewers only found five
     studies appropriate for the review. Four of them concluded that patients
     exposed to music therapy had a greater reduction in symptoms compared to
     those who didn’t listen to music.</li>
<li>And <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-2648.2002.02052.x/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a third review published in the <i>Journal of
     Advanced Nursing</i></a> in
     2002 looked at the impact of music therapy on patients admitted to the
     hospital. Researchers reviewed 19 studies, and found music therapy
     improved patients anxiety levels in the hospital. Researchers recommended
     music therapy as an effective way to calm patients.</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<p><b>The
bottom line: There is plenty of evidence to show that music therapy used in
health care settings  can help calm
patients. And given there are no side effects associated to music listening,
it’s certainly a treatment worth trying.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<br/>
<p><b>Benefits
Of Music In Schools</b></p>
<p>Nearly everyone enjoys music, whether by listening to it,
singing, or playing an instrument. But despite this almost universal interest,
many schools are having to do away with their music education programs. This is
a mistake, with schools losing not only an enjoyable subject, but a subject
that can enrich students’ lives and education. Read on to learn why music
education is so important, and how it offers benefits even beyond itself.</p>
<p>1.<b> Musical training helps develop language and reasoning:</b>
Students who have early musical training will develop the areas of the brain
related to language and reasoning. The left side of the brain is better
developed with music, and songs can help imprint information on young minds.</p>
<p>2. <b>A mastery of memorization:</b> Even when performing
with sheet music, student musicians are constantly using their memory to
perform. The skill of memorization can serve students well in education and
beyond.</p>
<p>3. <b>Students learn to improve their work:</b> Learning
music promotes craftsmanship, and students learn to want to create good work
instead of mediocre work. This desire can be applied to all subjects of study.</p>
<p>4. <b>Increased coordination:</b> Students who practice
with musical instruments can improve their hand-eye coordination. Just like
playing sports, children can develop motor skills when playing music.</p>
<p>5. <b>A sense of achievement:</b> Learning to play pieces
of music on a new instrument can be a challenging, but achievable goal.
Students who master even the smallest goal in music will be able to feel proud
of their achievement.</p>
<p>6. <b>Kids stay engaged in school:</b> An enjoyable
subject like music can keep kids interested and engaged in school. Student
musicians are likely to stay in school to achieve in other subjects.</p>
<p>7. <b>Success in society:</b> Music is the fabric of our
society, and music can shape abilities and character. Students in band or
orchestra are less likely to abuse substances over their lifetime. Musical
education can greatly contribute to children’s intellectual development as
well.</p>
<p>8. <b>Emotional development:</b> Students of music can be
more emotionally developed, with empathy towards other cultures They also tend
to have higher self esteem and are better at coping with anxiety.</p>
<p>9. <b>Students learn pattern recognition:</b> Children can
develop their math and pattern-recognition skills with the help of musical
education. Playing music offers repetition in a fun format.</p>
<p>10. <b>Better SAT scores:</b> Students who have experience
with music performance or appreciation score higher on the SAT. One report
indicates 63 points higher on verbal and 44 points higher on math for students
in music appreciation courses.</p>
<p>11. <b>Fine-tuned auditory skills:</b> Musicians can
better detect meaningful, information-bearing elements in sounds, like the
emotional meaning in a baby’s cry. Students who practice music can have better
auditory attention, and pick out predictable patterns from surrounding noise.</p>
<p>12. <b>Music builds imagination and intellectual
curiosity:</b> Introducing music in the early childhood years can help foster a
positive attitude toward learning and curiosity. Artistic education develops
the whole brain and develops a child’s imagination.</p>
<p>13. <b>Music can be relaxing:</b> Students can fight
stress by learning to play music. Soothing music is especially helpful in
helping kids relax.</p>
<p>14. <b>Musical instruments can teach discipline:</b> Kids
who learn to play an instrument can learn a valuable lesson in discipline. They
will have to set time aside to practice and rise to the challenge of learning
with discipline to master playing their instrument.</p>
<p>15. <b>Preparation for the creative economy:</b> Investing
in creative education can prepare students for the 21st century workforce. The
new economy has created more artistic careers, and these jobs may grow faster
than others in the future.</p>
<p>16. <b>Development in creative thinking:</b> Kids who
study the arts can learn to think creatively. This kind of education can help
them solve problems by thinking outside the box and realizing that there may be
more than one right answer.</p>
<p>17. <b>Music can develop spatial intelligence:</b>
Students who study music can improve the development of spatial intelligence,
which allows them to perceive the world accurately and form mental pictures.
Spatial intelligence is helpful for advanced mathematics and more.</p>
<p>18. <b>Kids can learn teamwork:</b> Many musical education
programs require teamwork as part of a band or orchestra. In these groups,
students will learn how to work together and build camaraderie.</p>
<p>19. <b>Responsible risk-taking:</b> Performing a musical
piece can bring fear and anxiety. Doing so teaches kids how to take risks and
deal with fear, which will help them become successful and reach their
potential.</p>
<p>20. <b>Better self-confidence:</b>
With encouragement from teachers and parents, students playing a musical
instrument can build pride and confidence. Musical education is also likely to
develop better communication for students.</p>

The Campaign
Not all people in the global community have ready access to music and its availability. Millions of people who are afflicted with physical or mental illness may not have access to music, and to the benefits that listening to one’s favorite music can bring.  In its simplest form music can bring the healing power to anyone that listens.
We all know that music is in our lives every day and in every way. Music is not only on the
radio, but on television, in motion pictures, as soundtrack in the electronic
games we play, broadcast and download music available in many forms.
Music has
been around since the very beginnings of time, from ancient tribal drums and
sounds through development of technology over decades to modern times. 
Music and it’s rhythmic motions can be as simple as
anyone tapping their foot to a song or sound or humming a tune in our heads
that brings back memories. Music is and has been
alive and well. Music drives our lives and has great effect on all of us in
one-way or another. It has been scientifically established  that music does indeed have healing power. Music may well be considered the universal
language. 

The Campaign Plan
The mission of Music Has Healing Power
foundation is to bring healing, empowerment and awareness throughout the global
community by delivering free music through distribution of individual MP3 players to
needing recipients. These recipients can be an individual family member, a
known friend or a group of people in a gathered situation such as a hospital,
hospice or other community facilities. We will reach people who are in need and
who have been inflicted with illness or disease, disability, as well as, people
who have the inability to afford music & an MP3 player to use for the
healing power of music.

The Story
The healing power of music has been
referenced for centuries. Throughout history the idea of music as a healing
modality was well founded in Chinese, Egyptian and Greek history, suggesting
music is comforting, soothing and restorative for the soul.
Contemporary research shows that
music therapy benefits patients with stress, psychological and physical
problems. This brings about a sense of well being which helps manage illnesses
of all kinds.  Renowned Dr. Oliver Sachs,
neurologist, claims “music is the pathway in all patients”.  
http://www.oliversacks.com/books-by-oliver-sacks/musicophilia/  
A recent study in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, published in the UK, concluded that people
with depression who listened to music at least one hour each day reported a
reduction of symptoms of up to 25%. Another study by researchers at the
Cleveland Clinic in the US found that music helps ease unrelenting,
non-malignant pain in patients. Music has also been found effective in managing
pain caused by cancerous conditions in the body and procedural pain such as
chemotherapy.
Dr. Diana Vetter, a lead surgery researcher at the University
of Zurich in Switzerland, said “Informing
our patients before scheduled surgeries of the positive effect of music on
their wellbeing could be a low cost intervention that may enhance wellbeing and
possibly faster recovery”.
To assess
the impact of music on surgical outcomes, Vetter and colleagues analyzed data
from 47 studies, including 26 that looked at the effect of music before
procedures, 25 looking at music in the operating room, and 25 looking at music
during recovery. Overall, music was linked to about 31 percent less pain, 29
percent lower odds of using pain medication, and 34 percent less anxiety. In addition,
music was tied to 40 percent lower blood pressure and 27 percent lower heart
rate. 
""There now seems to be enough
evidence to support the formal adaptation of music interventions in clinical
guidelines."" said
Marianne van der Heijden, a researcher at Erasmus Medical Center - Sophia
Children's Hospital in Rotterdam, The Netherlands.
Music
interventions shouldn't be difficult to provide at all and could be realized by
creating awareness among hospital staff, patients and their family members
about the positive effects of music,"" van der Heijden added. http://news.yahoo.com/music-not-just-good-soul-good-body-180422525.html

The Story Continued
Music Therapy is an established health
profession in which music is used to address physical, emotional, cognitive,
and social needs of individuals. Music therapy also provides avenues for
communication that can be helpful to those who find it difficult to express
themselves in words. Research in music therapy supports its effectiveness in
many areas such as: overall physical rehabilitation and facilitating movement,
increasing people's motivation to become engaged in their treatment, providing
emotional support for clients and their families, and providing an outlet for
expression of feelings. 
Examples of therapeutic
music which are noteworthy, from American Music
Therapy Association, (AMTA)
- A person with Alzheimer’s listening to an MP3 player with headphones of his/her
favorite songs.
- A piano player in the lobby of a hospital
- Nurses playing background music for patients

Top 12 brain-based reasons
why music works in therapy, by
Karen Merzenich, writer-editor Brain HQ from Science Post, May 10, 2013
1. 
Music is
a core function in our brain. Our
brain is primed early on to respond to and process music. Research has shown
that day-old infants are able to detect differences in rhythmic patterns.Mothers across cultures and throughout time have used
lullabies and rhythmic rocking to calm crying babies. From an evolutionary
standpoint, music precedes language. We don’t yet know why, but our brains are
wired to respond to music. 
2. 
Our bodies entrain to rhythm. Have
you ever walked down the street, humming a song in your head, and noticed that
your walking to the beat? That’s called entrainment. Our motor systems
naturally entrain, or match, to a rhythmic beat. When a musical input
enters our central nervous system via the auditory nerve, most of the input
goes to the brain for processing. But some of it heads straight to motor nerves
in our spinal cord. This allows our muscles to move to the rhythm without our
having to think about it or “try.” It’s how we dance to music, tap our foot to
a rhythm, and walk in time to a beat. This is also why music therapists can
help a person who’s had a stroke re-learn how to walk and develop strength and
endurance in their upper bodies.
3. 
We have physiologic responses to music. Every
time your breathing quickens, your heart-rate increases, or you feel a shiver
down your spine, that’s your body responding physiologically to music.
Qualified music therapists can use this to help stimulate a person in a coma or
use music to effectively help someone relax.
4. 
Children (even infants) respond readily to music.
Any parent knows that it’s natural for a child to begin dancing and singing at
an early age. My kids both started rocking to music before they turned one. And
have you seen the YouTube video of the baby dancing to Beyonce? Children learn through music, art, and play, so
it’s important (even necessary) to use those mediums when working with children
in therapy.
5. 
Music taps into our emotions. Have
you ever listened to a piece of music and smiled? Or felt sad? Whether from the
music itself, or from our associations with the music, music taps into our
emotional systems. Many people use this in a “therapeutic” way, listening to
certain music that makes them feel a certain way. The ability for music to
easily access our emotions is very beneficial for music therapists.
6. 
Music helps improve our attention skills.
I was once working with a 4-year-old in the hospital. Her 10-month-old twin
sisters were visiting, playing with Grandma on the bed. As soon as I started
singing to the older sister, the twins stopped playing and stared at me, for a
full 3 minutes. Even from an early age, music can grab and hold our attention.
This allows music therapists to target attention and impulse control goals,
both basic skills we need to function and succeed.
7. 
Music uses shared neural circuits as speech.
This is almost a no-brainer (no pun intended), but listening to or singing
music with lyrics uses shared neural circuits as listening to and expressing
speech. Music therapists can use this ability to help a child learn to
communicate or help someone who’s had a stroke re-learn how to talk again.
8. 
Music
enhances learning. Do you remember how you learned
your ABCs? Through a song! The inherent structure and emotional pull of music
makes it an easy tool for teaching concepts, ideas, and information. Music
is an effective mnemonic device and can “tag” information, not only making it
easy to learn, but also easy to later recall.
9. 
Music
taps into our memories. Have
you ever been driving, heard a song on the radio, then immediately been taken
to a certain place, a specific time in your life, or a particular person? Music
is second only to smell for its ability to stimulate our memory in a very
powerful way. Music therapists who work with older adults with dementia have
countless stories of how music stimulates their clients to reminisce about
their life.
10. 
Music is
a social experience. Our
ancestors bonded and passed on their stories and knowledge through song,
stories, and dance. Even today, many of our music experiences are shared with a
group, whether playing in band or an elementary music class, listening to jazz
at a restaurant, or singing in church choir. Music makes it easy for music
therapists to structure and facilitate a group process.
11. 
Music is
predictable, structured, and organized–and our brain likes it! Music often has a predictable steady beat,
organized phrases, and a structured form. If you think of most
country/folk/pop/rock songs you know, they’re often organized with a
verse-chorus structure. They’re organized in a way that we like and enjoy
listening to over and over again. Even sound waves that make up a single tone
or an entire chord are organized in mathematical ratios–and our brains really
like this predictability and structure.
12. 
Music is
non-invasive, safe and motivating.
We can’t forget that most people really enjoy music. This is not the most
important reason why music works in therapy, but it’s the icing on the cake.
The Evidence On Music Therapy Continued,
from Evidence – Based Living, Cornell University 
We’ve all
heard the idiom, “Music is good for the soul.” But, according to the evidence,
it’s good for your health as well.
A new study published in the Journal of the American Medical
Association found that children admitted to
the emergency department who listened to music during routine procedures showed
less distress and reported lower pain scores than those who didn’t listen to
music.
The study
included a total of 42 children aged 3 to 11 years who had an IV line placed.
Half of them were randomly selected to listen to music selected by a music
therapist during the procedure. Health care providers reported that it was
easier to insert the IV line in children who were listening to the music and health
providers also reported more satisfaction with the placement compared to those
who did not listen to music.
Those are
some convincing results, but still only a single study. So we went looking for
systematic reviews on the impact of music in medical settings. It turns out,
there is plenty more evidence showing the positive effects of music on
health.  Among them:


A 2011 review published in the Cochrane libraries found music therapy and music medicine
     interventions can help cancer patients. The review found some positive
     effects of music on anxiety, pain, mood, quality of life, heart rate, respiratory
     rate, and blood pressure.
Another Cochrane review published in 2009 looked for studies measuring whether music
     therapy is useful in treating depression. The reviewers only found five
     studies appropriate for the review. Four of them concluded that patients
     exposed to music therapy had a greater reduction in symptoms compared to
     those who didn’t listen to music.
And a third review published in the Journal of
     Advanced Nursing in
     2002 looked at the impact of music therapy on patients admitted to the
     hospital. Researchers reviewed 19 studies, and found music therapy
     improved patients anxiety levels in the hospital. Researchers recommended
     music therapy as an effective way to calm patients.


The
bottom line: There is plenty of evidence to show that music therapy used in
health care settings  can help calm
patients. And given there are no side effects associated to music listening,
it’s certainly a treatment worth trying.


Benefits
Of Music In Schools
Nearly everyone enjoys music, whether by listening to it,
singing, or playing an instrument. But despite this almost universal interest,
many schools are having to do away with their music education programs. This is
a mistake, with schools losing not only an enjoyable subject, but a subject
that can enrich students’ lives and education. Read on to learn why music
education is so important, and how it offers benefits even beyond itself.
1. Musical training helps develop language and reasoning:
Students who have early musical training will develop the areas of the brain
related to language and reasoning. The left side of the brain is better
developed with music, and songs can help imprint information on young minds.
2. A mastery of memorization: Even when performing
with sheet music, student musicians are constantly using their memory to
perform. The skill of memorization can serve students well in education and
beyond.
3. Students learn to improve their work: Learning
music promotes craftsmanship, and students learn to want to create good work
instead of mediocre work. This desire can be applied to all subjects of study.
4. Increased coordination: Students who practice
with musical instruments can improve their hand-eye coordination. Just like
playing sports, children can develop motor skills when playing music.
5. A sense of achievement: Learning to play pieces
of music on a new instrument can be a challenging, but achievable goal.
Students who master even the smallest goal in music will be able to feel proud
of their achievement.
6. Kids stay engaged in school: An enjoyable
subject like music can keep kids interested and engaged in school. Student
musicians are likely to stay in school to achieve in other subjects.
7. Success in society: Music is the fabric of our
society, and music can shape abilities and character. Students in band or
orchestra are less likely to abuse substances over their lifetime. Musical
education can greatly contribute to children’s intellectual development as
well.
8. Emotional development: Students of music can be
more emotionally developed, with empathy towards other cultures They also tend
to have higher self esteem and are better at coping with anxiety.
9. Students learn pattern recognition: Children can
develop their math and pattern-recognition skills with the help of musical
education. Playing music offers repetition in a fun format.
10. Better SAT scores: Students who have experience
with music performance or appreciation score higher on the SAT. One report
indicates 63 points higher on verbal and 44 points higher on math for students
in music appreciation courses.
11. Fine-tuned auditory skills: Musicians can
better detect meaningful, information-bearing elements in sounds, like the
emotional meaning in a baby’s cry. Students who practice music can have better
auditory attention, and pick out predictable patterns from surrounding noise.
12. Music builds imagination and intellectual
curiosity: Introducing music in the early childhood years can help foster a
positive attitude toward learning and curiosity. Artistic education develops
the whole brain and develops a child’s imagination.
13. Music can be relaxing: Students can fight
stress by learning to play music. Soothing music is especially helpful in
helping kids relax.
14. Musical instruments can teach discipline: Kids
who learn to play an instrument can learn a valuable lesson in discipline. They
will have to set time aside to practice and rise to the challenge of learning
with discipline to master playing their instrument.
15. Preparation for the creative economy: Investing
in creative education can prepare students for the 21st century workforce. The
new economy has created more artistic careers, and these jobs may grow faster
than others in the future.
16. Development in creative thinking: Kids who
study the arts can learn to think creatively. This kind of education can help
them solve problems by thinking outside the box and realizing that there may be
more than one right answer.
17. Music can develop spatial intelligence:
Students who study music can improve the development of spatial intelligence,
which allows them to perceive the world accurately and form mental pictures.
Spatial intelligence is helpful for advanced mathematics and more.
18. Kids can learn teamwork: Many musical education
programs require teamwork as part of a band or orchestra. In these groups,
students will learn how to work together and build camaraderie.
19. Responsible risk-taking: Performing a musical
piece can bring fear and anxiety. Doing so teaches kids how to take risks and
deal with fear, which will help them become successful and reach their
potential.
20. Better self-confidence:
With encouragement from teachers and parents, students playing a musical
instrument can build pride and confidence. Musical education is also likely to
develop better communication for students.

<p>Hello!
I’m Michael Levy, a lifelong folk, gospel and jazz musician and
songwriter, and advocate for the sustainable well-being and beauty of
our planet. “Great Big Love” is a collection of songs I've
written over the past few years as a <b>passionate
approach to engaging and empowering people on </b><b>climate
change,</b> one of the most
crucial challenges in the history of our species. Just because we are
in a time of global crisis doesn’t mean we should stop singing.
Quite the contrary! (<u><a href=""https://michaellevyband.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here's
a link</a></u> to some
songs I've recorded already.)</p>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>I have begun recording
these songs because I feel they have to potential to help empower
people far and wide, in places I may never get to myself. Although I
have spent a few thousand dollars of my own money, I need help to create a complete CD and downloadable
album of professionally-made recordings. 

Money that you contribute will all be
spent on the recording process, which costs upwards of $1,000 per
song. Your contribution of any size will be a huge help in getting
the music to the people! 
</p>
<b><h3>What we need<br/>
</h3></b><p></p>
</div><div> <p>
</p>
<p>
My immediate goal is to raise $5,000,
which is the minimum required to finish the CD. However, the STRETCH
goal is $10,000, which will provide more hours of valuable studio
time, additional top-notch musicians, and an overall better result.
My SUPER YOGA GUMBY STRETCH goal of $15,000 means the best of
everything, including bringing in a professional producer to add
polish to the creation, which could allow this music to achieve even
wider distribution.</p>
<ul> </ul>
<b><b><b><h3>What you get (perks! perks!)</h3></b></b></b>
<p>OK,
now the fun part: what you get at different donation levels. There
are a whole range of perks, from a hug and hi-five at the $5 level to
a private house concert (and more) at the $500 level. Check out all
of them on the right side of the page. <b>(Note: to make sure you get the perk, click on the perk itself, not the Contribute Now button.)</b><br/></p>
<p>And
guess what? Even if I don't reach my basic funding goal :-(  you're
still guaranteed to get all your perks!</p>

the reality of climate change about 10 years ago, I have found that feelings of isolation, fear and
powerlessness are the biggest pitfalls that
stop people from taking action – and lead to burnout for activists.
That's why I started writing these songs. At my concerts, I have
found that people feel the togetherness they need in order to dare to
care, to consider what they might like to do, or to keep going with
their work. They no longer feel like they have to hold the crisis at
bay, in a painful corner of their minds. <br/></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> I'm Joshua Lee, the Founder of this project. I am a musician/singer/songwriter; mostly in the rock and acoustic-driven genre. I am trying to provide an option for the kind of people who provided me care when I had NOTHING. The homeless pandemic in this country is ridiculous, especially when those who have the least are usually more generous than anyone else. There is nothing more heart wrenching to me than to see someone who has nothing be treated worse than a stray dog. So, with the connections I have I'm going to put out this new album with appearances by some well known (and some lesser known) musicians. I can't divulge the possibilities yet, but they are endless depending on the amount of support we get for this cause. With your help, we can make sure that a lot of men, women and children have a great Christmas IN DOORS, with dignity, warmth, and love...and hopefully a steady income and a home of their own. I promise you will NOT be disappointed in the songs, lineup, or the wonderful production by Mr. Ben Trexel.</p>

 I'm Joshua Lee, the Founder of this project. I am a musician/singer/songwriter; mostly in the rock and acoustic-driven genre. I am trying to provide an option for the kind of people who provided me care when I had NOTHING. The homeless pandemic in this country is ridiculous, especially when those who have the least are usually more generous than anyone else. There is nothing more heart wrenching to me than to see someone who has nothing be treated worse than a stray dog. So, with the connections I have I'm going to put out this new album with appearances by some well known (and some lesser known) musicians. I can't divulge the possibilities yet, but they are endless depending on the amount of support we get for this cause.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Raising funds to bring Hafler Trio (Andrew McKenzie) to Austin for a 4-day workshop culminating in a 5th day performance by workshop participants, with some sections of time open to the public for experience and participation if they choose.  We specifically need money to cover Mr. McKenzie's transportation from Estonia to Austin, as well as room and board during his stay.</p>
<p>"" ''''''' "" (Seven Quotation Marks) by Hafler Trio. March 1st - March 5th, 2017.   Open to absolutely anyone interested with or without any artistic or musical experience. Workshop covers a variety of performance, conceptual, psychological and personally meaningful topics, culminating in a 5th day of 12-14 hour performance opportunity available to workshop participants.  Performance will be recorded and an edited version will be provided by Andrew exclusively to the workshop particpants only - these recordings will not be available to the public or anyone else in any other medium.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are a group of experimental and avant-garde art &amp; music fans, creators and performers who have been enthusiastic fans of Hafler Trio for many decades</li>
<li>We have received Andrew's permission to organize his workshop and a group performance of his piece "" ''''''' "" (Seven Quotation Marks) for March 1st through March 5th, 2017, and we need your help to raise the funds to produce the event.</li>
<li>BUT....  WE NEED THE FUNDS SOONER THAN LATER, because if we wait until January or February, we will miss various deadlines and would likely not be able to produce the event.</li>
<li>This will be the first time that Hafler Trio has performed in the United States in many years, and the first time Andrew has been back to Texas in more than 25 years!  As such this workshop and performance not only presents a rare opportunity to experience the Hafler Trio, but a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn from and collaborate with Andrew McKenzie himself!  The workshop and performance are open to absolutely anyone; there is no musical or artistic experience required whatsoever.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need funding to cover Andrew McKenzie's transportation costs, food and lodging; fees for our workshop and performance spaces; costs of the audio and other equipment required to produce the show; artist fees; show programs and other printed materials &amp; marketing costs</li>
<li>If you sign up as a participant, you will get FIVE DAYS with Andrew McKenzie!  Depending on which level you sign up at, you will also receive a recording of the performance edited by Mr. McKenzie after the event, that is ONLY AVAILBLE TO WORKSHOP PARTICIPANTS.  There will also be a level where you receive the "" ''''''' "" (Seven Quotation Marks) book, which contains relevant background and detail about the piece. (UPDATE: The book WILL NOT be amended with information from the Austin performance as previously reported.  You will receive the book as currently available.  Apologies for any confusion regarding this.)</li>
<li>If we do not reach our entire goal in time, we will seek to reschedule the event at a later date if Andrew is amendable to this, or we will use it to bring another experimental music performer in the future.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This piece "" ''''''' "" (Seven Quotation Marks) has never been performed in the US, has only been performed anywhere a handful of times, and in general Mr. McKenzie has withdrawn from the regular release of music through the physical and digital means common these days.  Additionally, this piece is designed to stretch the personal capacities of all involved in ways that truly provide a transformative experience that will continue to unfold in their lives long after the performance is over.</li>
<li>In our world of throw-away products and experiences, "" ''''''' "" (Seven Quotation Marks) is the exact opposite, and as a result *cannot not* have an impact on the performers and audience that goes far beyond anything they can experience anywhere else in their lives.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Put simply, if we are<ul>
<li>1.) not able to secure approximately 10 to 15 people who can commit to the full workshop, and</li>
<li>2.) not able to raise at least $2000 by December 31st, 2016, we risk the entire project being postponed indefintely or cancelled.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Having secured Mr. McKenzie's agreement to come to Austin, this would be a major disappointment and there is a likelihood that Mr. McKenzie would not agree to return at a later date.  We have his agreement now, so it would be a shame to let it slip through our fingers!</li>
<li>We are also seeking funding from various grant organizations, however most of them require some existing funds that they will match or multiply.  For example, one grant program will match what we raise if they see there is enough interest and benefit to the community, so if we are able to raise $2000, they will provide $2000 as well.  If we can engage a few of these programs and leverage the funds we raise here, we might be able to match our goal very quickly.  However this entirely depends on raising the initial funds here.</li>
<li>One of the ways that grant organizations measure interest and benefit is by the number of workshop participants and advanced ticket sales, so if you are interested, PLEASE SIGN UP for the workshop ASAP, or if you can't make the workshop, PURCHASE YOUR TICKET instead.  The sooner you do this, the better we will be able to make our case to the granting organizations, and the more secure this whole project becomes!</li>

<p>This photo was taken at the first venue I attended open mic nights - The Hard Rock Cafe, Sydney in 2014.</p>
<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Nina. I'm 21 and I'm from the Gold Coast, Australia. I moved here a bit over two years ago from Sydney after leaving uni and found music. Ever since I've been writing and playing wherever I could get the opportunity. I've played countless open mic night's, paid gigs and even have performed at weddings. It has never been so clear that all I want to do is music, however it hasn't always been that way.</p>
<p>When I was younger I actually wanted to be a Latin &amp; Ballroom dancer. I danced for seven years, even won medals but when a singing teacher started teaching at my high school and my friend suggested I take lessons I was curious. That's when I got the bug.

<p>Songwriting wasn't something that came easily to me. I could come up with a tune almost instantly but I felt stuck for words. I started out when I was 15 trying to write out lines that rhymed with each other to form the structure of a song which could take me days and the story wouldn't be real. It's amazing to look back as now I'll be driving to work and a whole song will come to me instantaneously.  I hear so often from people that listen to my performances, ""that song should be on the radio"", and they have no idea how much I want to make this happen.</p>
<p>I have songs in a folder that I wrote from way back when I was 15 but with time my writing has changed and I have five songs I'm dying to get out into the world to perform and sell. Realistically after performing for over three years the next step is to record and release music.</p>
<p>Without releasing something I will stay at a stand still and I can't let that happen. I can't work in an office job the rest of my life and not have given my best shot at trying to make it in something that would give me immense joy to wake up and do everyday.</p>
<p>With this help I will be able to record the EP and get the kick start I need to put it out there. This would be creating the first step but the most important. THE MUSIC. If you know are a musician or understand the process you know that this is the most integral part of what makes an artist. Your help is going to start the biggest change in my life.</p>

<h3>The Funding</h3>
<p>I'm attempting to fund just the recording of the EP itself which is $5000, for those of you musos reading this includes mixing and mastering so it's a great deal. I have gotten many quotes from different recording studios around the same price but I'd really like to work with a producer by the same of Sean Carey from Thirsty Merc. He has done some amazing work not only in the band but with many awesome releases for other artists.</p>
<p>This is the major start guys. I am going to be playing as many gigs as I can, working as many hours as possible to fund the rest of this release. Once it's recorded the ball will be rolling and I can start setting dates for release.</p>
<h3>What You'll Get</h3>
<p>Not only will you be making this EP with me but you'll be pre-purchasing a signed copy. There will also be posters and an option of house concerts for those who live in Byron Bay, Gold Coast and Brisbane.</p>
<p>If I don't get the target amount I am putting the full amount towards recording this EP. It is just going to take me longer to raise the rest of the funds myself.</p>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>The main challenge with this is securing a date to say I'm recording this. I can't secure anything until I have the funds so unfortunately it's all riding on finances. I've said that this is the year I make a change and make progress. This is the first step but even without it I will make this happen whether it takes me longer or not.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You have no idea how much of a difference this would make for me to be able to record this.

Who Am I?
Hi,
My name is Nina. I'm 21 and I'm from the Gold Coast, Australia. I moved here a bit over two years ago from Sydney after leaving uni and found music. Ever since I've been writing and playing wherever I could get the opportunity. I've played countless open mic night's, paid gigs and even have performed at weddings. It has never been so clear that all I want to do is music, however it hasn't always been that way.

<h3>Our Master Project</h3>
<p>Out of the turmoil that followed the 2011 earthquake and tsunami, our band distilled a new style of Japanese art to bring to the world, which it termed ‘chaos’, or KAO=S. Our sound is a blend of vocals (Kaori Kawabuchi) and acoustic guitar (Shuji Yamagiri) overlaid with traditional Japanese instruments such as the three-string Tsugaru shamisen (Jack) using a full range of effects. Complemented by a spellbindingly powerful sword dance, we have quickly caught people’s attention.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fgaVzOXP8Iw"" width=""560""></iframe></div></div>
<div>With our Master Project crowdfunding campaign, we want to produce a six track album and accompanying music video to be released by December 31st, 2017. We've decided to turn to crowdfunding, because we want to produce a truly master class album - but producing a high quality album is expensive. These days it has become easier and easier to produce music cheaply and easily. But we plan to work with some of the best musicians and artists for our masterpiece, an album that will be legendary in quality.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KAO=S has been lucky enough to visit many countries around the world to perform. We have been influenced by the folk and traditional music of everywhere we have traveled to. Drawing on these wonderful influences, we want to make an album that shows off the traditional instruments and music of the world by combining it with our unique Japanese art rock sound.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If our crowdfunding campaign is successful, we'll produce one of the highest quality, most unique and interesting albums to come out of modern Japan. We hope you are looking forward to listening to our Master Project. We hope to do a world tour with our album once it is finished, so with your help we'd love to perform it live for you, in your own country!</div>
<div> </div>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 

Opus 5 is composed of musicians from the Philadelphia area. Each member has studied music at a collegiate level and some are obtaining advanced degrees. Our founder, Jeremy Gaddy, has a vision to create a musical group that performs to the highest standard and produces a sound that is unique to Philadelphia and a reflection of each member of the quintet. 
Our members: Will Gregory, trumpet; Tessa Ellis, Trumpet; Bryn Coveney, Horn; Matt Gatti, Tuba. 
All of Opus 5's members are at the start of their careers. This campaign is important as it will help to pave the way to professional playing for the current members as well as for other skilled musicians in the future.
Your contribution will help our dream become a reality. It will allow us to share the love and dedication each of us has for our instrument and for this ensemble. By commissioning local composers, we will help to enrich our own musical community, as well as add valuable new pieces to the brass quintet repertoire.

 

What the funding covers. 

The funding will be be used to pay for the following: 
$2000 to pay for coachings with members of the Philadelphia Orchestra
$800 to pay for our piece that is being written by local Philadelphia Composer Alex Kruchoski
$1500 to pay for our recording space and sound engineer.
$200 for the sheet music
$1500 for creating albums and merchandise to give to our backers. 
$500 to cover the cost of rehearsals and the rehearsal space. 


 

Our project will allow a group of talented musicians to be heard and the beauty of their gift to be shared. 
This campaign brings 5 individual's dreams one step closer to reality. 


Risks & Challenges

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>For those of you who don't know me, I grew up in a small town in northern Minnesota (yes I talk like Fargo). I started a dairy operation with my brothers when I  was 16 and sold it when the market collapsed in 2010...crazy I know, I'll tell you more in person. I was an Air Traffic Controller in Alaska (I know another crazy story)...But ultimately in 2015 I moved to Nashville to pursue my real passion of country music. Since moving here I've been able to write with some truly great writers and I'm finally ready to put out an album!! Funding it is the only thing holding me back!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What does the money go to?</p>
<p>At least 6 fully produced tracks, paying the musicians, paying the producers/engineers, paying for studio time, costs associated with printing the actual CDs and tip reward fulfillments, and hopefully a small cushion extra for any unexpected costs (i.e.  Mastering etc)</p>
<p>What do you get:</p>
<p>New music! Merch! (T-shirts, Hats, Sweatshirts), liner note THANK YOU, and a tractor ride/meet and greet/writers round with my friends who wrote the EP with me! </p>
<p>What happens if we don't reach our goal:</p>
<p>I'm making this album happen no matter what!!  If I make less than the goal, I can reassess what needs to be done to fit into the financial constraints, but hitting the goal would be really helpful!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Getting this album funded will have a huge impact on not just ya'll getting new music...but starting the ball rolling for me in the music world. It will lead to many open doors here in Nashville in the industry but also touring and the chance to meet so many of you that have supported me so far...I can't wait!</p>

<h3>About the songs for the CD, ""Twist Run Road""</h3>
<p>About the songs for the CD, ""Twist Run Road""<br/>Twist Run Road is the name of the street I grew up on, in the countryside outside of the small town of Endicott, in upstate New York. Although my experience growing up there was very difficult, my memories of ""Twist Run Road"" center on the beauty, the innocence, the tiny moments of joy that do exist in my memories of that place:</p>
<p>Catching fireflies on a warm, August night. Playing in the fields of milkweed, releasing their feathery seeds ""like snow, falling from a summer sky."" The title song tells the story of ""the house across the street from us on Twist Run Road,"" where I was welcomed and loved by the family that lived there. </p>
<p>These songs are ultimately about Love. Not romantic love, really, although there are a few lyrics along those lines. The Love that comes from true Forgiveness. The Love that Hope is made of. The Love that conquers Fear. And ultimately, the Love that heals all of us by creating connection, understanding and empathy toward each other.</p>
<p>Many of these songs came to me while sleeping...in my dreams, the music and / or the lyrics would form fully realized. All I had to do was remember them. Other times, the songs would come as snippets of memories accompanied by music. Very rarely do I ever sit down to ""write a song."" </p>
<p>Because of the way in which I have been give these songs, they feel like gifts that must be passed on, shared with anyone and everyone who cares to hear them.</p>
<p>And that is why I am embarking on this campaign to raise the funds to complete this recording project.</p>
<h3>Why Am I Asking You to Join Me in This Campaign?</h3>
<p>My goal is simple: to release these songs out into the world; to share peaceful, loving music and stories that touch the heart.</p>
<p>The time is now, more than ever, to create and share Music and Art that connects us with each other. With your contribution to this project, you'll be a part of something positive...bringing even more beautiful Music into the world! Let's do this together!</p>
<p>I hope you will join me, because the truth is: it takes more than one person to share...I can't do it without You!</p>
<p>It is an honor and a privilege to be a Musician, to have the opportunity to connect with you, and I greatly appreciate every single contribution, no matter what size or form it takes. Thank you so much!</p>

<h3>These Songs That Come to Me in Dreams....</h3>
<p>For as long as I can remember, music has been 'playing in my head' day and night. Underlying every moment of my life, the undercurrent of music has always been there. And so, it has never seemed unusual for me to <i>dream a song</i>.  It was something I took for granted! Many times over the years, I have had very vivid dreams – complete with song melodies and lyrics – that would come to me while I slept, and stay with me for days. In the dreams, I open my mouth to speak, but instead of a speaking voice, I <i>sing </i>the words...I am dreaming in song.<br/><br/>Many times during a dream/song, a separate part of my mind, the <i>observer</i> of this dream, will comment: ""Oh my gosh, this is beautiful....I need to remember this!""  I wake up and write or record as much as I can remember.</p>
<p>These are not overtly spiritual songs or religious songs, but they do come from Spirit. They are simple songs that tell a story or paint a picture from the past. Underlying the stories are images of the moon and stars; they evoke water or the wind. They are beautiful dreams songs that are open and spacious, allowing you the room in your mind and heart to go wherever <i>your</i> Spirit takes you as you listen.</p>
<p>The Soul within each of us <i>does</i> speak to us in our dreams. But we do not always recognize the voice of our own Soul. It is only recently that I realized the music of my dreams is actually my own Higher Voice that has been <i>trying to reach me, through songs, for my entire life. </i>Now I know that this lovely music and loving lyrics were being dropped into my dreams like beautiful, shining <i>Gifts</i>.  I finally got the message: <i>'Wake UP, Elaine!! You're supposed to SHARE these songs!!""<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499232555/czjsc22qvtghxbedbw7d.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p>

<h2>Please type ""Susanna Lynn Prolife"" or ""Susanna Lynn I Am Alive"" in the Indiegogo search bar for my LIVE CURRENT campaign. </h2>
<h3>
<br/>I'm Susanna Lynn and my debut CD of original songs was a top 5 finalist for Christian Album of the Year at the Independent Music Awards.   But I got very sick and had to put my music ministry on hold for quite a while.  I was down for several years.  But God healed me!  And now I'm recording my second Christian CD of my original Christian songs.  I'm crowdfunding to help with the overwhelming costs of staying in Nashville to record, buying equipment, travel and more.</h3>
<p><br/>I'm so excited that we have already recorded the single!   I wrote this song because the subject (a secret till the release) is so important to me.  It has a <strong>powerful message </strong>and will be released before the CD.   </p>

I'm Susanna Lynn and my debut CD of original songs was a top 5 finalist for Christian Album of the Year at the Independent Music Awards.   But I got very sick and had to put my music ministry on hold for quite a while.  I was down for several years.  But God healed me!  And now I'm recording my second Christian CD of my original Christian songs.  I'm crowdfunding to help with the overwhelming costs of staying in Nashville to record, buying equipment, travel and more.
I'm so excited that we have already recorded the single!   I wrote this song because the subject (a secret till the release) is so important to me.  It has a powerful message and will be released before the CD.

</div></div>","Hello every one! Like you see in the title, my name is Andres Arciniega and I'm a rock singer and writer from Caracas, Venezuela... Currently living in the beautiful city of Philadelphia.




I used to be the front man of a Spanish rock band called Los Inquilinos (www.losinquilinos.com), there were quite a few great years of doing music with these guys. 
However, due to various circumstances, I'm now here in the United States, doing all by my own, giving away what I do best... sing! 


I have a long career being musician... I started to play the guitar 22 years ago, and when have I started singing? I can't even remember. And so many times I try to stop playing music, but the music never leaves me... she still believes in me jajaja.
Through all these years I played a lot, in small venues and big concerts, here is a secret... theres nothing like small ones, because the energy with the public is another thing; but back in to the above, having played in all these venues taught how it feels like... to play music to people! 


I've been working for a few years in this album, working with SUPER great people that believe in me, believe in what I would like to do and what I would like to show you... Even though, here is the point that divides the reality from the dreams, what I mean is, that in order for me to make a good record, I need good equipment. 
In the past I counted with my band partners, but now I am by my own and that makes it much more difficult all. 

What I'm talking about is ""The Budget""... And YES! I know that I can count on you! I know that you're going support this dream and let me show you the fantastic music that I've been working on!

 I have to tell you at this part about other projects success... but the problem is that this is the first music project of a latin person! So it's difficult to explain.

<p>We are the Indigenous musical group Tzotzollin. Some time ago we
produced a CD of Aztec sacred songs that sold worldwide. It is time to produce
a second CD of ceremonial music as a follow-up to the first CD:
<i>Mexihkateokwikameh</i>—which can still be found at CDbaby.com/tzotzollin. </p>
<p> It has always been our objective to learn,
teach, document and share the sacred songs of our Indigenous community so that
they might be preserved and available for future generations. People from
across North America and around the world have referenced our music for
ceremonial purposes. Because of our efforts, the songs we recorded will never
be lost.  It is time for us to share new
music with the world and the generations of children that will follow in our
footsteps. To do this we need your help.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We estimate the cost to record, mix, master and produce a second
CD of music will be about $6000.00.  Rock
Garden Studios has offered us a fantastic rate to record this new CD.  We will be recording songs used for the rite
of purification. We estimate $2500 in studio time expenses. Mastering the CD
will cost an estimated $1000. Production of the CDs will cost $2000. Costs for
postage, handling and the percentages kept by the crowdfunding source, another
$500. Already we have had contributions and commitments from videographers,
photographers, and graphic artists who are donating their time and talents to
help reduce our costs. Money raised for this project will go directly to fund
production of the CD.</p>
<p>With your contribution of $25, you will receive a copy of the CD
in the mail once it has been produced or you can pick it up at the CD release
party set for March 12, 2016.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If we fail to reach our goal of $6000, we will produce fewer
copies of the new CD, but we will still accomplish the project.  The importance of documenting and providing
this music so that it is not lost is too critical for us not to complete the
project.  We promise a new CD of music on
March 12, 2016.  Help us to make that
possible without having to borrow money and support the credit card
companies.  The release party will
coincide with the Aztec New Year and you are invited to join us! No entrance
fee.</p>
<p>If we are able to surpass our goal, the extra money will be used
to produce an additional CD of music documenting traditional songs used for the
velación. The more money we are able to raise, the more songs we will be able
to document.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>So much has been lost to the Indigenous communities over the
last 500 years. The losses continue and only with projects like this and
support from you can we hope to preserve the rich cultural gifts our communities
have to offer. This CD of music will be available for those that share a
passion for the cultural riches of the Mexica community.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the sale of the new CDs will all be donated to a
Native not-for-profit dedicated to supporting the Native communities.  All of the musicians donate their time and
efforts for the benefit of the community.</p>
<p>Words to the songs will be available online to the community at
no cost. The commitment of Tzotzollin is always to serve the Indigenous
community with the talents the Creator provided. Already the first CD of music
is used by communities from Canada to Mexico who sing the songs in sacred,
traditional Indigenous ceremonies.</p>
<p>Given the success of our first CD of music, we know that this is a valuable and needed project!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
</div>
<p>Our risks are few. We already have the commitments from
the recording studio, mastering studio, artists (graphic design and

their time or giving a huge discount to the work. All we need are funds to pay
for studio time and production of the CD of music. </p>

 Please please get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. Share this with everyone you know. Allow others the opportunity to help share the light with us. Use the Indiegogo share tools!

Realizing the power of utilizing local cultures and teaching artists to bring about positive social transformation among refugee youth, RWR started working in early December of 2016 in Baqa’a Refugee Camp through a generous donation of instruments from Talal Abu-Ghazaleh Organization and a partnership with Drumming for Social Change and UNRWA.</p><p>While our flagship work is in Baqa’a refugee camp – the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Jordan – RWR has plans to extend its services to refugees of other backgrounds through projects that will include Somali, Sudanese, Yemeni, Iraqi, and Syrian youth.</p><p><u><strong>Where We Work</strong></u></p><p>We operate out of Jordan in the heart of the Middle East.

The lessons are part of a new initiative 'Rhythms with Refugees' that aims to introduce refugee children in Jordan to percussion. The first class was held at the Baqaa refugee camp, located 20 km north of Amman. The largest camp in Jordan, it is home to more than 100,000 Palestinian refugees. The programme was founded by Bradley Broomfield, the head percussionist at Jordanian National Orchestra Association. ""With the help of the orchestra, I thought it would be a really neat and amazing idea, with Talal Abu Ghazaleh's help to bring music to kids, especially Arabic music in particular, to them so they can have a chance to see how beautiful their culture is and how neat it is to play drums,"" he said. The musician, along with a team of six volunteers, will go to Baqaa once a week to teach the students various drumming and percussion techniques. So far, around 30 students have signed up for the classes. Among them is 11 year-old Raghad Althaker. ""I wanted to learn (the drum) because it had great beats. So I wanted to learn how to play it and how to play these beats,"" she said. The initiative is supported by the Talal Abu Ghazaleh Foundation. The director of the group said music was a ""therapy for the soul"". ""It calms people down, makes them more productive, allows them to express whatever feelings they have inside, anger or any other emotion. This is especially true with the tabla,"" Luay Abu Asbeh said, referring to the drum, which is a variation of the Indian tabla. Set up in 1968, the Baqaa camp is one of six emergency camps set up to house Palestinians who left the West Bank and Gaza during the 1967 Arab Israeli war. Poverty and high unemployment are the major issues facing residents of the camp, according to U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. Student Mohammed Abu Doush said the programme offered him the only chance to learn an instrument he loves. ""Playing tabla is a good hobby, I started learning it from my uncle who is a percussionist, I came to him and asked him to start teaching me, so he did. But now my uncle works and is very busy. So I heard about this through school, they said there is someone who could teach me, so I came,"" he said. The teenager said he wants to be a professional drummer one day. 'Rhythm with Refugees' programme is expected to last six months, culminating in a concert that will showcase the skills learned by the students. Classes will also be held at the Zaatari refugee camp, which is home to around 80,000 Syrian refugees.""</p></div>","Rhythms With Refugees (RWR) is a grassroots musical collaboration between Drumming for Social Change, National Music Conservatory and UNRWA in Jordan’s refugee camps.

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Auburn Row was originally formed in 2012 through a combination of mutual friendships and a variety of unsuccessful musical projects. Though the past few years have been multi-focused for each of us, we now feel ready to break into the music scene more than ever before. Our original material stems from a vast variety of influences- including classic rock, modern rock, metal and jazz. In an album critique from 2016, Music Connection Magazine praised the band’s “prog-rock precision” and emphasized the group’s “soulful subtleties.”</p>
<p>Our new EP, titled ""A World Divided"" is slated for release this summer. And this is your chance to be directly involved in the process.</p>
<h3><font>Campaign Purpose</font></h3>
<p>The purpose for this crowdfunding campaign is to assist with an organized pre-sale for the new EP- allowing devoted fans (like you) to participate, and extend the reach of our music to new heights. We handpicked our six most popular live songs and recreated them to better reflect our live energy in an accurate and fresh way. Though the six songs on this EP are not ""new,"" these recordings are completely different from their previous iterations with updated lyrics, unique instrumental additions and new instrumentation. </p>

<div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Over the past few years, many of you have expressed to us just how important the messages of some of these songs are within your own lives. ""I'm Not Like You"" deals with the concept of individuality and standing up for yourself in the face of adversity, while ""Out of Time"" explains the value of every human life and is dedicated to Alex's friend, Miles Applebaum, who tragically passed away in 2014. We want to share these messages with others in hope of creating new connections around the world and inspiring others in the process. </span></p>

Rigorosamente ad ingresso gratuito fin dalla prima edizione, Nel Nome del Rock è riuscito a portare sul proprio palco <strong>grandi nomi</strong> del panorama indipendente nazionale e internazionale, artisti come <strong>Queens Of The Stone Age</strong>, <strong>Morphine</strong>, <strong>Theraphy?</strong>, <strong>Levellers</strong>, <strong>New Model Army</strong>, <strong>Senser</strong>,<strong> Kaki King</strong>, <strong>Caparezza</strong>, <strong>Frankie Hi NRG MC</strong>, <strong>Marlene Kuntz</strong>, <strong>Afterhours</strong> e molti altri.</p><p>Dopo <strong>23 anni</strong>, per vari motivi, sia economici che logistici, NNdR ha dovuto chiudere i battenti dopo l'edizione del <strong>2012</strong>.</p><p>Siamo qui come associazione culturale Nel Nome del Rock a presentarvi questa campagna di <strong>raccolta fondi</strong> perché crediamo vivamente che Nel Nome del Rock debba tornare ad essere un punto di riferimento per artisti emergenti e non. Nel Nome del Rock è un festival nato dalla passione e che con la passione è sempre andato avanti gestito interamente da <strong>volontari</strong>, con il solo intento di promuovere <strong>musica di qualità</strong> e noi crediamo che debba essere incoraggiato e sostenuto!</p><h3>Perché questa campagna?  </h3><p>Nel Nome del Rock è sempre stato un festival difficile da mettere in piedi e con <strong>alti costi</strong> di produzione. La natura gratuita dell'evento ha sempre richiesto grandi sforzi per la raccolta fondi e sempre un alto rischio di fallimento, ma noi abbiamo sempre confidato nel fatto che il pubblico avrebbe risposto numeroso e che il festival sarebbe stato un successo. L’approccio non è cambiato, ma purtroppo abbiamo bisogno di un <strong>sostegno economico</strong> da parte vostra in questo momento critico!</p><p>Una delle cose che ci ha sempre aiutato è stato il fatto di avere accumulato negli anni, tramite donazioni e acquisti mirati, un ingente quantitativo di attrezzature, materiali e attrezzi da lavoro. Il <strong>magazzino di NNdR</strong> comprendeva (notare l'uso del passato) legname, decorazioni, banconi bar, impianti elettrici, illuminazione, piani cucina, insomma, un mare di attrezzatura, tutta <strong>fondamentale</strong> all'allestimento del parco e che riduceva enormemente i costi limitando il noleggio a palco e impianti audio/luci del main stage.</p><p>Purtroppo nei <strong>5 anni di inattività</strong> il magazzino di NNdR ha subito un alto numero di <strong>furti </strong>riducendo l'attrezzatura e i materiali rimasti a poche cose che fortunatamente altre associazioni locali stanno ancora utilizzando. Come potrete immaginare, le cose più importanti sono andate letteralmente a ruba :(</p><p><strong>Illuminazione</strong>, <strong>cavi e quadri elettrici</strong>, <strong>bruciatori</strong>, <strong>decorazioni</strong>, <strong>striscioni </strong>che risalivano alle prime edizioni, <strong>banconi bar</strong>, <strong>materiali per allestimento</strong> come pareti in legno, <strong>gazebo</strong>, <strong>tavoli</strong>, insomma, un mare di attrezzatura è <strong>andata perduta</strong>. Questa perdita costituisce un grande <strong>ostacolo </strong>per la produzione e l'allestimento del parco e alza di molto i costi di noleggio di attrezzature che altrimenti avremmo avuto a nostra disposizione e a costo zero.</p><h3>Che impatto avrà la raccolta fondi?</h3><p><strong>Nel Nome del Rock ci manca</strong>, manca al pubblico e manca a molti artisti. Far rinascere il festival significa <strong>ridare speranza</strong> a tanti amanti della musica ma anche a molti artisti che per mille motivi hanno sempre meno palchi dove esibirsi. Non si parla solo di Nel Nome del Rock, noi crediamo nel <strong>potere della musica</strong> e nel potere che i festival hanno sulle persone; i festival sono luoghi di <strong>aggregazione</strong> e sono luoghi dove ci si conosce, ci si ritrova, si condividono <strong>musiche</strong>, <strong>momenti</strong>, <strong>esperienze</strong>; i festival sono luoghi che servono, sono luoghi che devono essere sostenuti e non condannati come purtroppo spesso accade!<br/><br/>Questa campagna ambisce anche dettare un esempio, crediamo che riportando in vita Nel Nome del Rock si possa dare speranza ad <strong>altre realtà</strong>, talvolta addirittura <strong>ispirate</strong> dallo stesso NNdR, che si trovano in difficoltà nel portare avanti <strong>eventi gratuiti</strong> con il solo intento di promuovere musica di qualità e aggregazione sociale.</p><p>Far <strong>rinascere</strong> Nel Nome del Rock significa <strong>ricreare un luogo</strong>, un momento, un <strong>evento magico</strong> che per 23 anni è stato un <strong>appuntamento fisso</strong> per molti e che adesso<strong> manca a tutti</strong>, anche a chi ne ha solo sentito parlare!</p><p>Riportiamo Nel Nome del Rock ad essere quello che era: un weekend <strong>all'insegna della musica</strong>, della cultura e dell'aggregazione, il tutto in una cornice stupenda quale il <strong>Parco Barberini</strong> di Palestrina.</p><h3>Quanto vogliamo raccogliere?  </h3><p>Vorremmo raggiungere il nostro target di <strong>25.000 € </strong>per far sì di riuscire a produrre un Nel Nome del Rock degno di questo nome!

Il target sarà flessibile e qualunque cifra raggiungeremo alla fine della campagna sarà di grande aiuto per ricostruire un magazzino mirato a <strong>sostenere le edizioni future</strong>.</p><p>I <strong>costi di noleggio</strong> di tutte queste attrezzature sono <strong>insostenibili </strong>per il festival specialmente se si considera che il festival è sempre stato, e sempre sarà, ad <strong>ingresso gratuito. </strong>Per poter pensare al futuro dobbiamo essere in grado di poter limitare i costi di noleggio ai soli palchi, audio e luci e ad attrezzature speciali.</p><p>Al momento sappiamo che Nel Nome del Rock 2017 si farà, però, per far sì che il festival torni ad essere un appuntamento fisso nel futuro e con line-up degne degli anni passati, abbiamo bisogno del <strong>vostro sostegno</strong> specialmente nell'anno in cui stiamo <strong>ripartendo letteralmente da zero</strong>!!</p><h3>Come saranno spesi i soldi raccolti?</h3><p>I soldi raccolti in questa campagna, come annunciato, andranno a<strong> limitare i costi di noleggio</strong> consentendoci l'acquisto di <strong>nuove attrezzature</strong>, <strong>impianti elettrici</strong> e <strong>illuminazione</strong>. Nel caso in cui la vostra generosità ci portasse a raggiungere cifre superiori al nostro target finale, il resto delle donazioni andranno a contribuire alla copertura di altri <strong>costi di produzione</strong> come palco, luci e backline, così come a sostenere i costi di <strong>marketing e lineup</strong> consentendoci di far crescere il festival sia a livello di produzione che a livello promozionale fin da subito!</p><p>Nel caso in cui non dovessimo raggiungere il nostro target finale, le donazioni andranno a contribuire all'acquisto di materiali e a coprire alcuni dei costi di noleggio. Il festival del 2017 non dipende necessariamente da questa crowdfunding, ma la <strong>qualità dell'evento</strong> e la <strong>fattibilità </strong>delle <strong>future edizioni</strong> dipende da quanto riusciremo a raccogliere, quindi, per favore, aiutateci; noi lo facciamo per voi, aiutateci a ripartire!! </p><p>Inoltre se supereremo il target che ci siamo prefissati riusciremmo a ricreare un festival di nuovo <strong>sostenibile</strong> e crescerebbero le possibilità di ritornare a fare <strong>beneficienza</strong> già dal primo anno.

<h3>YOUR Impact</h3>
<p>We have so many beautiful stories of people that have given up suicide, cutting, insecurities, etc. due to these songs from our live show. When these songs get recorded and in the ears of the one struggling to survive, you will be a part of the hope revealed in each song. We do this together.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Producing a music project on a professional level is very mentally draining. Most of the time we are touring, we just hope to break even due to the financial weight from travel. To think about the thousands it takes to record almost seems impossible.</p>
<p>We have put so much of our own money into the songs we have now and to be honest it isn't easy. While others are buying things for their families, homes, personal lives, etc. we are putting our paycheck into a recording. We do this with joy because we know the impact it makes. However, in order to finish this project, we need your help because we have given just about all we can at this point.</p>

Therefore, after releasing the single <i>EXPECT</i> in 2014 and performing an acclaimed interpretation of the song <i>MON DOUBLE</i> as a guest artist together with the Iberica AllStars backing band the summer of the same year at the Rototom Sunsplash Festival (20th Edition, 23.000pax), I tasted paradise… yet I had to take care of priorities first. However, I never stopped writing songs… <strong>Music is my muse, and singing is my muscle. Songwriting helps me breathe and understand the world we live in, both the beauty and ugliness.</strong></p><h3><strong>This First Studio Record</strong></h3><p>When I started working on <strong>“MODERN AFRICA I: REVERIES”</strong> (referred to from now on as REVERIES), <strong>I wanted to make an original record, the reflection of my true essence as an artist; and the biggest influence for me were clearly my roots, the Arabian as well as the African ones. But it also had to reflect the story of my adulthood in Europe, as I left the motherland aged 17.</strong></p><p>Talk about contrast.</p><p><strong>Africa, and Morocco are pure contrast</strong>. Wet/dry, rural/urban, clean/gritty, dark/colourful, traditional/modern, silent/loud, extremely formal behaviors vs freedom to be, desert landscapes/green valleys, reality and fantasy, fear and faith, truth and mythology, chaos and courage... <strong>Both Africa and Morocco on my mind were a perfect place for the stories I chose to tell in this first record collection, where I also wanted to pay my tribute to those poets, songwriters, vocalists and artists of all disciplines whose names juggle in my head-space; those who inspire me besides just my folks.</strong></p><p>That being said, <strong>“REVERIES” is a tasteful, personal homage to the music that I have incubated throughout the journey of life</strong> (Gnawa music, Malian music, the blues, desert folk music, Moroccan traditional music, arab classical music, gospel, soul music, funk music, afrobeat, world music in general...), <strong>and shaped with care and passion together with my producer Jules Bikôkô</strong>; I am honored if anyone can put my little record on their shelves, or in the same sentence as one of the greatest world, desert-inspired, singer-songwriter music accomplishments of all times.</p><p>The duration of the record will be approximately <strong>45 minutes. 8 songs + 1 remix.</strong></p><p>Summing things up, <strong>I have spent the last two years in my tiny home studio when I wasn't nurturing my son Jad or working as a performer, taking every spare moment of my time and all of my skill, dedicating it to bringing ""REVERIES"" to… well, life. ),0)</strong></p><h3><strong>Teamwork Does Make The Dream Work</strong></h3><p>My core team consists of myself<i> </i>(<i>the jack of all deals</i>), my best friend Stef (my best advisor, aka<i> the oracle</i>), and a collection of loyal collaborators to whom I am forever grateful; and with some help from my friends and family whom basically hold my sanity together, <strong>I carried this project on my back for as long as I could, but I realized that, in order to finish my record in the way I envisioned it, I need the help from my fans and the wider community</strong>. As a platform best suited for my needs, I chose Indiegogo to present this record, connect me with my audience, and give you a chance to be an essential part in the creation of ""REVERIES"". <strong>Because. This. Is. The. Future. Of. Music.</strong></p><h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3><p>Cards on the table: I have spent quite some money out of my pocket already, and NOW I need you guys to help me finish the record and release it worldwide, in order to bring it to you digital, physical as well as personally.</p><p>A big part of the work is done: <strong>the music is almost finished</strong> (I still need to pay the studio hours for recording, mixing and mastering). <u>It shall be ready to share in less than a couple of months from now</u>, <strong>but I have an extensive production, post-production and release list of needs ahead of me; I have also planned a clear and strategic promotional process.</strong></p><p>For the record, and on top of the above-mentioned actual music making process duties (<strong>5.5k</strong>), the breakdown of the remaining <strong>40.000€</strong> I am raising is as follows:</p><ul>

<li>
<strong>10k approx.

<h3>The Beki Brindle Band - About us - Our Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Beki Brindle - Guitars (lead and rhythm) and Vocals (lead and harmonies)</strong><br/><br/>New York Blues Hall of Fame 2014 Inductee, Beki Brindle was discovered at Indiana University by Rick Danko and Richard Manuel of ""The Band,"" while she was Blues Legend James ""Yank"" Rachell'slead guitarist. A consummate player at an early age, Beki toured repeatedly with Jerry Lee Lewis, as his guitarist. A native of Indiana, she spent time living in Ireland where she shared the stage with Hot House Flowers, The Waterboys, members of U2 and Thin Lizzy, The Pogues and Francie Conway, as well as recording  &amp; touring with blues artists such as Carey Bell, Johnny Mars, Joe Louis Walker, Mary Stokes Band, Tampa Red, Fenton Robinson and more. She was also commissioned by Bono of U2 to create and run a blues workshop on Irish National Television.<br/><br/>Although Beki is a renowned blues guitarist and singer, with a style that is a mix of classic and original blues, peppered with sounds from Chicago and The Delta, she was also the guitarist for the Warner/Reprise band Grace Pool, as well as releasing several albums featuring other guitar stylings.<br/><br/>In 2016, Beki's latest blues album, ""All Kinds of Beki,"" released on NY Blues &amp; Jazz label Random Chance Records, was much-lauded, including a stellar review from Living Blues Magazine (by Robert Cattaliotti). In November, Beki and her band recorded a ""Live in The Studio"" album in Staffordshire, UK, featuring original, classic and obscure songs by artists such as Willie Dixon, Ike Turner, The Band, Lightnin' Hopkins, Russ Ballard's ""Blue For You"" (the title track,) and Yank Rachell. The new album, ""Blue For You,"" promises both classic blues and originals, jam-packed with unforgettable, exuberant and raw performances.<br/><br/><strong>Beki Brindle Band members:</strong><br/><br/><strong>Danny McCormack - Piano/Hammond/Backing Vocals</strong><br/>From Stockton-On-Tees UK, ""Ivory"" Dan McCormack sprang onto the Birmingham music landscape at the age of seventeen, playing his trademark boogie style piano with King Pleasure and the Biscuit Boys. Dan is a fine musician, who has toured and recorded with many respected artists, including Van Morrison (also Van's musical director as well as his pianist), Imelda May, Tony Christie, Richard Hawley as well as countless American jazz and blues performers such as Screaming Jay Hawkins and Bobby Parker (James Brown). He has appeared on Radio 2 as guest pianist with the BBC Radio Orchestra and is a lecturer in Music Studies at Derby University. Dan is a regular player with The Sticky Wicket Swing Orchestra, Roy Wood and The Beki Brindle Band. An arranger with an extraordinary reputation, Danny has made a massive contribution to the upcoming Beki Brindle album, “Back to the Juke Joint.""</p>
<p><br/><strong>Sticky Wicket - Drums/Percussion</strong><br/>After beginning his career playing with rock bands in his hometown of Birmingham, UK, Sticky switched gears and began playing with jazzmen.

<p><strong>The Campaign - why we are doing this and what it means to us!</strong></p>
<p>""It was never our intention to record this album but the ensuing results of jamming a few tunes at Danny McCormack's studio at  Netherseal in the County of Derbyshire, UK encouraged us immensely. Further encouragement came from Beki's Woodstock chum John Sebastian (Lovin' Spoonful etc) who offered to play harp on one of the tracks, which he did beautifully! </p>
<p>Also, two of drummer Alan 'Sticky' Wicket's old band bosses, Russ Ballard and Steve Gibbons, on hearing the rough mixes wanted to get involved too! Steve came along and sang a duo with Beki and Russ offered some advice on song writing as he saw so much potential in our sound. In the end Russ went a step further and offered us one of his songs to be recorded and produced at his studio, which was Blue For You.</p>
<p>With so much encouragement and involvement form these musicians/songwriters of such high esteem (and and there were others too) we felt compelled to complete this album which comprises of strong 'Blues roots' tunes plus more original material that Beki came up with to compliment our unique line up and sound!

<li><p>The Magnitude of what YOU, the contributors will help us achieve is quite substantial.  We have a big ""in"" with a large record distribution company / promotion company but this costs quite a bit.  This is for a good 3 months of promotion and that means airplay.  Solid airplay.  We know this album has some hits on it.  We have been told this by people who really know what constitues a hit.  YOU would be essential in helping us to reach the goal of rotation airplay which will ensure that our songs are played enough to be heard by hundreds of thousands of listeners .. maybe millions.  We are seasoned players and we've all been on major labels and on the big stage.  It is time for that again as our music truly is unique and we are very proud of all the hard work we put into this.  We've put all of our faith and funds into this and the album is complete!  Now for promotion.  We thank you in advance for helping us.  Thank you to those who have helped us previously and during this nearly 2 year process!</p></li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise about $30,000 in order to pay for <u>top promotion</u> for 3 months. We've set our goal at obnly 20% of this amount so that, as long as we rach that goal in 60 days, we can run this open-ended campaign.  We know it will take time to raise that amount of money. We could need more but this is a number we have agreed upon as a band.  This covers most of it. </li>
<li>
<strong>If you contribute</strong>, you will get signed CDs + early download (before the CD is manufactured) and other levels of contribution will get you more things, such as signed CD, early download PLUS a signed lyrics sheet.  You may contribute enough to get Beki's Danelectro signed guitar and/or a personal concert in your home or venue of your choice. </li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal completely, we have chosen flexible funding, so we will use the funds to promote as much as we can and manufacture the CDs.  We are running this as an open ended campaign so hopefully, within 60 days, we will have the funds but if not, we will still carry on and work hard to pay for promotion, manufacturing, etc.  We will have the CDs no matter what.  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our album BLUE FOR YOU is important as we are keeping real roots music and crossover roots music, played by real musicians, <strong>alive!</strong>  We have a message and it is ""<strong>STAY REAL!</strong>"" .. this band is filled with great talent and seasoned players, each with many accolades from the many well known musicians they have backed.  We want our magic to spread to YOU and everyone who hears our music.  </li>

<h3>Are there Risks &amp; Challenges?</h3>
<p>We have already taken all of the <i>risks</i> and overcome obstacles such as mixing issues using Logic Pro when Apple upgraded but caused a lot of issues for those using this program even in major studios!  It was frustrating but we have managed, thanks to Dan McCormack and lots of others figuring out Apple's changes!  We had the challenge of Beki travelling to the UK many times to work on the album.  This was quite expensive but we are all dedicated to this project and we know it is a winner.</p>
<p>The only <i>challenge</i> now is to raise money as we have all contributed our own money for nearly 2 years and well..... we are at the golden door .. we've got the pass but we just need the funds to walk through it! :) (mainly money to promote.)</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>    Please feel free to share this campaign .. this will help us tremendously.  Word of mouth is at         least 50% of any campaign's success!  </p>

She was also commissioned by Bono of U2 to create and run a blues workshop on Irish National Television.Although Beki is a renowned blues guitarist and singer, with a style that is a mix of classic and original blues, peppered with sounds from Chicago and The Delta, she was also the guitarist for the Warner/Reprise band Grace Pool, as well as releasing several albums featuring other guitar stylings.In 2016, Beki's latest blues album, ""All Kinds of Beki,"" released on NY Blues & Jazz label Random Chance Records, was much-lauded, including a stellar review from Living Blues Magazine (by Robert Cattaliotti). In November, Beki and her band recorded a ""Live in The Studio"" album in Staffordshire, UK, featuring original, classic and obscure songs by artists such as Willie Dixon, Ike Turner, The Band, Lightnin' Hopkins, Russ Ballard's ""Blue For You"" (the title track,) and Yank Rachell. The new album, ""Blue For You,"" promises both classic blues and originals, jam-packed with unforgettable, exuberant and raw performances.Beki Brindle Band members:Danny McCormack - Piano/Hammond/Backing VocalsFrom Stockton-On-Tees UK, ""Ivory"" Dan McCormack sprang onto the Birmingham music landscape at the age of seventeen, playing his trademark boogie style piano with King Pleasure and the Biscuit Boys.

<h2>""Do You Hear Me Now?"" </h2>
<p>Its more than the title of a song, its the main reason for doing this project: We really just want these songs to be heard!   They're all original tunes, all new recordings, and they're fresh, exciting and 'smart' songs.   Some of them actually  were originally recorded in the 80's,  and released as a cassette-only EP. called ""Starksongs"".  That project, produced by Bill Starks and Chuck Underwood,  yielded an exciting  mix of high-energy power-pop and roots-influenced rock, but it remained 'under the radar' for a lot of folks.   Why was that?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546530797/nqenzrqcd7j8napmnprh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The tunes were well-received by those who heard them - and several of the songs were awarded honors in the Mid-Atlantic Songwriters competition - but they weren't really performed live on more than a few occasions,   Plus, this was long before facebook and youtube and file-sharing.  So,  while this music represents an exciting and creative period for us,   it didn't get the attention of many DC music fans back in the day.  </p>
<p>Bill, Chuck and Greg first began working together in the band called ShadowBox, which soon morphed into The Rhythm Method.   More changes a year or so later found these guys in separate bands, but before too long, they were working together again on the ""Starksongs"" recording project.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546530711/x4tvijlw8n3txnuflszd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The core band for the original recordings, was Bill Starks on keys and vocals and Chuck Underwood on guitar, with Greg Hardin on bass and vocals, and Joe Dougherty on drums.  Also on the original sessions, was a great horn section with Bruce Swaim (tenor sax), Vince McCool (trumpet) and John Wolff  (trombone) and some backing vocals by the members of the Dynettes (Martha Hull, Cherie Grasso, and Diana Quinn).    That's a whole lot of creative energy - and not something that's easily duplicated!</p>
<p>So why not just re-release the original recordings on CD?  Well, that isn't possible, because the original master tapes are gone.  But we wanted to take another crack at these tunes anyway! Plus, the original recordings were very energetic and fun, but they were also flawed in some ways.  For example, when the cassettes were mass-produced, they sounded a bit sped-up. We decided to recreate the original arrangements and get a better sounding final result. </p>
<p>So it wasn't easy, herding all these cats, but we <strong>'got the band back together' </strong>for this project,  and we cut brand-new versions of all the tunes that we recorded years ago, along with a couple other unreleased 'lost classics'. Hopefully, having honed our chops, and having acquired a bit more studio experience over the years, we've now created the definitive versions of these favorite songs of ours.   </p>
<p>For this new CD, the core band again includes Bill, Chuck, Greg and Joe, along with the horns: Bruce and Vince again,  and this time, with Chris Watling on baritone sax. We also brought in percussionist Josh Howell to play congas on a couple of tracks. And  topping it off,  some harmonies provided by the Starks Famdamily.  Also, we've added a couple of songs to the six tracks that were on the original Starksongs EP.  We are really pleased with the results -- the energy is fresh, and the music feels new again.  And with Jim Robeson behind the console, you know its going to sound incredible.  And it's been quite a rewarding experience, reuniting to give these songs their due, and approach them from a more mature perspective.</p>

<p>""Do You Hear Me Now"" is really more than the title cut in the collection, it's the theme of this project, with our goal of presenting these  new-and-improved versions of these tunes to a wider audience.  Its been a labor of love, and a good deal of the work involved is still ahead.  A lot of planning, a lot of talent, time and effort, and a fair amount of money is required, but at this point we're nearly done and there is no turning back! </p>
<p>Now, we're hoping that you and other music fans, through your donations,  will help us with our funding goals, in order to complete this project. The money from CD purchases and other donations will be used to cover the recording and production costs, and the design and manufacturing of the CD's, and to compensate the very talented musicians who have so generously offered their services in making this record, and bringing these long-neglected tunes back to life again.  We wouldn't ask you for a commitment like this unless we were confident that everyone will like the results.  So - come on and join the band -- We're counting  on your your support to make this happen!   </p>
<p>Here's how you can help!</p>
<p> We're looking for the support of music lovers like you, in the DC area and beyond, to fund this project:  donations will help pay the musicians who have (so far) contributed their time and talents,  and cover the costs of the recording studios we used,  and  will also pay for the manufacturing of the discs themselves.  Our goal is to raise  $7500  in contributions, in 2 months, based on the budget for this project. To be clear, this is not designed to make a profit, just to recoup the costs we've incurred so far.  </p>
<p>How you can help?  It could be as simple as pre-ordering an autographed copy of the CD, for $25.  For a little more money ($35) you can get an autographed CD and a copy of the accompanying poster as well. For a $50 donation, you can get an autographed copy of ""Do You Hear Me Now"", as well as the award-winning 2015 CD release ""I See Trouble"".  Also, once we have scheduled a CD release party, (which is still TBA, as of now)  and when we have more details about the time and place,  we're also hoping to add  a perk so you can get VIP status at that event.  And, to be clear, there is no limit to the amount of your donation: if you just want to make a small donation and hold off on getting a copy of the CD for now, that is just fine, and we appreciate any help you can give. And,  if you are feeling more generous, we'll gladly receive any amount you can afford  to help fund this campaign, and  of course, in return for larger donations, we'll gladly provide you multiple copies of the new CD.  How many copies can we put you down for?</p>
<p>Finally, its worth mentioning that we had a very successful IndieGogo campaign for Bill's first solo CD project, ""I See Trouble"" in 2015. And we're certainly hoping to repeat those results for this campaign as well.   Incidentally, that  ""I See Trouble"" CD received multiple nominations in the annual Washington Area Music Association awards, and Bill received a ""Song of the Year"" Wammie for one song, ""300 Miles"", and ""Songwriter Of the Year"" award for the album. Those were such gratifying and affirmative experiences that we're still so thankful for, and we couldn't have done it without you!  </p>

Here's how you can help!
 We're looking for the support of music lovers like you, in the DC area and beyond, to fund this project:  donations will help pay the musicians who have (so far) contributed their time and talents,  and cover the costs of the recording studios we used,  and  will also pay for the manufacturing of the discs themselves.  Our goal is to raise  $7500  in contributions, in 2 months, based on the budget for this project. To be clear, this is not designed to make a profit, just to recoup the costs we've incurred so far.  
How you can help?  It could be as simple as pre-ordering an autographed copy of the CD, for $25.  For a little more money ($35) you can get an autographed CD and a copy of the accompanying poster as well. For a $50 donation, you can get an autographed copy of ""Do You Hear Me Now"", as well as the award-winning 2015 CD release ""I See Trouble"".  Also, once we have scheduled a CD release party, (which is still TBA, as of now)  and when we have more details about the time and place,  we're also hoping to add  a perk so you can get VIP status at that event.  And, to be clear, there is no limit to the amount of your donation: if you just want to make a small donation and hold off on getting a copy of the CD for now, that is just fine, and we appreciate any help you can give. And,  if you are feeling more generous, we'll gladly receive any amount you can afford  to help fund this campaign, and  of course, in return for larger donations, we'll gladly provide you multiple copies of the new CD.  How many copies can we put you down for?
Finally, its worth mentioning that we had a very successful IndieGogo campaign for Bill's first solo CD project, ""I See Trouble"" in 2015. And we're certainly hoping to repeat those results for this campaign as well.   Incidentally, that  ""I See Trouble"" CD received multiple nominations in the annual Washington Area Music Association awards, and Bill received a ""Song of the Year"" Wammie for one song, ""300 Miles"", and ""Songwriter Of the Year"" award for the album. Those were such gratifying and affirmative experiences that we're still so thankful for, and we couldn't have done it without you!",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Will you help me in this musical mission of mercy? Please?<br/><div>
<br/><span>My
name is Wendy Wham Mills. Music and art have been a huge part of my
life as long as I can remember, and have always dreamed of playing this piano once again, though I thought I would never have the chance.</span>   So
many blissful memories of the family gathering around this beauty to sing
Broadway or popular tunes from the American Songbook, or quiet times of repose
playing Chopin...<br/>

children, this beautiful piano was given to my brother by my mother so his
daughters might have the chance to play. Their interest was short, and
the piano was left unused in the living room, then was relegated to the basement
where it stayed for years. Though
not as grand as a Steinway, this beautiful 1930's spinet has deep loving roots
in my memory.  My brother doubted that my memories were in step with the
reality of an instrument that lay in dust for years... so I journeyed to Utah
to see.  <br/><span><br/>It was!  I was so joyous! The piano was just as beautiful as
I had imagined-- and my heart sang!  But she needed some work: besides
desperately needing tuning, the white keys were cracked and swirled, a leg was
wobbly, and her finish needed some love (the refinishing I can do, but
replacing the key tops, securing the leg, and transportation needed to be
handed to the professionals).</span><br/><br/><span>I thought that I would have some time to gather
funds for her removal and restoration, but that was not to be.  I recently
learned that she had to be gone.  <br/>Now.  <br/>R</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">ight on the heels of an engine rebuild on my car. (-sigh-)  Timing... <br/><span><br/>Details:
<p>$500 for fixing leg, and re-topping the white keys<br/>$900 for transportation from Utah to Colorado<br/>$100 to help with storage costs until the move. </p>

</div><br/></div>","The wonderful 1930s spinet that witnessed my mom learning to play, and then me in turn, has been cast aside and desperately needs to be rescued.  My heart longs for the piano of my childhood. Will you help me in this musical mission of mercy? Please?
My
name is Wendy Wham Mills. Music and art have been a huge part of my
life as long as I can remember, and have always dreamed of playing this piano once again, though I thought I would never have the chance.   So
many blissful memories of the family gathering around this beauty to sing
Broadway or popular tunes from the American Songbook, or quiet times of repose
playing Chopin...
  
(You can see me along with my twin brother at the
piano as babies).
But I
digress.  


Long story short:  when my brother married and had
children, this beautiful piano was given to my brother by my mother so his
daughters might have the chance to play. Their interest was short, and
the piano was left unused in the living room, then was relegated to the basement
where it stayed for years. Though
not as grand as a Steinway, this beautiful 1930's spinet has deep loving roots
in my memory.  My brother doubted that my memories were in step with the
reality of an instrument that lay in dust for years... so I journeyed to Utah
to see.  It was!  I was so joyous! The piano was just as beautiful as
I had imagined-- and my heart sang!  But she needed some work: besides
desperately needing tuning, the white keys were cracked and swirled, a leg was
wobbly, and her finish needed some love (the refinishing I can do, but
replacing the key tops, securing the leg, and transportation needed to be
handed to the professionals).I thought that I would have some time to gather
funds for her removal and restoration, but that was not to be.  I recently
learned that she had to be gone.  Now.  Right on the heels of an engine rebuild on my car. (-sigh-)  Timing... Details:
$500 for fixing leg, and re-topping the white keys$900 for transportation from Utah to Colorado$100 to help with storage costs until the move. 
I have already put  some money into the piano's
move from the basement, and restoration, but need further assistance, given the engine rebuild...  Please help me achieve this dream, and give love to a beautiful and worthy
instrument, and help to bring her home to Colorado.   All funds received will go to this project.  The piano mover and restoration company is the most wonderful Barrus Pianos in Salt Lake City (http://barruspianos.com)
Might
you help?
In exchange for your generous monetary  gift *of any amount,* I have several one-of-a -kind artistic thank you gifts to share- you may view my work at www.wendywhammills.com-- I would love to share (or create) a heartfelt thank you for your kindness.  (If you have too much stuff and wish to donate without receiving a gift, you may do so directly above the 'Contribute Now' button).

<h3>Why Vinyl?</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hmm...the short answer is because I think it's awesome!  But, maybe not for the reasons you think.  Some people say that vinyl offers superior sound quality over digitally compressed files and, while that's true to some extent, it's not the number one reason why I think it's such a special medium...</div>

<div>For me what makes vinyl special is the physical connection to the artifact itself.  When I discover new music that I love it becomes immediately important to me to discover the deeper meaning behind the songs by reading the lyrics and liner notes, gazing at the artwork, and taking the time to really listen to the music in an environment where I'm not being distracted by messages on my computer, or smart phone.  It's pretty unique in our fast paced digital world!</div>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>In 1966-67 NASA sent five spacecraft to the Moon to map it in preparation for the Apollo Moon landings.    These high resolution images, hundreds at 1 meter resolution, provided the first closeup look of the Moon in human history. The images were recorded on 70mm high resolution film, processed on the spacecraft in lunar orbit, scanned with a light beam and sent back to the Earth via radio.  At ground stations at Goldstone California, Madrid Spain, and Woomera Australia, the images  were recorded on tape, and also on 35mm film.</p>
<p>The images that the world saw in the 1960's were from the 35mm film and were grainy, with low dynamic range, and with striping.  The recordings on the tape were preserved in their most pristine form and were stored for over 40 years by NASA.  In 2007 we found, from retired NASA employee Nancy Evans, the last four remaining tape drives in the world that could play the images, stored for decades in a barn in Los Angeles with Nancy hoping for the day that the tapes could be read.</p>
<p>The Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project (LOIRP) was kicked off in 2008 with $120k in NASA funding and $15k from the Odyssey Moon Google Lunar X Prize Team.  We were able to get of the four 40+ year old Ampex tape drive running and produce in stunning quality, the remastered first image of the Earth first seen from lunar orbit.  This image, along with many others that we have produced have received worldwide acclaim.  </p>
<p>Between further NASA funding and $62k raised by crowd funding in 2013 we have completed the process of digitizing almost 1500 tapes, the entire tape library from lunar orbiter.    This has created tens of terabytes of data, and over 1700 images.  Each medium resolution image is broken into 28 strips or framelets.  Each high resolution image is made from 98 framelets.  Each framelet is a file. We have over 107,000 of these files.  </p>
<p>Our task is to complete the processing of these files and publish them to the NASA  website where they will be free for everyone to enjoy.  We are also doing the paperwork to get the raw data and images to the National Space Science Data Center.   We had estimated the cost to NASA to complete this at about $400,000 dollars, of which they provided $300k after we finished the work from the 2013 crowd funded effort.  We originally thought that we were only going to get Lunar Orbiter II and III, but because of our previous crowd funded effort, we were able to leverage the additional $300k.  That puts us at about $100k short of what we needed to finish, and that is what we are asking you, the crowd funding community to help us with.  This gets us our very last mile to finish everything.  To see what we have done so far, here is our gallery at NASA Ames Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute web site.</p>
<p><a href=""http://sservi.nasa.gov/LOIRP/loirp_gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sservi.nasa.gov/LOIRP/loirp_gallery/</a></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We already have the software to do the image processing to remove the striping from the images, assemble them, and do the final touch up to go to the NASA server.  However, our computers are several years old now, and we need to upgrade them and our photoshop and other software (we have to remove all the alien artifacts [just kidding!]) needed to process the images.  These images are gigapixel size and thus it takes time to process!  This will take about 20% of the funds.</p>
<p>Salaries for the team will take about 60% of the funds.</p>
<p>Fulfillment of the perks will take 10-11% of the funds.  This including mailing the perks here and overseas which is fairly expensive for the perks (you will see the good swag that we provide), packaging (good shipping tubes come from Yazoo.com) and first class mailing.  We have had problems with media mail class shipping before and we want you to get your prizes!</p>
<p>Oh, and Indiegogo does not do this for free!  It will cost between 7-10% if we make our goal (including credit card fees), and 12-15% if we don't!  So really it would be nice if we beat the goal a bit to take care of this cost.</p>
<p>Our perks will include at the lowest level your name on a plaque that will be given to whatever museum gets some of the original Lunar Orbiter hardware.  We will then have certificates for more help, then some really interesting original images on kodak paper from the 1960's donated to us by Dr. Donald Wilhelm, former head of the U.S. geological survey.  These will come with a certificate of provenance.  Just this week a major gallery is auctioning off similar images for lots of money.  Not only are these beautiful images, but they will have enduring value in the collectors market.  We will also put out special images related to our work in lunar bases and NASA studies over the years from acclaimed space artist Mark Maxwell.  We will have a few special image prints that will be colorized and otherwise creatively improved, and signed by Mark Maxwell and Don Davis, another famous space artist.  Finally we will have books of prints of the high resolution images and also large sized versions of our digitized Earth Rise and other cool lunar images, including blow ups of the Apollo 12 and 14 landing sites before the landing!</p>
<p>If we don't make the total, we will still do everything possible to finish.  It is our expectation that if the crowd funding takes off, we will go ahead and get a loan to cover some of the costs to start working so you should see some results before the crowdfunding is over!  The images go straight to the NASA server and are posted as they are completed.  The <a href=""http://sservi.nasa.gov/LOIRP/loirp_gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LOIRP Gallery</a> will have the images that are free to the public for downloading.  </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>The impact of this crowdfunded effort will seal the legacy of these historic images.  You the crowdfunding donor will participate in what we have coined the word as technoarchaeology, or the archeology of technology.</p>
<p>We have had worldwide acclaim, including front page newspapers with our Earthrise  image (LA Times).  We have had multiple documentaries (links below), and have been honored to have our images included in the inauguration presidential swag bag in 2013.  </p>
<p>We are also providing these images for the scientific community for all time.  The raw and processed images will be forever stored on NASA's cloud servers at the National Space Science Data Center and the Lunar Orbiter images will be available to the scientific community in their highest quality, closest to original form as well as in raw form.  By saving the data in raw form, in the future when our computers today are as much of a joke as the computers of 1966, researchers will be able to do magic with the images that we cannot think of today.  </p>
<p>You, the crowdfunding donor will be literally helping to make history by funding our efforts to preserve the history of the Apollo era.   We call this citizen science and you will participate in it.  We also have students who work with us doing real science with the images who we hope to employ this summer.   Never again can we do what has taken us six years to do with digitizing all these tapes.  That work is done, but we have to finish!  So thanks in advance and take a look at our links and images!</p>

Our perks will include at the lowest level your name on a plaque that will be given to whatever museum gets some of the original Lunar Orbiter hardware.  We will then have certificates for more help, then some really interesting original images on kodak paper from the 1960's donated to us by Dr. Donald Wilhelm, former head of the U.S. geological survey.  These will come with a certificate of provenance.  Just this week a major gallery is auctioning off similar images for lots of money.  Not only are these beautiful images, but they will have enduring value in the collectors market.  We will also put out special images related to our work in lunar bases and NASA studies over the years from acclaimed space artist Mark Maxwell.  We will have a few special image prints that will be colorized and otherwise creatively improved, and signed by Mark Maxwell and Don Davis, another famous space artist.  Finally we will have books of prints of the high resolution images and also large sized versions of our digitized Earth Rise and other cool lunar images, including blow ups of the Apollo 12 and 14 landing sites before the landing!
If we don't make the total, we will still do everything possible to finish.  It is our expectation that if the crowd funding takes off, we will go ahead and get a loan to cover some of the costs to start working so you should see some results before the crowdfunding is over!  The images go straight to the NASA server and are posted as they are completed.  The LOIRP Gallery will have the images that are free to the public for downloading.  
The Impact
 The impact of this crowdfunded effort will seal the legacy of these historic images.  You the crowdfunding donor will participate in what we have coined the word as technoarchaeology, or the archeology of technology.
We have had worldwide acclaim, including front page newspapers with our Earthrise  image (LA Times).  We have had multiple documentaries (links below), and have been honored to have our images included in the inauguration presidential swag bag in 2013.  
We are also providing these images for the scientific community for all time.  The raw and processed images will be forever stored on NASA's cloud servers at the National Space Science Data Center and the Lunar Orbiter images will be available to the scientific community in their highest quality, closest to original form as well as in raw form.  By saving the data in raw form, in the future when our computers today are as much of a joke as the computers of 1966, researchers will be able to do magic with the images that we cannot think of today.  
You, the crowdfunding donor will be literally helping to make history by funding our efforts to preserve the history of the Apollo era.   We call this citizen science and you will participate in it.  We also have students who work with us doing real science with the images who we hope to employ this summer.   Never again can we do what has taken us six years to do with digitizing all these tapes.  That work is done, but we have to finish!  So thanks in advance and take a look at our links and images!

Risks & Challenges
 The biggest risk is not to do this.  We have the images, we have processed a few hundred of them, we just need to finish the job.  For us the biggest risk has always that we have not had enough money to do this right.  $100k will barely get us there.  If we can we can go over it would really help.  We have always been doing this on a shoestring and we really need as much help as we can get to finish strong!
We have overcome many challenges to get here, from getting the tape drives running, obtaining heads, developing the software for image processing, all of these have been overcome.  We just need to finish!
    Other Ways You Can Help If you can't help us financially then you can help to spread the word.  We have lost some of our media support from before and rely more than ever on viral spreading of the word.  We have a new twitter feed and we are on Facebook at 
https://www.facebook.com/groups/17596829126/
We will have a new twitter feed that we need followers on as well and we will keep folks updated via that way as well as through frequent updates here on indiegogo.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p>
<p>Hello IndieGoGo viewers! </p>
<p>I'm a big-haired country singing girl from Texas! I've been
making music and travelling across our great state for the past 4 years. Below
is lots of info about a new adventure I'm ready to take, but I need the help of
y'all! Watch the video for the 4-1-1 and below is a lengthy version that will
explain what this is all about! </p>
<p>Friends, Family and Fans… I have such exciting news that I have
been dying to share with you… I’m ready to make some new MUSIC!!!!! Yes, you
heard it from the horse’s mouth – It’s time to get back in the studio and crank
out some new material. My last EP (short 6 song album) was released in March
2014 and blew my mind – because of YOU it was a Top 200 iTunes Country Album
Download! (#163 to be exact) Not only that but my first radio single “Just
Another Blonde” went to #94 on the Texas Country Radio Charts and my second
single ""Avalanche"" went to #21!!! I mean really?! This year was
amazing. Not only did I have digital success, but there were some life moments
that no dollar sign could buy. I was nominated for ""New Female Vocalist of
the Year"" for the Texas Regional Radio Awards and was featured as a
""New Face"" in Texas Country! I sang at the legendary Bluebird Café in
Nashville. I recorded with the top musicians at OmniSound on music row. I’ve
been able to go out on the road and play over 200 shows the past 2 years. I
went into the studio for the first time EVER September 2013 to record my first
song, ""Life Changes"" and now I'm looking at putting together a full
length album! </p>
<p>That’s just the tip of the iceberg. I have been busting my butt
to save money, promote my music and get out there and meet y’all and I think
this year has been a HUGE stepping stone in expanding that dream from just
singing in some bars in Dallas to getting out on the road and seeing all of
Texas and playing bigger venues (remember when we had 1,500 people at my EP
release party in March? Yeah, that was awesome). </p>
<p>Which brings me to a fork in the road. Thankfully I was able to
gain financial support from a few investors to make this last record happen,
and could never thank them enough. They allowed me to get my feet off the
ground for the first time and now I’m not quite ready to come back down. The EP
record produced 3 radio singles; “Life Changes”, “Just Another Blonde” that
went to #94 and was on the charts for 27 weeks, and “Avalanche” which went to
#21 on the charts (my first Top 25 single EK)!  </p>
<p>I’ve got the material and the momentum from YOU the fans, but we
are a few dollars short on getting the final touches together for a full length
album.  This is why I’m reaching out to y’all, I get asked ALL THE TIME,
“when are you putting out new music”, “when can we expect another album”… well,
when I can raise some money! Haha. Music is more than a hobby to me, it’s my
passion and without it I don’t know what I would do with my nights and
weekends… watch Real Housewives?! (oh wait, I already do that…) But really… I
LOVE music and feel I have been blessed thus far, and from the encouragement I
have gotten from people over the past few years, this is something I should
continue to pursue as long as it will let me.</p>
<p>In addition to putting together a new full length album, we are
planning to send out ANOTHER single (<a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/adrian-johnston-ep/id845382452"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""It's A Song""</a>) from the EP to radio
September 21st! Then a single from the NEW album out in Feb 2016 and then the
full length album out March 2016 (estimated times). I mean things are about to
start CRANKING Y'ALL! </p>
<p>I have already been in the works putting together a launch team
that is AMAZING (like seriously), but we need your help to get the funds to
back these new efforts! </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>If you have gotten to
this point of my soap box BLESS YOUR HEART! I’m going to get to the
nitty-gritty now I promise. To record a full length album; the hard costs are
hiring the band to record, rent the studio, the engineer, mix and mastering
(the button flipping process that makes it sound good, that I do not
understand, and that is much harder than I just explained). Then we have my
Rock-Star Producer <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/adrian-s-first-full-length-album/edit/www.zacmaloymusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Zac Maloy</span></a> who is coming in on this project,
HE IS THE MAN!!! He not only produced my 6 song EP, but he co-wrote on half the
album. The man that brought you The Nixons, songs recorded by Carrie Underwood,
Blake Shelton, Tim McGraw...need I keep going? He's on board. So you should be
too! </p>
<p>Then there are the
costs to physically have CDs printed to take to shows and mail out to venues
for booking, and then the radio single to mail out to stations. In addition to
the minimum hard costs, the additional marketing/promotion cost to make the
album/single successful….You have to pay a radio promoter to get the single out
to radio (Thank the lord for Dorothea Ivey, Cabin Creek Promotions who is the
master-mind behind “Avalanche” and will be working ""It's A Song"").
THENNNNNN, we have a photo shoot to try and make me look cool (which is very
very hard) so we can create an album cover and artwork, and use those pictures
for the website, social media, one-sheet mail outs, etc. Which turns into
BOOKING GIGS and going on the road. Because they will only book you if you
have all of the above FIRST.... Soooo here is a breakdown of the budget for
y'all to peak at! </p>
<p><b>Where is the money going?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Promoting Next Radio Single – ""It's A Song""</li>
<li>Record &amp;
     Produce FULL Length Album</li>
<li>Promotion for New Single from Full Length Album - Feb
     2016</li>
<li>Production
     cost of Full Length CDs and distribution </li>
<li>Promotional
     Material for Marketing (Posters, one-sheets, photo shoot, album artwork)</li>
<li>Press/Radio
     Tour Costs </li>
</ul>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>So. With all that being said, the minimum hard costs outlined
are $20,500. But, adding in the additional marketing/promotion costs we are
looking at a grand total of $25,550. That’s a car. A down-payment on a house.
Or a record, haha.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of our goals and what we will be able to
do with the amount of money raised! </p>
<ul>
<li>10k = Recording all New Songs </li>
<li>13k = Recording + Radio Promotion for Single ""It's
     A Song""</li>
<li>18k = Recording + Radio Promo (2nd single) + New CD
     Distribution </li>
<li>20k  = Recording + Radio + CD Distribution +
     Marketing Design </li>
<li>25k = ALL ABOVE NEEDS + Marketing Materials, Videos,
     Photos, etc.! </li>
</ul>
<p>I’m not finished yet! Because I value everyone’s dollar, I want
you to get an awesome PERK for your selfless donation. I’ve tried to be super
creative on these perks you see listed, and would encourage you to check them

<p>Thankfully with campaign outlets like IndieGoGo we are able to
set up a fundraiser, that even if we do not fulfill our entire goal, we will
still walk away with what we DO raise! If we aren't able to raise the entire
amount, then that's okay! We will still go into the studio and work on what we
can and get new music out to y'all. It may not be a full album, or (2) radio
singles, and we may not be able to do all the promotion and marketing bells and
whistles we want to, but we will still make NEW music no matter what and it
will make a huge splash! It might take a little longer to get a full project
completed, but any donation will help get us started! Anything is better than
the $0 we have now :) </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Don't get paid for another two weeks and need to keep you
electricity turned on? I HEAR YA! It's okay if you aren't able to donate!
Spreading the word is JUST as important! Copy this link and post this on
Facebook, or send via text message to your friends and family to let them know
about these really cool perks they can win! Also, we have live shows coming up
and coming out and supporting a live show is JUST as important!!!! Head on over

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello IndieGoGo viewers! 
I'm a big-haired country singing girl from Texas! I've been
making music and travelling across our great state for the past 4 years. Below
is lots of info about a new adventure I'm ready to take, but I need the help of
y'all! Watch the video for the 4-1-1 and below is a lengthy version that will
explain what this is all about! 
Friends, Family and Fans… I have such exciting news that I have
been dying to share with you… I’m ready to make some new MUSIC!!!!! Yes, you
heard it from the horse’s mouth – It’s time to get back in the studio and crank
out some new material. My last EP (short 6 song album) was released in March
2014 and blew my mind – because of YOU it was a Top 200 iTunes Country Album
Download! (#163 to be exact) Not only that but my first radio single “Just
Another Blonde” went to #94 on the Texas Country Radio Charts and my second
single ""Avalanche"" went to #21!!! I mean really?! This year was
amazing. Not only did I have digital success, but there were some life moments
that no dollar sign could buy. I was nominated for ""New Female Vocalist of
the Year"" for the Texas Regional Radio Awards and was featured as a
""New Face"" in Texas Country! I sang at the legendary Bluebird Café in
Nashville. I recorded with the top musicians at OmniSound on music row. I’ve
been able to go out on the road and play over 200 shows the past 2 years. I
went into the studio for the first time EVER September 2013 to record my first
song, ""Life Changes"" and now I'm looking at putting together a full
length album! 
That’s just the tip of the iceberg. I have been busting my butt
to save money, promote my music and get out there and meet y’all and I think
this year has been a HUGE stepping stone in expanding that dream from just
singing in some bars in Dallas to getting out on the road and seeing all of
Texas and playing bigger venues (remember when we had 1,500 people at my EP
release party in March? Yeah, that was awesome). 
Which brings me to a fork in the road. Thankfully I was able to
gain financial support from a few investors to make this last record happen,
and could never thank them enough. They allowed me to get my feet off the
ground for the first time and now I’m not quite ready to come back down. The EP
record produced 3 radio singles; “Life Changes”, “Just Another Blonde” that
went to #94 and was on the charts for 27 weeks, and “Avalanche” which went to
#21 on the charts (my first Top 25 single EK)!  
I’ve got the material and the momentum from YOU the fans, but we
are a few dollars short on getting the final touches together for a full length
album.  This is why I’m reaching out to y’all, I get asked ALL THE TIME,
“when are you putting out new music”, “when can we expect another album”… well,
when I can raise some money! Haha. Music is more than a hobby to me, it’s my
passion and without it I don’t know what I would do with my nights and
weekends… watch Real Housewives?! (oh wait, I already do that…) But really… I
LOVE music and feel I have been blessed thus far, and from the encouragement I
have gotten from people over the past few years, this is something I should
continue to pursue as long as it will let me.
In addition to putting together a new full length album, we are
planning to send out ANOTHER single (""It's A Song"") from the EP to radio
September 21st! Then a single from the NEW album out in Feb 2016 and then the
full length album out March 2016 (estimated times). I mean things are about to
start CRANKING Y'ALL! 
I have already been in the works putting together a launch team
that is AMAZING (like seriously), but we need your help to get the funds to
back these new efforts! 
What We Need & What You Get
If you have gotten to
this point of my soap box BLESS YOUR HEART! I’m going to get to the
nitty-gritty now I promise. To record a full length album; the hard costs are
hiring the band to record, rent the studio, the engineer, mix and mastering
(the button flipping process that makes it sound good, that I do not
understand, and that is much harder than I just explained). Then we have my
Rock-Star Producer Zac Maloy who is coming in on this project,
HE IS THE MAN!!! He not only produced my 6 song EP, but he co-wrote on half the
album. The man that brought you The Nixons, songs recorded by Carrie Underwood,
Blake Shelton, Tim McGraw...need I keep going? He's on board. So you should be
too! 
Then there are the
costs to physically have CDs printed to take to shows and mail out to venues
for booking, and then the radio single to mail out to stations. In addition to
the minimum hard costs, the additional marketing/promotion cost to make the
album/single successful….You have to pay a radio promoter to get the single out
to radio (Thank the lord for Dorothea Ivey, Cabin Creek Promotions who is the
master-mind behind “Avalanche” and will be working ""It's A Song"").
THENNNNNN, we have a photo shoot to try and make me look cool (which is very
very hard) so we can create an album cover and artwork, and use those pictures
for the website, social media, one-sheet mail outs, etc. Which turns into
BOOKING GIGS and going on the road. Because they will only book you if you
have all of the above FIRST.... Soooo here is a breakdown of the budget for
y'all to peak at! 
Where is the money going?

Promoting Next Radio Single – ""It's A Song""
Record &
     Produce FULL Length Album
Promotion for New Single from Full Length Album - Feb
     2016
Production
     cost of Full Length CDs and distribution 
Promotional
     Material for Marketing (Posters, one-sheets, photo shoot, album artwork)
Press/Radio
     Tour Costs 

The Impact
So. With all that being said, the minimum hard costs outlined
are $20,500. But, adding in the additional marketing/promotion costs we are
looking at a grand total of $25,550. That’s a car. A down-payment on a house.
Or a record, haha.
Here is the breakdown of our goals and what we will be able to
do with the amount of money raised! 

10k = Recording all New Songs 
13k = Recording + Radio Promotion for Single ""It's
     A Song""
18k = Recording + Radio Promo (2nd single) + New CD
     Distribution 
20k  = Recording + Radio + CD Distribution +
     Marketing Design 
25k = ALL ABOVE NEEDS + Marketing Materials, Videos,
     Photos, etc.! 

I’m not finished yet! Because I value everyone’s dollar, I want
you to get an awesome PERK for your selfless donation. I’ve tried to be super
creative on these perks you see listed, and would encourage you to check them
out! Everything from a free song downloads, to coming to Nashville with me, to
SINGING ON THE RECORD (it’s okay if you’re not a great singer, we have
auto-tune, hehe)… I want you to be part of this record in every way possible!!!!!
