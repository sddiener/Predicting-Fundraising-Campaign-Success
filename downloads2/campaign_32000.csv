<p></p>
<p><b>THE CONCEPT</b></p>
<p>To install a specialized form of tiny modular houses in a ‘big box’ style warehouse (think Costco) that would give each family a secure place to sleep, read, laugh, do homework and bathe - privately and securely. Set up as a complete working community with resources for families with school children, everyone works or contributes in some way to the habitat. The focus is on families, their children's education and their parent’s advancement back into society.</p>
<p><b>THE PROJECT</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">To create a complete packaged, blueprinted and road mapped solution for cities, groups and investors to build and grow micro-community habitats in their cities. </span></p>
<p><b>THE ISSUE</b></p>
<p>There are over 1.6 million homeless children in our nation. Not winos, drug addicts or cardboard wielding panhandlers, they are <i>children</i> and they are a part of our nation’s future.</p>
<p>Most of our homeless children are victims of the economy and housing meltdown. Surrounded by winos, criminals and drug addicts in mixed use cot shelters, many homeless families choose to take their chances in parks, abandoned houses and cars instead.</p>

<p><b>THE IMPACT</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p> According to the 2009 figures, homeless individual without supportive housing costs the public upwards of $3000 a month, and this doesn't include the life-long effects and costs on children forced to live under such circumstances. The typical public cost for residents in supportive housing, however, is approximately $600 a month.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/24513/files/20130820212437-Where_We_Sleep_chart.gif?1377059077"" src="""" style=""""/></p>   <a href=""http://www.economicrt.org/summaries/Where_We_Sleep.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""http://www.economicrt.org/summaries/Where_We_Sleep.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Graph and info via Where We Sleep </a><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Public costs go down when individuals are no longer homeless. Stopping homelessness, not just through housing, but through better family education and support for our youths and their parents can only further reduce the short and long term societal costs.  Plus it's just the right thing to do. America should not have a single child sleeping in the streets. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>While the cost for a city to build these centers will be dependent on how they address the different facets, initial building costs spread over the number of people served over time should make it an attractive option. Factoring in the social education opportunity, the ability to employ the resident workforce as well as generate goods, services and energy can make this a very smart, cost effective option. </p>

<p></p>
<p><b>WHAT IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL? </b></p>
<p>If we can't raise a mere $7500 to begin to improve the lives of 1.6 million U.S. children, then shame on us as a society. <i>Please contribute. You matter and your contribution matters. </i></p>
<p>However, If we don't reach our goal, we'll take the funds we do receive and continue to find ways to reach the professionals we need to connect with to get the job done.

<p><b>ABOUT THE DRAWINGS </b></p>
<p>Annette has lifelong construction experience and an interior design (UCLA) background, so she drew the simple plans. In the <a href=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/90554338/HabitatforFamilies.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PDF</a> you can zoom in further explore the basic idea of the community. The dining and multi-purpose rooms are not correctly sized or placed. Those have to be determined by how they will be used and how many will use them at a time. The houses are drawn to scale and basic code, however, we need professional help with egress, safety and fire codes. The reason we are raising funds is to get to the bottom of all these aspects, develop a solid plan and go from there. Every great thing starts out as a great idea and builds from there. </p>

 Tonight when you go to bed remember 1.6 million U.S. children needed solutions today.
PLEASE BE GENEROUS
Together we're the smart adults our children need.



THE PLANS




THE COMMUNITYSimple modular living quarters with bunks, a writing desk and personal storage is where families can safely and securely bed down with their children at night line the ‘streets’ inside the warehouse. Nice portable showers and lavatories, including handicapped accessible, are plugged into the back of the units for ease of maintenance and sanitation. Blue streets designated on the warehouse floor plan above provide service access. 





Rubber sidewalks and soft synthetic grass define the front yards. Bicycling around the neighborhood makes it the perfect place to be a kid. Holidays and celebrations have a place and meaning once again.

If at any point we reach a deal breaking double jeopardy form of Murphy's Law, involving un-variance-able building codes, ridiculous government bureaucracy, an act of God, or a pandemic chocolate shortage, we'll use the funds to continue our daily non-profit work of helping women and their families all over the world live better, healthier lives. But don't expect us to give up all that easily.


MEET US!  We're the team leading this project for our organization







ABOUT THE DRAWINGS 
Annette has lifelong construction experience and an interior design (UCLA) background, so she drew the simple plans. In the PDF you can zoom in further explore the basic idea of the community. The dining and multi-purpose rooms are not correctly sized or placed. Those have to be determined by how they will be used and how many will use them at a time. The houses are drawn to scale and basic code, however, we need professional help with egress, safety and fire codes. The reason we are raising funds is to get to the bottom of all these aspects, develop a solid plan and go from there. Every great thing starts out as a great idea and builds from there.

</h3>I teach a section of Religion 102 at Garden State Youth Correctional Facility, through the Princeton Prison Teaching Initiative. We are at (or over) our budget for course materials, but my 10 students really need copies of Kate Turabian's <i>Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations</i>. They struggle with issues such as organizing their papers, attributing sources properly, and formatting citations correctly. We could just give them some handouts, but if they have Turabian, they can use it to continue working on their research and writing skills in future courses and after they are released. In addition, they can start building their personal libraries of essential reference materials for college-level work.<br/><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3><ul>
<li>I have 10 students, and I can get brand-new copies at a discount through a local independent bookstore. So, really, $180 would cover all ten copies of Turabian plus the indiegogo fees (12%). <br/>
</li>
<li>If I raise $500, the indiegogo fees will be lower (7%), and I will use the additional funds to purchase similar reference materials for students in other classes and/or source materials for my students' research papers. You will have my undying gratitude.</li>

<p>Dan Selec had been thinking about his son's future for a long time. Having a child on the autism spectrum, he asked the same question so many parents ask; ""What happens when my son grows up? What is out there that can help him today, in a practical and predictable way?"" Dan recognized the interest, ability and passion many like his son seemed to display, especially in regard to PC’s and game consoles. If this passion could be harnessed in the form of technical ability, an entirely new method of communication, expression and productivity would be possible.<br/> The culmination of Dan's thoughts resulted in the foundational nonPareil whitepaper, <a href=""http://www.npitx.org/files/NPIWP1.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Technical Training for the Autistic Mind</a> written in July 2008.<br/><br/> Shortly after, Dan met Gary Moore, a parent asking the same questions. Gary is also the parent of a child on the spectrum, and understood the challenges ahead, and also recognized his son’s similar interest in computers and video games. It was at this first meeting that Gary committed to helping Dan take his vision and make it a reality, and in September 2008, they founded Nonpareil Institute.<br/><br/> Dan began training the first student in his kitchen in July 2009, then added a second and third quickly thereafter, due in no small part to the efforts of J’Lynn Anderson who conducted the early student recruiting efforts. The nightly training in Dan’s kitchen quickly grew to 8 students and five nights a week, for over a year. As his wife says today, “It was just our new norm…”<br/> Gary’s efforts during this time were largely directed at building a network of supporters, partners and donors to help fund the young, fledgling company, as well as finding a location for nonPareils’ first training center. Through a mutual friend, an introduction was made to the Executive Director of the Guildhall at SMU-in-Plano, which led to a meeting with the Campus Director to consider space for nonPareil.<br/><br/> The culmination of the efforts of this team resulted in the opening of the first full-time nonPareil operation on the campus of SMU-in-Plano in September 2010. This site, which opened with 8 students, quickly grew to 52 students in the first 8 months. One year later more space was acquired, and the program grew to over 80 students.<br/><br/> Today, 3 of our original students are full-time employees of the company, with 9 other students being part-time staff.<br/> As of June 2012, we have 3 apps in the iTunes store, and 1 in the Android store, as well as many free to play maps and campaigns for various popular games.

Since then Hip Hop has been a part of my life, Rakim, KRS-One and Public Enemy taught me about a culture I may have never seen had it not been for that awareness that they shared with me through music. I put together a concept a few years ago of getting involved with an already well established Hip Hop scene and trying to bring more underground out of town acts to come and preform. I started a page on Facebook called Fort Wayne Hip Hop Society and began reaching out to others that seemed to share the same ideas as I had and people that were already bringing their elements to the people.</h2>
<h2><strong>Pillars in the Park is going to be a free all ages show in Friemann Square that showcases the importance of the Pillars of Hip Hop, DJing, B Boying Emceeing, and Graf artists.

<h3>Tuition Fundraising</h3>
<p>Ivan and I have been studying in seminary for 4 years.  I have just finished my certificate this summer.  Ivan still has 30 credits to go and our 3rd kid is going to school this fall.  </p>
<p>外子與我同在神學院已四年.  我有幸今年剛完成我的証書課程, 但外子仍有三十個學分在讀.  我們的小女子也將於 9 月入讀學前班. </p>
<p>Honestly we are still not sure where would God lead us in the future.  God hasn't tell us where or in what we will serve.  Ivan has a strong feeling (or possibly calling?) that he would be serving college students.  We attend the Chinese Community Church at Washington D.C.  Besides serving at church, Ivan lead Bible study at home helping non-believer and I help kids in low income families to learn to play piano.  </p>
<p>說實的, 我們還未知道主將來要差派我們往那裡去.  外子一直有感動要服侍大專學生.  我們現在在美京中華基督教會事奉.  除了在教會事奉, 外子在家舉辦查經班幫助未信主之家庭, 而我則教授低收入家庭的兒童學習彈鋼琴.</p>
<p>Ivan is studying a Master of Divinity program with a pastoral focus and has finished 2/3 of the program.  We have been paying every cents of our studies in the past two years.  We are still expecting to pay US$13,000 in tuition and US$5,000 for room and board before he can graduate.  The tuition burden is getting intense from time to time.  We are hoping to raise just enough money for his next class on August 2014 (Hebrew III).  He has been maintaining his GPA around 3.79 (out of 4.0) so far.</p>
<p>現在外子是神學碩士在讀, 主修是教牧, 已完成課程的三分之二.  過去兩年我們沒有拿任何資助自付學費.  現在還要大概一萬三千美元學費和五千美元的交通住宿費才能完成整個課程.  這次籌款盼望可籌得 8 月要修讀的希伯來文III的學費.  外子成績一直維持在 3.79 (4.0 是滿分) 左右.</p>
<p>

We have three little kids and we believe in Christian education as a caregiver to our kids. 
Our 7-year-old and our 4-year-old are studying in private Christian
schools.  Our 3-year-old daughter will
join the journey in Christian education this Sept.  Our seminary study along with my high-risk
pregnancies has been such a blessing.  We
learned to pray and read and worship together as a family.  There had been very difficult moments in
facing Joshua’s asthma and Katie’s serious eczema.  Katie’s condition has been so bad that it
would have been prevent her in going to school this year.  We experienced God’s healing and the supports
of brothers and sisters with lots of prayers and help.  Katie’s skin has been improved a lot this
year.  Most importantly we have
experienced God’s grace through this. 
Even Nathan is extremely thankful for Katie’s situation.</p>
<p>我們育有三個小孩, 我們相信將孩子信到教會學校是主所喜悅的.  大兒子 (7 嵗) 跟次子(4嵗)
都已在基督教的私校就讀.  女兒
(3嵗) 亦將於9 月加入基督教學校.  在讀時的兩次高危懷孕成為我們很大的祝福.  我們學會了一家人一起祈禱, 讀經, 和敬拜.  謙謙的哮喘和妹妹的濕疹讓我們經歷主的醫治和弟兄姐妹的關愛.<span>  大家的禱告和偏方 (豬油, 馬油, 亞麻子油,
大麻子油等等) 都為我們帶來很大的幫助.  妹妹的情況今年好多了.  本來以為她今年不能入學, 因著主的醫治, 她也準備上學了, 就連晟仔也讚嘆主醫治了妹妹.</span></p>
<p>Anything would help.  It would be great if you could share this page with others who may be interested in sponsoring a seminary student.  We trust that God will have a way.  Every classes in the seminary has been a faith builder to us.  We hope we could finish it strong so that we could be better equipped when we are called to serve Him full time in the future.  Thank you very much!</p>
<p>任何的幫助我們都無限感激.  請把這網頁與其他人分享.  我們深信主必供應.  在神學院的每一課程對我們都有極大造就.  希望將來能幫助我們全職事奉.  謝謝各位!</p>

</h3><h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">Our Mission</span><br/>
</h3><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">My name is Joe Spanos, and I was
a proud educator for over 30 years, lately I have seen and heard of way too
many tragedies in our schoolhouses, and I feel the need to increase school
safety in our buildings is a must. To sit back and not be proactive would be a
travesty. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Two recent local and tragic
events that hit “close to home” which made me realize how important it is to
assist in securing our schools were:  the
“mass-shooting rampage” that horrifically killed 26 innocent 6 and 7-year-old
children and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in New Town, CT.  My daughter was in the first grade when that
tragedy occurred.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The
second most recent “Unthinkable” act of violence was the brutal stabbing,
raping and murdering of one of my former most beloved students at Andover High
School; Colleen Ritzer.  Colleen was a
beautiful soul and an angel on earth who wanted to be a Math Teacher and help
shape the lives of our youth.  Her life
was tragically taken at Danvers High School at the age of 24 by her fourteen
year old student.  I have seen enough, as
I’m sure you have, and would appreciate your assistance in minimizing and
preventing these violent acts of terror in our schools.  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><h3>How Will SEND Make An Impact</h3><p></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p><p>To really appreciate the power of having such a device on hand requires you to imagine yourself as a teacher in a real classroom scenario.  Many teachers do not physically carry their cell phones on them during class.  It is either silenced on their desks, usually out of sight, or even secured within a purse that's placed under or inside the teacher's desk.  Keep in mind that teachers do not only sit at their desks, but actively move about the room helping students learn and tackle new concepts.  </p><p>When an attacker breaks into the classroom, there are but only a few seconds to react that could spell the difference between life and death.  With the best case of having a cell phone already in your pocket, you would still have to pull it out, select the emergency option, dial 9-1-1, and hope that you have reception or time long enough to connect to the operator.  During all of this, your focus was removed from your assailant; anything could have happened.  If the cell phone was in the desk and you are half way down the room, the attacker could be standing between you and your only lifeline.  </p><p>The SEND device is worn on the teacher at all times and with a quick press of one button, the emergency authorities are notified and the programmed alerts are immediately sent out.  This means that your focus could stay on your assailant the whole time, giving you more time to defend yourself and perform split-second decisions.  Additionally, having alerted the rest of the school, additional casualties could be significantly reduced.  That is the power of the SEND system.  Every fraction of a second counts.</p><br/><p></p><h4><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;""></span></h4><h3>Ways You Can Help<br/>
</h3><p>Please join our SEND team in assisting with
the cost of the prototype and/or communicating to others through the means of
“Social Media” and alike of our SEND product. Your contribution can help stop
the violence and save lives now… </p>
<br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Where Your Funds Will Make A Difference</h3><p>All proceeds will be used towards building the SEND prototype system.  There will <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">be a lot of custom software and hardware required and about $19,000 will go </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">towards designing, coding, integrating, and testing the software and firmware of the SEND device and network prototypes.  $9,000 will go towards building the hardware of the SEND system.  This will include personal devices carried by the individuals, and also the custom network routers that will form the SEND network within a facility.  The remaining $2,000 will go towards marketing and business development.  Any additional money will go towards improving the SEND design to miniaturize the units and fund the mass production of them.  </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As with any R&amp;D, there is a higher cost up front.  Once the design and prototype are completed, the products themselves are much more affordable and will have low cost production and maintenance.</span></p><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Benefits of SEND<br/>

Our Mission
My name is Joe Spanos, and I was
a proud educator for over 30 years, lately I have seen and heard of way too
many tragedies in our schoolhouses, and I feel the need to increase school
safety in our buildings is a must. To sit back and not be proactive would be a
travesty. Two recent local and tragic
events that hit “close to home” which made me realize how important it is to
assist in securing our schools were:  the
“mass-shooting rampage” that horrifically killed 26 innocent 6 and 7-year-old
children and staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in New Town, CT.  My daughter was in the first grade when that
tragedy occurred.The
second most recent “Unthinkable” act of violence was the brutal stabbing,
raping and murdering of one of my former most beloved students at Andover High
School; Colleen Ritzer.  Colleen was a
beautiful soul and an angel on earth who wanted to be a Math Teacher and help
shape the lives of our youth.  Her life
was tragically taken at Danvers High School at the age of 24 by her fourteen
year old student.  I have seen enough, as
I’m sure you have, and would appreciate your assistance in minimizing and
preventing these violent acts of terror in our schools.  How Will SEND Make An ImpactTo really appreciate the power of having such a device on hand requires you to imagine yourself as a teacher in a real classroom scenario.  Many teachers do not physically carry their cell phones on them during class.  It is either silenced on their desks, usually out of sight, or even secured within a purse that's placed under or inside the teacher's desk.  Keep in mind that teachers do not only sit at their desks, but actively move about the room helping students learn and tackle new concepts.  When an attacker breaks into the classroom, there are but only a few seconds to react that could spell the difference between life and death.  With the best case of having a cell phone already in your pocket, you would still have to pull it out, select the emergency option, dial 9-1-1, and hope that you have reception or time long enough to connect to the operator.  During all of this, your focus was removed from your assailant; anything could have happened.  If the cell phone was in the desk and you are half way down the room, the attacker could be standing between you and your only lifeline.  The SEND device is worn on the teacher at all times and with a quick press of one button, the emergency authorities are notified and the programmed alerts are immediately sent out.  This means that your focus could stay on your assailant the whole time, giving you more time to defend yourself and perform split-second decisions.  Additionally, having alerted the rest of the school, additional casualties could be significantly reduced.  That is the power of the SEND system.  Every fraction of a second counts.Ways You Can Help
Please join our SEND team in assisting with
the cost of the prototype and/or communicating to others through the means of
“Social Media” and alike of our SEND product. Your contribution can help stop
the violence and save lives now… 
Where Your Funds Will Make A DifferenceAll proceeds will be used towards building the SEND prototype system.  There will be a lot of custom software and hardware required and about $19,000 will go towards designing, coding, integrating, and testing the software and firmware of the SEND device and network prototypes.  $9,000 will go towards building the hardware of the SEND system.  This will include personal devices carried by the individuals, and also the custom network routers that will form the SEND network within a facility.  The remaining $2,000 will go towards marketing and business development.  Any additional money will go towards improving the SEND design to miniaturize the units and fund the mass production of them.  As with any R&D, there is a higher cost up front.  Once the design and prototype are completed, the products themselves are much more affordable and will have low cost production and maintenance.Benefits of SEND

Many people have different types of phones, running different mobile OS and varying hardware and firmware specs.  Based on our expertise, to make a universal app would be too complex in keeping up with the multitude of software and hardware platforms. We wanted to take a different direction with the goal of providing a complete solution.  2.

What constraints do you have?
We spent a lot of time thinking about the obstacles that we will face moving ahead with a prototype design.1. Cost: Generally, to accomplish what we are asking for would require a lot more money.  After reviewing our options and considering different individuals, we chose to move forward with the proposal from expert and reputable engineers based on their reasonable costs and their full belief in our cause.2. Time: The sooner we are able to complete this project, the sooner we can potentially save lives.  Based on our needs, we took this approach because we believe that it is the most efficient path to get the product to the market.3.

At the northern edge of the city of Matagalpa sits a small plot of land burned by the equatorial sun. Two years ago, a Catholic nun approached the owners of the land about creating a safe place for the many impoverished boys and girls in the neighborhood. At first, they provided a simple sanctuary from the dangers of the streets. Soon, a basic meal was offered in return for good behavior. Now, several hundred children visit El Comedor each week to receive the love, care and attention that every child deserves.

</div></div>","Every Child Deserves A Chance

COMMUNITY LIBRARIES ARE A SOURCE OF HOPE
A child with access to a community library is 300% more likely to complete her primary education.
 

Hi, I'm Joe Hafner, Founder of Go For Hope and the guy that started this campaign. In 2010, I moved my family to Nicaragua after losing almost everything in the recession. Living there for nearly a year transformed my life: Despite my own losses, I learned to embrace gratitude and was filled with a desire to serve the most vulnerable. When we returned to the U.S. I started Go For Hope to share the joy of service and giving. This is our first crowd funding campaign, and I hope you will join us in giving the gift of education and hope to these children.
Where does the money go?
This campaign is to fund two library programs in very specific ways:
Program 1: El Comedor (The Community Soup Kitchen)
 



At the northern edge of the city of Matagalpa sits a small plot of land burned by the equatorial sun. Two years ago, a Catholic nun approached the owners of the land about creating a safe place for the many impoverished boys and girls in the neighborhood. At first, they provided a simple sanctuary from the dangers of the streets. Soon, a basic meal was offered in return for good behavior. Now, several hundred children visit El Comedor each week to receive the love, care and attention that every child deserves.

The all-volunteer staff at El Comedor wants to offer these students more by building a library and homework center on the premises. They need the following: 

Security improvements to the existing fence: $1200
Building improvements: $3400
Tables, chairs: $450
Secure cabinets for book storage: $875
Educational supplements: $800
Seed collection of children's titles: $500
Library-in-a-box lending system: $250
Librarian training: $600
Basic art and education supplies: $375
Total: $8450
 
Project 2: El Volador (The Flying Book, mobile library)


On the outskirts of Estelí, in the ranching and tobacco-growing region of northern Nicaragua, sit a series of small disconnected farming villages. Too far from the city center, these communities rely on the mobile library truck to bring not just books, but medical, vision and dental necessities to vulnerable residents.

El Volador currently serves 800 children on a bi-monthly rotation. Twice that many are not receiving any services at all. With some help, they can offer services to more than 2500 children by adding a second route. To accomplish this, they need the following: 

Improvements to the current vehicle: $4400
Additional books for current route: $450
Training for a second mobile librarian: $600
Seed collection of children's titles for second route: $500
Library-in-a-box lending system for second route: $250
Adult literacy program supplies: $475
Total: $6675
Stretch goals and future projects
If we surpass our funding goal, our next target is $22,500. This would allow us to build, supply and train the staff for a library at a boarding home for teenage boys who have been rescued from the streets.

 In Nicaragua…

Out of 100 children who start the first grade this year, 51 of them will complete the 5th grade.
The average Nicaraguan adult aged 25-40 has 4.6 years of formal schooling.
Nicaragua spends $62 per year per student.  In contrast, the United States spends an average of $10,600.
Lack of training and low income cause many teachers to abandon their profession.



HELP US BUILD A COMMUNITY LIBRARYPoverty is the greatest threat to the welfare of Nicaraguan children.More than 2/3 of the population earns an average of $100 per month. Unlike the United States, children in Nicaragua are often pressured to leave school as early as 8 years old to help the family earn income or perform domestic duties. 
However, a student that completes her primary education
Will earn 1.4 times more than her less-educated peers. 
Each year of education beyond the 5th grade is correlated with a 14% increase in monthly earnings. 


The Backstory 
The first book I remember reading was ""The Berenstain Bears: Bears in the Night"". I can still feel the excitement and anticipation that built as my imagination carried me out my window, down the tree, over the wall, and under the bridge, off on an adventure into the night. Classic children's tales are a staple of early education in the U.S. and foster a love of exploration and discovery through reading. Frankly, I'd taken books for granted for most of my life...   
A Story begins...
 


On August 12th, 2010, my wife, three children and I left friends, relatives and everything familiar behind and boarded a plane bound for Nicaragua, a little-known Spanish-speaking country in Central America. We had lost our home after a two year battle against the recession, and we needed a change. We had brains in our heads and shoes on our feet, and that was about it.
We abandoned our suburban lifestyle for nearly a year to live as neighbors in the 2nd poorest country in the Western Hemisphere. We helped where we could and discovered the importance of dignity in cross-cultural relationships.
One sunny afternoon we visited a rural school on a mobile library truck. Children of all ages burst with excitement at our arrival. They crowded around a makeshift table, eyes drinking in the vibrant book covers laid out before them. I learned that thanks to this little pick-up truck and a few hundred children's titles, these children could check out two books per month. Before the library was started, they had none. For these students, books were a luxury.


The Next Chapter...

Six months after returning to the United States I started Go For Hope. Our mission: to improve the quality and access to education for children in the most disadvantaged regions of Nicaragua by partnering with indigenous programs such as community libraries and learning centers.
With the support of a small but dedicated team of volunteers and donors, we have donated more than 1000 books and partnered with several Nicaraguan organizations in support of education. But there is much more to do.
We need your help to expand the programs that we currently support, and reach more children who thirst for a quality education.",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Two classes away from finishing my MA in Special Education, San Francisco State University cut off my tuition grant.   I filed an appeal, and won the appeal, but was told that a new policy overrided my appeal.   I even wrote the Director of Financial aid, but to no avail.   I could take out a loan, but because I'm at the aggregate maximum I'd need a co-signer.   So I decided to explore other possibilities and a close friend of mine suggested that I put my situation up on this site.</p>
<p>Ironically, at the same time they told me my tuition would no longer be covered the school awarded me a $3,000 grant for conference travel - contingent on me enrolling in classes.   I'm scheduled to present at the Psychology of Mathematics Education-North American conference in Chicago in November and at the California Mathematics Council-Asilomar in December.   It's forbidden to use the $3,000 for tuition, and I can't ""unlock"" the money unless i can come up with the money for tuition.    So you can think of it almost like a matching grant, I guess :-)</p>
<p>My research in Special Education focuses on two simple questions: - What is it about mathematics that makes it so challenging for so many people and how can we teach it so that everyone can understand?   At the same time, I think we need to move away from endless practicing of procedures and focus on mathematical thinking.   I find inspiration from the ideas of disability studies and queer studies, and consider those paradigms central to my work.   My ""creative project"" for my degree will focus on the creation of a training workshop for mathematics teachers that encourages them to think creatively and innovatively about mathematics disability and mathematical possibility.</p>
Where would the money go?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Part-time fees for a graduate student at SF State are $2442 per semester.  So, for two semesters that equals $4884, and then counting the 4 percent surcharge:  x - 0.04x = 4884, so x = $5087.   Even if I don't reach that goal, funds will be applied to tuition and I will come up with other ways to raise the rest of the money - applying for scholarships, working part-time, and anything else I can come up with.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Perks</div>
<p>The primary perk of funding this work is making my conference available to all using free/libre/open (FLO) licenses.   All of my conference papers are available on my website:  <a href=""http://www.jamessheldon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.jamessheldon.com</a> - under the Creative Commons CC-BY-SA license - you are free to share, copy, and remix the work as long as you keep the same terms.</p>
<p><br/>That said, at risk of sounding like a dreaded PBS pledge drive, I'm happy to offer a few individual perks, which are listed in the perks section.   I'm not adding any extra money to what I'm asking for to cover perks, though, so feel free to opt out of the perk and have your entire donation go towards the tuition.</p>

 Why Micro Finance is Important and How it Works Have you ever heard the saying: “Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; show him how to catch fish, and you feed him for a lifetime”? Micro finance is the financial embodiment of this principal. We don’t just give people money; we loan money to people to start and grow their own businesses so that they have the ability to move themselves and their communities out of poverty. When they repay their loan, the money, including a small amount of interest, is re-invested in another entrepreneur. We make this possible by partnering with organizations like Village Exchange International/Ghana (VEG). VEG is in Ghana working directly with these local entrepreneurs and has programs to inform villagers of these opportunities and aid them through the process.  VEG will be having weekly meetings with the loan recipients to help keep them on track towards repaying their loans. Loans Across Borders club members and contributors to this campaign will receive updates on these weekly meetings and the progress that is being made.                                 How You can Help Twelve women in Ghana need loans to help them grow their businesses.

<div>
<p>Welcome to the <em>MyQUEST</em> funding project, as you’ll notice in the above clip, we are not movie masterminds, we are teachers. We have partnered with renowned Australian Software Developers, Studio Emotion (our techno wizards) so we may build this mutli-platform learning system.</p>
<p>As you know, 21<sup>st</sup> century technology has contributed to massive changes in communication, education and societal expectations. Cyber bullying threatens children in their homes and incidents of anxiety, teen pregnancy and teen suicide grow at an alarming rate. Our kids need help. They need our support. They need to learn how to cope with a maelstrom of emotion, thought  and information that assaults their senses every day. Our children need to learn how to interact within the world so they may recognise and evaluate what they see, hear and feel. This help starts in the home, extends into the classroom and moves beyond to online platforms.  If young adults don’t have the skills to ‘fit in’ the 21<sup>st</sup> century, if young learners don’t have 21<sup>st</sup> century literacy tools, if our kids don’t have learning flexibility, they simply will not survive.</p>
<p>Therefore, we want to develop <em>MyQUEST</em>, a fully interactive learning platform for smartphones and tablets. We want to use the latest and greatest in learning technology to help young adults become confident, courageous, creative and compassionate, lifelong learners. <em>MyQuest  </em>is based on the <em>Is This MyStory</em> Learning process. Its innovative design utilises the features of narrative to link gaming technology, animation, interactive pages, film, music, books, blogging, storytelling, social media, global connectivity and much more. <em>MyQuest</em> uses the technology young adults love, to help them develop a focused, flexible approach to learning. With <em>MyQuest</em>, teenagers embark upon a journey toward a critically, emotionally and creatively literate future.</p>
<p>We all know, today’s teens don’t go anywhere without their phones. With <em>MyQuest</em>, they will be carrying 21<sup>st</sup> century learning tools wherever they go. Perhaps you’d like to think about this – would you prefer your teenager played with slightly upset birds - becoming angrier by the second, or would you like them to recognise their thoughts and manage their emotions while interacting, studying or simply playing with ideas.</p>
<p>With your contributions, we can make this happen. We aim to generate enough funding to breathe life into cutting edge technology that will help teenagers connect and learn in constructive ways. You can help us develop an elite platform which incorporates intricate gaming, detailed illustrations, creative animations and complex interactivity.</p>
<p>As a system, <em>MyQUEST</em> is a 4 Phased learning platform (4 apps) and, even though we have already developed and written the content, the project will cost approximately $150,000 to complete. Nevertheless, we have set an initial target of $25,000. This will help us build Phase 1. All funds will be put toward the cost of developing the software. Of course, we would rather create all 4 phases at once and have set stretch goals in the hope of reaching the total amount. These stretch goals will also allow contributors to access Phases 2-4 and open opportunities for Launch Parties in Melbourne, Brisbane/Gold Coast and hopefully, overseas.</p>
<p>We’d love to come to your city, visit your schools, talk to your teachers , meet you and throw a big bash launch party, especially New York, London, Vancouver or even Honolulu (more information can be found below under Launch Parties).</p>
<p> </p>
<img alt=""The Company Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/3elv8.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Company""/><p><em>Is This MyStory</em> is an Australian business founded on principals of metacognition and built on the teaching experience of Nicole Feledy, a passionate, innovative English teacher / author who loves stories and genuinely cares about her students. Nicole and the MyStory team have recognised deficiencies within educational systems worldwide.  They see a growing number of students left behind, unable to develop the key skills they require to survive in a technological era.  Nicole and her team want to help. They want to provide tangible strategies that will enable students throughout the world to develop key skills in critical, creative and emotional literacy. These are the 21<sup>st</sup> century skills our children need to thrive in a time of rapid change.  Imagine 21<sup>st</sup> century learners with 21<sup>st</sup> century tools, feeling confident, courageous, creative and compassionate because they are lifelong learners in control of their own learning.  Whether it be in the classroom or simply the action of living life as a 21<sup>st</sup> century teenager, our children must have the implements of successful learners. Meeting students where they are and providing access to these strategies is the number one goal of <em>Is This MyStory</em> and the <em>MyQUEST</em> Learning project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""I Want In Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/2s0cu41.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""I Want In""/></p>
<p>So how can you get involved?</p>
<p>It’s quite simple! There are two generous ways you can contribute and we hope you will do both:</p>
<p>The first way is extremely simple; just share the word with people you know. Email your family, friends and local schools. Share the link on your blog, FaceBook, Twitter, LinkedIn or any social media site. Share the message with everyone you can think of. The more people who know about <em>MyQUEST</em>, the greater the chance of achieving our goals. For starters you may like to share the link on FaceBook and Twitter now by clicking the icons below our introduction video. Go on, do it now, you know you want to.</p>
The second way to get involved is to pre-purchase <em>MyQUEST</em> by claiming one of the perks on the right hand side of this page. After clicking, you will be asked to confirm your perk and fill in your delivery details (it’s even easier if you’re on FaceBook). You can then choose to contribute using Visa, Amex, Mastercard or Discover (IndieGogo has excellent security to ensure your details are safe).<br/><p> </p>
<p><img alt=""The Good Stuff Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i50.tinypic.com/r23yqd.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Good Stuff""/></p>
<p>You will notice down the right hand side of this page we have designed different contribution levels, or 'perks', to benefit yourself, students and schools around the world - so everyone gets a little something. For example, the <strong>$99 Party Time</strong> Perk will get you <em>MyQUEST</em> Phase 1, the <em>Is This MyStory</em> eBook, the <em>MyStudy Muse</em> Program, a Mindfulness Session, tickets to the a Launch Party PLUS we will donate 10 <em>MyQuest</em> Phase 1’s to a needy school on your behalf. How good is that? Imagine how much students will appreciate your generosity!</p>
<p>NOTE: If you prefer, we are happy to transfer your gifts to family, friends or students you may know.</p>
<p>Here are your choices:</p>
<p><img alt=""Gold Coins"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i50.tinypic.com/2lldlb6.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Aussie Gold""/></p>
<p>We appreciate we will have many international contributors and will be happy to accept donations in other currencies including $US, GBP, EU and $CAN. Oh, heck! We will accept any currency. :))</p>
<p><img alt=""Door Opener Images"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i47.tinypic.com/2dweuzk.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Door Opener""/></p>
<p>The <em>Is This MyStory</em> eBook is the foundation upon which <em>MyQUEST</em> is built. It is not essential, but an obvious advantage to read the book while venturing along the <em>MyQUEST</em> journey. The eBook will be downloadable upon completion of this campaign.</p>
<p>We estimate completion of <em>MyQUEST</em> by March 2013.</p>
<p><img alt=""Now We're Talking Images"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/2lkd5wj.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Now We're Talking""/></p>
<p>The <em>MyStudy Muse Guided Learning Formula</em> is a 4 week online guided learning exercise which a student completes on a daily basis. Students develop practical strategies to improve their study skills whilst cultivating mental focus and concentration. MyStudy Muse is a 10 step process and compliments the <em>Is This MyStory</em> Learning process.</p>
<p><img alt=""Ready to Launch Images"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i49.tinypic.com/2vdpj.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ready to Launch""/></p>
<p>This is the <strong>Launch Pack</strong>. We believe it will initially be most popular for those living outside Sydney, Australia. In relation to donating the apps to needy schools, the number of people that choose this perk and the number of students per school will determine the number of schools we can donate to. Keep an eye out for the stretch goals, because once met, we may end up launching in a city near you. If and when this happens you will have the option to upgrade to the <strong>Party Time Perk</strong> to attend.</p>
<p>Launch Parties are planned to be held upon completion of <em>MyQUEST</em>, so around March 2013. See the Launch Party Section below for more information. At least you’ll have plenty of time to arrange a babysitter!</p>
<p><img alt=""Party Time Images"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i50.tinypic.com/ix7384.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Party Time""/></p>
<p>We predict this perk will be the favourite among Sydney siders.</p>
<p>Your teenagers get the 21st century tools they need, you do your bit for the community, donating <em>MyQUEST</em> to local schools and you get a fun night out.</p>
<p>Unbeatable!</p>
<p>Well that’s not entirely true because we have more contribution levels below which offer even more goodies.</p>
<p><img alt=""Judge Book Images"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/2irb5tc.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Judge This Book by the Cover""/></p>
<p>This is as unique as it comes – we are printing a limited edition paperback version of <em>Is This MyStory</em>, with a twist. The current print version features the first names of students Nicole has taught over the years printed on the cover. However the new limited edition will have your full name (or a name of your choice) along with the other 49 contributors embedded, on the cover design. There will only ever be 50 of these made and they will all be signed and personalised for you by Nicole (author). This would make a fantastic birthday or graduation gift for that special teenager. PLUS you receive the Launch Pack and a great night out.</p>
<p><img alt=""Nic Image"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/351g2af.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Nicole Feledy""/></p>
<p>This perk is designed for schools, whether you are a school or would simply like to donate on behalf of a school of your choice. You or the school will still get the Launch Pack and Party tickets and can choose from having <a href=""http://isthismystory.com/nicole/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""About Nicole"">Nicole</a> present her spectacular <em>Is This MyStory Interactive Seminar</em> at the school or a 1yr unlimited <em>MyQUEST</em> license for the school. This license will be developed during 2013 and will offer schools greater learning facilities, interactivity and additional features within the <em>MyQUEST</em> platform.</p>
<p><img alt=""Too Kind Images"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/2lm5auv.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""You're Too Kind""/></p>
<p>Now you’re really showing some heart! So many schools around Australia rely on government funding to obtain the learning tools students need and quite often funding is insufficient. It would be a dream for us if we could donate at least 10 devices to each of these needy schools. At this perk level we will donate a tablet device with <em>MyQUEST</em> in your name to a local needy school. Plus you still get all the usual extra goodies, WOW!</p>
<p><img alt=""School License"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/25fna1e.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""License to Learn""/></p>
<p>Another great perk for the school of your choice. The <em>MyQUEST</em> License is better than an individual scholarship as it will benefit every student in the school, not just one. You’d be helping an entire community here.</p>
<p><img alt=""You an Me"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i50.tinypic.com/2lsbmkg.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""One 4 You and One 4 Me""/></p>
<p>Similar to the <strong>You’re Too Kind </strong>Perk plus an added tablet device for yourself (or student of your choice) plus some additional <em>MyQUEST</em> Phases donated in your name. PLUS the best part is becoming a recognised producer in the credits of <em>MyQUEST</em> learning platform (All 4 Phases) – what a golden opportunity.</p>
<p><img alt=""Dare Images"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i45.tinypic.com/29xfddh.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""We Dare You""/></p>
<p>For the carers that really want to make a difference. This perk is jam packed full of stuff for everyone including extra tablet devices for schools, VIP tickets, domestic flights*, accommodation, <em>MyQUEST</em> school license and much more. And best of all, you will become a recognised executive producer in the <em>MyQUEST</em> learning platform credits (All 4 Phases).</p>
<p>Outstanding, give yourself a pat on the back when you select this one. C’mon do it for the kids!</p>
<p>Please note the flights and accommodation are to be used for the Launch Party and maybe used for your city of choice if different Launch Party Stretch Goals are met.</p>
<p><img alt=""Double Dare Images"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i50.tinypic.com/20s60bs.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""We Double Dare""/></p>
<p>Never been to OZ, always wanted to come down under? Well here is your chance. Pack your bags, buy some sunscreen and bring a hat. This is the package of a lifetime and we can confirm you’re single handedly changing the world. And best of all you will become a recognised executive producer in the <em>MyQUEST</em> learning platform credits (All 4 Phases).</p>
<p>You’re so exceptional, we may even vote you in as Prime Minister of Australia!</p>

<p>So what happens next?</p>
<p>The campaign will finish on the Sunday the 16th December 2012.</p>
<p>Now, if we don’t reach our initial goal of $25,000 (unlikely since we have your support), <em>MyQUEST</em> will still be developed, however we may be slightly delayed. We will still honour all perks. Although, we don’t want to focus on not hitting the target as we have complete faith in you sharing our project with everyone you know (and even those you don’t). Did you remember to share our project on FaceBook?</p>
<p>The <em>Is This MyStory</em> eBook and <em>MyStudy Muse</em> will be delivered within 5-10 working days of the campaign ending.</p>
<p>If we only just reach our initial target, <em>MyQUEST</em> Phase 1 will be downloadable after the initial Launch Party, estimated to be in March 2013. If and when stretch goals are met, resective phases will also be available at this time.</p>
<p>The Mindfulness Session will be delivered in early 2013 (Date TBA).</p>
<p>The Limited Edition <em>Is This MyStory</em> books may either be collected at the Launch Party or delivered immediately thereafter.</p>
<p>Launch Party Tickets will be emailed upon confirmation of dates and venues. See below.</p>
<p>Tablet Devices will be delivered once the 4 phases are complete. If all stretch goals are met the 4 phases will be ready for the Launch Parties and available for collection or delivery.</p>
<p>The <em>MyQUEST</em> school licenses we be completed later in 2013 and also rely on the completion of all phases.</p>
<p>Flights and accommodation are only to be used to attend the Launch Parties and will be arranged upon confirmation of Launch Party dates and venues. Every effort will be made to accommodate the travel plans of the contributors.</p>

<p>The initial Launch Party will be in Sydney, Australia upon completing the development of phase 1 of <em>MyQUEST</em> - estimated to be in March 2013. We have set stretch goals (see below) which, once reached, will enable us to hold numerous launch parties in different cities. Therefore, we will confirm dates and venues upon completion of the campaign. Obviously, we would like to hold each event on consecutive dates, wherever possible.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<p><img alt=""Stretch Goals Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/ngocna.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Stretch Goals""/></p>
<p>The initial goal is only set at $25,000 to complete Phase 1, but we really want to complete the full 4 Phased Learning System, which will cost approximately $150,000. Therefore, we have set stretch goals to ensure this will happen and offer you, the contributor greater incentives.</p>
<p>Please note the initial target is to compliment the funding already contributed by <em>Is This MyStory</em>.</p>
<h3>Initial Target</h3>
<p><img alt=""Initial Target Graph"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/243fe9y.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Initial Target""/></p>
<p>Everyone who purchases <strong>The Door Opener</strong> or greater will receive <em>MyQuest</em> Phase 1 plus all the individual perk inclusions. At this stage, if you live outside Sydney you’ll have to make the trek to be part of the <em>MyQUEST</em> Launch Party.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goal 1</h3>
<p><img alt=""Goal 1 Graph"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i45.tinypic.com/muejj8.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Stretch Goal 1""/></p>
<p>As soon as we reach stretch goal 1 everyone who purchases or has purchased <strong>The Door Opener</strong> or greater will automatically be upgraded to receive MyQuest Phase 2 also.</p>
<p>We will now be holding Launch Parties in Sydney and Melbourne. To ensure we hold a launch party in your city we recommend you contribute as early as possible and get the <em>MyQUEST</em> word out there within your community. This way we’re more likely to reach these stretch goals. For example, if you grab the <strong>Ready to Launch</strong> Perk, once we’re getting close to this goal you can upgrade to the <strong>Party Time</strong> Perk to confirm your launch party tickets in Melbourne. It would also be a great help if once you’re <strong>Ready to Launch</strong> you email us with your intentions to attend a Launch Party in your city, regardless of which city – Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, London, NY or anywhere.</p>
<p>Simply send your email to <a href=""mailto:storyadmin@isthismystory.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">storyadmin@isthismystory.com</a> and tell us your city of choice. We can then provide updates so you will know which cities are favoured and when and where the parties are likely to be held.</p>
<h3>Stretch Goal 2</h3>
<p><img alt=""Goal 2 Graph"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i45.tinypic.com/35kk41e.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Stretch Goal 2""/></p>
<p>As soon as we hit stretch goal 2 everyone who purchases or has purchased <strong>The Door Opener</strong> Perk or greater will automatically be upgraded to receive MyQuest Phase 3.</p>
<p>We will now be holding Launch Parties in Sydney, Melbourne and either Brisbane or Gold Coast. To ensure we hold a launch party in your city we recommend you contribute as early as possible and get the <em>MyQUEST</em> word out there within your community. This way we’re more likely to reach these stretch goals.  For example, if you grab the <strong>Ready to Launch</strong> Perk, once we’re getting close to this goal you can upgrade to the <strong>Party Time</strong> Perk to confirm launch party tickets in your city.

<h3>Stretch Goal 3</h3>
<p><img alt=""Goal 3 Graph"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i48.tinypic.com/r9g9dc.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Stretch Goal 3""/></p>
<p>As soon as we hit stretch goal 3 everyone who purchases or has purchased <strong>The Door Opener</strong> Perk or greater will automatically be upgraded to receive MyQuest Phase 4.</p>
<p>Now we’re thinking BIG, we want an international launch party. We will hold a launch party in the first international city to collectively purchase perks with 100 launch party tickets, so make sure you let us know which city you’re from. To ensure we hold a launch party in your city we recommend you contribute as early as possible and share the <em>MyQUEST</em> word with your community, this way we’re more likely to reach these stretch goals. For example, if you grab the <strong>Ready to Launch</strong> Perk, once we’re getting close to this goal you can upgrade to the <strong>Party Time</strong> Perk to confirm your launch party tickets in your city. It would also be a great help if once you’re <strong>Ready to Launch</strong> you email us with your intentions to attend a Launch Party in your city, regardless of which city – Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, London, NY or anywhere.

<h3>Stretch Goal 4</h3>
<p><img alt=""Goal 4 Graph"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i46.tinypic.com/6ghgl3.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Stretch Goal 4""/></p>
<p>Every time we reach another $20,000 on top of our total and have over 100 launch party tickets sold collectively within a city anywhere in the world, we will arrange another launch party. Plus a one year <em>MyQUEST</em> License will be donated to a local school within that community.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to the MyQUEST funding project, as you’ll notice in the above clip, we are not movie masterminds, we are teachers. We have partnered with renowned Australian Software Developers, Studio Emotion (our techno wizards) so we may build this mutli-platform learning system.
As you know, 21st century technology has contributed to massive changes in communication, education and societal expectations. Cyber bullying threatens children in their homes and incidents of anxiety, teen pregnancy and teen suicide grow at an alarming rate. Our kids need help. They need our support. They need to learn how to cope with a maelstrom of emotion, thought  and information that assaults their senses every day. Our children need to learn how to interact within the world so they may recognise and evaluate what they see, hear and feel. This help starts in the home, extends into the classroom and moves beyond to online platforms.  If young adults don’t have the skills to ‘fit in’ the 21st century, if young learners don’t have 21st century literacy tools, if our kids don’t have learning flexibility, they simply will not survive.
Therefore, we want to develop MyQUEST, a fully interactive learning platform for smartphones and tablets. We want to use the latest and greatest in learning technology to help young adults become confident, courageous, creative and compassionate, lifelong learners. MyQuest  is based on the Is This MyStory Learning process. Its innovative design utilises the features of narrative to link gaming technology, animation, interactive pages, film, music, books, blogging, storytelling, social media, global connectivity and much more. MyQuest uses the technology young adults love, to help them develop a focused, flexible approach to learning. With MyQuest, teenagers embark upon a journey toward a critically, emotionally and creatively literate future.
We all know, today’s teens don’t go anywhere without their phones. With MyQuest, they will be carrying 21st century learning tools wherever they go. Perhaps you’d like to think about this – would you prefer your teenager played with slightly upset birds - becoming angrier by the second, or would you like them to recognise their thoughts and manage their emotions while interacting, studying or simply playing with ideas.
With your contributions, we can make this happen. We aim to generate enough funding to breathe life into cutting edge technology that will help teenagers connect and learn in constructive ways. You can help us develop an elite platform which incorporates intricate gaming, detailed illustrations, creative animations and complex interactivity.
As a system, MyQUEST is a 4 Phased learning platform (4 apps) and, even though we have already developed and written the content, the project will cost approximately $150,000 to complete. Nevertheless, we have set an initial target of $25,000. This will help us build Phase 1. All funds will be put toward the cost of developing the software. Of course, we would rather create all 4 phases at once and have set stretch goals in the hope of reaching the total amount. These stretch goals will also allow contributors to access Phases 2-4 and open opportunities for Launch Parties in Melbourne, Brisbane/Gold Coast and hopefully, overseas.
We’d love to come to your city, visit your schools, talk to your teachers , meet you and throw a big bash launch party, especially New York, London, Vancouver or even Honolulu (more information can be found below under Launch Parties).
 
Is This MyStory is an Australian business founded on principals of metacognition and built on the teaching experience of Nicole Feledy, a passionate, innovative English teacher / author who loves stories and genuinely cares about her students. Nicole and the MyStory team have recognised deficiencies within educational systems worldwide.  They see a growing number of students left behind, unable to develop the key skills they require to survive in a technological era.  Nicole and her team want to help. They want to provide tangible strategies that will enable students throughout the world to develop key skills in critical, creative and emotional literacy. These are the 21st century skills our children need to thrive in a time of rapid change.  Imagine 21st century learners with 21st century tools, feeling confident, courageous, creative and compassionate because they are lifelong learners in control of their own learning.  Whether it be in the classroom or simply the action of living life as a 21st century teenager, our children must have the implements of successful learners. Meeting students where they are and providing access to these strategies is the number one goal of Is This MyStory and the MyQUEST Learning project.
 

So how can you get involved?
It’s quite simple! There are two generous ways you can contribute and we hope you will do both:
The first way is extremely simple; just share the word with people you know. Email your family, friends and local schools. Share the link on your blog, FaceBook, Twitter, LinkedIn or any social media site. Share the message with everyone you can think of. The more people who know about MyQUEST, the greater the chance of achieving our goals. For starters you may like to share the link on FaceBook and Twitter now by clicking the icons below our introduction video. Go on, do it now, you know you want to.
The second way to get involved is to pre-purchase MyQUEST by claiming one of the perks on the right hand side of this page. After clicking, you will be asked to confirm your perk and fill in your delivery details (it’s even easier if you’re on FaceBook). You can then choose to contribute using Visa, Amex, Mastercard or Discover (IndieGogo has excellent security to ensure your details are safe). 

You will notice down the right hand side of this page we have designed different contribution levels, or 'perks', to benefit yourself, students and schools around the world - so everyone gets a little something. For example, the $99 Party Time Perk will get you MyQUEST Phase 1, the Is This MyStory eBook, the MyStudy Muse Program, a Mindfulness Session, tickets to the a Launch Party PLUS we will donate 10 MyQuest Phase 1’s to a needy school on your behalf. How good is that? Imagine how much students will appreciate your generosity!
NOTE: If you prefer, we are happy to transfer your gifts to family, friends or students you may know.
Here are your choices:

We appreciate we will have many international contributors and will be happy to accept donations in other currencies including $US, GBP, EU and $CAN. Oh, heck! We will accept any currency. :))

The Is This MyStory eBook is the foundation upon which MyQUEST is built. It is not essential, but an obvious advantage to read the book while venturing along the MyQUEST journey. The eBook will be downloadable upon completion of this campaign.
We estimate completion of MyQUEST by March 2013.

The MyStudy Muse Guided Learning Formula is a 4 week online guided learning exercise which a student completes on a daily basis. Students develop practical strategies to improve their study skills whilst cultivating mental focus and concentration. MyStudy Muse is a 10 step process and compliments the Is This MyStory Learning process.

This is the Launch Pack. We believe it will initially be most popular for those living outside Sydney, Australia. In relation to donating the apps to needy schools, the number of people that choose this perk and the number of students per school will determine the number of schools we can donate to. Keep an eye out for the stretch goals, because once met, we may end up launching in a city near you. If and when this happens you will have the option to upgrade to the Party Time Perk to attend.
Launch Parties are planned to be held upon completion of MyQUEST, so around March 2013. See the Launch Party Section below for more information. At least you’ll have plenty of time to arrange a babysitter!

We predict this perk will be the favourite among Sydney siders.
Your teenagers get the 21st century tools they need, you do your bit for the community, donating MyQUEST to local schools and you get a fun night out.
Unbeatable!
Well that’s not entirely true because we have more contribution levels below which offer even more goodies.

This is as unique as it comes – we are printing a limited edition paperback version of Is This MyStory, with a twist. The current print version features the first names of students Nicole has taught over the years printed on the cover. However the new limited edition will have your full name (or a name of your choice) along with the other 49 contributors embedded, on the cover design. There will only ever be 50 of these made and they will all be signed and personalised for you by Nicole (author). This would make a fantastic birthday or graduation gift for that special teenager. PLUS you receive the Launch Pack and a great night out.

This perk is designed for schools, whether you are a school or would simply like to donate on behalf of a school of your choice. You or the school will still get the Launch Pack and Party tickets and can choose from having Nicole present her spectacular Is This MyStory Interactive Seminar at the school or a 1yr unlimited MyQUEST license for the school. This license will be developed during 2013 and will offer schools greater learning facilities, interactivity and additional features within the MyQUEST platform.

Now you’re really showing some heart! So many schools around Australia rely on government funding to obtain the learning tools students need and quite often funding is insufficient. It would be a dream for us if we could donate at least 10 devices to each of these needy schools. At this perk level we will donate a tablet device with MyQUEST in your name to a local needy school. Plus you still get all the usual extra goodies, WOW!

Another great perk for the school of your choice. The MyQUEST License is better than an individual scholarship as it will benefit every student in the school, not just one. You’d be helping an entire community here.

Similar to the You’re Too Kind Perk plus an added tablet device for yourself (or student of your choice) plus some additional MyQUEST Phases donated in your name. PLUS the best part is becoming a recognised producer in the credits of MyQUEST learning platform (All 4 Phases) – what a golden opportunity.

For the carers that really want to make a difference. This perk is jam packed full of stuff for everyone including extra tablet devices for schools, VIP tickets, domestic flights*, accommodation, MyQUEST school license and much more. And best of all, you will become a recognised executive producer in the MyQUEST learning platform credits (All 4 Phases).
Outstanding, give yourself a pat on the back when you select this one. C’mon do it for the kids!
Please note the flights and accommodation are to be used for the Launch Party and maybe used for your city of choice if different Launch Party Stretch Goals are met.

Never been to OZ, always wanted to come down under? Well here is your chance. Pack your bags, buy some sunscreen and bring a hat. This is the package of a lifetime and we can confirm you’re single handedly changing the world. And best of all you will become a recognised executive producer in the MyQUEST learning platform credits (All 4 Phases).
You’re so exceptional, we may even vote you in as Prime Minister of Australia!
*Domestic and International Flights are direct only, no connections or airport transfers.

If you’re considering funding the entire 4 phase project you definitely are mighty, we’ll cook you Aussie BBQ’s, take you swimming with the sharks, take you hunting for crocodiles, show you the Great Barrier Reef and carry you up Uluru (Ayres Rock). We’ll even buy you a beer!
The question is…is it time to elect the President of Australia?
Simply contact us and we’ll personally collect you in our MyStory ‘jet’.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Anthony Tucker Jr.; I am an upcoming film director, editor, and writer that lives in the small city of Elyria, Ohio. I live with both of my parents; my dad works in a factory. My mom does not work because just a few weeks ago we found out that she was diagnosed with breast cancer. This hit us pretty hard, so I started looking for a job and finally got one at Wal-Mart. It is only seasonal but I have to take what I can get to help my dad with the bills and groceries around the house. I am creating this campaign to raise money for the New York Film Academy. When applying you need a thousand dollar deposit to hold your spot. Since we found out about my mom having breast cancer my dad is not able to pay for it, and the money I get from my job will be used to help around the house with whatever my dad needs. Money is really tight around my household, so if you could help me get the money to apply for the New York Film Academy I will be able to further my education in Film.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All I am asking for $1500, so I can put $1000 to hold a spot for me at New yYork FIlm Academy. I would use the extra $500 to go visit the school, and go on a tour at the school.</p>
<p>If I am unable to reach my goal I will put the money into a savings account where I will keep trying to save the money I need to apply for the New York Film Academy. I will also help out my family with what is needed around the house.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you are unable to contribute to my fundraiser you can still help. If you could pass my fundraiser around to your friends, or even share my videos around to let everyone know about me. Thank you to all the people who are willing to help me out even if you are unable to contribute to my goal.</p>

My name is Anthony Tucker Jr.; I am an upcoming film director, editor, and writer that lives in the small city of Elyria, Ohio. I live with both of my parents; my dad works in a factory. My mom does not work because just a few weeks ago we found out that she was diagnosed with breast cancer. This hit us pretty hard, so I started looking for a job and finally got one at Wal-Mart. It is only seasonal but I have to take what I can get to help my dad with the bills and groceries around the house. I am creating this campaign to raise money for the New York Film Academy. When applying you need a thousand dollar deposit to hold your spot. Since we found out about my mom having breast cancer my dad is not able to pay for it, and the money I get from my job will be used to help around the house with whatever my dad needs. Money is really tight around my household, so if you could help me get the money to apply for the New York Film Academy I will be able to further my education in Film.


What We Need & What You Get
All I am asking for $1500, so I can put $1000 to hold a spot for me at New yYork FIlm Academy. I would use the extra $500 to go visit the school, and go on a tour at the school.
If I am unable to reach my goal I will put the money into a savings account where I will keep trying to save the money I need to apply for the New York Film Academy. I will also help out my family with what is needed around the house.


Other Ways You Can Help


If you are unable to contribute to my fundraiser you can still help. If you could pass my fundraiser around to your friends, or even share my videos around to let everyone know about me. Thank you to all the people who are willing to help me out even if you are unable to contribute to my goal.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hello everyone, my name is Antoine D. Bates, a Senior business management major at Morehouse College originally from Flint, Michigan. I moved to Atlanta, Ga to pursue my Bachelors degree following in the footsteps of my mentors and my heroes(Dr. Martin Luther King Jr, Dr. Will O. Cobbs, Dr. Robert M. Franklin). From day one at Morehouse I have faced hurdles such as being homeless, jobless, to being kicked out of all my classes after attending school for two weeks due to financial issues, to being on the Dean's list yet only being able to go part time because I could not afford this college out of pocket.</h3>
<h3>I am a firm believer in never giving up, but sometimes I sit down and cry because I do not know how I am going to be able to fund school and finish this degree. I am asking for $2,500 dollars currently even though tuition is approx. $12,000 per semester and I need to attend two more semesters at full time capacity to graduate. Every dollar earned from this campaign will go directly into my school account so that I can move that much closer to finishing my goal of graduation. I just want my grandmother to look down from heaven and see me cross that stage. I know I can achieve anything I put my mind to, and that I pray into existence, but at this moment I need your help.</h3>
<h3>Currently I am only taking one course, and this is the only course I was able to take all school year due to my finances. I have no more loans I can take out, and I am not eligible for pell grants. I applied for UNCF Scholarships but the scholarship coordinator at my college felt I didn't put in enough money out of my pocket for her to award me any money, so I was S.O.L. I am part of numerous groups including Morehouse College Safe Space, Beta Gamma Sigma International Honor Society for Business Majors, President of Morehouse College's Golden Key International Honour Society, former member of NAACP, and Morehouse Business Association.</h3>
<h3>
<br/>I devote my life and time to giving back to others, and in the past seven years I have worked/volunteered in the field of HIV prevention. I have lived all over and met many people but the one thing that stays constant is HIV is killing people who look just like me everyday and I can't stand and watch people die around me. One reason I am currently working toward my degree is because I want to start my own non profit that deals with housing needs for Gay/ Bisexual/ transgender  HIV positive/ negative individuals. Because across this country there aren't many of these services but they are very much needed. I don't want to start anything without education to build a foundation for success.</h3>
<h3>I just hope you take a second of your time to donate whatever you can to make my dream a reality. Everybody needs help at some time in your life be that help for me, that I so much need. And always know no good deed goes unrewarded in life. And if you know anyone else that could contribute let them know, I can use all the help that you can give, because sometimes you may not be able to contribute money but just by telling someone else that may be all the help I need. Thank you again, and God Bless.</h3>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi! <a href=""http://averschool.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Aver School"">Aver School</a> is a volunteer-run organization dedicated to teaching digital photo, video and audio skills to at-risk children around the world. Since 2006, we've been hosting an annual workshop at <a href=""http://lovehopemercy.org/ministries-esperanza-viva.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Esperanza Viva Youth Home"">Esperanza Viva Youth Home</a> in Puebla, Mexico.<br/><br/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Too many children in the world (around 143 million of them according to 2005 UNICEF figures) find themselves facing life on their own, with little support from family. Kids that have no one to care for them experience great hardships, poverty, abuse, even death. Life really is a daily struggle for survival. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The good news is that <i>there is good news</i>: <b>All over the world there are people that care that are making a positive difference in the lives of at-risk children and youth.</b><br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p>Aver School partners with organizations, orphanages and youth homes that give at-risk children a brighter future by providing food, shelter, health care, an education and most of all love. We believe that in today's world, all children should have the opportunity to learn digital media skills and to have an outlet for their creativity and their voice.</p>

Too many children in the world (around 143 million of them according to 2005 UNICEF figures) find themselves facing life on their own, with little support from family. Kids that have no one to care for them experience great hardships, poverty, abuse, even death. Life really is a daily struggle for survival. 

The good news is that there is good news: All over the world there are people that care that are making a positive difference in the lives of at-risk children and youth.

Aver School partners with organizations, orphanages and youth homes that give at-risk children a brighter future by providing food, shelter, health care, an education and most of all love. We believe that in today's world, all children should have the opportunity to learn digital media skills and to have an outlet for their creativity and their voice.


What We Need & What You Get
We're raising $3,000 to buy five digital SLR cameras and to cover the costs for the upcoming workshop in November. Here's a breakdown of our needs:



$100 - Gallery Exhibit Expenses (frames, photo printing, food)

$100 - Photo Calendar prizes for kids from 2010 photos.

$800 - Transportation (Two $350 RT tickets to Puebla via Mexico City and $100 for local transport).
$2,000 - To buy 5 digital SLR cameras.


This year, Aver School teacher, Valentina Vitols and I will be going to Mexico. Normally we cover all expenses ourselves but currently our finances do not permit this so we are asking for help to pay for our travel expenses and raising additional funds to get much needed cameras for the kids. We've been using digital point-n-shoots and the students are ready to learn and use more advanced photography concepts.

10/28/2011 Update: Unfortunately, due to a family emergency, Valentina will not be able to go to Mexico this year. The kids and I will miss her greatly! Since I will be the sole workshop facilitator, we are tailoring the content and format to best match my skill set with the kids' learning needs. Additionally, any funds raised to cover Valentina's travel expenses will now be applied towards buying more cameras.

Donations to Aver School are 100% tax deductible in the USA.




Other Ways You Can Help
While our goal is to buy 5 digital SLR cameras, our dream is to get an additional 5 cameras donated (10 total), enabling more students to further their skills. You can help us by hosting a Camera Campaign which will help us get camera donations. Of course, one of the main ways that you can help is by spreading the word of this campaign far and wide!

Thanking you in advance for your support!

<h3>
<br/>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Kind to Kids Foundation is a nonprofit charity that makes dreams come true for foster children &amp; children in poverty. We send children in need to wonderful events they could not normally attend, and provide Life Skills education programs.</p>
<p>Kind to Kids brightens the lives of needy children by giving them opportunities they would not otherwise have. We provide healthy, family friendly experiences for underprivileged children.  Often, the children can only imagine what it would be like to go to a symphony, theater, or a sports game. We make these dreams come true.  Come join us and make a difference!</p>
<p>Foster children have been removed from their homes because they were abused or neglected by their own families. Kind to Kids brings joy to a child in the midst of an extremely painful situation.  In our LifeSkills Program, we teach children how to be successful in life, and that their past does not equal their future. Every youth has their own unique and special strengths.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>By attending the Halloween Hoopla, you will have the joy of participating in a fun-filled community event - and comfort of realizing that your contribution will bring happiness to a child in need who lives right in your community.</p>
<p>Kind to Kids Foundation is an extremely efficient and well respected, 501c3, nonprofit charity. The money raised will fund 3 services: </p>
<p>1. Event opportunities for foster children and children in poverty</p>
<p>2. LifeSkills Program to teach foster teens how to be successful in the adult world.</p>
<p>3. Toys for foster children this Holiday Season. For many of the foster children, the toys we provide will be the only ones they get during the holidays. Last year we had a toy for every child (800) in Delaware's foster care system. We hope to bring joy again this year!</p>

<p>This summer, in 5 weeks, 20 teen apprentices and 8 teen peer-mentors will Write 100 Spoken Word Masterpieces - to produce and  present to The Triad in a 2 night event of Live Stage and Film Screening Extravaganza.  Our 2013 Summer Intensive brings together local professional artists and our teen authors to inspire and educate the greater human community...reaching beyond our neighborhood to yours.<br/>Now 11 seasons, over 1,500 Literary pieces, 60 videos, 30 short films later, Authoring Action is on the eve of our 12th Summer Intensive.  </p>

<p><br/>Our grueling Summer Intensive is indeed that. (photos) We roll from 845 AM to 415 PM, Monday through Friday, during the end of June through July.  <br/>Every morning begins with yoga, calisthenics, empowerment sharing.  <br/>For the first 10 days we write our Shout Outs, Riffs, Poems, Monologues, Stories and Short Screenplays.  A collection of 110-150 pieces that must qualify as literary, stage, screen production and publication worthy.  Did I say gallery?

<p><br/>The final week we Tech and Dress rehearse for our Commencement: our Community Celebration, show-off launching  of our new ensemble of middle and high school authors who will graduate into our elite year-round Assegai Ensemble and roll with us all the way into college.</p>
<p>Each Summer Intensive yields authors who transcend gender, ethnicity and class to achieve ... their name. I.E. self identification, a signature reference point and style. They go forth as Assegai and engage their audiences and readers eye-to-eye and have proven to impact human development and change.  Our audiences/readers leave with a mandate to do something.  Art Must Do Something.</p>

A Case For Literacy: Nathan Ross Freeman, Artistic Director
Harvard Graduate School of Education, April 28, 2012
Please view all our Literacy and Harvard Video BlogsAuthoring Action kicks off our 12th year working with teens who learn the power of their own voices through creative writing and engaging audiences of all sizes through stage and film. Over the first eleven years we've developed teens from high crime neighborhoods, teens who may be lacking one or more essential support systems, some teens who have great support but need to discover a sense of self and direction, high achievers and low achievers, across race and class. We are ... click:
Prime Directive
This summer, in 5 weeks, 20 teen apprentices and 8 teen peer-mentors will Write 100 Spoken Word Masterpieces - to produce and  present to The Triad in a 2 night event of Live Stage and Film Screening Extravaganza.  Our 2013 Summer Intensive brings together local professional artists and our teen authors to inspire and educate the greater human community...reaching beyond our neighborhood to yours.Now 11 seasons, over 1,500 Literary pieces, 60 videos, 30 short films later, Authoring Action is on the eve of our 12th Summer Intensive.  
Authoring Action has achieved a keynote presenter status with over 50 local, regional, national and international civic, educational, faith based, cultural, law enforcement, judicial and health organizations. 
SUMMER INTENSIVE
Our grueling Summer Intensive is indeed that. (photos) We roll from 845 AM to 415 PM, Monday through Friday, during the end of June through July.  Every morning begins with yoga, calisthenics, empowerment sharing.  For the first 10 days we write our Shout Outs, Riffs, Poems, Monologues, Stories and Short Screenplays.  A collection of 110-150 pieces that must qualify as literary, stage, screen production and publication worthy.  Did I say gallery? Click:
Authoring Action Word Wall
The next 3 weeks our apprentice authors are drilled in Speech Conditioning, work with Collaborating Artists to develop 3 of their 120 writings for Spoken Word, Filmmaking, Songs, Choreography, Visual Arts.
The final week we Tech and Dress rehearse for our Commencement: our Community Celebration, show-off launching  of our new ensemble of middle and high school authors who will graduate into our elite year-round Assegai Ensemble and roll with us all the way into college.
Each Summer Intensive yields authors who transcend gender, ethnicity and class to achieve ... their name. I.E. self identification, a signature reference point and style. They go forth as Assegai and engage their audiences and readers eye-to-eye and have proven to impact human development and change.  Our audiences/readers leave with a mandate to do something.  Art Must Do Something.
When our audiences request Authoring Action to develop the themes of their events, they come to us for our teens to show them the way.  ""I am happy to be writing this letter of support for Authoring Action, as I have been continually inspired by the entrepreneurial acumen and artistic excellence of their organization. They are impresarios of community integration, and a beacon in the artistic ecology of this region – infusing the Triad, state and country with artistic energy, innovation, and camaraderie.""                ~ Steven Matijcio, Curator of South Eastern Center For Contemporary Art

<p>Hi! My name's Ben, and this January I am hoping to go to Honduras with some friends of mine to help out with a volunteer organization called Honduras Children. They do a lot of work in a town called El Porvenir, expanding and improving the academic experience of about 200 local kids, and hopefully teaching them a variety of useful life lessons besides. Outside of their work in the classroom, Honduras Children does a lot of work in the local community, and I think I could make a real impact there if nowhere else (there's always a use for unskilled labor, right?). There's always work to be done and connections to be made with the local people, and they're doing a great job of not only doing that work, but giving guys like me the opportunity to do it too. In short there's a lot of worthwhile stuff being done down there, and I am ready, willing, and almost able to go and work my ass off with them. Wanna toss me a couple bucks?</p>
<p>All in all, I'm going to need a thousand dollars (about half for plane tickets, the other for living expenses while I'm there, renting a car, getting a passport, etc.) The plane tickets for my group were bought... yesterday, so the sooner I can get moving on that the better. Anything you can give will be much appreciated. So appreciated, in fact, that I will be unable to contain my unbridled appreciation and it will boil over into the form of a gnarly drawing of a kitty or something which I will then give to you. Along with a hug if you are within hugging distance. </p>
<p>If I don't make enough, I'll give what I raised right to Honduras Children. They're a seriously cool group with some seriously cool volunteers (I know one of the founding directors, Eve Horowitz, and she's a very intelligent and productive person). Their Vacation Activities Program is especially awesome, the idea being to give kids  the opportunity to continure their education during their equivaent of summer break. It should be a testament to what a positive impact they're having that the kids are willing to come in to learn during their time off. That's just one example of the cool work they're doing, and if you want see more you should check out <a href=""http://www.honduraschildren.org/projects/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">their website</a>. </p>
<p>Obviously the main benefit I'm trying to sell here is the useful stuff I'll be doing while I'm down there, but equally important (to me at least) is what I'll get out of it. I've never left the states in my life, sad to say, and though I don't speak much Spanish yet I see this as an invaluable opportunity to meet and bond with people from an entirely different background. Besides the new perspective, there's the new experiences, and those are equally invaluable. It's been my experience that hard work is good for your mind, and so is travel, and so is meeting new and interesting people. This is my chance at getting all three in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>So there you have it! That's my pitch. If you don't have money to give away, please remember that sending a few people this link can be just as valuable. If you do have money to give away, and you decide to give it away to me, you have my sincere and eternal gratitude. Seriously. This is definitely helpful for Honduras Children, but it's <em>huge</em> for me. All I can say is that someday I hope to be able to return the favor, and thank you, thank you, thank you!</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Since 1982, Neighbrohood Ministries (NM) has been serving distressed families of urban Phoenix, advocating for their physical, emotional, mental and spiritual needs. Among the organization's many programs and ministries are a food and clothing bank, a pre-school, youth outreach, dance and guitar classes, a bike shop, college access and tutoring, community advocacy, support for teen moms - the list goes on and on. In a given week, over 700 children and young adults will connect with well over 100 volunteers both on our 8-acre property and also out in homes and surrounding neighborhoods seeking to foster healthy relationships and break cycles of brokenness, addiction, abuse and poverty. </p>

<p><em>Summer Kids Club at the Neighborhood Center</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>While the majority of our year is spent mirroring a traditional school year of programming, the summer has continually evolved into a unique and focused time of leadership development. Since 1993, NM has hosted its Summer Internship as a way to invest in a select team of emerging leaders while also bringing in fresh energy to pull off some of the biggest events of the year. Every summer, a group of competitively selected high school students join other college students and young adults in theological training, targeted leadership development, and lots of hard work to execute the summer ministry activities.  </p>

<p><em>2012 Summer Intern Team</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>This summer we have the strongest class of summer intern applicants to date, and so, we have expanded our numbers to 17 Emerging Leaders - our largest team ever. Because our team has grown, we are in need of extra funds to help pay the summer stipend for these 17 young leaders. Each emerging leader receives $1,500 for their hard work over the 10 weeks of our summer. That means we need $25,500 total to pay all of our young leaders this summer. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have a few donors already giving towards our summer internship, but we still need an additional $12,000 from this campaign to cover all the intern stipends. All profits above our hard costs from this Indiegogo campaign are designated to the 2013 summer intern stipend.</p>
<p>To help us raise these funds for our emerging leaders, we have a number of perks to offer to you. First, our NM Media team will be documenting the activity of our interns with photographs and video footage. All of this media will be compiled into a documentary at the end of the summer - to showcase the work of our youth. Anyone who donates at least $5 will receive an email link to view this video upon completion. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Third, for a $20 donation, we will send you a copy of our coffee-table book, <em>The Relentless Pursuit: Stories of God's Hope, Love and Grace in the Neighborhood</em>.

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Collectively, our internship team will log well over 15,000 hours developing as leaders and working for the betterment of our community. They will play a vital role in executing a two week day camp which will host over 700 children and several hundred volunteers on our campus. Also, they will take a group of seventy 5th-7th graders up to a week long camp in northern Arizona. They will work the gardens of Hope House Farms; they will knock on over 1,000 doors of community houses - listening to the needs of our neighbors. They will work in the bike shop to foster micro-enterprise development, and assemble and deliver 50 kits that teach families with young children to foster brain development at home. </p>
<p>Most importantly, they will take one giant step further in believing God will use them as the agents of change that our community needs to grow stronger. </p>

Every summer, a group of competitively selected high school students join other college students and young adults in theological training, targeted leadership development, and lots of hard work to execute the summer ministry activities.  

2012 Summer Intern Team
 
This summer we have the strongest class of summer intern applicants to date, and so, we have expanded our numbers to 17 Emerging Leaders - our largest team ever. Because our team has grown, we are in need of extra funds to help pay the summer stipend for these 17 young leaders. Each emerging leader receives $1,500 for their hard work over the 10 weeks of our summer. That means we need $25,500 total to pay all of our young leaders this summer. 

 


What We Need & What You Get
We have a few donors already giving towards our summer internship, but we still need an additional $12,000 from this campaign to cover all the intern stipends. All profits above our hard costs from this Indiegogo campaign are designated to the 2013 summer intern stipend.
To help us raise these funds for our emerging leaders, we have a number of perks to offer to you. First, our NM Media team will be documenting the activity of our interns with photographs and video footage. All of this media will be compiled into a documentary at the end of the summer - to showcase the work of our youth. Anyone who donates at least $5 will receive an email link to view this video upon completion. 

 
Second, for a $12 donation, we will send you a Neighborhood Ministries branded USB drive bracelet and the video link above. The USB drive has a 4 GB capacity. 

 
Third, for a $20 donation, we will send you a copy of our coffee-table book, The Relentless Pursuit: Stories of God's Hope, Love and Grace in the Neighborhood. This book is full of 200 pages of pictures and stories that illustrate the formation of the ministry and communicate the lessons learned along the way. 

 
Fourth, for $30, we will send you a special edition t-shirt, made specifically for this Indiegogo campaign. The shirts are printed by Opportunitees, our on-site screenprinting and embroidery business, on a lightweight and comfortable, 100% ring-spun cotton, V-neck t-shirt. Sizes offered are XS-2XL in a unisex cut. Featured on the back of the shirt is this quote from author and artist Ralph Ransom: 
Before the reward there must be labor. You plant before you harvest. You sow in tears before you reap in joy.
 

Fifth, for $55, we will send you a short-sleeve, three-button, golf polo. The polo features Reebok's lightweight PLAYDRY material and has Neighoborhood Ministries' logo embroidered on the sleeve. This shirt is also produced at Opportunitees and comes in Men's sizes S-3XL.

Lastly, for $75, we will send you a high-quality print on 11x17"" paper of Kyle Matthews' (NM two year intern) original artwork featured on our special edition summer intern tee. Each print will be individually signed and numbered by Kyle. Limited run of 25 prints. 

 


The Impact
Collectively, our internship team will log well over 15,000 hours developing as leaders and working for the betterment of our community. They will play a vital role in executing a two week day camp which will host over 700 children and several hundred volunteers on our campus. Also, they will take a group of seventy 5th-7th graders up to a week long camp in northern Arizona. They will work the gardens of Hope House Farms; they will knock on over 1,000 doors of community houses - listening to the needs of our neighbors. They will work in the bike shop to foster micro-enterprise development, and assemble and deliver 50 kits that teach families with young children to foster brain development at home. 
Most importantly, they will take one giant step further in believing God will use them as the agents of change that our community needs to grow stronger.

<p><strong>What is the need and how can it be creatively addressed?</strong></p>
<p>In today's world, teens often find it difficult to relate to conventional social values; consequently, they withdraw from society, drop out of school and slip into isolation.</p>
<p>At <strong>Kaima Organic Farm</strong>, we have created an innovative solution to this problem by creating a unique outdoor space <strong>where drop-out teens will gain employability skills, work experience, leadership development and community building skills and enjoy the benefits of teamwork. </strong>The teens will see themselves as fully invested partners in this undertaking, as they will receive a salary for working on the farm.</p>
<p><strong>What is Kaima?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kaima</strong>, (<em>sustainability </em>in Aramaic), is a newly established Israeli NGO that will re-engage, motivate and empower drop-out, at-risk youth who cannot adjust to, let alone thrive in, other social settings. <strong>Teens on our program will gain agricultural and leadership skills, learn communication and marketing, basic business knowledge, fiscal and personal accountability, and environmental responsibility. </strong>They will learn how to achieve environmental sustainability by growing their own food, collecting rainwater and restoring diminished landscapes and ecosystems.</p>
<p><strong>Where is Kaima?</strong></p>
<p>The project is on 12 dunams (3 acres) of fertile land in the village of Moshav Beit Zayit - donated by generous local families.</p>
<p><strong>Who are our partners?</strong></p>
<p>In collaboration with <strong>other NGO's and government authorities</strong>, we are committed to transforming the lives of a distressing number of youth who have exceptional difficulty finding their place in the world and are living on the margins of society.</p>
<p><strong>Who is eligible?</strong></p>
<p>Youth-at-risk (as identified by the Ministry of Education) who have either fallen out of the system or are receiving minimal formal instruction. Candidates will undergo a competitive interview process to be selected for inclusion in this project.</p>
<p><strong>What's the plan?</strong></p>
<p>The first crops will be planted by Kaima's board, members of the community and other volunteers. Once up and running, activities will take place daily in shifts from 8:00 - 4:00.</p>
<p><strong>What does our pedagogic model have the power to do?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Legitimize non-conventional educational settings.</li>
<li>Encourage young people to engage in positive interaction with adults and their peers.</li>
<li>Provide on-the-job training and life skills for marginalized youth</li>
<li>Give urban youth the opportunity to engage with nature.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Kaima Organic Farm</strong> offers a real chance to contribute to a society in which a growing number of kids feel no sense of personal pride or civic responsibility. This grassroots initiative has the ambition and and potential to become a model for replication in other communities.</p>

What We Need & What You Get for Helping us!
We are aiming to raise a total of $7,000 to cover our travel, accommodation and ""brain fuel"" expenses, which is broken down as follows:


$2,900 for 2 weeks of shared accommodation at the Boston Hostel


$1,500 for Sally's flights from Brisbane to Boston and back home


$1,150 for Rachel's flights from Rome to Boston and back home

$1,450 for food and local transportation (about $52 each, per day).
In return, you will be able to choose from a whole range of creative, unique and exclusive perks through which we will be sharing our MIT experience and learnings: from specially dedicated photos, to webinar tickets, to being mentioned in our press articles (see the perks section for full details). There IS something in this for EACH of you, even if it is just keeping you entertained for the next few weeks!
Anything raised above and beyond will be used to help the MIT sisters grow their entrepreneurial story-telling reach and impact more people’s lives. 

WIIFM- ""What's In It For Me?""You help us, we help you! 

Many of our PERKS have been designed to be valuable for people who want to know whether entrepreneurship is for them and if so, to guide them through the first steps they need to take to become successful. Knowing where to start is often the hardest part. The program takes out the guess work and SHOWS you where to start, using the PROVEN framework developed by MIT. 

What niggling problems could our PERKS answer for you? 




Is entrepreneurship for you? 


Have you started a business but are currently stagnant? People don’t know where to start, they need structure to follow, they have limited time and resources available to invest. 


If you have already got a business, can you define what problem you are solving and who you are solving it for?




    Even if Entrepreneurship is not your focus, we would still love to share with you the thrills of our special MIT experience, so our other PERKS are designed to share with you peeps and insights into our time in the amazing MIT community: because by expressing your support you will become a very cherished and important part of our Mission Impossible! 
Other Ways You Can Help
Some of you may just wish to help but not in a position to donate yourself. We would be so grateful for you to pay this forward and share it with other's in your network who may be interested in entrepreneurship, or in lending a helping hand to two tenacious women.


We THANK YOU IN ADVANCE for anything you are willing and able to do to help and support us on our challenging but exciting journey.


We would be most happy if you would like to share feedback, make requests, and ask questions. We value your input and would love to incorporate you ideas where possible. Please feel free to contact us by writing to mitsisters [at] gmail.com",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>A massive thank you to everyone who supported our crowdfunding campaign enabling us to reach our goal and beyond!  Thanks to you, we will be starting the project in February 2017 by sand blasting of the beams and ceiling to remove peeling paint. <br/>It is not too late if you still want to donate!  Please visit our website page: <a href=""http://www.butserancientfarm.co.uk/villa-renovation-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.butserancientfarm.co.uk/villa-renova...</a>  where you will find a donation button.</p>
<p>Butser Ancient Farm is a gem in the crown of the South Downs National Park in Hampshire, UK. Our beautiful villa has been worn down by the thousands of people visiting the farm each year, who come to learn how the Romans lived in Britain nearly 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Whether you visited Butser Ancient Farm as a child, are a Friend of Butser and supporter, or have never visited but like the look of our site, please consider making a donation today to bring our villa up to the standard a wealthy Roman would expect.</p>
<p>Where else in the world can you experience a Roman villa inside and out as it actually would have looked and felt to our ancestors?</p>
<p><strong>The Need</strong></p>
<p>As you can see in the video, the paint is peeling from the beams of the villa and the earth packed floors could be so beautiful if laid with mosaics and herringbone tiles.</p>
<p>The visitor experience at Butser Ancient Farm is unique as people step back in time through reconstructed Stone Age, Iron Age, Roman and Saxon houses, learning how our ancestors lived and adapted to their environment.</p>
<p>However, you can see the Roman house has become a little shabby and in need of attention. Its refurbishment will pave the way for other projects which will vastly improve the whole Roman area at Butser, including mosaic floors and a Roman garden.</p>
<p><strong>The Goal</strong></p>
<p>£2,000 will pay for sandblasting the beams to enhance the wood and get rid of the flaky paint.  This will take place in February half term 2017 when there will be no school visits and fewer public on site and will launch the whole renovation project.</p>
<p>The cost of all the renovation work is £100,000 but it is the beams that need to be cleaned up first. </p>
<p>The next stage of renovation will start at the end of May 2017 with the aim to complete by September 2017 ready for a grand opening, followed by our busiest school season of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Our Track Record</strong></p>
<p>Butser Ancient Farm is a centre of educational excellence known as being the birthplace of experimental archaeology in Britain and a leading example for other research centres across the world.  The site has gone from strength to strength.  Our Saxon house is a finalist in the Hampshire Countryside Sustainable Buildings Award and with your help we can bring the Roman villa up to a similar standard of excellence!</p>
<p><strong>How you can help</strong></p>
<p>Whether or not you are able to donate, please spread the word! Send this link to all your friends and acquaintances and share our project on Facebook, Twitter and even in your local newsletter or noticeboard – that would help us so much!</p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Imagine: You enter a shop, then you go to the salesperson and say:</p>
<blockquote>""Hey, I want to buy a certain product at your place. But I know, that I could actually buy it somewhere else. So lets make a deal. I buy it at your place and you give a certain percentage of the money I spend on it to an NGO that supports a cause, I care about"".</blockquote>
And the salesperson answers:
<blockquote>""alright, deal!""</blockquote>
Does it sound too idealistic? Maybe. But it works. Somehow. Especially in the internet. It's <a href=""http://makehappy.in/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""makehappy india"">makehappy.in</a>! <br/><br/><center>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://happy.carrotshop.org/fileadmin/images/campaign/Indiegogo/makehappy_ss_11Mar2012.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><a href=""http://makehappy.in/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""makehappy india"">makehappy.in</a>
</center>
<br/><p>Online shops and services are hungry for every customer. So they give a commission to partner website, that make advertisement for the online shop and link potential customers onto their website. Affiliate Marketing.</p>
<blockquote>We believe that affiliate commission should be used to support good and charitable causes.</blockquote>
And to make it easy for you and other users to generate affiliate commissions to support good causes, we want to setup a webportal, embed as many online shops as possible, that grant a certain commission for successful leads and sales.
<p>So, every time you intend to shop online, you can visit our website, click the logo of your favorite shop to get redirected to it.</p>
<p>Shopping is done as usual and price stays exactly the same price. Just for clicking the logo we receive a commission, well you have to buy a product and service too ;). <strong>70% of the commission we forward to the cause, you care most about.</strong> You can select which one out of 10-15. The other 30% are used to cover our costs and to spread the word. <br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://happy.carrotshop.org/fileadmin/images/campaign/Indiegogo/how_it_works_ss_11Mar2012.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You can also have a virtual account and track your contributions to NGOs or tie up with your friends to contribute as a group and have greater impact.<br/> We love India and we want to support the NGOs in India, so we plan to setup makehappy for India initially and then launch it in other countries.</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>We have attented IAccelerator, an incubation program from IIM-Ahmedabad and setup a first version of the above mentioned web portal during our stay.<br/> This first version of makehappy features more than 40 online shops, commissions are between 0.75% and 20% of the purchase value. Average is 6%, commissions for booking of domestic airline tickets are around Rs. 200.</p>
<p>With more than 100mio internet users in India, 10mio online shoppers and more than 10bn US$ revenue in e-commerce the impact of our service will be great. An average online shopper spends 1000 US$ annually for products, services and airline tickets. We estimate that at least 60% will be bought via our partner shops, this makes 600 US$.</p>
<p>600 US$ generate 36 US$ in commissions (6% average). So when 70% of this amount are forwarded, more than 25 US$ go to a charitable cause. 25 US$ from each average user each user. <br/> Wow. That is a lot of money and when thousands of user shop via makehappy the impact will be noticeable and big.</p>
<p>We assume that at least 60% will be bought via our partner shops, this makes 600 US$.<br/> 600 US$ generate 36 US$ in commissions (6% average). So when 70% of this amount are forwarded, more than 25 US$ go to a charitable cause.<br/> 25 US$ from each average user each user. Wow :)<br/> A lot of money and when thousands of user shop via makehappy the impact will be noticeable and big.</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We want to get together and host a 20 day work camp in April to concentrate on makehappy and to grow as a team to come up with the best ideas for the website and to spread the word about our project in the best way.<br/> We also need to setup a company in India. And but not least we would like to invite a coder to support our project.</p>
<p>So the money is needed for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Airline tickets: $1000.-</li>
<li>Apartment rental: $500.-</li>
<li>Company setup: $500.-</li>
<li>Developer: $500.-</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>To express our happy- and gratefulness we made a list of versatile perks, which you can see on the right side.</p>

This first version of makehappy features more than 40 online shops, commissions are between 0.75% and 20% of the purchase value. Average is 6%, commissions for booking of domestic airline tickets are around Rs. 200.
With more than 100mio internet users in India, 10mio online shoppers and more than 10bn US$ revenue in e-commerce the impact of our service will be great. An average online shopper spends 1000 US$ annually for products, services and airline tickets. We estimate that at least 60% will be bought via our partner shops, this makes 600 US$.
600 US$ generate 36 US$ in commissions (6% average). So when 70% of this amount are forwarded, more than 25 US$ go to a charitable cause. 25 US$ from each average user each user.  Wow. That is a lot of money and when thousands of user shop via makehappy the impact will be noticeable and big.
We assume that at least 60% will be bought via our partner shops, this makes 600 US$. 600 US$ generate 36 US$ in commissions (6% average).

Wow :) A lot of money and when thousands of user shop via makehappy the impact will be noticeable and big.
What We Need & What You Get
We want to get together and host a 20 day work camp in April to concentrate on makehappy and to grow as a team to come up with the best ideas for the website and to spread the word about our project in the best way. We also need to setup a company in India. And but not least we would like to invite a coder to support our project.
So the money is needed for:

Airline tickets: $1000.-
Apartment rental: $500.-
Company setup: $500.-
Developer: $500.-

 
To express our happy- and gratefulness we made a list of versatile perks, which you can see on the right side.

<h3>About Suzanne:</h3>
<p>Suzanne was a kind, supportive, responsible, funny and loving young woman who passed away suddenly over the summer of 2011 during a research trip she was conducting with the University of Alberta. She was highly involved in the local Edmonton choral scene, and made an incredible impact on those who she met and sang with. She was also deeply dedicated to education, nature, and biology, holding an Undergraduate and Masters degree in science from the University of Alberta. <br/></p>

<p><em><strong>Samuel Lang</strong></em></p>
<p>     Ex-military and law enforcement. I served in the armed forces prior to receiving an honorable medical separation for a tumor obtained while on duty status.</p>
<p>     Since then I have developed a passion for martial arts, grappling and Brazillian Jiu Jitsu specifically. I am very active in the community and have a loving, supportive family.</p>
<p><em><strong>Shayne Yetter<br/></strong></em></p>
<p>     Avid Brazillian Jiu Jitsu practictioner. I have been studying the art for about a year and am seeking a place where my work and school schedule will allow me to stay active.</p>
<p><em><strong>Austin Hanzlik<br/></strong></em></p>
<p>     Currently enlisted in the United States Air Force. I am new to grappling and MMA outside of what I have trained in the military but am excited to have a place to practice. I have a family of four and a full work schedule so I'm very excited about the prospect of an all-hours location to stay in shape.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we're doing:</h3>
<p>     We are looking to expand upon what we have deleloped as a free grappling gym in Nampa, Idaho. We want provide a safe, non-threatening atmosphere for those that are looking to get fit, learn some self-defense or to improve their lives through the disciplines that are taught in martial arts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     At the Nampa No-Gi school we teach kids to be confident and respectful as well as promoting a team atmosphere for them to enjoy. We instill self-respect and anti-bullying while providing a fun, free way to exercise.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     We live in a very low income area and many people can't afford high-cost gyms (which most that offer grappling are). Aside from that many of us operate on very different schedules and this is a way for the members to pick times in which everyone can attend classes.</p>
<p>     Some of the classes include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Wrestling     </li>
<li>Brazillian Jiu Jitsu</li>
<li>Muay Thai</li>
<li>Boxing</li>
<li>Strength Training </li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>     Everything that we offer are at no cost to the members and are supported by volunteer staff. We have personal connections in all of the disciplines listed above as well as active wrestlers, grapplers and mixed martial artists that are willing to provide free training. Once operations are more managable we plan to make guest trainers a weekly occurence.                       </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>    </strong></h3>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>We need help with the supply cost, all work and maintenance is on us!:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We already have a foundation down and mats that will work for now. We also have wall supports surrounding the grappling area. What we do need is more wall padding to make grappling more safe. So far we have about 30% of the area covered. The rest we can do, by hand using soft foam and non-abrasive covers. We can achieve this with about $200.   <strong>COST: $200</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Our facility is without any central heating or air conditioning. We have a small heating unit that doesn't quite do as much as we need it to during the winter evenings. We hope to get better heating and cooling control that will make cold and hot seasons more bearable for training.    <strong>COST: $250</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly we want to apply for non-profit status in the State of Idaho. In order to do so we need to file for tax exempt status and the going rate to submit the paperwork is a little bit expensive. If the campaign does well we will be applying for tax exempt status through the 501(c)(3) process.    <strong>COST: $800</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
</li>
<li>The final set of items that we are looking to buy are more optional and miscellaneous. If we are able to we will be buying extra gloves, wraps, mouth guards and rash guards for those that come to the Nampa No-Gi School.    <strong>COST: APP. $250</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>                                    </strong><strong>TOTAL NEED: $1500</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Anything extra will go to little things that we, at NNG could use. This can include team t-shirts, extra water, weight training supplies and grappling / striking bags.</li>

<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>We are a group of pre-service teachers from the Education program at the University of Prince Edward Island.  There are twenty-six of us specializing in International and Indigenous Education.  We will all be completing a six-week teaching placement during March and April 2013 in an international setting.  This experience will not only be transformational for each of us on a personal level from living and teaching in a culture that differs from our own, but we will return as a group with a great wealth of knowledge to bring into our future classrooms, whether on PEI or elsewhere.  The countries we will be traveling to in the Spring include China, France, New Zealand, Sweden, and Togo.</p>
<p>This international experience, however, will be an expensive venture for each of us as we are responsible for covering our own travel and living costs.  Plane tickets, living accomodations, and other expenses for this six-week placement will be impossible to meet without extensive fundraising - which we started in May 2012.  Depending on the location of our placement, we will each be expected to contribute $3,000 - $4,000, in addition to our university tuition costs.  We will not receive any compensation while engaged in this teaching practice.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that we are asking for any assistance you can provide.  No matter the size of your donation, it will be greatly appreciated and recognized by us, as well as the entire Faculty of Education.</p>

As a single mother raising a bi-cultural child one of the most important values I strive to instill in Allyson is a strong connection between her and her Latina heritage. One strategy I have used to nuture this connection is exposing Allyson to the Spanish language.  Over the last four years Allyson has been exposed to Spanish speaking caregivers, Spanish lessons, and my attemps to read the plethora of Spanish books we own. As Allyson's language capabilities have expanded, I have realized that she needs more than I, or a weekly Spanish class, can offer.  My search to find a viable option to continue to nurture Allyson's Spanish development has lead me to summer Spanish immersion day camps. I have found a program that will work with our needs and schedule, but the $2200 in tuition (while competitive with similar programs) will not fit into my modest student budget.</p>
<p>My hope is that with your support I can make this experience a reality for my daughter without having to place myself in debt to do so.  Your generosity will be met with my deepest grattitute in addition to an original piece of art created by the one, and only, Allyson Justice.</p>

<p>Who the hell am I, anyways? I've been making and writing about comics since 1988. My work has been exhibited at the American Academy of Arts and Letters in New York and the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh. Allegedly, I'm a good egg and one of the most passionate proselytizers for comic books and visual literacy that you will ever meet.</p>
<div>
<div>
<b>I'm from Pittsburgh, PA </b>and I want to make this city the best place in the world to learn comic book making. Beyond that and closer to home I want to improve the neighborhood I am from. I grew up in this neighborhood in Pittsburgh called Swissvale---and my family has been on this tiny little street since 1933. This was a booming steeltown hamlet and then it went into decline. <p></p>
<p><b>Now, the city and the neighborhood are on the upswing. I want to be a part of that change and I want my schoolhouse residency to be an anchor on this street and in this neighborhood. </b></p>
<p>I've traveled all over the world and there is something special about Pittsburgh besides my own nostalgia or hometown pride. I want the Rowhouse Residency to be a part of the incredible ecosystem of learning institutions here in Pittsburgh. We are such an interesting city, I think, because we have this combination of a hard working blue collar mentality and a broad appreciation of the arts. I know it's because of the ecosystem of museums, libraries, universities and independent learning institutions we have in Pittsburgh. Everyone from here has been to the Carnegie Museum and a Steeler game. City of Champions in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Even if you know very little about comic books please consider that comics are where many kids learn to read. Comics are words and pictures. And words and pictures are the internet. So the artform of comics promotes ""visual literacy"". Learning comics is like learning music or learning how to communicate with more than just words. And that's the world we live in today.</p>
<p><b>Our plan for the school is to create a dojo for students much like a martial arts academy.</b> The beginner student will learn from more experienced students. We run the school like a sports clinic. What's wrong with your swing? We can fix it. The dojo sparring sessions (so to speak) will be recorded and broadcast. We want to have a ""broadcast booth"" and a radio show. We can interview veterans and rookies and make room for friendly competition in order to push the boundaries of what is possible in the artform. This is not your regular comic book academy. <b>This is a ninja academy, a samurai school, a Jedi academy.</b> I do a really good Yoda impression.</p>
<div>The student can live for a day, a weekend, a week or a month at a time in the same space. That way, the student-resident can have a total immersion in the process. <b>Most cartoonists work out of their home, so why have an expensive school building and make the student live in a crappy dorm or apartment off campus?</b> Why not just give them a desk and their own bedroom? The residents will take classes with me in the living room of the house. And I live next door. And my mom lives up the street and makes great spaghetti sauce and lasagna. So it's a family affair. <p></p>
<p>Then we will broadcast lessons and publish the work of residents through the local powerhouse, Copacetic Comics. Bill Boichel, the proprietor of Copacetic Comics in the Polish Hill section of Pittsburgh, is my Yoda. I want to pass on the lessons he taught me to a new generation of Jedis. </p>

<p>With the two remaining weeks that we have this Indiegogo going, I'd like to see if we can raise the funds for things that only felt like pipe dreams at the start of our campaign like recording equipment, schoolhouse technology and even a scholarship endowment.  I'm so excited to see what we can accomplish in the time remaining.</p>

<p>Howzitgoin? Good, good. Me? Good, thanks. I gotta tell ya though I’m sorry to bother you again, but y’see somethin’s been troubling me and I can’t stop thinking about it. Kept me up all night. and the dog too cuz he thought I was getting up to take him to Cincinnati. What’s that? Oh. Sorry. Cincinnati is what I call the park. Cuz if I say “park” or “walk” then he gets crazy. So we say Cincinnati around here. Yeah. So. Where was I? Oh yeah. This thing has been bothering me and it’s this thing about commodity form as community form. What’s that? Oh. “Commodity form as community form.” Yeah, it’s a mouthful. And sort of puzzle. What does it mean? I don’t know. Or I think I know. Either way, I keep thinking about it.</p>
<p>People ask me, “Frank, what’s this I hear you are buying the house next door and turning it into your schoolhouse?” I say, yeah, it’s true. The old man who owned the property passed away. Well, no one’s been living there for twenty years. He was this old guy who lived in Florida most of the year and had a bunch of properties all over the neighborhood. I’ve wanted to buy it forever but the old man wouldn’t budge so we thought maybe someday. Anyways, the day arrived and the nephew who cut the grass, y’know, to keep the place nice over the years—well, the nephew stopped by and asked me if i wanted to buy the place. That they weren’t gonna put it on the market. Was I interested, he says? Was I interested? Of course, I’m interested. I said yes, I’ll buy it.</p>
<p>Trouble is, you see, I don’t have the money. Yeah, I know. Foolish of me, wasn’t it? I had to say yes, though. Otherwise it’s on the market and bang it’s gone. This way I have a chance at least. </p>
<p>So I’m scraping together the money as fast as possible. Boy, I’ll tell ya though, it’s humbling. Passing the hat is a humbling experience. Why should I help this fool is what most of them are thinking, I know. It’s ok, I understand. I am foolish. But foolish choices have gotten me this far---so I gotta ride out the lucky streak. If it’s a complete disaster and I can’t get the house, well, at least I took a shot. A shot not taken is a shot missed, they say. But, it’s gotta be a good shot. You gotta take a good shot to score. </p>
<p>Anyhow, can I get you a coffee or a tea? Sorry, I got alot on my mind and I gotta just talk it out, if you don’t mind. Can’t sleep. Cream and sugar? No, ok. Here ya go. You’re welcome. Let me get one, myself. Hold on.</p>
<p>There we are. Ok. So, about the house. We're gonna do an IndieGoGo campaign. Yeah, ""crowdfunding"". Yeah, I know. It's an interesting idea which we think we have to try. I mean, we gotta take the shot, right? Take it to the hoop.</p>
<p>What’s that? Oh. Sorry, when I say “we” I mean we, like, the school. I’m gonna make it a school next door. I like having the correspondence course for comics but I think it’s time to try to do more. I’ve been trying to figure out for years how I can expand my school—start having my students teach in some way—but I can never figure it out because the correspondence part of it is so personal. Teaching in a classroom is different. But how do you get a classroom? Do I have to join my school to another school to get their classroom? But most comics are done alone by the person making them in a room. Classrooms are good for teaching some artforms but not so great for teaching others, y’know what I mean? Like how do you teach writing in a classroom? Go around peering over the shoulders to read what they are doing? No, it’s gotta be something different. Like a residency. Like the student can live in the classroom. Work in the classroom of course, but also, sleep in the classroom and eat there too. </p>
<p>Most cartoonists I know work out of their homes. So maybe if I can have a house that is a residency where the student can have classes everyday and then do the hard work in private in the same space—that might just work. Especially if the teacher lives on the same street and his mother makes really awesome spaghetti sauce and the student doesn’t have to worry about what to make for dinner. An airbnb with comic book lessons. Something like that.</p>
<p>The students I have already are pretty psyched about it. Many of them live in far flung backwater comics towns and here in Pittsburgh, well, we are a prime time comics town. Always have been, but things are really hoppin’ here now. So I dunno. I think it could work, cuz the students I already have would be the first wave of residents. We already know each other even if we never met in person. And then they can come here and we can work with the game plan we already know and come up with new strategies for making forward thinking comics. Does that sound hokey? I’m sorry, forgive me, I get carried away. See, I just think that for the artform to grow there need to be different types of interdisciplinary learning institutions that are outside of the traditional academy. Like there needs to be a big ecosystem. </p>
<p>People say, why do we need a comics school? There aren’t many jobs in comics so why churn out these kids with no job prospects? Well, I’m not interested in that. I’m interested in churning out ninjas. I don’t see many jobs out there for ninjas. It’s understood that if you want to be a ninja you are doing it for the love of ninjadom--not for personal glory or gold. I mean, what professional ninja goes around telling people they are a ninja? I’ve never seen a “ninja needed” advertisement anywhere. </p>
<p>This is why I’m intrigued by this “commodity form as community form” thing. What’s that? Oh, did I make that up? No, no, <a href=""http://www.tcj.com/bill-boichels-bem-publications-85-98/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bill Boichel came up with that one. Back in the 80s. </a>His whole thing was that he had this comic book store in an economically depressed steel town back in the 80s. And it was the only place in the neighborhood kids could hangout without an adult. Like you see in store windows “only two kids allowed at a time” or “children must be accompanied by an adult” and all that stuff? Yeah, Bill’s store was never like that. Christ, he had couches. Kids would sit there and read. A kid who was flunking English class probably would be READING at the comic book store without a care in the world. And so, you know, Bill is a thoughtful guy and he’d start putting all this relevant material into these kids’ hands. Like he’d give a kid a Black Panther comic and tell him his theory that that “the Black Panther party” was named soon after the comic came out back in the 60s. Like he didn’t just take their quarters for beat up back issues of comics, he actually fucking cared about these kids. And that really did something to me, cuz I was one of those kids too. There was NO WAY OUT of my post-idustrial wasteland existence, really. Except there was—thru comics. Bill preached the gospel of comics and I signed up for the choir. </p>
<p>He taught me about “commodity form as community form”. Meaning that what we buy and sell creates a community. And how do you engage your community in which you are buying and selling? And what are you buying? And what are you selling? </p>
<p>Bill would make his own comics in the basement of the store and then print them on the xerox machine down there and then go upstairs and put it on the rack for sale. He rearranged my thinking of how a maker of art can get their work into the world. Bill was publishing comics made by the kids who hung out at the store. He had us selling our comics at our high schools. He “published” our work for us and taught us how to make money from our art. They weren’t teaching me that in high school art class. He taught us how to fish essentially. The guy changed my life.</p>
<p>So I want to do the same thing in my own way. I know how hard it is to gain an education in comics. How to learn the craft and how to survive in this godforsaken industry and on the circuit of church basement shows? I can help you. Really. We can help you. I have over 150 students now and I want to bring each student, if they are willing, thru the residency schoolhouse and help them level up so that they can go back into their community and pass on what Bill passed on to me. What Bill passed on to me is really something I can’t even explain except that it is part of the necessary oral tradition of art. Especially comics. Comics is such an insanely difficult thing to study because so much of the art is obscured by the marketplace. How do you balance the two when the form itself is, as they say, the bastard child of art and commerce? I know: you provide a space where the student can LIVE AND WORK. Where there is no separation between art and life or between your school’s awesome classroom and your hovel on the otherside of town. A place where the student can have a total immersion in the private process of making comics while still being tethered to a strong community. </p>
<p>What’s in it for you, you ask? Well, that’s a good question. Maybe if you are, simply, a comics fan--- then someday in the future you can read the work by some of the school’s students and you’ll enjoy it. That’s probably all that is in it for you. But if you are a comics snob who is also interested in seeing the form grow then maybe you will consider supporting the school because you know that I am one passionate motherfeyer about comics and I really, really want to push the form itself to grow and to absorb new voices and disciplines to create a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8AOm79BeLY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jeet Kune Do</a>-type comics style. A style, an approach to comics making that is firmly rooted in the 21st century. What does it mean it be a comics maker in the 21st century? How does a comics maker navigate the marketplace or navigate a marketplace that doesn’t exist for them? Making comics on the xerox machine and selling them by hand is still the business model. So something has got to give. Help me help my students figure this out so that the next generation won’t have such a hard time of it. That’s what you’ll get out of supporting the school: knowing that you made a difference, potentially, in the direction of the form itself.</p>
<p>More coffee?</p>
<p>So, yeah. I’m selling my collection through a private auction and now this: we’re going to do an IndieGoGo crowdfund to raise money to buy the house and start working on it. The house needs alot of work to get it up to code for inspections. But first we gotta raise the money for the down payment. If you feel like helping out you can buy something or donate <a href=""http://comicscourse100.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. If you want to check out the private auction then send me an email: santoroschoolATgmail. Everyone is asking why I’m doing a private auction. It’s because some of the famous artists giving me artwork to sell don’t really want to be part of a crowdfund and all that. Plus it is a way of avoiding eBay fees and that kind of thing. It is also a way of keeping the books and art in my collection IN the community because in theory the people buying stuff are comics snobs (haha, that’s a term of respect). So, for me, this plays into the ""community form as commodity form thing”. Like I’m selling the collection I amassed for years—a collection that was made thru purchases made within the community—to buy a house to teach comics. So hopefully if you, the comics fan, buy something from the auction then I am selling my commodities to buy a meeting place for the community. See, how pretty that is? It’s like a circle. The end is in the beginning. I want some kid to sit on the couch at our school and read comics and maaaaybe take a workshop and get interested in comics as A WAY OUT in a spiritual sense and possibly in a financial sense. Like it’s a trade. A 21st century skillset. How to arrange words and images. Visual literacy. I mean, that’s the internet, right? Commodity form as community form. Community form as commodity form.</p>
<p>Take awhile, think about it. I’ll be here if you wanna stop by later. </p>

Who the hell am I, anyways? I've been making and writing about comics since 1988. My work has been exhibited at the American Academy of Arts and Letters in New York and the Carnegie Museum in Pittsburgh. Allegedly, I'm a good egg and one of the most passionate proselytizers for comic books and visual literacy that you will ever meet.


I'm from Pittsburgh, PA and I want to make this city the best place in the world to learn comic book making. Beyond that and closer to home I want to improve the neighborhood I am from. I grew up in this neighborhood in Pittsburgh called Swissvale---and my family has been on this tiny little street since 1933. This was a booming steeltown hamlet and then it went into decline. 
Now, the city and the neighborhood are on the upswing. I want to be a part of that change and I want my schoolhouse residency to be an anchor on this street and in this neighborhood. 
I've traveled all over the world and there is something special about Pittsburgh besides my own nostalgia or hometown pride. I want the Rowhouse Residency to be a part of the incredible ecosystem of learning institutions here in Pittsburgh. We are such an interesting city, I think, because we have this combination of a hard working blue collar mentality and a broad appreciation of the arts. I know it's because of the ecosystem of museums, libraries, universities and independent learning institutions we have in Pittsburgh. Everyone from here has been to the Carnegie Museum and a Steeler game. City of Champions in more ways than one.

We can interview veterans and rookies and make room for friendly competition in order to push the boundaries of what is possible in the artform. This is not your regular comic book academy. This is a ninja academy, a samurai school, a Jedi academy. I do a really good Yoda impression.
The student can live for a day, a weekend, a week or a month at a time in the same space. That way, the student-resident can have a total immersion in the process. Most cartoonists work out of their home, so why have an expensive school building and make the student live in a crappy dorm or apartment off campus?

When I was 15, I got a copy of the video documentary The Masters of Comic Book Art. I watched it everyday after school. Jean Giraud, aka Moebius, said something which impacted me greatly then and it is something I carry with me always. Moebius said,""Like any art, the possibilities of the art are big, but the possibilities of the artist are bigger or smaller. It is the artist who has the possibility to upend, to make a pressure, to be more responsible. Because to be more responsible is to be more mature, more evolved. [...] Because it's not the publisher who will push, it's not the public. It's the artist. The artist must be the warrior who fights.""

We've reached 100% of our goal with two weeks left to go.With this achieved the school is going to be a reality.  Students will be able to be residents in just a few months. I am incredibly humbled. 
With the two remaining weeks that we have this Indiegogo going, I'd like to see if we can raise the funds for things that only felt like pipe dreams at the start of our campaign like recording equipment, schoolhouse technology and even a scholarship endowment.  I'm so excited to see what we can accomplish in the time remaining.
Let's make the Comics Workbook Rowhouse Residency the greatest learning institution it can be.
Please see newly added stretch goals at top of post under ""Breaking News""






And now here's something we hope you'll really like:

Frank Santoro doing his best Columbo imitation to tell you all about the plan to build the Comics Workbook Rowhouse Residency in Pittsburgh,PA (read to yourself in your best Columbo voice)


Howzitgoin? Good, good. Me? Good, thanks. I gotta tell ya though I’m sorry to bother you again, but y’see somethin’s been troubling me and I can’t stop thinking about it. Kept me up all night. and the dog too cuz he thought I was getting up to take him to Cincinnati. What’s that? Oh. Sorry. Cincinnati is what I call the park. Cuz if I say “park” or “walk” then he gets crazy. So we say Cincinnati around here. Yeah. So. Where was I? Oh yeah. This thing has been bothering me and it’s this thing about commodity form as community form. What’s that? Oh. “Commodity form as community form.” Yeah, it’s a mouthful. And sort of puzzle. What does it mean? I don’t know. Or I think I know. Either way, I keep thinking about it.
People ask me, “Frank, what’s this I hear you are buying the house next door and turning it into your schoolhouse?” I say, yeah, it’s true. The old man who owned the property passed away. Well, no one’s been living there for twenty years. He was this old guy who lived in Florida most of the year and had a bunch of properties all over the neighborhood. I’ve wanted to buy it forever but the old man wouldn’t budge so we thought maybe someday. Anyways, the day arrived and the nephew who cut the grass, y’know, to keep the place nice over the years—well, the nephew stopped by and asked me if i wanted to buy the place. That they weren’t gonna put it on the market. Was I interested, he says? Was I interested? Of course, I’m interested. I said yes, I’ll buy it.
Trouble is, you see, I don’t have the money. Yeah, I know. Foolish of me, wasn’t it? I had to say yes, though. Otherwise it’s on the market and bang it’s gone. This way I have a chance at least. 
So I’m scraping together the money as fast as possible. Boy, I’ll tell ya though, it’s humbling. Passing the hat is a humbling experience. Why should I help this fool is what most of them are thinking, I know. It’s ok, I understand. I am foolish. But foolish choices have gotten me this far---so I gotta ride out the lucky streak. If it’s a complete disaster and I can’t get the house, well, at least I took a shot. A shot not taken is a shot missed, they say. But, it’s gotta be a good shot. You gotta take a good shot to score. 
Anyhow, can I get you a coffee or a tea? Sorry, I got alot on my mind and I gotta just talk it out, if you don’t mind. Can’t sleep. Cream and sugar? No, ok. Here ya go. You’re welcome. Let me get one, myself. Hold on.
There we are. Ok. So, about the house. We're gonna do an IndieGoGo campaign. Yeah, ""crowdfunding"". Yeah, I know. It's an interesting idea which we think we have to try. I mean, we gotta take the shot, right? Take it to the hoop.
What’s that? Oh. Sorry, when I say “we” I mean we, like, the school. I’m gonna make it a school next door. I like having the correspondence course for comics but I think it’s time to try to do more. I’ve been trying to figure out for years how I can expand my school—start having my students teach in some way—but I can never figure it out because the correspondence part of it is so personal. Teaching in a classroom is different. But how do you get a classroom? Do I have to join my school to another school to get their classroom? But most comics are done alone by the person making them in a room. Classrooms are good for teaching some artforms but not so great for teaching others, y’know what I mean? Like how do you teach writing in a classroom? Go around peering over the shoulders to read what they are doing? No, it’s gotta be something different. Like a residency. Like the student can live in the classroom. Work in the classroom of course, but also, sleep in the classroom and eat there too. 
Most cartoonists I know work out of their homes. So maybe if I can have a house that is a residency where the student can have classes everyday and then do the hard work in private in the same space—that might just work. Especially if the teacher lives on the same street and his mother makes really awesome spaghetti sauce and the student doesn’t have to worry about what to make for dinner. An airbnb with comic book lessons. Something like that.
The students I have already are pretty psyched about it. Many of them live in far flung backwater comics towns and here in Pittsburgh, well, we are a prime time comics town. Always have been, but things are really hoppin’ here now. So I dunno. I think it could work, cuz the students I already have would be the first wave of residents. We already know each other even if we never met in person. And then they can come here and we can work with the game plan we already know and come up with new strategies for making forward thinking comics. Does that sound hokey? I’m sorry, forgive me, I get carried away. See, I just think that for the artform to grow there need to be different types of interdisciplinary learning institutions that are outside of the traditional academy. Like there needs to be a big ecosystem. 
People say, why do we need a comics school? There aren’t many jobs in comics so why churn out these kids with no job prospects? Well, I’m not interested in that. I’m interested in churning out ninjas. I don’t see many jobs out there for ninjas. It’s understood that if you want to be a ninja you are doing it for the love of ninjadom--not for personal glory or gold. I mean, what professional ninja goes around telling people they are a ninja? I’ve never seen a “ninja needed” advertisement anywhere. 
This is why I’m intrigued by this “commodity form as community form” thing. What’s that? Oh, did I make that up? No, no, Bill Boichel came up with that one. Back in the 80s. His whole thing was that he had this comic book store in an economically depressed steel town back in the 80s. And it was the only place in the neighborhood kids could hangout without an adult. Like you see in store windows “only two kids allowed at a time” or “children must be accompanied by an adult” and all that stuff? Yeah, Bill’s store was never like that. Christ, he had couches. Kids would sit there and read. A kid who was flunking English class probably would be READING at the comic book store without a care in the world. And so, you know, Bill is a thoughtful guy and he’d start putting all this relevant material into these kids’ hands. Like he’d give a kid a Black Panther comic and tell him his theory that that “the Black Panther party” was named soon after the comic came out back in the 60s. Like he didn’t just take their quarters for beat up back issues of comics, he actually fucking cared about these kids. And that really did something to me, cuz I was one of those kids too. There was NO WAY OUT of my post-idustrial wasteland existence, really. Except there was—thru comics. Bill preached the gospel of comics and I signed up for the choir. 
He taught me about “commodity form as community form”. Meaning that what we buy and sell creates a community. And how do you engage your community in which you are buying and selling? And what are you buying? And what are you selling? 
Bill would make his own comics in the basement of the store and then print them on the xerox machine down there and then go upstairs and put it on the rack for sale. He rearranged my thinking of how a maker of art can get their work into the world. Bill was publishing comics made by the kids who hung out at the store. He had us selling our comics at our high schools. He “published” our work for us and taught us how to make money from our art. They weren’t teaching me that in high school art class. He taught us how to fish essentially. The guy changed my life.
So I want to do the same thing in my own way. I know how hard it is to gain an education in comics. How to learn the craft and how to survive in this godforsaken industry and on the circuit of church basement shows? I can help you. Really. We can help you. I have over 150 students now and I want to bring each student, if they are willing, thru the residency schoolhouse and help them level up so that they can go back into their community and pass on what Bill passed on to me. What Bill passed on to me is really something I can’t even explain except that it is part of the necessary oral tradition of art. Especially comics. Comics is such an insanely difficult thing to study because so much of the art is obscured by the marketplace. How do you balance the two when the form itself is, as they say, the bastard child of art and commerce? I know: you provide a space where the student can LIVE AND WORK. Where there is no separation between art and life or between your school’s awesome classroom and your hovel on the otherside of town. A place where the student can have a total immersion in the private process of making comics while still being tethered to a strong community. 
What’s in it for you, you ask? Well, that’s a good question. Maybe if you are, simply, a comics fan--- then someday in the future you can read the work by some of the school’s students and you’ll enjoy it. That’s probably all that is in it for you. But if you are a comics snob who is also interested in seeing the form grow then maybe you will consider supporting the school because you know that I am one passionate motherfeyer about comics and I really, really want to push the form itself to grow and to absorb new voices and disciplines to create a Jeet Kune Do-type comics style. A style, an approach to comics making that is firmly rooted in the 21st century. What does it mean it be a comics maker in the 21st century? How does a comics maker navigate the marketplace or navigate a marketplace that doesn’t exist for them? Making comics on the xerox machine and selling them by hand is still the business model. So something has got to give. Help me help my students figure this out so that the next generation won’t have such a hard time of it. That’s what you’ll get out of supporting the school: knowing that you made a difference, potentially, in the direction of the form itself.
More coffee?
So, yeah. I’m selling my collection through a private auction and now this: we’re going to do an IndieGoGo crowdfund to raise money to buy the house and start working on it. The house needs alot of work to get it up to code for inspections. But first we gotta raise the money for the down payment. If you feel like helping out you can buy something or donate here. If you want to check out the private auction then send me an email: santoroschoolATgmail. Everyone is asking why I’m doing a private auction. It’s because some of the famous artists giving me artwork to sell don’t really want to be part of a crowdfund and all that. Plus it is a way of avoiding eBay fees and that kind of thing. It is also a way of keeping the books and art in my collection IN the community because in theory the people buying stuff are comics snobs (haha, that’s a term of respect). So, for me, this plays into the ""community form as commodity form thing”. Like I’m selling the collection I amassed for years—a collection that was made thru purchases made within the community—to buy a house to teach comics. So hopefully if you, the comics fan, buy something from the auction then I am selling my commodities to buy a meeting place for the community. See, how pretty that is? It’s like a circle. The end is in the beginning. I want some kid to sit on the couch at our school and read comics and maaaaybe take a workshop and get interested in comics as A WAY OUT in a spiritual sense and possibly in a financial sense. Like it’s a trade. A 21st century skillset. How to arrange words and images. Visual literacy. I mean, that’s the internet, right? Commodity form as community form. Community form as commodity form.
Take awhile, think about it. I’ll be here if you wanna stop by later.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Most participants ride the Sierra Century on a bicycle, but last year I tried it on a unicycle. I rode so hard that my cranks fell off. There's a big climb, too, and no brakes on a unicycle (ever ride a </span>fixie?). <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Between several roadside repairs and a sag wagon I was able to finish the 30-miler but I could've done better with preparation.

<p>This year, if you fund this campaign beyond the $1,750 goal, <b>I'll step up my efforts! </b>I'll make a 150% effort with solid gear and ride the 30-miler not only from Olympic Valley to Donner Lake and back, but I'll also swap out the 36-inch wheel unicycle for my 20-inch wheel six-foot tall unicycle and ride up and down Donner Summit on Highway 40 with the 60 and 100-mile bicycle riders (it's easier to climb with a small wheel). This climb adds five miles and 1,100 feet of elevation, and on a 20-inch wheel that's another 5,000 crank revolutions on the pedals! That's  at total of 35 miles on a unicycle - with a massive climb in the middle! I assure you it'll be tough and that I'll loose some skin on this one if I make it. . .</p>

<p>Mr. Nordby has a unique gift that enables him to connect with his students, guiding them to be considerate, well-rounded young men and women.

<h3><b>Students Give Back</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Each year, Mr. Nordby's Jazz Band band plays at a variety of venues throughout the community and the state, with the most demanding schedule being the Jazz Tour. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">On this tour last year, they played for convalescent homes, elementary schools and the Braille Institute. The Jazz Band students share their music - engaging elementary school students by making them part of the band and sometimes playing the same songs four times in a day as the audience changes. </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440563410/c5csngpawrsbgdeerytq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p>
<p>Take a look at how they engage the students by making them part of the percussion. See that kid who's smiling? This kind of interaction creates an impressionable memory that these students will remember forever, probably even creating their own interest in music. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440563670/ktj9tzx8yvl6fn8ukigg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After a visit to the Orange County Regional Center of the Braille Institute, the Programs Coordinator wrote a thank you note that praised the NTHS Jazz Band students for their maturity, interactivity, and the excitement the braille students showed when they played percussion. He summarized it as ""we<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> were very impressed not only at the talent and quality of performance, but
also at the maturity and character of your students. I gave them a short
demonstration on sighted guide and reading/writing Braille and they were the
most respectful and engaged group of high schoolers I have ever presented to.
After the performance we all played a quick game together and your kids were
great interacting with our kids."" The Jazz Band students aren't programed to act this way, they have a professional role model to follow!  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Perhaps the most impressionable visits to see are at nursing centers (convalescent homes, skilled nursing facilities). The residents really engage in the music, smiling and moving around. After the performance, the Jazz Band students talk with the residents of the home. If you've been to these places you know that every resident wants to talk. What would you think of the opportunity to see and hear jazz music from high school students as a future resident of a nursing center? If I were here it would certainly be the highlight of my week. This kind of care is part of our responsibility. </p>

<h3><b>Students Succeed as Musicians and Win University Scholarships Too</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>A short sampling of some of some of the Mr. Nordby-lead accomplishments include a superior rating at the Region V Band Festival (3/19/15) and an excellent rating at the Santa Cruz Jazz Festival (3/21/15).  Many individual band students
have successfully auditioned for prestigious regional and state honor
bands.  Seven band students from North
Tahoe High made the Capitol Honor Band (Sacramento region, 1/8/15 to 1/10/15)
and seven students made the NorCal Honor Band (Northern California region,
2/5/15 to 2/7/15).  In addition, two
students made the All-State Honor Band (entire state of California), which is
one of the top honor bands in the country.  The graduating class of 2015 had several music scholarships, too. This is a direct result of Mr. Nordby’s dedication to encouraging and
enabling his students to spend time outside of the classroom to become better
musicians.  Given the small size of our
high school relative to the other schools also feeding into these honor bands,
this is an impressive feat that speaks volumes to the quality of music
instruction at North Tahoe High School.  As
a side note, Mr. Nordby also currently serves as President of the Northern
California Band &amp; Choir Director’s Association.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Mr. Nordby treats music education as the gateway to
life’s many opportunities to learn, and he provides wonderful music and life
experiences for his students that make them better human beings.  </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>$1,750 for North Tahoe Jazz Band Creates </h3> <p>Sure, it's an impressive amount for a high school jazz band. This money provides instruments, music and travel expenses for part of their activities - so they can share it right back. The use of the money would be at the sole discretion of Mr. Nordby, a trusted community member and teacher.  </p>
<p>There are no physical awards or perks for contributing to this campaign, as the cost of them would be subtracted by the total funds raised. The rewards are much more than a t-shirt or recording of music, and include:</p> <ul> <li>Performances where the student's time and music is shared with elementary kids, elderly, and groups of all ages;  </li> <li>Entertainment at community events;</li>
<li>Developing musicians who earn scholarships and play for their life; and  </li>
<li>Perhaps most importantly, discretionary financial support for students who need assistance to participate. </li>
</ul>
<div>And if the $1,750 goal is reached, I'll ride the Sierra Century 30-miler plus Donner Summit on my unicycle. If the $1,750 goal is not reached, whatever funds collected go to North Tahoe High School Jazz Band and I am not obligated to riding this part of the century on my unicycle (but I'll try to do it anyway). Don't you want to see if I can do it? </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact of Your Donation</h3> <p>Unless you're local to North Tahoe, you may not directly benefit but please consider the following.</p> <ul> <li>Many others will have a really positive experience like I described above.</li>
<li>Imagine yourself being a kid who got to play percussion with a band, or as an elderly person who got the treat of this band on a  Friday afternoon.</li> <li>I'm going into this campaign to win, and I'm matching it with my own physical effort which I'll document for you after the September 12th Sierra Century.</li> <li>We're rewarding an educator. They're unnecessarily humble yet so professional, they give 150% of their time to students, and they may spend more time with our children than we do on our own. </li> </ul>

In both events, your funds still go to NTHS Jazz Band.</p> <ul> <li>Weather or force majeure could cause the Tahoe Sierra Century to be cancelled. September is a fairly safe time weather-wise in Lake Tahoe.   </li> <li>I'm unable to do the Sierra Century on my unicycle due to lack of preparation, equipment failure or sudden illness. Help me fund this now so I have more inspiration to train for the ride!  </li>

I'll Match Your Donation by Riding the Sierra Century - On a Unicycle! 

On August 12th is the big fundraiser for North Tahoe Middle School and High School music programs, the Tahoe Sierra Century. This fundraiser is for all music activities at these two schools, but I'd like to target these funds specifically for the NTHS Jazz Band.
Most participants ride the Sierra Century on a bicycle, but last year I tried it on a unicycle. I rode so hard that my cranks fell off. There's a big climb, too, and no brakes on a unicycle (ever ride a fixie?). Between several roadside repairs and a sag wagon I was able to finish the 30-miler but I could've done better with preparation. Here's a picture near Donner Summit.
This year, if you fund this campaign beyond the $1,750 goal, I'll step up my efforts! I'll make a 150% effort with solid gear and ride the 30-miler not only from Olympic Valley to Donner Lake and back, but I'll also swap out the 36-inch wheel unicycle for my 20-inch wheel six-foot tall unicycle and ride up and down Donner Summit on Highway 40 with the 60 and 100-mile bicycle riders (it's easier to climb with a small wheel). This climb adds five miles and 1,100 feet of elevation, and on a 20-inch wheel that's another 5,000 crank revolutions on the pedals! That's  at total of 35 miles on a unicycle - with a massive climb in the middle! I assure you it'll be tough and that I'll loose some skin on this one if I make it. . .
Mr. Dean Nordby - A Positive Influence on Band Students and Community
Mr. Nordby has a unique gift that enables him to connect with his students, guiding them to be considerate, well-rounded young men and women. His positive influence is just as important than the musical skills he develops among the students. He runs the kind of class that's open all day, with lunch time being a gathering for anybody. Here's a picture of him with his wife Beth, another great teacher. 



Students Give Back

Each year, Mr. Nordby's Jazz Band band plays at a variety of venues throughout the community and the state, with the most demanding schedule being the Jazz Tour. On this tour last year, they played for convalescent homes, elementary schools and the Braille Institute. The Jazz Band students share their music - engaging elementary school students by making them part of the band and sometimes playing the same songs four times in a day as the audience changes. 


Take a look at how they engage the students by making them part of the percussion. See that kid who's smiling? This kind of interaction creates an impressionable memory that these students will remember forever, probably even creating their own interest in music. 


After a visit to the Orange County Regional Center of the Braille Institute, the Programs Coordinator wrote a thank you note that praised the NTHS Jazz Band students for their maturity, interactivity, and the excitement the braille students showed when they played percussion. He summarized it as ""we were very impressed not only at the talent and quality of performance, but
also at the maturity and character of your students. I gave them a short
demonstration on sighted guide and reading/writing Braille and they were the
most respectful and engaged group of high schoolers I have ever presented to.
After the performance we all played a quick game together and your kids were
great interacting with our kids."" The Jazz Band students aren't programed to act this way, they have a professional role model to follow!  

Perhaps the most impressionable visits to see are at nursing centers (convalescent homes, skilled nursing facilities). The residents really engage in the music, smiling and moving around. After the performance, the Jazz Band students talk with the residents of the home. If you've been to these places you know that every resident wants to talk. What would you think of the opportunity to see and hear jazz music from high school students as a future resident of a nursing center? If I were here it would certainly be the highlight of my week. This kind of care is part of our responsibility. 


Students Succeed as Musicians and Win University Scholarships Too

A short sampling of some of some of the Mr. Nordby-lead accomplishments include a superior rating at the Region V Band Festival (3/19/15) and an excellent rating at the Santa Cruz Jazz Festival (3/21/15).  Many individual band students
have successfully auditioned for prestigious regional and state honor
bands.  Seven band students from North
Tahoe High made the Capitol Honor Band (Sacramento region, 1/8/15 to 1/10/15)
and seven students made the NorCal Honor Band (Northern California region,
2/5/15 to 2/7/15).  In addition, two
students made the All-State Honor Band (entire state of California), which is
one of the top honor bands in the country.  The graduating class of 2015 had several music scholarships, too. This is a direct result of Mr. Nordby’s dedication to encouraging and
enabling his students to spend time outside of the classroom to become better
musicians.  Given the small size of our
high school relative to the other schools also feeding into these honor bands,
this is an impressive feat that speaks volumes to the quality of music
instruction at North Tahoe High School.  As
a side note, Mr. Nordby also currently serves as President of the Northern
California Band & Choir Director’s Association.
Mr. Nordby treats music education as the gateway to
life’s many opportunities to learn, and he provides wonderful music and life
experiences for his students that make them better human beings.     $1,750 for North Tahoe Jazz Band Creates  Sure, it's an impressive amount for a high school jazz band. This money provides instruments, music and travel expenses for part of their activities - so they can share it right back. The use of the money would be at the sole discretion of Mr. Nordby, a trusted community member and teacher.  
There are no physical awards or perks for contributing to this campaign, as the cost of them would be subtracted by the total funds raised. The rewards are much more than a t-shirt or recording of music, and include:  Performances where the student's time and music is shared with elementary kids, elderly, and groups of all ages;   Entertainment at community events;
Developing musicians who earn scholarships and play for their life; and  
Perhaps most importantly, discretionary financial support for students who need assistance to participate. 

And if the $1,750 goal is reached, I'll ride the Sierra Century 30-miler plus Donner Summit on my unicycle. If the $1,750 goal is not reached, whatever funds collected go to North Tahoe High School Jazz Band and I am not obligated to riding this part of the century on my unicycle (but I'll try to do it anyway). Don't you want to see if I can do it? 
    The Impact of Your Donation Unless you're local to North Tahoe, you may not directly benefit but please consider the following.  Many others will have a really positive experience like I described above.
Imagine yourself being a kid who got to play percussion with a band, or as an elderly person who got the treat of this band on a  Friday afternoon. I'm going into this campaign to win, and I'm matching it with my own physical effort which I'll document for you after the September 12th Sierra Century. We're rewarding an educator. They're unnecessarily humble yet so professional, they give 150% of their time to students, and they may spend more time with our children than we do on our own.  
We've got a combination that warrants the reward of a successful campaign.   Risks & Challenges  Here's what could happen that might affect the success of the campaign. In both events, your funds still go to NTHS Jazz Band.  Weather or force majeure could cause the Tahoe Sierra Century to be cancelled. September is a fairly safe time weather-wise in Lake Tahoe.    I'm unable to do the Sierra Century on my unicycle due to lack of preparation, equipment failure or sudden illness. Help me fund this now so I have more inspiration to train for the ride!  
   Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute, you can still help a whole bunch!  Circulate this link among your friends and networks on social media. Volunteer at the Tahoe Sierra Century.",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The challenges that teens face today are widespread and serious.  According to the National Institutes of Health, approximately 46.3% of youth (aged 13 - 18) will have a mental health disorder. A recent study found that 8.5% of American youth (aged 8 -18) show signs of addictive behavior in video game playing (Iowa State University and the National Institute on Media and the Family). Moreover, 1 in 11 American high school students attempts suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death in youth (aged 10 - 24) (CDC). <b>ReTribe addresses these mental health issues at their core and your contributions will allow us to reach more people in need and have a bigger impact on the world.</b></span><br/></p>
<p>Here is one parents story about the deep impact this experience had on their son and their family: </p>
<div>""Immediately after I picked up Jake from ReTribe, some really beautiful and transformative communication began. He was excited to share his experience with us; a light I had not seen in many years emanated from within him--the  Jake I really needed to see again. Stopping for dinner on our way home, I listened as he talked about the week--his interpersonal skills were suddenly astounding. At one point, he stopped mid-sentence and began to tell me about how he remembered something while at ReTribe that he had forgotten over the previous years. He said ""I remembered how much I love you, Mom, I really missed you and wanted to tell you but had no way to get in touch with you--so I wrote to you in my journal"". Now, I can't even begin to explain how much I needed to hear that from him, and I can tell you that even as I recall this moment now it brings tears to my eyes. As I sat there at the table crying onto my dinner plate, Jake proceeded to talk about his brother - how close they used to be, how he didn't know what happened, but he wanted to be close to him again. It was really surreal for me. And it didn't stop there. I thought when we got home that this confident loving Jake might quickly disappear. I waited for the ball to drop, it seemed just too good to be true; but it didn't and it has been 5 months.""</div>

In addition to other fundraising efforts such as applying for grants and building major donor relationships, raising $3,500 in this annual fundraiser is an important source of funding for our small organization. 
Whatever amount you can give will help and remember to check out the great perks you can get with your donation!
Your Impact


                  
The challenges that teens face today are widespread and serious.  According to the National Institutes of Health, approximately 46.3% of youth (aged 13 - 18) will have a mental health disorder. A recent study found that 8.5% of American youth (aged 8 -18) show signs of addictive behavior in video game playing (Iowa State University and the National Institute on Media and the Family). Moreover, 1 in 11 American high school students attempts suicide. Suicide is the third leading cause of death in youth (aged 10 - 24) (CDC). ReTribe addresses these mental health issues at their core and your contributions will allow us to reach more people in need and have a bigger impact on the world.
Here is one parents story about the deep impact this experience had on their son and their family: 
""Immediately after I picked up Jake from ReTribe, some really beautiful and transformative communication began. He was excited to share his experience with us; a light I had not seen in many years emanated from within him--the  Jake I really needed to see again. Stopping for dinner on our way home, I listened as he talked about the week--his interpersonal skills were suddenly astounding. At one point, he stopped mid-sentence and began to tell me about how he remembered something while at ReTribe that he had forgotten over the previous years. He said ""I remembered how much I love you, Mom, I really missed you and wanted to tell you but had no way to get in touch with you--so I wrote to you in my journal"". Now, I can't even begin to explain how much I needed to hear that from him, and I can tell you that even as I recall this moment now it brings tears to my eyes. As I sat there at the table crying onto my dinner plate, Jake proceeded to talk about his brother - how close they used to be, how he didn't know what happened, but he wanted to be close to him again. It was really surreal for me. And it didn't stop there. I thought when we got home that this confident loving Jake might quickly disappear. I waited for the ball to drop, it seemed just too good to be true; but it didn't and it has been 5 months.""

<p>Med Film Factory is an advanced training
program for teams of Arab producers and directors working on their first or
second feature narrative film project. </p>
<p>This unique training
opportunity aimed at Arab filmmakers from the MENA (Middle East / North Africa)
region was created in 2010 when a concept initiated by the Royal Film
Commission – Jordan in partnership with Sud Ecriture – Tunisia and the Huston
School of Film &amp; Digital Media – Ireland materialized into a fully-developed
training program with the financial support of the Euromed Audiovisual program
of the European Union, which funded the program between 2011 and 2014. </p>
<p>Med Film Factory is now suspended due to lack of funds and to the non-renewal of the Euromed Audiovisual program that funded it these past few years and we need your support to keep it going!<br/></p>
<p>As
of 2015, the training will take place on two interrelated workshops: </p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The
Producers’ Workshop</strong>: For six days, producers are guided
by professionals through an advanced coaching program tackling various aspects
of producing: creative producing, marketing, funding, legalities and pitching,
with emphasis on regional co-production, exhibition and distribution.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>The
Directors’ Workshop</strong>: Guided by reputable regional and
international film tutors and experts, selected directors join group,
one-on-one sessions and hands-on exercises throughout the eight-day specialized
training program. Experts will work with directors on their scripts, directing
techniques, camera, sound and editing with the aim of helping them develop
their visual languages as directors. In addition, participants will have the
opportunity to direct a short film from or inspired by their feature projects,
supervised by tutors and experts.  Local crew and cast will work with them
through all stages of production.</p>
<p>To
replace the third training session of the previous version of the program, the <b>Independent
Film Assembly</b>, participants will be directly dispatched by Med Film Factory
to participate in film markets of international and regional festivals. </p>
<p><br/></p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Med Film Factory is the only Arab training program in the region
that is specifically designed to develop the skills of Arab producers and Arab
directors. </p>
<p>It seeks to enhance the participants’ creative and professional
skills as well as support them in the realization of their projects. It
also anticipates to contribute to the creation of collective connections within
the Arab regional film industry, in particular to encourage the regional
support of independent creative voices and films through all the stages of
filmmaking that will help sustain the overall Mediterranean film industry.</p>

</h3>
<p>Out of the 24 feature film projects that
went through the program, two feature films have been shot and are now in
post-production. Eight more are now in pre-production. </p>
<p>Two short films produced during the
Directors’ Workshop that took place in April 2014 were selected to the official
short film competition of the 25th edition of Carthage Film Festival in 2014
and are screening in various film festivals. </p>
<p>In addition, many participants from all
three cycles have individually developed success stories in the film industry
thanks to their experience in Med Film Factory.</p>

</h3>
<p>Three cycles into the project, Med Film
Factory has matured into a beautifully crafted training program which has
benefited around 50 Arab producers and directors. Annually anticipated, the
program is one of the most important training opportunities aimed at Arab
producers and directors, its mark significant when it comes to developing the
skills of filmmakers from the Arab World.</p>
<p>Med Film Factory helped Arab film
directors to develop their professional directing skills, thus enhancing the
artistic quality and value of regional film projects. It has contributed in training
Arab producers in their profession and has supported them to find new methods
of producing, financing, exhibition and distribution.</p>
<p>Also it encouraged audio-visual
professionals from the Mediterranean countries to invest, support and produce
film projects by Arab and independent filmmakers to present to the audiences a
good range of films by regional filmmakers. </p>
<p>Finally, Med Film Factory helped in supporting
local and regional film appreciation and its literature and contributed towards
a wider range of distribution and circulation of films within the Mediterranean
countries as a market for films. </p>

<p>Help us
raise the funds to organize a complete edition in 2015! </p><br/></div>","Med Film Factory is an advanced training
program for teams of Arab producers and directors working on their first or
second feature narrative film project. 
This unique training
opportunity aimed at Arab filmmakers from the MENA (Middle East / North Africa)
region was created in 2010 when a concept initiated by the Royal Film
Commission – Jordan in partnership with Sud Ecriture – Tunisia and the Huston
School of Film & Digital Media – Ireland materialized into a fully-developed
training program with the financial support of the Euromed Audiovisual program
of the European Union, which funded the program between 2011 and 2014. 
Med Film Factory is now suspended due to lack of funds and to the non-renewal of the Euromed Audiovisual program that funded it these past few years and we need your support to keep it going!
As
of 2015, the training will take place on two interrelated workshops: 

The
Producers’ Workshop: For six days, producers are guided
by professionals through an advanced coaching program tackling various aspects
of producing: creative producing, marketing, funding, legalities and pitching,
with emphasis on regional co-production, exhibition and distribution.

The
Directors’ Workshop: Guided by reputable regional and
international film tutors and experts, selected directors join group,
one-on-one sessions and hands-on exercises throughout the eight-day specialized
training program. Experts will work with directors on their scripts, directing
techniques, camera, sound and editing with the aim of helping them develop
their visual languages as directors. In addition, participants will have the
opportunity to direct a short film from or inspired by their feature projects,
supervised by tutors and experts.  Local crew and cast will work with them
through all stages of production.
To
replace the third training session of the previous version of the program, the Independent
Film Assembly, participants will be directly dispatched by Med Film Factory
to participate in film markets of international and regional festivals. 


 
Med Film Factory is the only Arab training program in the region
that is specifically designed to develop the skills of Arab producers and Arab
directors. 
It seeks to enhance the participants’ creative and professional
skills as well as support them in the realization of their projects. It
also anticipates to contribute to the creation of collective connections within
the Arab regional film industry, in particular to encourage the regional
support of independent creative voices and films through all the stages of
filmmaking that will help sustain the overall Mediterranean film industry.






Out of the 24 feature film projects that
went through the program, two feature films have been shot and are now in
post-production. Eight more are now in pre-production. 
Two short films produced during the
Directors’ Workshop that took place in April 2014 were selected to the official
short film competition of the 25th edition of Carthage Film Festival in 2014
and are screening in various film festivals. 
In addition, many participants from all
three cycles have individually developed success stories in the film industry
thanks to their experience in Med Film Factory.
   



Three cycles into the project, Med Film
Factory has matured into a beautifully crafted training program which has
benefited around 50 Arab producers and directors. Annually anticipated, the
program is one of the most important training opportunities aimed at Arab
producers and directors, its mark significant when it comes to developing the
skills of filmmakers from the Arab World.
Med Film Factory helped Arab film
directors to develop their professional directing skills, thus enhancing the
artistic quality and value of regional film projects. It has contributed in training
Arab producers in their profession and has supported them to find new methods
of producing, financing, exhibition and distribution.
Also it encouraged audio-visual
professionals from the Mediterranean countries to invest, support and produce
film projects by Arab and independent filmmakers to present to the audiences a
good range of films by regional filmmakers. 
Finally, Med Film Factory helped in supporting
local and regional film appreciation and its literature and contributed towards
a wider range of distribution and circulation of films within the Mediterranean
countries as a market for films. 
   



The target of this crowd-funding campaign is set at 75,500 USD. The below chart shows a budget breakdown of the raised amount: Since 2011, 24 teams of Arab producers
and directors participated in the training sessions offered by Med Film
Factory. Each team was composed of one producer and one writer/director, both
attached to a feature film project with which they applied to the program.

place between 2011 and 2014:

</div></div>","About Oregon Koto-Kai

Founded by Koto Master Mitsuki Dazai in 2012, Oregon Koto-Kai works to bring the ancient sound of Japanese Koto music to live audiences in the Pacific Northwest.
We have performed at the Camellia Festival in Newburg, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, and more. With an extensive repertoire of both traditional and contemporary music, Oregon Koto–Kai provides a powerful link to the unique sounds of ancient and modern Japan.
We are a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
Here's a taste of what we sound like in concert.

Our Goal

The goal of our Indiegogo campaign is to bring an expert koto specialist from Japan to Oregon to professionally restring our kotos for next year's performance season.
What is koto?

The koto is a traditional Japanese instrument dating back to the ancient Nara Period some 1300 years ago.Measuring over six feet from end to end, the koto derives its unique sound from the thirteen strings which stretch along its length. These strings, which are braced across thirteen independent, movable bridges, allows the koto to be tuned to a wide range of musical scales. 
As with any stringed instrument, the strings of the koto wear out over 
time, and must be replaced every three years to maintain their rich 
tonal quality. However, unlike modern stringed instruments with tuning 
pegs, traditional kotos must have their strings tension fitted by 
professional craftsmen who have trained for years in the
 art of building and maintaining kotos.
Koto Specialists

For more than a thousand years, koto players have taken their instruments to specialists to have them restrung. The process of restringing is very demanding, as too little tension, or too much, can result in undesirable or unusable sounds, and may even damage the instrument. 
As there are none in the Americas, koto craftsmen are typically brought from Japan to restring kotos in the States.

About Millenial Trains Project


½ of US students are failing to read, Literator is here to help.
 
More than ½ of current US students are projected to drop out of high school because they can't read, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Reading is so critical to a child's future success, yet teachers are lacking the tools to help them address each child's individual needs: all they have are tests and binders full of notes and guidelines.Literator is a free tool that supports teachers in understanding, assessing, and addressing a child's reading needs without testing and without after school data entry.

Administrators use the insights gleaned from teacher inputs to alert them to problem areas throughout their organization. We need your help to raise $5,000 so we can participate in the Millennial Trains Project and get Literator into classrooms across the country.  How Literator Works






Literator is a mobile app that is both lightweight and unintrusive. It gives teachers just the tools they need at that moment to best help students:

Literator shows teachers exactly the skills and prompts they need to help a student at any level, so the teacher doesn't have to memorize all 2,000 skills
Literator allows teachers to rate a student's performance with a single swipe, so they don't have to take attention away from the students just to write notes
Literator groups students who struggle with the same skills, so teachers can teach in small groups and be more efficient in their instruction





And this is just the beginning! By the end of the summer, Literator will have a more robust dashboard for principals and administrators. Literator will show educators student performance trends and predictions on a daily basis, something that has never been done before. Finally, educators can support students preemptively instead of scrambling to catch kids up right before testing time.

Literator is commited to equity in education.

We’re just getting started but we won’t be finished until we’ve closed the literacy gap - a gap disproportionately impacts students of color and students in poverty. It doesn’t have to be that way. We’ve identified and addressed some of those root causes in how we’ve built Literator. We’re taking the best of technology, user experience design and literacy expertise and bringing easily and affordably into the classroom to give teachers what they need to help students read. We’re changing the future for the kids who have traditionally been left behind because they were too far below their grade level in reading. 
   Funding
We want to get Literator into the hands of more teachers. We've been honored to be selected by The Millennial Trains Project, which will allow us to meet with educators and influencers all across the country.

My name is Rachel Medeiros, and last summer my dear friend Cristy O'Brien and I embarked on an amazing project, which needs your help to continue! In 2018 we began with Summer Elements Nature Camp, and had LOADS of fun with more than 40 different children over the course of 8 weeks. We operated at Round The Bend Farm in Dartmouth, MA. where the kids explored the fields, learned about the livestock and vegetables, caught and released numerous toads, caterpillars, beetles and roly-polys, climbed more trees than we could count, and enjoyed the adjacent Audubon Society trails. We had a blast!! We provided 3 children with free or half-cost tuition for a total of 16 weeks between them. Incoming tuition went towards overhead costs and program materials. Everything we did that summer was done by Cristy and myself, volunteering our time to turn our grand vision, into a reality---albeit a scaled-back reality...</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560001463/uoyzzwfb6p3unkzd5kff.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Our goal was to make this kind of engaging outdoor program available year-round! For families who didn't want to send their children to schools where they get little to no outdoor playtime...For families who worry about the increased anxiety among elementary students, in this age of standardized testing and rigorous achievement standards...For families with children in the school system who are struggling to keep up, getting bullied, have test-related anxiety, or getting bored because they're advanced.  We want families to have another option, and we want this experience for our own children as well. Donors like you are making this unique and meaningful learning environment accessible for all, regardless of income, by supporting our scholarship fund. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560001405/fm6pokpe39madkfrjqut.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Cristy and I both come from teaching backgrounds, and in our studies of education and child development, we realized that what we wanted something different for our kids-something that most schools are not providing. We understand the importance of play, and that play, is in fact learning! When children play, they are making meaningful discoveries and connections and developing a deeper understanding of the world around them, and their relationship to it. We understand that children have a variety of learning styles, strengths and weaknesses, and that they need to develop their knowledge and skills at their own individual pace. We worried that even the most skilled and best-intentioned teacher would struggle to provide this for all 20+ students in the classroom.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560001880/qnwz0dz997wmjczftjvk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Homeschooling appealed to us, and we learned that there is a big community of homeschoolers here on the Southcoast, (over 300 k-12 children in the 8 surrounding towns and cities!!), with  opportunities for meet-ups, co-ops, classes, and events. But something was missing. Something that we felt was very important--a community; a group of children, of varied ages and learning styles and cultures, coming together on a regular basis, to grow and learn together.  We interviewed homeschooling parents, and talked with friends and family, and we found that other parents wanted this too, and many parents dismissed their desire to homeschool because they didn’t know how to find or create their own community. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560001508/u9in4o6a5lfpm1kag6lk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We continued to provide Elements Nature Program year round, with a 12 week session for each season. This gives children the time to get to know one another, to develop friendships with someone who they may not have initially approached, to work out disagreements that naturally arise among groups, and to work on projects over the course of the season. We are a young group, of 3-7 year olds, and hope that with continued outreach we will bring in children up to age 10.

We had a blast!! We provided 3 children with free or half-cost tuition for a total of 16 weeks between them. Incoming tuition went towards overhead costs and program materials. Everything we did that summer was done by Cristy and myself, volunteering our time to turn our grand vision, into a reality---albeit a scaled-back reality...Our goal was to make this kind of engaging outdoor program available year-round! For families who didn't want to send their children to schools where they get little to no outdoor playtime...For families who worry about the increased anxiety among elementary students, in this age of standardized testing and rigorous achievement standards...For families with children in the school system who are struggling to keep up, getting bullied, have test-related anxiety, or getting bored because they're advanced.  We want families to have another option, and we want this experience for our own children as well. Donors like you are making this unique and meaningful learning environment accessible for all, regardless of income, by supporting our scholarship fund. Cristy and I both come from teaching backgrounds, and in our studies of education and child development, we realized that what we wanted something different for our kids-something that most schools are not providing. We understand the importance of play, and that play, is in fact learning! When children play, they are making meaningful discoveries and connections and developing a deeper understanding of the world around them, and their relationship to it. We understand that children have a variety of learning styles, strengths and weaknesses, and that they need to develop their knowledge and skills at their own individual pace. We worried that even the most skilled and best-intentioned teacher would struggle to provide this for all 20+ students in the classroom.  Homeschooling appealed to us, and we learned that there is a big community of homeschoolers here on the Southcoast, (over 300 k-12 children in the 8 surrounding towns and cities!!), with  opportunities for meet-ups, co-ops, classes, and events. But something was missing. Something that we felt was very important--a community; a group of children, of varied ages and learning styles and cultures, coming together on a regular basis, to grow and learn together.  We interviewed homeschooling parents, and talked with friends and family, and we found that other parents wanted this too, and many parents dismissed their desire to homeschool because they didn’t know how to find or create their own community. We continued to provide Elements Nature Program year round, with a 12 week session for each season. This gives children the time to get to know one another, to develop friendships with someone who they may not have initially approached, to work out disagreements that naturally arise among groups, and to work on projects over the course of the season. We are a young group, of 3-7 year olds, and hope that with continued outreach we will bring in children up to age 10. In future years, we plan to offer programming up to age 18!By donating to our fundraiser, you make it possible for low-income families to benefit from a meaningful and developmentally appropriate learning experience for their children. One that will benefit their physical, social, and mental well-being for years to come. Donors like you are also making it possible for us to hire experts and skilled people who are able to join us as educational collaborators, to teach children various skills and arts, such as bread-baking, playing instruments, sewing, pottery, archery, soap-making and much more!! Part of our mission is to further develop connections, with children, families with others who are in some way improving our community or maintaining important and valuable skill-sets. Funding Breakdown - $30,000$13,485 - Scholarship Fund (This will provide 1 Full-Cost Scholarships and 2 Half-Cost Scholarships for each season!)$9,450 - Staff (Outreach & Volunteer Coordinator - 7 hr/wk $4,550/yr, Fundraising Coordinator - 6 hrs/wk $3,900/yr , and Website Design - $1,000)$3,400 - Collaborators ($100/wk 34 weeks/yr)$2,000 - Urban Outreach Programs/Events (Rent, Materials, Marketing, Permits - For 3-4 events annually)$1,665 - Gear (Proper Rain Boots & Shell Pants)",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Dear family, friends and kind-hearted contributors,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                 I am writing you this letter to bring to your attention a future President of the United States, a surgeon, a lawyer, and/or a leader in whatever area she decides.  My daughter is in the third grade at Baltimore International Academy, which is a language immersion school.  She learns Mandarin Chinese all day at school.  The teacher speaks to her only in Chinese.  She has been studying Chinese for four years.  Her language skills are progressing very well.  When given the chance she can participate in a fluent conversation.  We are aware that a lot of her time in school is spent learning Chinese so after school, of course after homework, she has a schedule of math, spelling, Rosetta Stone. </p>
<p>                Aniya performs in the top of her class.  She has been awarded the President’s Award two years in a row.  She has received awards because of her ability to excel on the YCT, young learners Chinese test.  To say that I am proud is an understatement.  At the age of nine, she has already performed for the Mayor of Baltimore and the President of China.  Not only is she a scholar, but she also excels in sports.  She participates in several rec sports including soccer, basketball, and several others.  She also competes in AAU track, basketball and most recently swimming.  While on the track team she shined in the shot put.   She is approaching her second year in swimming and continues to learn and implement several great habits like hard work, determination, perseverance, and respect.</p>
<p>                Aniya’s teacher recently nominated her for the National Young Scholars Program.   The National Young Scholars Program accepts high-achieving elementary students to attend this hands-on educational and leadership program.  This will be a great experience that will help Aniya build her leadership skills and learn all about ­­­engineering, medicine: the human body, and crime scene investigation.  Many of you have children, nieces, nephews, god-children or work with children on a daily basis and many of you many not.  I can guarantee that in your life you have come across at least one child who as entered into your heart.  Giving children opportunities to grow is emotionally fulfilling.   If I could give endless to my child I would, but I can’t  as funds are finite.  So, I call on the village for help.  </p>
<p>                The teacher that nominated her apologized after realizing the cost of the summer camp.  I am glad that she was not aware of the cost at the time because otherwise my daughter might not have been given the opportunity.  I am reaching out to family, friends and the community for support.  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.   Thank you for your ear and hopefully your support.</p>

<div style=""margin: 0px; font: 14px Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4"">I'm not perfect, I have failed more times than I care to admit, but I kept going, learning from each and every experience, good and bad. </font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px; font: 14px Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4""><br/>I was always looking for the secret to success, always searching for a shortcut to get what I wanted.</font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px; font: 14px Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4"">What I discovered over the past 23 years was that there are no short cuts, no secrets, just a simple step by step process to create the lifestyle you want. </font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px; font: 14px Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4""><br/></font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px; font: 14px Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4"">Seven years ago I was coaching people one on one to help them achieve the same success that I have enjoyed over the years. </font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px; font: 14px Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4"">If you have ever looked at hiring a success coach, you would know that they're not cheap, in fact it can be very expensive , I was no different.</font></div>
<div style=""margin: 0px; font: 14px Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;""><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""4"">Unfortunately the people who needed my help most, weren't able to afford my services.</font></div>

<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: large;"">So after much deliberation I decided put my 'one on one' coaching on hold, and made the decision to create a Success program that many people could afford, <u><em>and</em></u> still get the same amazing results using my methods. However, what makes my program different from many others, is that you don't do it all on your own, you will have help from your very own coach, someone to cheer you on, bounce ideas off and importantly, keep you accountable to your goals and ensure that you keep moving forward.</span><br/>

They were people who through no fault of their own, were 'stuck in a rut', they had lost their way and they were working hard, day in day out, week in week out, to merely 'eke' out a living for themselves and their family.</span>

<div style=""margin: 0px; font: 14px Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(77,77,77); font-size: large;"">I created this program to help those same people to create a lifestyle of their own choosing, not the one they are currently struggling in.

purposeful and successful 12 Weeks of your life!
...or
They could be just another 12 weeks

Your choice!

That's what the Autus Buddy-Up Succes program can offer people.

 
BUT Imagine what it could do for our High School Students
in their Graduating Year of School!

 

 

 
But First A  Bit About Me!

After twenty three years of research, four years of writing, re-writing, editing and formatting, I have completed one of the world's most unique personal success programs. But before I tell you about that, first a bit about me!

My name is Mark Craymer, I'm almost fifty, I'm a married father of three adult children, (that may sound like a contradiction but that's how I put it).
I served in the Navy for 11 years, since leaving in 1990, I have owned and operated my own businesses.
I'm not perfect, I have failed more times than I care to admit, but I kept going, learning from each and every experience, good and bad. 
I was always looking for the secret to success, always searching for a shortcut to get what I wanted.
What I discovered over the past 23 years was that there are no short cuts, no secrets, just a simple step by step process to create the lifestyle you want. 

Seven years ago I was coaching people one on one to help them achieve the same success that I have enjoyed over the years. 
If you have ever looked at hiring a success coach, you would know that they're not cheap, in fact it can be very expensive , I was no different.
Unfortunately the people who needed my help most, weren't able to afford my services.
I coached a few clients for free as they really needed help, and didn't have the money to hire my services, but I could only spread myself so far. 


So after much deliberation I decided put my 'one on one' coaching on hold, and made the decision to create a Success program that many people could afford, and still get the same amazing results using my methods. However, what makes my program different from many others, is that you don't do it all on your own, you will have help from your very own coach, someone to cheer you on, bounce ideas off and importantly, keep you accountable to your goals and ensure that you keep moving forward.


Now don't worry, this coach, (which I call in this program, your 'Success Buddy' ),won't cost you a penny! But more about that soon.

What is this Success Program?

You could liken it to a giant awakening! It would be like your mind has just woken from many years of slumber and all of a sudden, opportunities seem to cross your path readily, ideas come to you easily and your level of self confidence in your ability to achieve anything is at it's highest level yet.

You'll create a vision of what your new life is going become, and a road map on how you are going to get there. It all starts with my step by step, 12 week program, upon completion of which, you'll progress tonto a 90 Day goals achievement program. 

 
What you'll discover in this program is that within each of us, there lies a seed of greatness! The Autus Buddy-Up Success Program will help you realise what that seed is and how to nurture and grow it, to allow you to become someone who gets to do what they love in life and be rewarded extremely well for it!
You will embark upon the game of life with more vigour than ever before, you will be brimming with purpose, fullfilment and experience much joy as you progress along the journey of self discovery.
You will be in the 'process' of being successful, and as you will learn in this program, a by-product of success is wealth, financial independence!

 

 
How It Works!

 

 
I mentioned before that you'll have the services of a 'Success-Buddy', to help you through this program. The great thing about your Success-Buddy is that you don't have to pay him or her any money! Because your success buddy, is going to be a friend of yours, a work colleague, a relative or even your partner.
Of course , in turn you will become your partner's Success-Buddy as well!

 
The only pre-requisite for a success-buddy, is that they also have a strong desire to make massive improvements in their life and break free of what may be a mundane existence. 
You and your success-buddy will both progress through this program together each week for the first 12 weeks and then move into the massive goal achievement phase which are broken into 90 Day segements, at this point you and your success-buddy will be meeting each fortnight. 
You will learn how to coach each other and become an effective coach/Success-Buddy using the 'Buddy Guide' that has been written for this program.

 
I won't get into too much detail here but one thing you must know is, that it is extremely hard to achieve great things and break out of your current lifestyle without some help, and I'm talking 'structured help'. Look at the most successful people in the world today, they all have people around them supporting, and coaching them onto greater things.
You are no different! You will have your 'Success Buddy', and your Success Buddy will have you.

 

 
My BIG Goal and Why I Need Your Help?


 When I first began writing this program four years ago, I was creating it for the same type of people who I was coaching. They were people who through no fault of their own, were 'stuck in a rut', they had lost their way and they were working hard, day in day out, week in week out, to merely 'eke' out a living for themselves and their family.

I created this program to help those same people to create a lifestyle of their own choosing, not the one they are currently struggling in. So the people who I wrote this program for were mature, working adults from 25 years old and upwards.

However, I also now see that there exists a definite need for this program in another very important area of our community. That being our young students commencing their final year in High School.

I remember when I was in my last year of high school, I had absolutely no idea what I was going to do!
My safety blanket of 12 years was going to be pulled away from me and I would have to fend for myself, what the hell was I going to do!
Now I bet many students in their final year of high school have similar thoughts racing around in their head!

I believe that if I could get this program, (although a modified version to pertain to 16 - 18 year olds), into high schools the world over, I/We, could create an impact on millions of students in their final year of school.
Imagine, these students leaving school brimming with self confidence armed with an, 'I Can Do It' attitude, a passion for life, a set of worthwhile goals to achieve, AND a 'road map' on how they are going to achieve them!
As the motivational speaker and trainer, Zig Ziglar would put it, we would have a healthy population of high school graduates that have become, 'Meaningful Specifics' rather than 'Wandering Generalities'!


Now it's time to hand it over to you!

 

Help this project and at the same time help yourself too!




 
I have a number of contribution levels available for you, each one of them gives you something in return. The money raised via this campaign will help me to acheive my goal of getting this program out into High Schools all over the world.
 
Initially I will be re-writing/editing the program so it pertains more to a teenage audience.

Next will be the creation of their own 'community based' website, where they can interact with other students, no matter where they are in the world.
They can share ideas, stories and help each other with challenges and obstacles that they will face as they progress through the program.
It will also be on this website whereby students will be able to download the program for themselves


Next comes the marketing, and the creation and distribution of information packages regarding the Autus Buddy-Up Success program. This is the one I'm going to need some help with and it will probably come at a cost.


But I have been committed to this program for four years now and have dedicated thousands of hours into it and almost $45,000 of my own money. I won't ever give up in getting this program into the hands of people who can reallt benefit from it, especially our youth!

It's one of the first ever family products built using the blockchain.We call it a piggy-wallet™.  
Today’s kids live in a fast-changing financial world. Digital money, contactless payments, in-app purchases and cryptocurrency are all things they need help to understand.It's hard to get to grips with money if you can’t touch the notes or feel the coins!We wanted to find a way to make digital money physical, so children can touch, play and experiment with it. The same way we did with the coins in our piggy-banks.  
Pigzbe teaches kids about money in a language they understand. It is made up of four connected elements: 1. Pigzbe Device Pigzbe is a friendly and interactive financial assistant that’s packed with personality. Take Pigzbe on adventures, play games and learn together as you grow up. 2. Pigzbe App The Pigzbe App connects the whole family to a child’s financial education. Parents can send allowances, set tasks & reward milestones. Kids learn through play. 3. Wollo, a family-friendly cryptocurrency  Using Wollo kids learn how to save, budget and manage digital money. Every new Pigzbe comes with 200 Wollo inside, enough to start having fun right away! 4. Family Payment CardSpend Wollo easily anywhere that takes Visa using our Family Payment Card. Or spend Wollo using a Wirex Visa card (both cards available in selected locations, additional fees apply).  
In the Parents App, Mum and Dad moderate. They can set allowances, create tasks to earn money, reward milestones, and invite others to join the family network. The Kids App is an interactive game. It allows children to feed their money tree, watch it grow, and learn new financial concepts as they play.  
Lots of parents struggle to talk to their children about finances and worry about passing on bad habits. Pigzbe helps create a more positive family dynamic around money.  Kids learn:  
Wollo is our family-friendly cryptocurrency, designed specifically to send money globally, quickly and cost-effectively (it costs $0.000001 to send as little as $0.005).    
Where do I get Wollo?  Every Pigzbe device comes with 200 Wollo inside, enough for parents to get started setting tasks and giving rewards. You can buy more Wollo online like any other currency.  How does Wollo work?Wollo works like any other currency – it has an exchange rate and you can buy it with dollars, pounds or other cryptocurrencies. Like any other currency it can go up and down in price.Fluctuation is an important financial concept to learn (the dollar does it, the pound does it) so introducing children to this idea with very small amounts of money, is a useful lesson.How can I spend Wollo?You can spend Wollo by exchanging it online for other digital or everyday currencies or using a Pigzbe Family Payment Card or Wirex Visa card (selected locations, fees apply).  
Pigzbe comes with all the necessary parts to start playing right out of the box: A. Pigzbe Piggy-Wallet, B. Pigzbe App (Parents App + Kids App), C. USBC Charging chord Lights! Sound! Touch! D. 128 LED lights, combined with a E. speaker, a F. vibration motor, and G. 2x buttons, to provide a tangible window into your digital money.   
We're a team of engineers, technologists, artists and storytellers from 15 countries. We've worked on incredible projects for companies like Apple, Google and NASA. We know what it means to deliver exceptional experiences to millions of people. Pigzbe is our next big adventure.  
Prototype in action. We worked with the amazing team at Pentagram, the world's largest independent design consultancy, to build a truly unique product.  Pigzbe runs on a Dual core XTENSA® 32-bit LX6 with AES/RSA/ECC/SHA hardware encryption. It has a 24 x 8 LED matrix display, 6-axis motion sensing and works with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.

<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""><h3 style="""">The Background</h3>
<div>Some of you might be aware, some of you might not be, but I am currently in my fourth year of architecture at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. Even though at this point in the year most students are gearing up for graduation, architecture school is a 5 year program for a BA. Not only that, but they expect us to handle a 3rd 400 level design course(more on what that means later) and our thesis research at the same time in our fall semester of 5th year. Under most circumstances I would say toughen up Zach you can do it, and I very much so could, however I also need to be able to work 18 plus hours a week in order to pay New York City rent. So that is where a summer design course comes into the equation. I have been one of 10 selected for a summer design course for summer 2011 that starts in the third week of May. Luckily it's not just any summer design course, it's a summer design course taught by Jonas Coersmeier with a seminar class taught by Gisela Baurmann both of <a href=""http://www.burony.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""BüroNY Architecture Office"">BüroNY Architecture Office</a>, also half of which is conducted in Berlin, Germany, which just happens to be on my list of cities to consider locating to after graduation upon completion of my 5th year at Pratt. However as always there is a downside to such a great program, and that is an elevated cost. This coupled with the lack of financial aid offered for summer courses leaves me stuck, but maybe not if you guys have something to say.</div></span></h3>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>The Program</h3>
<p>At Pratt and most other ""Design"" schools, architecture students are required to take a Design each semester they are enrolled. Your first year starts highly abstract, getting a grasp of the ideas/tools/techniques of being a designer, and as you progress getting more and more real, until your thesis where you can flip it however you choose fit. 400 level design is known as ""option studios"" meaning that there is no set program, site, and pedagogy for the entire 400 level, but professors and students form their own, which ends up allowing most of the abroad programs to insert themselves into these 400 level design courses. Specifics on architectural program and site of the project are not yet set, but this will be updated as they are provided. Pedagogy I can touch, but I in no way would like to step on Jonas' toes on this, so I'll keep it brief. I have previously taken a design course with him, and it proved to be one of the most demanding experiences in my education so far, but also yielded successful results. His interests align with mine(I feel so anyways) that program needs to be engineered and not laid out. He also brings technology to the forefront to be utilized as a tool, not a representational ornament. I learned a great deal from that one semester, but I know I can learn an infinite amount more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help all of these things come to fruition. It is very important to me that I can focus on my last design course without the distractions of thesis and work, combining to make the fall an unpleasant experience, and worst of all a potential waste of a design course and thesis research, the two things rounding out my portfolio coming out of school.

</div></div>","The Background
Some of you might be aware, some of you might not be, but I am currently in my fourth year of architecture at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. Even though at this point in the year most students are gearing up for graduation, architecture school is a 5 year program for a BA. Not only that, but they expect us to handle a 3rd 400 level design course(more on what that means later) and our thesis research at the same time in our fall semester of 5th year. Under most circumstances I would say toughen up Zach you can do it, and I very much so could, however I also need to be able to work 18 plus hours a week in order to pay New York City rent. So that is where a summer design course comes into the equation. I have been one of 10 selected for a summer design course for summer 2011 that starts in the third week of May. Luckily it's not just any summer design course, it's a summer design course taught by Jonas Coersmeier with a seminar class taught by Gisela Baurmann both of BüroNY Architecture Office, also half of which is conducted in Berlin, Germany, which just happens to be on my list of cities to consider locating to after graduation upon completion of my 5th year at Pratt. However as always there is a downside to such a great program, and that is an elevated cost. This coupled with the lack of financial aid offered for summer courses leaves me stuck, but maybe not if you guys have something to say.

The Program
At Pratt and most other ""Design"" schools, architecture students are required to take a Design each semester they are enrolled. Your first year starts highly abstract, getting a grasp of the ideas/tools/techniques of being a designer, and as you progress getting more and more real, until your thesis where you can flip it however you choose fit. 400 level design is known as ""option studios"" meaning that there is no set program, site, and pedagogy for the entire 400 level, but professors and students form their own, which ends up allowing most of the abroad programs to insert themselves into these 400 level design courses. Specifics on architectural program and site of the project are not yet set, but this will be updated as they are provided. Pedagogy I can touch, but I in no way would like to step on Jonas' toes on this, so I'll keep it brief. I have previously taken a design course with him, and it proved to be one of the most demanding experiences in my education so far, but also yielded successful results. His interests align with mine(I feel so anyways) that program needs to be engineered and not laid out. He also brings technology to the forefront to be utilized as a tool, not a representational ornament. I learned a great deal from that one semester, but I know I can learn an infinite amount more.

The Impact
Your contributions will help all of these things come to fruition. It is very important to me that I can focus on my last design course without the distractions of thesis and work, combining to make the fall an unpleasant experience, and worst of all a potential waste of a design course and thesis research, the two things rounding out my portfolio coming out of school. As I previously said, Berlin is also at the top of my list of places to locate to after completing my BA at Pratt, and this would be a great opportunity to also feel the city out and whether it can be the right fit, as well as visiting offices to layout a plan to facilitate such a move. Also on a side note, I have never even been out of the United States that wasn't a family trip to Mexico, so this will erase many bucket list style items.

Food/living - $50 per week x 6 weeks(in Berlin, in Brooklyn I'll be working so no cost factored in)

of the Arts in Brooklyn, NY, and Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Queens,
NY.
        Our curriculum focuses on
chord theory and harmony using MIDI keyboards, playback exercises, and music
notation. Our main goal is to make music easy to understand and fun to compose.
We wrote a method book that utilizes jazz and classical compositions, advanced
music theory, and jazz piano voicings that we coupled with software exercises
to teach theory, keyboard skills, composition and arranging. In our
advanced composition class at the Oakland and San Francisco School of the Arts,
we have had incredible results teaching 12 thru 18 year-olds to read lead
sheets, improvise, and compose their own music.
        Our goal
is $1,000, which is half of the projected budget of one beat lab (around
$2,000). Please help us raise money to build new labs in New York for 2015!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>My name is Ashley Winnard and I am a Linguistics major at the University of Oklahoma. For those of you that are unsure, or simply don't know, Linguistics is the comprehensive study of human language systems across the world. While most linguists study specific languages and are sometimes bi- or trilingual, the bulk of our studies involves the mechanics of human language: the individual sounds and sound patterns within language (the p's, t's and k's of any alphabet), sentence structure (intense grammar), semantics (meaning in words and communication), language change over time (how English and German are related, and how words like 'werewolf' came to be) and language death. The University of Oklahoma is the only university in Oklahoma that offers Linguistics and is also the leading university in the nation in preserving and documenting Kiowa, the language of the native Kiowa people. We began the first Kiowa dictionary at the beginning of this year and we also offer classes on the Kiowa language. When pondering how or why this is important, keep in mind that Hebrew was once a completely dead language and is now spoken by millions of people all over the world. This is what we do! </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Though the University of Oklahoma has a Linguistics program, there is an astounding lack of resources for the department. I am traveling to the University of Sheffield in January 2012 to study topics for which the University of Oklahoma just does not have the funding. In the fall of 2012, I will stay in Sheffield and continue my studies in English or travel to France to attend the Limoges University. In either situation, I will have no place to stay during the summer months in Europe. Your donation -anything helps!- will go towards housing and food during those summer months, in addition to passports and visas, flight costs, boarding at both universities, meal costs, emergencies and phoning home! <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need approximately $5,500 to live abroad for a year. This isn't much for a whole year, especially with the exchange rate, but it is a huge amount for me to earn on my own. I do not have a place to live during the summer so this is where a lot of the money will be going. Any and all funds raised will be used towards this campaign! Any excess will also be used for this campaign. All amounts help- from a dollar up.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Full Circles Foundation works at the intersection of the environment, the economy, and gender.  We believe that the excesses and injustices seen in each of these areas are fundamentally connected and cannot be addressed in isolation of each other.  Similarly, we believe that these connections represent enormous potential - by advancing genuine economic justice, we advance genuine gender justice and environmental justice (and vice versa all the way around).  In keeping with this understanding, we have six ambitious, long-term goals:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1.  Overcoming cycles of economic vulnerability among women.</p>
<p>2.  Overcoming cycles of violence against women.</p>
<p>3.  Returning to women power over their bodies.</p>
<p>4.  Building civic efficacy among girls and women.</p>
<p>5.  Building the restorative, sustainable economy.</p>
<p>6.  Overcoming climate change and environmental degradation.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>These goals are mutually reinforcing - building civic efficacy among girls and women helps women overcome cycles of violence against women, and working to overcome cycles of economic vulnerability among women aids in building the restorative, sustainable economy.  There is SO much evidence supporting the effectiveness of this intersectional strategy!  (Take a look at some of the organizations on which we are modeled - the Green Belt Movement, the Grameen Bank, and the Women's Environment &amp; Development Organization).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In the short-term (this summer), we are working to increase environmental literacy, health literacy, civic efficacy, and confidence and self-esteem among our campers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Lack of transportation is a major obstacle that prevents many girls from fully and consistently participating in Full Circles Foundation activities.  Our team has worked hard to provide transportation assistance this summer through Bus Buddies Program, wherein FCF instructors meet campers at bus stops near their homes and take public transportation together to and from the camp.  Bus Buddies cannot meet all of our transportation needs, however.  Some families do not live near bus stops, some of the bus routes are prohibitively long and inefficient, and there are more Bus Buddies applicants than there are instructors!  But while Bus Buddies isn't ideal, we don't necessarily like the idea of putting another gas-guzzling fleet of cars on Raleigh's already-congested roadways...<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So, our solution is this:  we want to buy up a used bus and convert it to a fabulous set of bio-diesel wheels!  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>While the finished product will be amazing, the process of converting the bus promises to be a wild, wonderful, and empowering experience for the Full Circles Foundation community - and it advances all of our missions!  I can't think of a better way to challenge gender norms than having a group of girls and women get elbow deep in a bus engine to convert it to run on waste vegetable oil!  Additionally, we will be able to strengthen the local economy by patronizing Piedmont Biofuels, the Triangle's bio-diesel producer from whom we will be purchasing some of our fuel!  And of course, there is the fact that bio-diesel burns cleaner than petroleum diesel.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We have budgeted $7500 for this expense:  $5000 for a used bus and $1500 for conversion expenses.  This is where we need your help.  Helping Full Circles Foundation purchase and convert a bus is a very concrete way to make a significant and lasting impact on the viability of Full Circles Foundation, the lives of the girls with whom we work, and our shared atmosphere.  And we have some special ways to say 'Thank you'... </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A $10 donation will secure you a set of three ""Flower Bombs"" - concentrated balls of flower power made with local compost, local clay, and wildflower seeds that one can toss onto the shoulder of the road, into vacant lots, or in your backyard.  It is a way to reclaim and revive public spaces!  Each Flower Bomb has been lovingly made and packaged by a Strong Camp participant!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>A $25 donation will be thanked with an autographed copy of the Full Circles Foundation music video!  Our campers have written and composed the official Full Circles Foundation song and are working on choreographing a music video!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

He has thrown his siblings down the stairs, banged his babysitter's head on a marble tile, tried to throw his sister out a window, pushed his sister in traffic and poked her in the face with scissors.  His speech has become delayed, and he became uncoordinated. Later, his school in Connecticut put him on a safety plan. Before he was properly treated for his conditions, Andrea had to physically intervene to calm him 40 to 60 times per day.  </p><p>In court, the psychologist treating the special needs child testified that he must receive complete evaluations  (Neuro developmental Pscholgogicla evaluations) immediately and explained <b>the window for his chance for change and improvement was closing.   </b>The father has refused to get him support.  His teachers and the school psychologist have observed great deterioration when he went off medication as his mother could no longer afford it. He is hitting himself and others as he does not transition well and is disrupted by a decrease in service and move to a country he lived in for under one school year.  His father refuses to set up services for him in Singapore and has not yet demonstrated to have the necessary health insurance.</p><p><b>There is no legal aid in Singapore and no social services for foreigners.  </b>There is no court ordered child support order in place. Andrea cannot continue to pay her lawyer in London to order child support.</p><p><b>A few other facts</b>, detailed in documents and reports:</p><p><b>-Caretakers in London reported him to social services</b>, once for abuse and neglect. Once he left the children unattended to work out at gym.</p><p><b>-There is non-disclosure of offshore accounts, as well as a freezing injunction on offshore accounts due to repeated financial threats. </b>This included eventual draining of frozen accounts after an expedited restraining order was served on Fred in Sinagpore.</p><p><b>-Submission of a falsified lease</b> for a Singapore residence to the US federal court for the children to live in.</p><p>-In US federal court, admits <b>not filing US taxes</b> for many years.</p><p>-<b>Unpaid tuition for children, unpaid dental, health insurance or alimony</b></p><p>-<b>Collusion with company</b> to submit falsified employment compensation record.</p><p><b>- Refusal to allow Andrea to get medical treatment </b>(needing serious back surgery). Leaving her to care for all five children repeatedly for weeks and months at a time while he travelled overseas.</p><p>-The father has <b>no visits with kids without supervision </b>from the federal court judge and court appointed psychologist.</p><p><b>-The children have begged the father to let them remain in the US</b>. The children are acting out and wake up with nightmares.</p><p>All the children lived in Singapore for less than a year. Andrea's husband has held no residence in Singapore for over a year and is documented to have spent less then ten days per month there during the past year. His company's main Asia office is in Hong Kong, so he must travel there frequently. In court he admitted that the Singapore office conducts minimal business but Singapore has a better ""regulatory"" situation and tax shelter. The children have no family, and no ties, but are being forced to return to Singapore. The children are devastated to leave their family, grandparents, home and school to return to a foreign place they lived in for under one year.</p><p><b>MAGNITUDE: IF ANDREA CANNOT PAY HER SINGAPORE LAWYERS, SHE COULD LOSE CUSTODY OF THE CHILDREN FOR FAILURE TO REPRESENT HERSELF.</b></p><p>Connecticut’s social services, the police and domestic violence organizations are seriously concerned. <b>Court documents, restraining orders and other legal documents detail the situation. These are available for public record.</b> Andrea wants to protect her children, but encourages a relationship with the father, as long as visits are supervised, with safety plans in place.</p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p><p>The most urgent initial need is $40,000 (by June 15). The funds will be used to pay for the initial round of legal representation in Singapore, including the filing of a restraining order to prevent family violence. If Andrea does not pay for legal representation she will not be available participate in the custody hearing.  Legal aid does NOT exist in Singapore.</p><p>There are other costs involved but these will be posted at a later date. These are at a minimum of another $60,000. These costs include the final payments for legal fees, as well as funds for neuropsychiatric evaluations and treatment and therapies for her child with special needs. Living expenses are also part of this. </p><p> If Andrea doesn't not reach her goal, she will use the funds to pay as much as the legal fees as possible. She cannot work in Singapore, which means she will be completely dependent on Fred Scolnick for support. She is now on a dependent visa and will be forced to leave the country, 90 days after entry if her husband does not cooperate to renew her visa.  Once the divorce is finalized she can no longer remain in Singapore on a ""dependent"" visa. </p><p>What you will get are regular updates on the progress of the campaign and the satisfaction that you have helped a devoted mother and children truly in need.</p><p><b>The Impact</b></p><p>Protecting child welfare and ensuring a mother from domestic violence is critical to the future of these children, especially to her son with special needs.</p><p><b>In Sum</b></p><p><b>As detailed above, Andrea has no funds to pay for legal representation,</b> but her husband has spent $600,000 to file numerous motions to stall or delay proceedings, abuse the children and Andrea financially and control the family. Andrea has fought without resources to pay custody lawyers, and several of the US and UK are working for free at this point.</p><p><b>Her desired outcome is to be awarded joint custody with sole care and control and to relocate back to the US with her children, especially since Fred is rarely in Singapore and travels extensively. She would encourage his visits to see the children in the US often.</b> </p><p><b> The children deserve to have the father in their life.</b> However, therapists and and the court have documented  the children are negatively impacted by the prior nomadic lifestyle. They concluded the children would benefit and feel stable and , security and a sense of belonging by continuing to live in the US with their mother, other family, and community that they have become embedded in.</p><p><b>The Future:</b></p><p>Andrea would like to renew her social work license, convert it to Connecticut and resume work. She also plans to provide adoption counseling for parents in need, once she has created a safe and stable home for the children and provides them with the grounding and roots all children deserve.</p><p>Twitter Account:  Team Children @help5children</p><br/><p></p></div>","Five American Children in URGENT NEED OF HELPAndrea Wainer, a single mother, teacher, and clinical social worker living in Greenwich, Connecticut with her five children, urgently needs help, while she represents herself and children in an international divorce and custody battle that has spanned the US, UK and Singapore. This is a watershed moment. The case is so critical that Connecticut’s domestic violence agencies, child welfare services, and the Greenwich police have been intimately involved on a continuous basis, to ensure the safety of Andrea and the childrenAfter volunteering to return to Singapore for the resolution of custody, the US ordered the children to remain living with Andrea.

Leaving her to care for all five children repeatedly for weeks and months at a time while he travelled overseas.-The father has no visits with kids without supervision from the federal court judge and court appointed psychologist.-The children have begged the father to let them remain in the US. The children are acting out and wake up with nightmares.All the children lived in Singapore for less than a year. Andrea's husband has held no residence in Singapore for over a year and is documented to have spent less then ten days per month there during the past year. His company's main Asia office is in Hong Kong, so he must travel there frequently. In court he admitted that the Singapore office conducts minimal business but Singapore has a better ""regulatory"" situation and tax shelter. The children have no family, and no ties, but are being forced to return to Singapore. The children are devastated to leave their family, grandparents, home and school to return to a foreign place they lived in for under one year.MAGNITUDE: IF ANDREA CANNOT PAY HER SINGAPORE LAWYERS, SHE COULD LOSE CUSTODY OF THE CHILDREN FOR FAILURE TO REPRESENT HERSELF.Connecticut’s social services, the police and domestic violence organizations are seriously concerned. Court documents, restraining orders and other legal documents detail the situation. These are available for public record. Andrea wants to protect her children, but encourages a relationship with the father, as long as visits are supervised, with safety plans in place.What We Need & What You GetThe most urgent initial need is $40,000 (by June 15). The funds will be used to pay for the initial round of legal representation in Singapore, including the filing of a restraining order to prevent family violence. If Andrea does not pay for legal representation she will not be available participate in the custody hearing.  Legal aid does NOT exist in Singapore.There are other costs involved but these will be posted at a later date. These are at a minimum of another $60,000. These costs include the final payments for legal fees, as well as funds for neuropsychiatric evaluations and treatment and therapies for her child with special needs. Living expenses are also part of this.  If Andrea doesn't not reach her goal, she will use the funds to pay as much as the legal fees as possible. She cannot work in Singapore, which means she will be completely dependent on Fred Scolnick for support. She is now on a dependent visa and will be forced to leave the country, 90 days after entry if her husband does not cooperate to renew her visa.  Once the divorce is finalized she can no longer remain in Singapore on a ""dependent"" visa. What you will get are regular updates on the progress of the campaign and the satisfaction that you have helped a devoted mother and children truly in need.The ImpactProtecting child welfare and ensuring a mother from domestic violence is critical to the future of these children, especially to her son with special needs.In SumAs detailed above, Andrea has no funds to pay for legal representation, but her husband has spent $600,000 to file numerous motions to stall or delay proceedings, abuse the children and Andrea financially and control the family. Andrea has fought without resources to pay custody lawyers, and several of the US and UK are working for free at this point.Her desired outcome is to be awarded joint custody with sole care and control and to relocate back to the US with her children, especially since Fred is rarely in Singapore and travels extensively. She would encourage his visits to see the children in the US often.  The children deserve to have the father in their life. However, therapists and and the court have documented  the children are negatively impacted by the prior nomadic lifestyle. They concluded the children would benefit and feel stable and , security and a sense of belonging by continuing to live in the US with their mother, other family, and community that they have become embedded in.The Future:Andrea would like to renew her social work license, convert it to Connecticut and resume work. She also plans to provide adoption counseling for parents in need, once she has created a safe and stable home for the children and provides them with the grounding and roots all children deserve.Twitter Account:  Team Children @help5children",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

This is done through day camps with Syrian children, material donations (such as coloring books, games, and sports equipment), holiday events, and monetary support of schools both inside and out of Syria.</p><p></p><p>The project was initially founded by Nousha Kabawat, University of Toronto Munk School of Global Affairs Global Journalism Fellow, and Aziz Abu Sarah, Executive Director of George Mason University’s Center for World Religions, Diplomacy, and Conflict Resolution. Nousha and Aziz on a trip to Syrian refugee camps in Turkey noticed the lack of educational resources available to Syrian children especially and an urgent need for intervention.

Since the revolution began in 2011, these children have been forced from their homes and country and have been unable to access basic needs or education. Project Amal ou Salam believes that every child has the right to an education, to a childhood free from trauma and violence, and to the hope of a peaceful tomorrow.</p><p></p><h1><b>What does Amal ou Salam do?</b></h1><p></p><h3>Workshops</h3><p>Project Amal ou Salam’s workshops, like the ones described below, provide open dialogue, giving the kids a safe space to tackle the issues that they face and develop their own ideas and visions for the future of Syria. Some of the workshops that Project Amal ou Salam conducts include:</p><p></p><p>•	Photography – Children are given digital cameras and asked to take pictures of their surroundings. While teaching fundamental use of digital media, giving lessons in perspective, depth, and framing, the children are introduced to concepts like empathy, self-expression, and emotional awareness.</p><p>•	Sports -- Children play team sports and take part in collaborative and active games. This is a positive energy outlet, team-building activity, and a lot of fun!</p><p>•	Team/Trust-Building – Volunteers facilitate activities that introduce group collaboration, teamwork, critical thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills such as trust falls, the human knot, relay races, Simon Says, and three legged races.</p><p>•	Art – Children are introduced to activities such as “rebuild your city,” where they are asked to think about their hometowns and what sorts of things they will need in these rebuilt communities, and Peace Flags, where children design flags depicting what peace means to them. This introduces children to creative expression, critical thinking, and teamwork.</p><p>•	Music – Children are introduced to rhythm and beat using the body and voices to produce music without instruments. This encourages creative self-expression, self-confidence, and listening skills.</p><p></p><p>…But Project Amal ou Salam is much more than just a summer camp. </p><p></p><p>In 2014, we supported over 3000 children in four different countries, were aided by 100 volunteers, and supported three schools.</p><p></p><p>Project Amal ou Salam is now funding three schools, one in Jarash, Jordan; one in Guvecci, Turkey; and one in Lebanon. It only costs $1,300 per month to support over 60 children in school, and provides these children the opportunity for an education. </p><p></p><p> </p><p>In March, 20 George Mason University students worked with 600 Syrian kids across Turkey in Istanbul, Gaziantep, Reyhanli, and Guvecci. This was directly followed by a 5 day workshop in Jordan for 800 kids with 30 international volunteers. </p><p>Here are some of the reflections from Lebanon 2014:</p><p></p><p>•	I was heartbroken by many things I saw on the workshop days, from kids with battle wounds (both physical disabilities and obvious emotional trauma), to the fact that many children did not want to eat their lunches as they were determined to save them for family members …. I can say after having seen this first-hand that there is hope for the future if educational, recreational and therapeutic programs such as this one continue to be supported. -  Genny, American Student</p><p></p><p>•	The biggest blessing of this work is the happiness you find yourself creating on the children’s faces. Their grins and eagerness to give you hugs and kisses and thanks – with occasional whispers of “this is the most fun I’ve had since leaving Syria” or even “this has been the best day of my life” – is truly the greatest reward that we could ask for."" Keep spreading the love! – Grace, Syrian living in Dubai</p><p></p><p>•	Especially looking at a world where conflict exists globally it was inspiring to be part of a group that has no political or religious agenda and simply wants to inspire hope and spread a positive message, which is truly refreshing. – Sandrine, Living in Geneva</p><p></p><p>In addition to these longer workshops, Project Amal ou Salam supports various informal activities for Syrian children. In 2014, they have supported activities in Idlib, Syria; sent school and art supplies to a refugee camp in Ersal, Lebanon; and hosted Eid celebrations in Suroui, Turkey for Kurdish refugees recently arrived from Kobani, Syria.</p><p></p><h1><b></b></h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433189159/nhmak9do51sckwcikim7.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 360px; height: 360px;""/></p><h3><br/></h3><h3>Schools</h3><div>
<p>Project Amal ou Salam sponsors several schools in refugee areas in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey and inside Syria, and fully funds a school in northern Jordan.</p>
<p>The Amal ou Salam school, which is administered in partnership with Fikra (a Syrian NGO in Amman) is located in a rural area outside of Jerash, Jordan, and has the capacity to serve 60 children. The school plays an important role by filling a gap in the education system: Syrian children are not allowed to enroll in Jordanian schools until they are able to pass tests at their appropriate grade level. Most Syrian children who are living as refugees in Jordan have been out of school for several years and need significant catch-up time and individualized attention to make up for the hundreds of hours of class time they have missed out on.</p>
<p>The Amal ou Salam school prepares students to pass the tests that will allow them to enter the Jordanian school system and ensures that they can perform as well as their Jordanian peers in their new classrooms. Several dozen students from the Amal ou Salam school have already successfully made the transition to public schools. We miss these outstanding scholars, but we are proud of their accomplishments and excited to welcome even more students as we expand and improve the school building to accommodate the many Syrian children in the area who do not yet qualify for public education.</p>

<b>Impact</b> – Why Your Support is Critical</h3><p>Providing a safe space for the psychosocial development of Syria’s children is crucial for the rebuilding and reconciliation processes and the future of Syrian society and is more sustainable than direct aid. When PTSD and depression are not treated in children they result in flashbacks, emotional instability, violent and aggressive behavior, nightmares, isolation and poor academic achievement. Helping the next generation cope with the trauma and tragedy of war will aid them in becoming strong, capable, and productive members of society ready to rebuild their country, which is just as essential as direct humanitarian aid. Your donation will go directly into expanding, building and developing the implementation of Project Amal ou Salam. </p><p>If you are in the U.S and would like to make a tax deductible donation please make your check out to GreaterGood.org and write “Project Amal ou Salam #65981″ in the memo line.

This is a positive energy outlet, team-building activity, and a lot of fun!•	Team/Trust-Building – Volunteers facilitate activities that introduce group collaboration, teamwork, critical thinking, problem-solving, and leadership skills such as trust falls, the human knot, relay races, Simon Says, and three legged races.•	Art – Children are introduced to activities such as “rebuild your city,” where they are asked to think about their hometowns and what sorts of things they will need in these rebuilt communities, and Peace Flags, where children design flags depicting what peace means to them. This introduces children to creative expression, critical thinking, and teamwork.•	Music – Children are introduced to rhythm and beat using the body and voices to produce music without instruments. This encourages creative self-expression, self-confidence, and listening skills.…But Project Amal ou Salam is much more than just a summer camp. In 2014, we supported over 3000 children in four different countries, were aided by 100 volunteers, and supported three schools.Project Amal ou Salam is now funding three schools, one in Jarash, Jordan; one in Guvecci, Turkey; and one in Lebanon. It only costs $1,300 per month to support over 60 children in school, and provides these children the opportunity for an education.  In March, 20 George Mason University students worked with 600 Syrian kids across Turkey in Istanbul, Gaziantep, Reyhanli, and Guvecci. This was directly followed by a 5 day workshop in Jordan for 800 kids with 30 international volunteers. Here are some of the reflections from Lebanon 2014:•	I was heartbroken by many things I saw on the workshop days, from kids with battle wounds (both physical disabilities and obvious emotional trauma), to the fact that many children did not want to eat their lunches as they were determined to save them for family members …. I can say after having seen this first-hand that there is hope for the future if educational, recreational and therapeutic programs such as this one continue to be supported. -  Genny, American Student•	The biggest blessing of this work is the happiness you find yourself creating on the children’s faces. Their grins and eagerness to give you hugs and kisses and thanks – with occasional whispers of “this is the most fun I’ve had since leaving Syria” or even “this has been the best day of my life” – is truly the greatest reward that we could ask for."" Keep spreading the love! – Grace, Syrian living in Dubai•	Especially looking at a world where conflict exists globally it was inspiring to be part of a group that has no political or religious agenda and simply wants to inspire hope and spread a positive message, which is truly refreshing. – Sandrine, Living in GenevaIn addition to these longer workshops, Project Amal ou Salam supports various informal activities for Syrian children. In 2014, they have supported activities in Idlib, Syria; sent school and art supplies to a refugee camp in Ersal, Lebanon; and hosted Eid celebrations in Suroui, Turkey for Kurdish refugees recently arrived from Kobani, Syria.Schools
Project Amal ou Salam sponsors several schools in refugee areas in Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey and inside Syria, and fully funds a school in northern Jordan.
The Amal ou Salam school, which is administered in partnership with Fikra (a Syrian NGO in Amman) is located in a rural area outside of Jerash, Jordan, and has the capacity to serve 60 children. The school plays an important role by filling a gap in the education system: Syrian children are not allowed to enroll in Jordanian schools until they are able to pass tests at their appropriate grade level. Most Syrian children who are living as refugees in Jordan have been out of school for several years and need significant catch-up time and individualized attention to make up for the hundreds of hours of class time they have missed out on.
The Amal ou Salam school prepares students to pass the tests that will allow them to enter the Jordanian school system and ensures that they can perform as well as their Jordanian peers in their new classrooms. Several dozen students from the Amal ou Salam school have already successfully made the transition to public schools. We miss these outstanding scholars, but we are proud of their accomplishments and excited to welcome even more students as we expand and improve the school building to accommodate the many Syrian children in the area who do not yet qualify for public education.

Impact – Why Your Support is CriticalProviding a safe space for the psychosocial development of Syria’s children is crucial for the rebuilding and reconciliation processes and the future of Syrian society and is more sustainable than direct aid. When PTSD and depression are not treated in children they result in flashbacks, emotional instability, violent and aggressive behavior, nightmares, isolation and poor academic achievement. Helping the next generation cope with the trauma and tragedy of war will aid them in becoming strong, capable, and productive members of society ready to rebuild their country, which is just as essential as direct humanitarian aid. Your donation will go directly into expanding, building and developing the implementation of Project Amal ou Salam.

<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b>Why we need your help!</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>We've been running in Somerville for five years.   From the beginning we've run on sliding scale, with families are encouraged to set their  price based on what they can afford.  This is a very popular option and there's obviously clear demand for it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>67% of kids in Somerville are eligible for free or reduced lunch. </b>  <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">That's almost twice the state average!   It's very unlikely that kids who are eligible for food assistance are going to be able to afford camp even at sliding scale rates.  </span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Over 50% - or 191 kids - who came to camp last summer used sliding scale. </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> 64 of those families paid under $10 a day.   That's a great start, but we still aren't reach anywhere near the number of kids we could be serving. </span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Last year, the total cost of subsidizing these slots was $64,019.</b> <span style=""font-weight: normal;""> Given that we are almost 100% participant funded, this means that the cost of these programs comes directly out of the bottom line.  </span>
</li>
</ul>
<div>If you paid full price last year, THANK YOU!    <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Without your help, we would never have been able to offer such a high number of reduced cost slots!    We're hoping to do even better this year and offer a baseline of 15 slots totally free of charge. </span><p></p>
</div>
<h3></h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3><b>Starting this year we are offering full scholarships to kids eligible for free school lunch</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our initial goal is to enroll 15 kids totally free of charge.   Scholarships are good for up to four weeks of camp, a value of $1200 per kid.    We're also hoping to expand our sliding scale program which supports reduced cost slots starting at $75/week.</p>
<p><b>Your donation will support a month of building, playing, and inventing </b>-- Parts and Crafts kids spend their summer 3D printing, building motorcars and marshmallow launchers, playing strategy games, learning to solder, learning how to sew their own costumes, folding kinetic origami, programming video games, drawing comics, and working with staff in our shop to make and invent and build.</p>
<p>It's an amazing learning experience,  and we do it on a shoestring budget for an ever-growing number of kids.   We need your help to make it a reality this summer!</p>
<br/>
<h3>Cost breakdown:</h3>
<p><b>At full price, a week of camp costs $300.   </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">An additional 15 kids will cost us approximately $18,000, which is about 2/3 of what a full-time staffer makes in a year.   </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Here's what it costs to support a kid at camp for one week: </span></p>

</div></div>","Parts and Crafts:  Make, play, build! Parts and Crafts is a kid makerspace and DIY tinkering camp based in Somerville Massachusetts.    Combined programs serve roughly 300 kids each year, the majority of whom live locally here in Somerville.   Basic principles include:  Building, making, taking stuff apart, learning by doing! Kid choice!    We offer a bunch of activities, kids choose what they work on.    Sliding scale.   Families set their price based on what they can afford.   We spend a lot of our time taking apart computers, building kid-sized hovercrafts, programming in Scratch, building, crafting, inventing, playing, and having a blast making things and exploring the world around us.   It's really fun!
   



Why we need your help!

We've been running in Somerville for five years.   From the beginning we've run on sliding scale, with families are encouraged to set their  price based on what they can afford.  This is a very popular option and there's obviously clear demand for it:


67% of kids in Somerville are eligible for free or reduced lunch.   That's almost twice the state average!   It's very unlikely that kids who are eligible for food assistance are going to be able to afford camp even at sliding scale rates.  


Over 50% - or 191 kids - who came to camp last summer used sliding scale.  64 of those families paid under $10 a day.   That's a great start, but we still aren't reach anywhere near the number of kids we could be serving. 


Last year, the total cost of subsidizing these slots was $64,019.  Given that we are almost 100% participant funded, this means that the cost of these programs comes directly out of the bottom line.  


If you paid full price last year, THANK YOU!    Without your help, we would never have been able to offer such a high number of reduced cost slots!    We're hoping to do even better this year and offer a baseline of 15 slots totally free of charge. 




Starting this year we are offering full scholarships to kids eligible for free school lunch

Our initial goal is to enroll 15 kids totally free of charge.   Scholarships are good for up to four weeks of camp, a value of $1200 per kid.    We're also hoping to expand our sliding scale program which supports reduced cost slots starting at $75/week.
Your donation will support a month of building, playing, and inventing -- Parts and Crafts kids spend their summer 3D printing, building motorcars and marshmallow launchers, playing strategy games, learning to solder, learning how to sew their own costumes, folding kinetic origami, programming video games, drawing comics, and working with staff in our shop to make and invent and build.
It's an amazing learning experience,  and we do it on a shoestring budget for an ever-growing number of kids.   We need your help to make it a reality this summer!

Cost breakdown:
At full price, a week of camp costs $300.   An additional 15 kids will cost us approximately $18,000, which is about 2/3 of what a full-time staffer makes in a year.   Here's what it costs to support a kid at camp for one week: 


Staff  (1:6 ratio):  $100
Materials:   $20
Rent + overhead:   $15
Insurance:   $15
Field trips:   $10
Snacks:  $5

Just to cover expenses for 15 kids, we would need to bring in $10,000.   We're aiming to raise at least half the cost through fundraising -- $5000 -- so we can guarantee free spots without compromising our ability to offer sliding scale.   


To put that into perspective:   The average price paid per week is around $200, but right now 20% of the kids who are *already* signed up for camp are coming for under $150/week, or just barely under what it costs to run -- and we're hoping to add 15 totally free slots on top of that.   It's a big job and we need your help!


 What happens if we don't meet our goal?   Nothing.   It's not *limited* to 15 slots, and we have never turned people people away for lack of ability to pay.   


What happens if we exceed our goal?    We throw a giant party!   More kids can come, we get to run more cool stuff, and we can take a breath and not worry about going broke trying to make it all come together.   Extra funds will either go towards additional scholarships or the $64,000  currently spent on sliding scale.
