<h2><u>Who we are!</u></h2>
<p>The Sugar Beet Food Co-op was opened in July of 2015 by 1,100 owners and families in and around Oak Park, IL.  We're a community owned grocery store, <u>open to everyone</u>, featuring local and organic products.</p>
<p>Now just the second food co-op in Chicagoland, we're working hard to spread the word on what a grocery store with soul looks like.  The Sugar Beet is about good food, supporting local growers and creating a vibrant, healthy community educated on food issues that affect them &amp; their families.</p>
<h2><u>What we need!</u></h2>
<p>We see the positive impact that food Co-ops have in their communities all over the country and are excited about bringing those values and contributions to the near west suburbs of Chicago. That starts by making sure everyone is aware of the Sugar Beet with good signage and that's where you come in.  A large sign had always been in our plans prior to opening, but we ran into a bunch of issues. Landlord, permitting, and cash shortage all kept us from getting the sign in place before we opened, but we've now removed all those barriers...except the cash.</p>
<p>We're out to build and install a beautiful, lit sign facing east and west on Madison Street for the 22,600+ cars a day that drive by our store.  As it sits now, our building can look very dark when you drive by.  To maximize space in the store we've had to put shelving and equipment up against the south wall of glass windows.  Another element is that this building is LEED Certified and has thermal energy saving blue glass windows.  We love this, but it does create a darker look and can make the building look unoccupied.  This sign will help change that and help us create more new customers and owners.  </p>
<p>We're projecting sign costs to be at $20K, with indiegogo getting 10%, so we're shooting for $22K. It sounds like a lot, but it's really just $1 per car that drives by every day.  We can do this!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><u>And what you get!</u></h2>
<p>We've got some really awesome gifts and promotions lined up for this campaign.  This isn't a charity after all, so we're trying to give some really cool stuff back for your support.  </p>

<h2><u>Other ways to Help!</u></h2>
<p>We know that not everybody has extra cash around to help us get our sign up and THAT'S OK. There are other ways to help the Sugar Beet reach it's goal.  Sharing this campaign on your social media site or page is amazing and really helps us spread the word.  And we'd be silly not to say just shopping at the Co-op really helps us raise funds for this and other great projects we're working on.  Even just getting doing some of your gift shopping at the Co-op can help.  Of course we have Gift Cards that make every food lover's holiday dreams come true. </p>
<p>Thanks so much for reading all these and helping our campaign in whatever way you can!</p>

We're out to build and install a beautiful, lit sign facing east and west on Madison Street for the 22,600+ cars a day that drive by our store.  As it sits now, our building can look very dark when you drive by.  To maximize space in the store we've had to put shelving and equipment up against the south wall of glass windows.  Another element is that this building is LEED Certified and has thermal energy saving blue glass windows.  We love this, but it does create a darker look and can make the building look unoccupied.  This sign will help change that and help us create more new customers and owners.  
We're projecting sign costs to be at $20K, with indiegogo getting 10%, so we're shooting for $22K. It sounds like a lot, but it's really just $1 per car that drives by every day.  We can do this!
 
And what you get!
We've got some really awesome gifts and promotions lined up for this campaign.  This isn't a charity after all, so we're trying to give some really cool stuff back for your support.  

Supportive Strawberry!
$15:  ""I heart my Co-op"" sticker and a shout out on Facebook/website/etc.

Other ways to Help!
We know that not everybody has extra cash around to help us get our sign up and THAT'S OK. There are other ways to help the Sugar Beet reach it's goal.  Sharing this campaign on your social media site or page is amazing and really helps us spread the word.  And we'd be silly not to say just shopping at the Co-op really helps us raise funds for this and other great projects we're working on.  Even just getting doing some of your gift shopping at the Co-op can help.  Of course we have Gift Cards that make every food lover's holiday dreams come true. 
Thanks so much for reading all these and helping our campaign in whatever way you can!

<p>Hello, this is Michael Lavery and
Antonio Appling and we are starting a breakfast restaurant called, ""The
Nest!"" </p>
<p><b>Background</b></p>
<p>Antonio was teaching high school in the
inner city in Los Angeles for the last 6 years while Michael was working various
management jobs in the food service industry in San Francisco.  <br/></p>
<p>We have a common love for food and
people that started in 2006 at the Olive Garden in San Francisco.  Fast-forward
to 2014 and we now have an opportunity to open up a space that will serve good
food, to even better people like you. Sounds easy enough. The cost to open a
restaurant (even a small one) is tremendous, and after going to college, the
last thing we want is more high interest debt. With your help we can get The
Nest off the ground and start contributing to the community through food and
service. If we cannot pull our people together around this idea, it might stay
just that…an idea. </p>
<p>We have extensive experience in the
industry, from chain restaurant management, trendy hotel restaurant management,
to local neighborhood eateries and nationally recognized neighborhood markets. </p>
<p>There is no going back, we quit our
jobs and moved from afar to make this dream a reality. But we need your genuine
help. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>In order to get our doors open and keep them open we need
$30,000. </p>
<p>That sounds like a lot, but remember,
you only have to contribute what you can. There is no doubt that there is
someone who could give the whole amount, but we believe this effort will be
championed by everyday folks giving out of the overflow of their hearts. We
would not ask for money if we didn't need it and we waited months before
starting this campaign because we were scared no one would give, or that our
friends and family would feel imposed upon. Well, a closed mouth doesn't get
fed and people can't bless what they don't know exists. We have both had
experiences where we had the resources to help a loved one but didn't find out
until it was too late that they needed help.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal the funds
will still go towards to paying our rent, paying our employees, keeping the lights
on and initial food costs, but we will have to push a little harder to
accomplish our goal.</p>
<p><br/>
 We have some awesome Gifts/Perks to offer you when you chose to invest
from naming your own dish, to free food and drinks.* </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The Nest has an opportunity to offer community through food
in an area that desires change. Bellflower is currently devoid of a thoughtful
breakfast spot. Imagine driving down Alondra Blvd and knowing that you played a
vital role in building up a community. Even better, imagine coming in for
breakfast and knowing that you have legit ownership in The Nest! </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We know that some people just cannot contribute.
Don't be discouraged. You can still help. Please post our link on your page, or

<p><strong>1)</strong> Bushwick is home to a number of designers, artisans, and makers. Right now there is no local venue to showcase all of the furniture and other designs created in Bushwick.  As a person who loves furniture I really appreciate good design and would really like other people to be exposed to it too.  I’ve seen some stunning work done in Bushwick and once you’ve seen it, I think you’ll agree. </p>
<p><img alt=""Model D by Rutledge Radio.  Available as a Perk!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thisiskerf.com/_img/rutledgeradioco/rutledgeradioco_model_d_2.jpeg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Model D by Rutledge Radio.  Available as a Perk!""/></p>
<p><strong>2)</strong>For better or worse a large part of the changes that have been going on in Bushwick has come in the form of bars and restaurants opening.  In fact 11 bars have opened here in the last 6 months.  In order for a neighborhood to really grow we need more than just bars and restaurants.</p>
<p><img alt=""Ponte by Hackett Design"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thisiskerf.com/indiegogo/Ponte_comp.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ponte  by Hackett Design""/></p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> There is a lot of construction going on here too.  Apartments are being renovated at a fast rate, and new buildings are going up all the time.  More people are moving here all the time- a creative class of people that will need furniture and other housewares to decorate their new living space.  Their option now? Ikea.  And Ikea is well…Ikea.  Not to mention the closest one is on the other side of Brooklyn.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Andy by Kahokia.  Available as a Perk!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thisiskerf.com/_img/db/kahokia_manity.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Andy by Kahokia  Available as a Perk!""/> </p>
<p><strong>My Story</strong>:  After graduating four years ago with a degree in Furniture Design, I moved back to NY and started working in Bushwick.  At the time I was honestly surprised to be working in Bushwick.  The neighborhood didn’t have the best reputation.  But I could quickly see a neighborhood in transition.  I now live in Bushwick and in the four years I’ve been back, I have to say there are some pretty amazing changes going on here. </p>
<p><strong>This is where KERF comes in.</strong>  KERF will add to the neighborhood as a showcase of local culture, providing a place to buy some brilliant furniture and giving the opportunity to local designers to grow their business.</p>
<p><strong>Why we need your money:</strong><strong> <img alt=""Knote by Hackett Design"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thisiskerf.com/_img/hd/hackett_design_knote_chair.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Knote by Hackett Design""/></strong></p>
<p>Right now KERF is moving from an esoteric idea to an actualized storefront.  We’ll use the donations to secure a physical location in Bushwick.  It will also allow us to get on our feet, pay for advertising, and aid with other business expenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The best part: THE PERKS!</strong></p>
<p>One of the coolest things about donating to KERF is the awesome furniture and products we have available.  <strong>Scroll down to see what we have to offer.</strong> We’ve profiled some of the local designers that will have their pieces for sale at KERF once we open.  Eleonora Zorzi, Kahokia, Rutledge Radio, and SAW have been cool enough to help the campaign by offering a few of their pieces as incentives for donations to KERF.  I know some of these prices seem high, but remember you are donating to a worthy cause and I want to get these designers top dollar for their participation. (Please note that international shipping rates may increase cost)</p>

<p>Model D by Rutledge Radio.  Locally Designed and Built. Your perk for $500 </p>
<p>The Model D is a self contained, amplified speaker unit with an 1/8"" (3.5mm) auxiliary input compatible with smart phones, iPods, tablets, laptops, etc... Designed as a reaction to mass-produced plastic iPod docks and clumsy computer speakers, our speaker units are constructed of domestic walnut hardwoods with traditional box joints, bone knobs and linen speaker cloth. The emphasis is on natural materials and longevity of the product. The most sustainable design is one where the materials are renewable, the aesthetics are timeless, and the product is well made. <img alt=""Andy by Kahokia.

Andy holds up to four watch logs or four pairs of sunglasses. The elegant and simple ""Watch Log"" is sold separately and holds up to 3 male wrist watches. Please note contents are for illustration purposes. 16""W x 14""H x 4""D.  Clear pine with a light natural stained finish. </p>

<p> </p></div>","Why Bushwick needs KERF:
1) Bushwick is home to a number of designers, artisans, and makers. Right now there is no local venue to showcase all of the furniture and other designs created in Bushwick.  As a person who loves furniture I really appreciate good design and would really like other people to be exposed to it too.  I’ve seen some stunning work done in Bushwick and once you’ve seen it, I think you’ll agree. 

2)For better or worse a large part of the changes that have been going on in Bushwick has come in the form of bars and restaurants opening.  In fact 11 bars have opened here in the last 6 months.  In order for a neighborhood to really grow we need more than just bars and restaurants.

3) There is a lot of construction going on here too.  Apartments are being renovated at a fast rate, and new buildings are going up all the time.  More people are moving here all the time- a creative class of people that will need furniture and other housewares to decorate their new living space.  Their option now? Ikea.  And Ikea is well…Ikea.  Not to mention the closest one is on the other side of Brooklyn.
  
My Story:  After graduating four years ago with a degree in Furniture Design, I moved back to NY and started working in Bushwick.  At the time I was honestly surprised to be working in Bushwick.  The neighborhood didn’t have the best reputation.  But I could quickly see a neighborhood in transition.  I now live in Bushwick and in the four years I’ve been back, I have to say there are some pretty amazing changes going on here. 
This is where KERF comes in.  KERF will add to the neighborhood as a showcase of local culture, providing a place to buy some brilliant furniture and giving the opportunity to local designers to grow their business.
Why we need your money: 
Right now KERF is moving from an esoteric idea to an actualized storefront.  We’ll use the donations to secure a physical location in Bushwick.  It will also allow us to get on our feet, pay for advertising, and aid with other business expenses.
 
The best part: THE PERKS!
One of the coolest things about donating to KERF is the awesome furniture and products we have available.  Scroll down to see what we have to offer. We’ve profiled some of the local designers that will have their pieces for sale at KERF once we open.  Eleonora Zorzi, Kahokia, Rutledge Radio, and SAW have been cool enough to help the campaign by offering a few of their pieces as incentives for donations to KERF.  I know some of these prices seem high, but remember you are donating to a worthy cause and I want to get these designers top dollar for their participation. (Please note that international shipping rates may increase cost)

Model D by Rutledge Radio.  Locally Designed and Built. Your perk for $500 
The Model D is a self contained, amplified speaker unit with an 1/8"" (3.5mm) auxiliary input compatible with smart phones, iPods, tablets, laptops, etc... Designed as a reaction to mass-produced plastic iPod docks and clumsy computer speakers, our speaker units are constructed of domestic walnut hardwoods with traditional box joints, bone knobs and linen speaker cloth. The emphasis is on natural materials and longevity of the product. The most sustainable design is one where the materials are renewable, the aesthetics are timeless, and the product is well made. 
Andy by Kahokia.  Locally Designed and Built.  A perk for $200  Soon to be offered by Kerf, Andy is the 4 tier wall vanity from the Manity line by Kahokia.  Andy includes an elegant side mirror and each cubby is large enough to store a ""Watch Log"", sunglasses (including a bulky case) or any other accessories you see fit. Andy holds up to four watch logs or four pairs of sunglasses. The elegant and simple ""Watch Log"" is sold separately and holds up to 3 male wrist watches. Please note contents are for illustration purposes. 16""W x 14""H x 4""D.  Clear pine with a light natural stained finish. 

Gatsby Table by SAW.  Loacally designed and built.  Yours for $1200 
The Gatsby Dining table is a hand built composition repurposed wood (varies on supply) and a hand welded steel frame. It has a powder-coated finish is (shown in MINT but many colors available) and adjustable feet. Easy assembly required (ten screws). 60""L x 30""W x 30""H, overall

The No. 007 Shelf by HackettDesign.  Locally Designed and Built.  Your Perk for $100 
Inspired by the art of Mondrian and the mystique or the golden ration, No. 007 structures FSC Certified plywood into a clean geometric composition. Ideal for books, glasses, or to bring order to whatever chaos surrounds you. Available in your choice of 3 backboard colors: daphne blue, lipstick red, or pale chartreuse. (shown in maroon).

<h3>Summary</h3>
I was struck by the news and video capture of a blatant abuse of power (by the rich) over the very poor.  Inspired by the campaign of the bullied bus monitor in upstate New York, while seeing the video reminded me that the inequality and human abuse tolerated in Philippine society is very real - it is not far from the dehumanization experienced in the deep south in the early 1900s - they exist today in the Philippines.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
The victim is Saturnino Fabros - a poor Traffic Enforcer who seems to be just doing his job, poor, humble and helpless when assaulted by a big rich bully.  A dollar in Manila will go a long way, I'd like to raise $500.00 for his family and more importantly, to make a statement.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
To make a statement and raise awareness among the Filipinos (and other societies in the world that live amidst inequality and abuse, where human rights is non-existent and the rich has free to reign to bully the weak and the poor. It is time to relinquish the chains of Spanish colonialism that has plagued us Filipinos for centuries and morph'ed into this very disgusting manifestation of self-entitled bully phenomenon. <br/><br/>A small token for the victim, will hopefully bring us a step closer to social change.</div>

<p><em><strong><strong>UPDATE 10/24/12 @ 1:25 pm</strong></strong></em></p>
<p>HEEEEY YOOOOOU GUUUYS!!</p>
<p>This is huge news!!! I had a long talk with Katie Gonzalez, the Executive Director of the service dog organization that we are working with. She was completely overcome with joy and gratitude for what all of you have done, not just for me, but for others. You have given her renewed faith of the good in people.</p>
<p>I asked her who of the people waiting to receive a service dog are the most in need of a service dog and quickly. We talked about two of the most disabled people and how much they really need the assistance.</p>
<p>One of them is a young woman named Jessica, she has cerebral palsy and related syndromes and is a quadriplegic. She was also diagnosed with leukemia in 2010 and is now in remission. She has dedicated her life to cerebral palsy research funding, cancer research funding, and turning pediatric oncology units from drab hospital floors to ""rainforests"". Even with her challenges, she gives to others freely. She has been waiting a very long time for a service dog and has essentially run out of people who can help by donating, and since she rarely gets out, her network is small.</p>
<p>Here's the best part:</p>
<p>I get to call Jessica and tell her that <strong>SHE IS GETTING HER SERVICE DOG...NOW!!!</strong></p>
<p>YOU donated enough money to make this happen for her! Right now! You are giving her a miracle. I am so grateful.</p>
<p><em><strong>AND</strong></em></p>
<p>There is another girl, Kathleen, a spunky, loving girl. She's also a teenager with permanent brain disorders and serious mobility challenges. <strong>The amount of money you raised will not only get Jessica her dog, but will put Kathleen within $2,500.00 from getting her service dog!</strong> I will be calling her next week to give her this great news as well.</p>
<p>What all of you who donated have done is nothing short of a miracle. Your kindness and generosity is touching people's lives and filling their hearts. You all had the trainers in tears last night. You made a huge difference in my life and so many others.</p>
<p>I will never be able to thank you enough, but I will live my life trying. I promise. I love you turkeys. I really really love you.</p>
<p>P.S. If you didn't donate, but would like to help get Kathleen to her goal sooner, you can donate through my IndieGoGo page that Amy, Kate, and Mare set up. If we could get Kathleen her dog too <em><strong>(putting this campaign at $20,702)</strong></em>, just think of the incredible impact your generosity would have on them. On the world, really.</p>
<p>As ever, <br/>I'll eat you up I love you so. xo<br/>-Sara Santiago</p>
<p>♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥</p>
<p><em><strong><strong>UPDATE 10/23/12 @ 8:45 am</strong></strong></em></p>
<p>Many people have asked if they can still donate on behalf of the other disabled people waiting to receive the service dogs that they need so desperately. Four of them are small children. If you wish to help, you can donate through this campaign - everything raised above what is needed for Sara will be donated directly to the children on the waiting list. Many of them are not blessed with Sara's amazing community of kind and generous human beings. Love you. xo</p>

After completing the application process, Sara and her extended family participated in an interview with the organization, and she was accepted into the program. </p>
<p>A Seizure and Mobility Assistance Dog will keep Sara safe both during and after a seizure. It will be trained to alert someone nearby or to use a specialized ""phone"" to dial a pre-programmed number if she is alone, and bring her its special vest that may hold a prepaid cell phone, medication and anything else Sara might need. The dog will also be trained to keep Sara from physically putting herself in an unsafe situation. (It is possible for Sara to continue walking during certain types of seizures, albeit in an altered state of consciousness.) It will be able to assist her in getting up from a lying down or seated position, help to stabilize her when she is having a bad balance day, and will be trained to retrieve things for her, should she be too weak to do it on her own.</p>

<h2>SAVE LAGU!!</h2>
<strong>Lagu James</strong> is a very sweet, gentle, and friendly 19 year old orphan and personal friend of mine who is currently suffering from health complications of all different kinds; chronic Hepatitus B, Cirrhosis of the liver, as well as bacterial infections and blood blisters  in his esophagus which have recently started bursting and causing him to throw up copious amounts of blood and jello-ey chunks of god knows what, requiring multiple blood transfusions. You can help  save his life without even giving blood!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>He needs a specific kind of treatment called Sclerotherapy, which impacts the blood vessels, and costs an estimated 2,000 USD.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lagu lives at Cornerstone orphanage in Nimule, South Sudan, which is where I had the pleasure of getting to know him. However the hospitals there are insufficient to meet his needs, and he would need to be transported to Kampala, Uganda, for treatment.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3,000 dollars is my estimate to cover the 2,000 dollar treatment plus travel and hospital expenses, but any and all donations are greatly needed and appreciated, as Lagu seems to encounter one health problem after another.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lagu is very special to me, and everybody else at Cornerstone. He has an extraordinary ability to brighten up the compound with his mile-wide smile that greets you as you approach him. I even told him he does not look like Lagu unless he is smiling. He is very compassionate, keeping an eye out for others and asking everybody how they are doing even while he was lying prostrate and helpless on the hospital bed. My words cannot do justice to his character. Help us give him the treatment he needs! If anyone deserves to live a full, happy life, it is someone like Lagu.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lagu means so much to me and the people around him, so if you can contribute ANYTHING, or just spread the word to those who can, I will personally be very grateful. And it will save his life. Thank you so much!</div>

<h3>What is this about?</h3>
<p>Janela Sagynbaeva is 24, she's a girl from a village in east Kyrgyzstan. <b>She has to pay a family debt wich is way beyond her financial means.</b> Today, nearly all her time and resources are focused on that effort.</p>
<p>The debt that has accumulated is the result of an unfortunate event.</p>
<p>Janela's Father has been selling fruits in Kazakhstan. The fruits he was selling were not only his but also those of his neighbours. He was supposed to collect and bring back the money to be shared among the villagers. When going back with the money, he was robbed at gunpoint.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the neighbours requested their money no matter what, hence a <b>$5000</b> debt. The event had occurend in 1997; since then, through various interest rates and further credits, the debt has risen to <b>$15,000</b>. The current <b>interest rate</b> is <b>13%</b> which makes it hard for the family to pay the percentage, let alone the initial sum.</p>
<h3>What are the consequences?</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The first and least of all consequences is that Janela had to <b>abandon her high school education</b>. She will use that time to work for the debt. Then she threw away her dreams of singing. No one is saying she would become a famous singer but everyone is entitled to have a dream, a hobby and to pursue it. No singing lessons, all the money she earns goes to the black hole of debt. And while she's at it she abandoned all her remaining dreams as well.<br/>
</li>
<li>She's not going to get married because in Kyrgyzstan, <b>a wife earns money for her husband's family and not her own</b>. It gets worse. Being a single at 24 is considered shameful, especially in the rural areas and the social pressure on Janela is enormous. Besides insults, <b>she risks bridenapping</b>, a custom which consists to kidnap a girl and force her into marriage. In spite of being unlawful this tradition is still common and Janela was already kidnapped once; she managed to call the police and escape.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>She's working 13 hours a day</b> in Bishkek (capital of Kyrgyzstan) in a sewing factory in very poor conditions.<br/>
</li>
<li>When she's not working in Kyrgyzstan, she's working in Siberia, Tomsk region as a salesperson. At her workplace, <b>sexual harassment is common</b> and she isn't exempt from it.<br/>
</li>
<li>Her brother is working on construction sites in Russia in poor conditions also and without security measures.<br/>
</li>
<li>If it all wasn't enough, <b>her mother got ill</b>, at first from too much stress. It has now gotten serious, she has suffered two heart attacks. Her medicine is also costing money.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>There are no NGOs helping or that could help besides their abundant numbers in the country. The burocracy involved when seeking official help is endless, expensive and uneffective. There are NGOs for teaching english, new technologies in agriculture but few of them touch the sharks of the banking system.</p>
<p>This page is the <b>main, only and last resort for Janela</b> and her family. If this fails, there is <b>no alternative</b>, there is <b>no plan B</b>. Their house will be seized and they will be on the street or worse. Either way, <i>it will be the end for them</i>.</p>
<p>There is no help from the state like in some european countries for people who are poor, destitute or homeless. There is nothing in the most literal and pure sense of the word.</p>
<p><i>I can attest from my own experience, I have seen Janela running arround borrowing money from her friends, trying to gather the remaining $200 for the month's interest. I have seen her getting refused everywhere, running from place to place in high heels because she didn't even had time to change from the job interviews. I have gathered these first $200 through a quick donation page on my blog and we sent the money merely 30 minutes before the bank's deadline. If the donations were not be there, the house was seized. That's right, for 200 dollars.</i></p>
<p><b>This is not abstract, this is not in 10 years, this is happening now.</b></p>
<h3>Is this a scam?</h3>
<p>From my perspective, this question makes me want to throw up. When I'm watching Janela killing herself at work, when we're running accross Bishkek to give the money to the bank to meet a monthly deadline for payment and I hear this kind of doubt, I just feel <i>despair</i>. Despair from the contrast between the ease of doubt on one end and the disastrous consequence on the other.</p>
<p>But I have been travelling for a long time, I have lost much of the western doubt. Doubt is in our culture and it is not a bad trait, on the contrary. Unfortunately, it is hard to lift a doubt just by writing. So I'll say this. My story is hard to prove but if you read something about central asia you will find it more likely. Actually, Janela is not the only person in that situation, she told me herself. A lot of girls sewing side to side do it because of credit in a bank. <b>But Janela is one that I want to help because I have got to know that person and I believe that she, of all people, deserves a shot at life.</b></p>
<p><i>I, myself am from western europe, France to be more precise. I have been travelling for four months now, by hitchhiking from Prague (Czech Republic) to Kamchatka (eastern Russia). My way of travelling is very low budget (maximum of 2 euros/day, actually it is more 1$/day now). I don't live in hotels or hostels, I don't pay for transportation, I rely on the help of people. For that reason, I often get closer to the culture than mass tourists do. I get to meet a lot of different people, learn the local language and some of the local customs. My stories can be read on <a href=""http://takemeeast.net/blog/."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://takemeeast.net/blog/.</a> I have met Janela because she has helped me way before I knew about her financial problems. She has hosted me at the risk of going against a strong local tradition (an unmarried girl beeing seen with a foreigner is very wrong and it's even worse if she brings him to her family's house) and has never asked money from me.</i></p>
<p>If you want additional information about me or Janela's situation, I'm a very easy person to find online. You can reach me either on my website: <a href=""http://takemeeast.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://takemeeast.net</a> or my facebook page, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/takemeeast/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/takemeeast/</a>.</p>
<h3>What is your money for?</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>paying the static sum of <b>$15,000</b>
</li>
<li>paying the monthly interests so the house isn't seized</li>
<li>giving Janela some free time she could spend not working. I'm not talking holiday on the beach, I'm talking about easing her 13 hour/day rhytm so she can have friends and see her family a bit!<br/>
</li>
<li>expenses for Janela's mother's health<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h3>The whole story </h3>
<p style="""">This is an excerpt from my travel blog all of which you can read here: <a href=""http://takemeeast.net/blog/janelas-tragedy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://takemeeast.net/blog/janelas-tragedy/</a></p>
<p>In 1997, Janela and her family lived a fairly happy life. Her parents were farmers as they are now, with a garden, horses, cows and sheep. Father even had a car. Thanks to his car, Father could sell fruits and vegetables a little further, he could even sell them to Kazakhstan!</p>
<p>Since he has a car, why not share it with the neighbours? That's how Father ended up driving his truck all the way to Kazakhstan with a friend of his. Inside the truck, all the fruits and vegetables from his friends and neighbours, about ten people in total.</p>
<p>Business was a success; they were returning from Astana (capital of Kazakhstan) with about 5000 U.S. dollars in cash.</p>

<p>Janela remembers what he then told his kidnappers:</p>

<p>As weird as it may seem to most of my readers, few people from the village cared about his story and they all wanted their money back. And Father kept his promise, he gave back every penny.

<p>It became soon obvious that the poor fruit and vegetable family business won't be enough to cover the debts. And believe me, banks in Kyrgyzstan have a lot in common with sharks. You don't want to be in their debt. That is why Father had to borrow money from another bank, to give the money back to the first bank.</p>
<p>After a while, he had to borrow from a private person for as high as 50%. Nowadays, the family is nowhere near paying back even the interests, let alone the initial sum. As a result, the debt has soared up to 15,000 dollars which is a sum they just cannot afford.</p>
<p>Father has faced the catastrophe bravely but always honestly. He has sold his <b>sheep</b>, his <b>cows</b>, his car and his <b>horses</b>. He has sold <b>all 4 hectars of his land</b>. His <b>house serves as a guarantee</b> for the bank and therefore it may be siezed.</p>
<p>His children have grown up, two of them have married. They have their own families to care about. Two of them work in russia, desperately trying to pay back the family debt. Janela is one of them.

<p>Her brother works at a construction site and I am not even starting about the security conditions of such jobs in this region.</p>
<p>This is not enough and they all know it. They are strong people so they keep working and keep hope. But sometimes it is too much.

</div></span></div>","What is this about?
Janela Sagynbaeva is 24, she's a girl from a village in east Kyrgyzstan. She has to pay a family debt wich is way beyond her financial means. Today, nearly all her time and resources are focused on that effort.
The debt that has accumulated is the result of an unfortunate event.
Janela's Father has been selling fruits in Kazakhstan. The fruits he was selling were not only his but also those of his neighbours. He was supposed to collect and bring back the money to be shared among the villagers. When going back with the money, he was robbed at gunpoint.
Unfortunately, the neighbours requested their money no matter what, hence a $5000 debt. The event had occurend in 1997; since then, through various interest rates and further credits, the debt has risen to $15,000. The current interest rate is 13% which makes it hard for the family to pay the percentage, let alone the initial sum.
What are the consequences?


The first and least of all consequences is that Janela had to abandon her high school education. She will use that time to work for the debt. Then she threw away her dreams of singing. No one is saying she would become a famous singer but everyone is entitled to have a dream, a hobby and to pursue it. No singing lessons, all the money she earns goes to the black hole of debt. And while she's at it she abandoned all her remaining dreams as well.

She's not going to get married because in Kyrgyzstan, a wife earns money for her husband's family and not her own. It gets worse. Being a single at 24 is considered shameful, especially in the rural areas and the social pressure on Janela is enormous. Besides insults, she risks bridenapping, a custom which consists to kidnap a girl and force her into marriage. In spite of being unlawful this tradition is still common and Janela was already kidnapped once; she managed to call the police and escape.


She's working 13 hours a day in Bishkek (capital of Kyrgyzstan) in a sewing factory in very poor conditions.

When she's not working in Kyrgyzstan, she's working in Siberia, Tomsk region as a salesperson. At her workplace, sexual harassment is common and she isn't exempt from it.

Her brother is working on construction sites in Russia in poor conditions also and without security measures.

If it all wasn't enough, her mother got ill, at first from too much stress. It has now gotten serious, she has suffered two heart attacks. Her medicine is also costing money.



There are no NGOs helping or that could help besides their abundant numbers in the country. The burocracy involved when seeking official help is endless, expensive and uneffective. There are NGOs for teaching english, new technologies in agriculture but few of them touch the sharks of the banking system.
This page is the main, only and last resort for Janela and her family. If this fails, there is no alternative, there is no plan B. Their house will be seized and they will be on the street or worse. Either way, it will be the end for them.
There is no help from the state like in some european countries for people who are poor, destitute or homeless. There is nothing in the most literal and pure sense of the word.
I can attest from my own experience, I have seen Janela running arround borrowing money from her friends, trying to gather the remaining $200 for the month's interest. I have seen her getting refused everywhere, running from place to place in high heels because she didn't even had time to change from the job interviews. I have gathered these first $200 through a quick donation page on my blog and we sent the money merely 30 minutes before the bank's deadline. If the donations were not be there, the house was seized. That's right, for 200 dollars.
This is not abstract, this is not in 10 years, this is happening now.
Is this a scam?
From my perspective, this question makes me want to throw up. When I'm watching Janela killing herself at work, when we're running accross Bishkek to give the money to the bank to meet a monthly deadline for payment and I hear this kind of doubt, I just feel despair. Despair from the contrast between the ease of doubt on one end and the disastrous consequence on the other.
But I have been travelling for a long time, I have lost much of the western doubt. Doubt is in our culture and it is not a bad trait, on the contrary. Unfortunately, it is hard to lift a doubt just by writing. So I'll say this. My story is hard to prove but if you read something about central asia you will find it more likely. Actually, Janela is not the only person in that situation, she told me herself. A lot of girls sewing side to side do it because of credit in a bank. But Janela is one that I want to help because I have got to know that person and I believe that she, of all people, deserves a shot at life.
I, myself am from western europe, France to be more precise. I have been travelling for four months now, by hitchhiking from Prague (Czech Republic) to Kamchatka (eastern Russia). My way of travelling is very low budget (maximum of 2 euros/day, actually it is more 1$/day now). I don't live in hotels or hostels, I don't pay for transportation, I rely on the help of people. For that reason, I often get closer to the culture than mass tourists do. I get to meet a lot of different people, learn the local language and some of the local customs. My stories can be read on http://takemeeast.net/blog/. I have met Janela because she has helped me way before I knew about her financial problems. She has hosted me at the risk of going against a strong local tradition (an unmarried girl beeing seen with a foreigner is very wrong and it's even worse if she brings him to her family's house) and has never asked money from me.
If you want additional information about me or Janela's situation, I'm a very easy person to find online. You can reach me either on my website: http://takemeeast.net or my facebook page, http://www.facebook.com/takemeeast/.
What is your money for?


paying the static sum of $15,000

paying the monthly interests so the house isn't seized
giving Janela some free time she could spend not working. I'm not talking holiday on the beach, I'm talking about easing her 13 hour/day rhytm so she can have friends and see her family a bit!

expenses for Janela's mother's health



The whole story 
This is an excerpt from my travel blog all of which you can read here: http://takemeeast.net/blog/janelas-tragedy/
In 1997, Janela and her family lived a fairly happy life. Her parents were farmers as they are now, with a garden, horses, cows and sheep. Father even had a car. Thanks to his car, Father could sell fruits and vegetables a little further, he could even sell them to Kazakhstan!
Since he has a car, why not share it with the neighbours? That's how Father ended up driving his truck all the way to Kazakhstan with a friend of his. Inside the truck, all the fruits and vegetables from his friends and neighbours, about ten people in total.
Business was a success; they were returning from Astana (capital of Kazakhstan) with about 5000 U.S. dollars in cash.
On the way back, they were stopped and assaulted by thieves. In the steppes of Kazakhstan, organised crime is common; we heard about it first hand when we were there. They beat up Father's friend and took Father to the forest. They took all his money and were about to gun him down.
Janela remembers what he then told his kidnappers:
""I know you can kill me; but if you do; the youngest of my five children will never remember me.""
They let him live, maybe because, as we learned in Kazakhstan, even bandits live by a certain code.
When Father returned to his village without the money, he lost all respect from his friends and even from his family.
""Here, if you have nothing, you are not a person."", Janela explains. His own brother abandonned him.
As weird as it may seem to most of my readers, few people from the village cared about his story and they all wanted their money back. And Father kept his promise, he gave back every penny. But at his own expense: he borrowed the sum from a bank. In a country like Kyrgyzstan, $5000 is more than a four year salary. The bank accepted to do him credit but only at the dangerously high percentage of about 13%.
It became soon obvious that the poor fruit and vegetable family business won't be enough to cover the debts. And believe me, banks in Kyrgyzstan have a lot in common with sharks. You don't want to be in their debt. That is why Father had to borrow money from another bank, to give the money back to the first bank.
After a while, he had to borrow from a private person for as high as 50%. Nowadays, the family is nowhere near paying back even the interests, let alone the initial sum. As a result, the debt has soared up to 15,000 dollars which is a sum they just cannot afford.
Father has faced the catastrophe bravely but always honestly. He has sold his sheep, his cows, his car and his horses. He has sold all 4 hectars of his land. His house serves as a guarantee for the bank and therefore it may be siezed.
His children have grown up, two of them have married. They have their own families to care about. Two of them work in russia, desperately trying to pay back the family debt. Janela is one of them. She sells fruits in Russia with an asshole boss who wants to sleep with her. In europe this would be called sexual harassment, nothing less.
Her brother works at a construction site and I am not even starting about the security conditions of such jobs in this region.
This is not enough and they all know it. They are strong people so they keep working and keep hope. But sometimes it is too much. Mother couldn't take the stress anymore, she became very sick and suffered two heart attacks. Everyone is very worried even though they try to hide it. Sometimes it's too much for Janela too. She didn't notice me when I woke up in the morning. I saw her silently praying in her room. I am not one too receptive to emotions but I could feel the desperation in the act.
I know that she needs help, that her hope is a leaking bottle, that she won't hold forever. I don't want her to destroy herself like her mother did. And there are just 15,000 dollars, stupid pieces of paper that separate her from a happy life.

<p>Presence Security expands on Presence to deliver a complete security solution for your home and mobile lifestyle that is convenient and flexible. Go out in the world and do your thing and let Presence Security keep a watchful eye on the things you care about most.</p>
<p>Plus, Presence Security makes neighborhood watch mobile and available anywhere. Invite your trusted circle of family, friends, and neighbors to help protect your home and loved ones when you are on vacation, sleeping, or simply away from home.</p>
<p>Here's how it works. Say you're going on vacation and plan to disconnect for awhile. First, invite someone using the friends list in Presence and grant them access to the alerts from your home while you're in ""Vacation"" mode. Then when you switch into Vacation mode, your alerts will be automatically shared with the people you've selected, so they can stop by and have a look when you can't.</p>

<p>Crime is a serious problem everywhere. In 2013, there was $4.5 Billion in property losses from crime, and 74% of that was from residential burglaries. Let's face it, anyone can fall victim to crime at anytime. But securing your mobile lifestyle might be even more important. We're talking about like seeing if your kids get home safely, making sure your garage door is closed, and seeing if your pet's water dish is empty all from your smartphone from anywhere. Do all this and more with Presence Security. Many folks have already paid the big bucks for traditional security systems to protect themselves. Get even better protection with Presence Security for much less.</p>
<p>Protect the people and things you love most. That's why we built Presence to give anyone with a spare device a chance to protect their home and loved ones absolutely FREE. Here are just a few of the many stories that Presence users have shared with us:</p>

<hr/>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h1>
<p><b>Q: How easy is it to install Presence Security?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> Extremely easy.
</p><ol>
<li>Download the Presence app to your smartphone and sign in.</li>
<li>Tap the ""Add Device"" button and scan the QR code on the back of your gateway.  Plug your gateway into ethernet and USB power.  A video plays in the app showing what to do next, which also puts the gateway into pairing mode.</li>
<li>Pull the battery tab on a sensor and wait for 10 seconds.  The sensor will pair automatically to the gateway, and you will be asked to give it a name.</li>
<li>Peel off the sticky backing on the sensor and place it where you want it to go.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: How many sensors can a single gateway support?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> 25</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I add multiple gateways to my home?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> Absolutely.  Your Presence app supports unlimited devices and gateways.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can you add ZigBee or Z-Wave Sensors, or just ""Presence"" Sensors?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> The current gateway supports ZigBee Green Power and ZigBee Home Automation, and can connect many different types of devices that already exist in the market.  The Presence app layers the UI's and rules on top of those devices, so new devices are usually brought into the app under careful quality assurance to offer the best experience for our users.  The Presence app, and the FabrUX cloud software that powers it, connects to many other devices, clouds, and protocols.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the wireless range of the sensors?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> Our range testing shows about 2-3x the performance of WiFi.  We are consistently seeing about 130+ feet indoors, through 4 walls.  In the same test, WiFi connected about 30-60 feet through 2 walls.</p>
<p><b>Q: What is the lifetime of the batteries?  What type of batteries?  Does the motion sensor need to be connected to a power source?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> The sensors are extremely low power and are expected to last 2 - 5 years on batteries, depending on use.  Most sensors use a CR2032 Lithium coin cell battery, which makes them small and unobtrusive and has a shelf life of 10+ years.  The motion sensor users 2x AA batteries.</p>
<p>See <a href=""http://www.edn.com/design/power-management/4421334/2/Long-Live-Coin-Cells--Getting-years-of-battery-life-from-small-batteries-in-low-power-devices"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.edn.com/design/power-management/4421334/2/Long-Live-Coin-Cells--Getting-years-of-battery-life-from-small-batteries-in-low-power-devices</a></p>
<p><b>Q: Will I be able to purchase individual sensors?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> Yes.  We will be offering sensors available for individual purchase on the Presence store at <a href=""http://presencepro.com/store."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://presencepro.com/store.</a></p>
<p><b>Q: In the video you show an old smartphone as a camera, but I don't see a smartphone included in the Presence Security packs?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> Presence can transform old smartphones and tablets into free Internet security cameras.  It's optional, and you'll have to provide your own.  This works on iPhone 3GS and newer, iPad 2 and newer, iPod Touch 4th and 5th generation, and Android 4.0 and newer.  Used smartphones capable of running as a Presence camera can be found on Amazon.com for less than $40, no cellular service is required.  You can do this right now by searching for 'webcam' and downloading the Presence app on the app store.</p>
<p><b>Q: In the video, what is that robotic mount that holds the camera?  Is it required?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> This is an optional add-on to Presence, called a Motrr Galileo.  It is not required.  It can be purchased directly on the Presence Store at <a href=""http://presencepro.com/store/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://presencepro.com/store/</a></p>
<p><b>Q: Can the Presence app installed on your primary phone detect when you leave the house and automatically arm all the sensors?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> Yes, we are in the process of adding Geofencing to Presence.  This feature will first be available on iOS, and then on Android.</p>
<p><b>Q: Any plans for a siren?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> Yes!  The Presence camera features a built-in siren.  Create a rule like, ""If my 'Front door' opens and I am away, then make my 'Presence cam' activate the alarm.""  When triggered, the alarm will go off at maximum volume, and won't exit until a valid password is typed in to the app.  If you just want an audible alert in the background whenever someone opens the door for example, you can also make your camera beep once, beep twice, or beep three times instead of sounding the alarm. </p>
<p><b>Q: Can you connect any wireless video camera to this system?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> At this time Presence only supports the free Presence camera, by turning a spare smartphone or tablet into a free Internet security camera.  If we achieve our stretch goals, we'll be adding connected IP cameras to the mix.</p>
<p><b>Q: I'm a developer.  Can I connect my own gadgets to Presence?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> Absolutely.  Sign up at <a href=""http://fabrux.peoplepowerco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://fabrux.peoplepowerco.com</a> to learn how to connect up your own devices into Presence, and customize your own device UI's.</p>
<p><b>Q: How does this differ from other smart home systems?</b><br/>
<b>A:</b> Every company in the smart home space has to have some basic table stakes:  connectivity with various protocols, mobile apps, and sometimes a rules engine (that is usually not optimized for mobile!).  Presence simply does more.  Instead of a technology-centric bottoms-up design that starts with a solution looking for a problem, we took a unique user-centric and top-down approach to the design of Presence, designing for real-life scenarios that really matter.
</p><ul>
<li>Presence is the only smart home solution that truly starts free by giving users free security cameras.</li>
<li>We are a mobile first company.  We believe people experience smart homes as added features on their smart phones.</li>
<li>We have moved beyond the basic smart home and 1990's style security systems, into smart communities.  Presence does this by allowing your home to intelligently share alerts and notifications with your trusted circle of friends, family, and neighbors, at the times you specify.  Other smart home systems simply aren't there yet.</li>
<li>The rules engine in FabrUX (the cloud software behind Presence) is optimized for the mobile experience, and enables an intuitive natural language way to orchestrate all the connected products in homes and offices.</li>
<li>Our API's are completely open, and developers can create their own apps or instantly add their own connected devices directly into the Presence mobile app, with completely customizable device UI's.</li>
<li>Unlike other smart home systems, Presence Security features unlimited devices, unlimited cameras, unlimited rules, unlimited alerts, unlimited friends, and unlimited sharing, with no subscription fees required.</li>
<li>The out-of-box setup is designed to be so simple, even the most non-technical person will find it easy to install.</li>
</ul>
Presence Security represents the future of home security.<p></p>

Presence Security expands on Presence to deliver a complete security solution for your home and mobile lifestyle that is convenient and flexible. Go out in the world and do your thing and let Presence Security keep a watchful eye on the things you care about most.
Plus, Presence Security makes neighborhood watch mobile and available anywhere. Invite your trusted circle of family, friends, and neighbors to help protect your home and loved ones when you are on vacation, sleeping, or simply away from home.
Here's how it works. Say you're going on vacation and plan to disconnect for awhile. First, invite someone using the friends list in Presence and grant them access to the alerts from your home while you're in ""Vacation"" mode. Then when you switch into Vacation mode, your alerts will be automatically shared with the people you've selected, so they can stop by and have a look when you can't.

Crime is a serious problem everywhere. In 2013, there was $4.5 Billion in property losses from crime, and 74% of that was from residential burglaries. Let's face it, anyone can fall victim to crime at anytime. But securing your mobile lifestyle might be even more important. We're talking about like seeing if your kids get home safely, making sure your garage door is closed, and seeing if your pet's water dish is empty all from your smartphone from anywhere. Do all this and more with Presence Security. Many folks have already paid the big bucks for traditional security systems to protect themselves. Get even better protection with Presence Security for much less.
Protect the people and things you love most. That's why we built Presence to give anyone with a spare device a chance to protect their home and loved ones absolutely FREE. Here are just a few of the many stories that Presence users have shared with us:

If you like what you see here, please support us. Help us define the future of home security! Be the first in your neighborhood to put Presence Security to work. We will work tirelessly to deliver a world-class security solution that will bring you and your family peace of mind. Your smartphone is about to learn some new tricks. Plus, you are putting the things that are most important to you first - your family, your home, your pets - by providing them with the best protection for the money.

FAQ
Q: How easy is it to install Presence Security?
A: Extremely easy.

Download the Presence app to your smartphone and sign in.
Tap the ""Add Device"" button and scan the QR code on the back of your gateway.  Plug your gateway into ethernet and USB power.  A video plays in the app showing what to do next, which also puts the gateway into pairing mode.
Pull the battery tab on a sensor and wait for 10 seconds.  The sensor will pair automatically to the gateway, and you will be asked to give it a name.
Peel off the sticky backing on the sensor and place it where you want it to go.


Q: How many sensors can a single gateway support?
A: 25
Q: Can I add multiple gateways to my home?
A: Absolutely.  Your Presence app supports unlimited devices and gateways.
Q: Can you add ZigBee or Z-Wave Sensors, or just ""Presence"" Sensors?
A: The current gateway supports ZigBee Green Power and ZigBee Home Automation, and can connect many different types of devices that already exist in the market.  The Presence app layers the UI's and rules on top of those devices, so new devices are usually brought into the app under careful quality assurance to offer the best experience for our users.  The Presence app, and the FabrUX cloud software that powers it, connects to many other devices, clouds, and protocols.
Q: What is the wireless range of the sensors?
A: Our range testing shows about 2-3x the performance of WiFi.  We are consistently seeing about 130+ feet indoors, through 4 walls.  In the same test, WiFi connected about 30-60 feet through 2 walls.
Q: What is the lifetime of the batteries?  What type of batteries?  Does the motion sensor need to be connected to a power source?
A: The sensors are extremely low power and are expected to last 2 - 5 years on batteries, depending on use.  Most sensors use a CR2032 Lithium coin cell battery, which makes them small and unobtrusive and has a shelf life of 10+ years.  The motion sensor users 2x AA batteries.
See http://www.edn.com/design/power-management/4421334/2/Long-Live-Coin-Cells--Getting-years-of-battery-life-from-small-batteries-in-low-power-devices
Q: Will I be able to purchase individual sensors?
A: Yes.  We will be offering sensors available for individual purchase on the Presence store at http://presencepro.com/store.
Q: In the video you show an old smartphone as a camera, but I don't see a smartphone included in the Presence Security packs?
A: Presence can transform old smartphones and tablets into free Internet security cameras.  It's optional, and you'll have to provide your own.  This works on iPhone 3GS and newer, iPad 2 and newer, iPod Touch 4th and 5th generation, and Android 4.0 and newer.  Used smartphones capable of running as a Presence camera can be found on Amazon.com for less than $40, no cellular service is required.  You can do this right now by searching for 'webcam' and downloading the Presence app on the app store.
Q: In the video, what is that robotic mount that holds the camera?  Is it required?
A: This is an optional add-on to Presence, called a Motrr Galileo.  It is not required.  It can be purchased directly on the Presence Store at http://presencepro.com/store/
Q: Can the Presence app installed on your primary phone detect when you leave the house and automatically arm all the sensors?
A: Yes, we are in the process of adding Geofencing to Presence.  This feature will first be available on iOS, and then on Android.
Q: Any plans for a siren?
A: Yes!  The Presence camera features a built-in siren.  Create a rule like, ""If my 'Front door' opens and I am away, then make my 'Presence cam' activate the alarm.""  When triggered, the alarm will go off at maximum volume, and won't exit until a valid password is typed in to the app.  If you just want an audible alert in the background whenever someone opens the door for example, you can also make your camera beep once, beep twice, or beep three times instead of sounding the alarm. 
Q: Can you connect any wireless video camera to this system?
A: At this time Presence only supports the free Presence camera, by turning a spare smartphone or tablet into a free Internet security camera.  If we achieve our stretch goals, we'll be adding connected IP cameras to the mix.
Q: I'm a developer.  Can I connect my own gadgets to Presence?
A: Absolutely.  Sign up at http://fabrux.peoplepowerco.com to learn how to connect up your own devices into Presence, and customize your own device UI's.
Q: How does this differ from other smart home systems?
A: Every company in the smart home space has to have some basic table stakes:  connectivity with various protocols, mobile apps, and sometimes a rules engine (that is usually not optimized for mobile!).  Presence simply does more.  Instead of a technology-centric bottoms-up design that starts with a solution looking for a problem, we took a unique user-centric and top-down approach to the design of Presence, designing for real-life scenarios that really matter.

Presence is the only smart home solution that truly starts free by giving users free security cameras.
We are a mobile first company.  We believe people experience smart homes as added features on their smart phones.
We have moved beyond the basic smart home and 1990's style security systems, into smart communities.  Presence does this by allowing your home to intelligently share alerts and notifications with your trusted circle of friends, family, and neighbors, at the times you specify.  Other smart home systems simply aren't there yet.
The rules engine in FabrUX (the cloud software behind Presence) is optimized for the mobile experience, and enables an intuitive natural language way to orchestrate all the connected products in homes and offices.
Our API's are completely open, and developers can create their own apps or instantly add their own connected devices directly into the Presence mobile app, with completely customizable device UI's.
Unlike other smart home systems, Presence Security features unlimited devices, unlimited cameras, unlimited rules, unlimited alerts, unlimited friends, and unlimited sharing, with no subscription fees required.
The out-of-box setup is designed to be so simple, even the most non-technical person will find it easy to install.

Presence Security represents the future of home security.
Q: When are you shipping?
A: We're currently on schedule for delivery in August. (The early orders of Presence Security Packs should arrive in late July.)

FREE shipping in the United States. Ships worldwide. We will contact you if additional fees are required to ship to your international address (duties/taxes not included).",19.0,2,"4 Campaigns

<h3>A Passion for Beer</h3>
<p>From test batches made on a dirty kitchen stove in Allston, Mass. to being available in 3 states, a commitment to quality has earned us the respect of customers, peers and mortal enemies alike.  </p>
<h3>Our Own Home</h3>
<p>The catch is, we haven't had a brewery of our own this whole time.  We've been brewing in other people's breweries where we can, and it has been a great way to start, but we are ready to take the next big step to open our own brewery and tap room. The brewery will allow us to make more great beer and give us the flexibility to experiment even more than we already do.</p>
<h3>Community</h3>
<p>The tap room will give you a place to come and hang out with us while you enjoy delicious craft beverages- but more than that, it will give us a chance to make a difference in our community by supporting local art, music and neighborhood organizations. We are serious about having a positive impact and being a force for good with this project, or at least as serious as we are about anything... (just kidding, totally very serious...mostly)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Opening what will be just the 5th brewery in Boston proper is no small task, but with your help we can make it happen.  Our $30k goal is what we'll need to put the finishing touches on our taproom and really bring it to life and make it special. </p>
<p>We value your contributions and are showing our thanks with a slew of awesome rewards. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","A Passion for Beer
From test batches made on a dirty kitchen stove in Allston, Mass. to being available in 3 states, a commitment to quality has earned us the respect of customers, peers and mortal enemies alike.  
Our Own Home
The catch is, we haven't had a brewery of our own this whole time.  We've been brewing in other people's breweries where we can, and it has been a great way to start, but we are ready to take the next big step to open our own brewery and tap room. The brewery will allow us to make more great beer and give us the flexibility to experiment even more than we already do.
Community
The tap room will give you a place to come and hang out with us while you enjoy delicious craft beverages- but more than that, it will give us a chance to make a difference in our community by supporting local art, music and neighborhood organizations. We are serious about having a positive impact and being a force for good with this project, or at least as serious as we are about anything... (just kidding, totally very serious...mostly)

What We Need & What You Get
Opening what will be just the 5th brewery in Boston proper is no small task, but with your help we can make it happen.  Our $30k goal is what we'll need to put the finishing touches on our taproom and really bring it to life and make it special. 
We value your contributions and are showing our thanks with a slew of awesome rewards.

<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
<p>Aaron and Sarah Wooten, the owners of Cranford Cove, have been big supporters of Greeley's historic downtown since they moved to Greeley in 2006. In June 2013, a space opened up next door to Cafe Panache on 10th Street downtown. Even though it was in pretty rough shape and needed a full renovation (not kidding - the previous tenant was a trash wear and tattoo shop complete with a stripper pole), Aaron and Sarah saw an opportunity to invest in the city that they love. They leased the space, and after much hard labor, Cranford Cove Tea Tavern was born.</p>
<p>For the past three years, Cranford Cove has served downtown Greeley as a place to linger over coffee, cocktails, or local beer, delight in loose leaf tea, experience delicious fast-casual dining, and savor local live music.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting local musicians, Cranford Cove is heavily involved in the community, advocating for and donating to local charities that fight sex trafficking, District 6 school district, and the local library. We like to get our neighborhood moving--Cranford Cove hosts a weekly run club free to all runners. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>OUR PLANS</h3>
<p>We are so excited to build onto Cranford Cove with you and grow this wonderful community with an expansive menu and a renovation of our current space including air conditioning, more seating, and a great outdoor patio.</p>
<p>We will expand Cranford Cove next door into the space previously occupied by Cafe Panache. We've excelled in bringing you inventive drinks and delicious baked goods, and you've made us into Greeley's favorite stop for grabbing lunch with a friend. <strong>With the addition of the Cafe Panache space, we want to bring you incredible dinners, too</strong>. We will consolidate and improve upon the kitchen, ultimately building a proper commercial kitchen equipped for full restaurant and bakery use.</p>
<p>We will renovate the Cafe Panache space into a formal dining space, more than <strong>doubling our current seating capacity.</strong></p>
<p>Simultaneously, we plan on expanding outside behind Cranford's to create an <strong>intimate, fenced patio for breezy imbibing day and night.</strong> We will expand our liquor license to include the new outdoor seating, so your favorite local brews and creative cocktails can be savored under the sun and moon behind Cranford Cove.</p>
<p>We often have local bands and musicians play at Cranford's, and we love that you guys come out to sip wine with us while  jamming to the tunes. <strong>A permanent, intimate music venue</strong> at Cranford Cove will bring live music to the shop throughout the week, giving more opportunities for you to discover Greeley's talents.</p>
<p> </p>

<div><br/></div> <p>Hello everybody! We are Luke and Reyne and Paisley Collie, a devoted and hardworking family who recently moved out from Vancouver to small town Alberta. We have been planning for a long time to run ourselves a small cafe/bistro with the extensive cumulative experience we have among us, and believe we have stumbled upon the most perfect opportunity we could have hoped for.</p>
<p>We intend to revive the currently empty Blackbird Cafe. It is located in a converted Roman Catholic church, circa 1905, in the town of Coleman, AB. The building is absolutely gorgeous, as anyone who has been inside it can attest to. Our pitch image is of the original painted ceiling in the main cafe area, and below is a shot of one of the half dozen stunning stained glass windows. The acoustics are also incredible and there is a rather impressive list of musicians who are eager to play on a regular basis. It is located directly on Highway 3 in the Crowsnest Pass, which would of course allow for some amazing foot traffic throughout the year, as lots of people head that way from the Calgary area towards Fernie for skiing in the winter and BC in general for the summer. There is also a residence incorporated into the building, which would allow our family to live onsite and consolidate some of our expenses, and generally make things easier for us! This space is almost a dream come true, we don't think we could possibly have found a better opportunity to put our plans into action!</p>
<p>Our lease agreement would include a lot of the equipment we would need, but there are a few bits and pieces, not to mention some personal touches, that we would like to acquire before we open for business. Your contributions would allow us to purchase the needed equipment, get our inventory set up, begin merchandising, produce a website and social networking hub, and if our goal is obtained, transform  it into the music venue of epicness that this place was obviously meant to be. Anything above and beyond our goal would, besides making our hearts explode with joy and thankfulness, go towards a down payment to purchase the building.</p>

<h3>Goals and Rewards!</h3>
<div><br/></div> <p>We are looking for $10,000 for start-up capital. We have been tentatively approved for a Leadership Grant of $10-25k, but require matching funds in order to be eligible. If we can procure at least the ten grand in this fashion, it will be doubled, and will blow our socks off, and the Blackbird will become the grooviest joint in Coleman for all time. But if we fall short of the mark, as long as we can pull in at least $5000, we should be able to get up and running as a small operation.</p>

<p><b>Catch you on the flipside.   ;D</b></p>
</div>
</div></div>","Hello everybody! We are Luke and Reyne and Paisley Collie, a devoted and hardworking family who recently moved out from Vancouver to small town Alberta. We have been planning for a long time to run ourselves a small cafe/bistro with the extensive cumulative experience we have among us, and believe we have stumbled upon the most perfect opportunity we could have hoped for.
We intend to revive the currently empty Blackbird Cafe. It is located in a converted Roman Catholic church, circa 1905, in the town of Coleman, AB. The building is absolutely gorgeous, as anyone who has been inside it can attest to. Our pitch image is of the original painted ceiling in the main cafe area, and below is a shot of one of the half dozen stunning stained glass windows. The acoustics are also incredible and there is a rather impressive list of musicians who are eager to play on a regular basis. It is located directly on Highway 3 in the Crowsnest Pass, which would of course allow for some amazing foot traffic throughout the year, as lots of people head that way from the Calgary area towards Fernie for skiing in the winter and BC in general for the summer. There is also a residence incorporated into the building, which would allow our family to live onsite and consolidate some of our expenses, and generally make things easier for us! This space is almost a dream come true, we don't think we could possibly have found a better opportunity to put our plans into action!
Our lease agreement would include a lot of the equipment we would need, but there are a few bits and pieces, not to mention some personal touches, that we would like to acquire before we open for business. Your contributions would allow us to purchase the needed equipment, get our inventory set up, begin merchandising, produce a website and social networking hub, and if our goal is obtained, transform  it into the music venue of epicness that this place was obviously meant to be. Anything above and beyond our goal would, besides making our hearts explode with joy and thankfulness, go towards a down payment to purchase the building.




Goals and Rewards!
 We are looking for $10,000 for start-up capital. We have been tentatively approved for a Leadership Grant of $10-25k, but require matching funds in order to be eligible. If we can procure at least the ten grand in this fashion, it will be doubled, and will blow our socks off, and the Blackbird will become the grooviest joint in Coleman for all time. But if we fall short of the mark, as long as we can pull in at least $5000, we should be able to get up and running as a small operation.


Here is a breakdown of our projected funding allocation:
    If we can make:                       It will go to:


$5000                                   espresso machine, till system, inventory


$8000                                   merchandise, website and pro graphic design


$10,000 ($20,000)           music equip and stage, building make-over


<                                             down payment on building





We are very pleased to offer perks to our supporters, and we hope you can feel the overwhelming gratitude coming from our souls as well!
At the $10 pledge level you get your choice of a sticker or badge with our logo!

But the problem came up while planning. Other people were looking for other type of food. Yeah burgers are common in all areas but this time I have a new idea. Actually the name Freedom reflects to the service I am planning to give to every customer that I will serve. Freedom because every customer have their rights to choose their preferred ingredients from the type of buns or bread up to the condiments and etc. My home-made patties (chicken, beef, pork) will also contribute to it's popularity since I have a different recipe for all of this.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/687444/files/20140701093757-3.PNG?1404232677"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/687440/files/20140701093628-10247465_10203783740622992_5297288956700208265_n.jpg?1404232588"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>Then, my UP macaroons will also be presented in the small burger restaurant I am planning to since it can be a potential dessert/ delicacy that is also available for take-outs. </p><p>The money from this campaign will allow us to put a place wherein I can start to serve larger amount of people in a most convenient way and in a comfortable room. </p><p>The funds will also give us the opportunity to continue and to grow our plans to meet the people's satisfaction in our area especially we're planning to start the business outside the University wherein all types of people are looking for something new, something to try and most of all something to eat!</p><p>Reaching our goal $2,500 would be a great achievement for us and if we are able to reach beyond our goal, it will be a very big help to continue our exciting ways of making unique ingredients for our Burger and different flavors for our macaroons.

We also need to innovate our products by giving extra effort of making different and unique products as possible. And lastly, we should learn to trust other people and try to communicate well in order to have good outcomes in and outside the business.</p><p>As long as we know how to do it and how to grow it, I know, we can survive and we can be successful in a short period of time.</p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We're very lucky to have this opportunity like others to express our ideas and gain different types of help from different types of people at the same time.

Freedom because every customer have their rights to choose their preferred ingredients from the type of buns or bread up to the condiments and etc. My home-made patties (chicken, beef, pork) will also contribute to it's popularity since I have a different recipe for all of this.Then, my UP macaroons will also be presented in the small burger restaurant I am planning to since it can be a potential dessert/ delicacy that is also available for take-outs. The money from this campaign will allow us to put a place wherein I can start to serve larger amount of people in a most convenient way and in a comfortable room. The funds will also give us the opportunity to continue and to grow our plans to meet the people's satisfaction in our area especially we're planning to start the business outside the University wherein all types of people are looking for something new, something to try and most of all something to eat!Reaching our goal $2,500 would be a great achievement for us and if we are able to reach beyond our goal, it will be a very big help to continue our exciting ways of making unique ingredients for our Burger and different flavors for our macaroons. We're also looking forward to launch other products in our restaurant in the future.  Risks & Challenges  Growing any kind of business has many challenges! In our case, a food project requires different ingredients, and different ingredients could be seasonal and their prices may vary all the time. There are also lots of competitors existing in the are that we're planning to put up the Freedom Burger and UP Macaroons Project.  We're also thinking that hiring or looking for someone we could depend the business when we're busy at other things would be a problem someday.Knowing all of the possible consequences, we're planning to make a survey and list of all ingredients to monitor the prices and which season should we buy more certain ingredients so we need to increase our storage facilities. We also need to innovate our products by giving extra effort of making different and unique products as possible. And lastly, we should learn to trust other people and try to communicate well in order to have good outcomes in and outside the business.As long as we know how to do it and how to grow it, I know, we can survive and we can be successful in a short period of time.   Other Ways You Can Help We're very lucky to have this opportunity like others to express our ideas and gain different types of help from different types of people at the same time. You can also help us through indiegogo tools by spreading to your friends about our planned project, what we're planning to do, and our about our goals.You can also support us not only just by money but also through sharing opinions and suggestions. These things would be very helpful for the success of our project.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>MTG Players Need Easier Ways To Connect<br/>
</h3>
<p>With nearly 60,000 subscribers on Youtube I hear the same story all the time, in fact, it's true of myself too!  People love to play magic but they don't always have a local shop or have an existing playgroup.  How do you find people to play with other than word of mouth?  There simply is NO easy way.</p>
<p>My goal is to create an interface where new and old magic players can easily find other gamers in their area with similar interests and make it easier to play the game we all love.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Here is how the shell of this app is going to work.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>People with existing home pages will be able to list their game type, location, times, and whatever other useful information they might need.  Then, people looking for a home page will be able to search their local area, by type of game and connect with other players!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Let me give you a very real world example.  Say you want to play a game of EDH, but don't have a play group, find one easily using this application, on the flip side if you run a home game for EDH, but are always looking for new players, you will be able to list your event and meet people looking to play EDH.</p>
<p>This process works if you are looking to do everything.</p>
<p>Standard Deck Testing<br/>Drafting<br/>Trading<br/>Modern Play Testing<br/>So Much More!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For operators of home games or local game shops, the process is simple, fill out your information, the types of games you are running, a sample of times, and other helpful information.  Then you will be entered into the game database.  For players looking for a game, you will come to the application, select what type of game you are looking for, the city you are located in, and the app will deliver results back to you of all local games matching your criteria.  You will then be able to message those running the game, meet some new friends, and play a whole heck of a lot more Magic The Gathering. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>At $1500 I can add an amazing MTG meetup application so you can search for a local home game anywhere in the world.  Looking to play casual EDH?  Looking to standard legacy or modern playtest?  You will be able to locate other magic players near you to do all of this.  There is simply no application like this in the entire world and I feel strongly this will be an amazing and FREE tool for magic players all over the world.  This level of the application will be a simple city search, meaning you will be able to search for home games, or game shops by game type and see listings and contact information.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>At $2500 I will be able to make that application accessible as an app for both Iphone and android mobile devices.  You will be able to use this application from your phones, anywhere in the world to locate other magic players in your city, contact them for game nights and so much more.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$2500+ Means we get to start adding features that YOU the backers would like to see in this application.  Have something you would like added to this amazing tool for magic players?  At this level we can start to really get crazy!   We can even start to think about tying it with your phones GPS, Facebook integration, more diverse search features and much more.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>$3000 Means We can add the ""like dislike"" system as proposed on reddit.  Rank your experience with a particular player or game shop!</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>$3500 Means we can start looking at adding GPS functionality to this App!  Have it auto locate where you are instead of being manual!</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>$4000 Means we can start looking at customizable profiles, trade indicators, local store feedback and more</b><br/></p>

</h3> <p>Back in the Ring begynte som et prøveprosjekt i 2013. Med Yoga som virkemiddel ønsket vi å utforske alternative veier i behandlingen av rusavhengige. Etter positive resultater fra mange av våre deltagere har prosjektet nå fått nasjonal oppmerksomhet. </p> <ul> <li>Ett år etter første runde er syv av ti deltagere rusfrie<br/>
</li> <li>Tre av deltagerne har blitt yogainstruktører og jobber nå med å hjelpe andre gjennom prosjektet<br/>
</li> <li>Prosjektet har stor pågang og opptil 40 rusavhengige kommer til yogaklasser i Oslo ukentlig<br/>
</li> </ul> <p>I november reiste 18 nye deltagere i Back in the ring II til India for et to måneders opphold hvor de skal bli rusfrie gjennom yoga og samfunnsnyttig arbeid. De skal blant annet bygge et tempel for fattige og pengene vi samler inn nå skal være med å finansiere dette arbeidet.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Vi ønsker oss 150 000<br/>
</h3> <ul> <li>Prosjektet har ingen offentlig støtte og deltagerne har selv betalt reisen til India. Purple Valley yogasenter i Goa støtter prosjektet med gratis innkvartering<br/>

 Back in the Ring begynte som et prøveprosjekt i 2013. Med Yoga som virkemiddel ønsket vi å utforske alternative veier i behandlingen av rusavhengige. Etter positive resultater fra mange av våre deltagere har prosjektet nå fått nasjonal oppmerksomhet.   Ett år etter første runde er syv av ti deltagere rusfrie
 Tre av deltagerne har blitt yogainstruktører og jobber nå med å hjelpe andre gjennom prosjektet
 Prosjektet har stor pågang og opptil 40 rusavhengige kommer til yogaklasser i Oslo ukentlig
  I november reiste 18 nye deltagere i Back in the ring II til India for et to måneders opphold hvor de skal bli rusfrie gjennom yoga og samfunnsnyttig arbeid. De skal blant annet bygge et tempel for fattige og pengene vi samler inn nå skal være med å finansiere dette arbeidet.   Vi ønsker oss 150 000
  Prosjektet har ingen offentlig støtte og deltagerne har selv betalt reisen til India. Purple Valley yogasenter i Goa støtter prosjektet med gratis innkvartering
 Innsamlingen går i sin helhet til å dekke materialkostnader for bygging av tempelet
    Hva vil ditt bidrag hjelpe til med?
 Et viktig resultat av ditt bidrag er jo at fattige i India får et nytt og etterlengtet tempel de ellers ikke ville fått. Det er en god ting i seg selv, men det er andre sider ved dette som er enda viktigere:  Gjennom å hjelpe andre får deltagerne i prosjektet oppleve den viktige følelsen av å gjøre noe godt for noen som trenger det, det blir hjelp til selvhjelp
 Det å hjelpe andre og være betydningsfull for noen, er en viktig ingrediens i prosjektet Back in the ring, vi vet at det gir kraft og styrke 
 På den lange veien til målet om å leve et rusfritt liv er det å jobbe sammen, skape noe bra, kjenne tilhørighet og bli sett utrolig viktig. Turen til India og jobben som gjøres der danner et veldig bra utgangspunkt for å nå det målet, og ditt bidrag vil hjelpe!

friend, I have encountered numerous women confronting infertility.  In fact, 12-20% of all couples will have some trouble conceiving. I have
listened to stories of pain and alienation and watched as some of my peers
embrace motherhood while others suffer the paroxysms of infertility.
 Additionally, I have noted the frequency of potentially damaging remarks
typically asked at Jewish communal functions.  Such questions sound
innocent enough, (How many children do you have?...Nu, what is taking so long?), but can crush the spirit
of those who suffer--in silence--from infertility.   All of these stories I have heard, have inspired me to create this project. </font><br/></p>
<p>My experience as a Jewish educator influenced me to utilize
Jewish texts in search of some means of solace for those who are enduring these struggles.

often portrayed by commentaries and educators in simple terms, inconsistent
with a more nuanced reality.  (If only infertility could be solved for everyone struggling nowadays by crying out to the Almighty!) </p>
<p>As a Jewish-dance educator and choreographer, my milieu for
expressing ideas is through movement.  Seven-years of
producing and choreographing for Jewish dance companies has made me a firm
believer in the immense power of dance--and movement--to convey ideas.  Ultimately,
UPROOTED draws upon this skill set as well as my background with classic Jewish
texts and my training in an MA program for Marriage and Family Counseling. The
result is an experience intended to raise awareness and ease the silent suffering
of so many individuals.    </p><div><br/></div><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Our community needs this project! </span><br/></p><p>Have you ever been to a Jewish communal event and been accosted with an invasive comment or asked a personal question?  Are you dating anyone, you should go to college X, did I hear that you lost your job, (or one that I was personally asked recently--the always inappropriate) are you pregnant? </p><p>Jewish communities of all types are frequently places of congeniality

<br/><br/><br/><h3>The Longer Version: Here is our story and we are stickin’ to it! </h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Simply put, Stillpoint Needs Your Help.</h3>
<p>We began our journey three and a half years ago after opening our doors in the Westshore. Since then we have given over 15,000 treatments, to just about 2,000 people. <a href=""http://www.stillpoint-clinic.com/testimonials/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">They love what we do</a>, and we love what we do too. But, in order for Stillpoint to keep growing, we need your help.</p>
<br/><p>Let’s back up...<b>What IS Community Acupuncture</b>?</p>
<p>The North American model of acupuncture is probably very familiar to you:  You see your acupuncturist for an hour or so, they ask you LOTS of questions before putting the needles in, let you rest a while then come in and kick you off the table, whether you’re ready or not.  Then, when you’re all spaced out and relaxed (we call that being in ‘aculand’), they hit you up for a fee ranging from $60-120 and book you in for your next treatment.<br/></p>
<p>That’s not our style.<br/></p>
<p>Community Acupuncture  is different!  Not only do you get to decide how long your treatments last, it is way cheaper!  Our patients play on a sliding scale between $20-$50, which means if you need those three treatments a week, it's actually affordable! Our treatments occur in one large room, where people sit quietly in comfy recliners, with their sleeves and pantlegs rolled up, all floating in aculand. Because there are numerous chairs to sit in, no one needs to make way for the next patient, if they’re not ready to. Also, you can bring friends, family, random people off the street (not sure why’d you do that, but hey! it’s all good!) and get treated at the same time. </p>
<p>And yes: we treat <a href=""http://www.stillpoint-clinic.com/our-treatments/acupuncture/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EVERYTHING </a>that any other acupuncturist treats, just as well. The added bonus is that with more treatments, you’ll often get better even faster!<br/></p>“I come to community acupuncture clinics to say I sleep with strangers”<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1382954/files/20150414124445-IMG_20150312_170023.jpg?1429040685"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So what happened at Stillpoint??<br/></p>As a Social Enterprise, all of our profits go back into our staff, clinics and community, (Note: if you are looking to become a millionaire, opening a Community Acupuncture clinic is not for you!) After the success of our first clinic, we found ourselves looking to expand our services outward to more underserved communities. <br/><br/><p>In May of 2014 we found a great location in Vic West, a tight knit working class community that is currently underserved by any form of health care provider. Our new clinic would share expenses with the first, and allow us to put our energy into a community that needed us.<br/></p>Just as we had started tearing down walls and building new treatment rooms, we discovered that our expected funding investment commitment had, through circumstances beyond anyone's control been reduced by half.<br/><p>That...was NOT good.<br/></p>Despite this financial set back, our community came together and saved us. With the blood, sweat and tears of many, we were able to scrape together enough resources to open the doors of our second location in October of 2014. <br/><p>Although the response from the Vic West Community has been astounding, our funding gap remains. We find ourselves stuck. We are unable to afford some of the basic necessities that our Vic West clinic needs in order to adequately support our new community.<br/></p>This is our dream of dreams.<br/><br/><p>Our Vic West clinic needs some serious TLC. Okay, it actually goes beyond TLC. There are walls still missing, and our sign looks like it was put up by a couple of monkeys (actually, the boss put it up!).  Esthetics aside, our community is asking us to be open full time hours, and it kills us that we just can’t afford to do it at this point.<br/></p>
<p>This campaign will provide us the funding we need to make Stillpoint more visible to the Vic West Community and provide them with the care and service they deserve, and need from us.<br/></p>
<p>Contributing to our campaign isn’t about donating to a Community Acupuncture clinic, it’s about supporting a community,  fulfilling a need, and joining the revolution that is Community Acupuncture.  Thank you for your support! </p>

<p>For those who don’t know, Raye
Roeske is a fabulous gal who has spent YEARS supporting indie authors and
small press publishers. If you are at all involved in the bizarro fiction community, this
is no surprise to you. But those outside of that community or are just becoming
familiar with it, you’ll soon see how much Raye does (and has done) for
everyone. <br/></p>
<p>My name is Jordan Krall, an author and publisher. I've known Raye for quite some time and she is like the older sister I should have had (instead of the older sister that I got, haha!). She has not only been supportive of <i>me </i>during the ups and downs of my life, but she's also helped countless friends and colleagues of mine.<br/></p>
<p>Last Spring,
her partner of many years passed away suddenly. Raye was left in a very
precarious situation with her vindictive landlord and was (and is) struggling
financially. Raye is unable to work and is on SSDI as her sole source of
income. Though she has since found a new place to live, she is still in a very unstable financial situation and can use any help she can get.</p>
<p>Because of Raye's love of hamsters, I decided to edit an anthology of hamster stories. I was lucky to get TONS of authors who were willing to write a story for this book despite it being a very niche topic. </p>
<p>All donations and proceeds of this anthology will go to pay for Raye's cost-of-living expenses. </p>

<h3>Please Help Kathy Heal !</h3>
<p>   On 3/12/13 Tuesday morning after getting off of work I intervened in a brutal beating of a woman on her way to her factory job. She was incapacitated and unable to defend against her attacker. I stopped the beating and the man was arrested and is being charged with a felony battery charge. The victim's name is Kathy and her battle isn't over yet. She has a shattered left orbital bone in her face and could possibly need reconstructive surgery to fix this. She will no doubt be stuck with the medical expenses unless you can help. Please help Kathy heal inside and out with your support we can do this. I am Charlie Blackmore Jr. a Marine Corps Disabled Veteran and I ask you to be one of the few and the proud. Thank you !</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Anything you can donate will help </h3>
<p>   I am trying to raise at least $35,000 not only to help with the medical expenses but to send her on a vacation with her children to help forget about this horrible morning. Every cent raised will go to Kathy and her children. If we reach the goal I will try to have their time documented on video and shared on YouTube for you all to view what happiness you helped accomplish. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>   Kathy also takes the bus to work every morning even during the brutal Wisconsin winters.  I know it's a stretch but to get her very own vehicle for transportation would just be the cherry on top.

<h3>About Anahata International</h3>
<p class=""normal"">We are a volunteer-run, DC-based nonprofit organization with a mission is to share the physical and mental health benefits of yoga and holistic wellness services with individuals in need. We provide teacher trainings and build sustainable wellness programs to trauma and conflict-affected communities around the world. Right now, we are halfway through a 2-part project in the West Bank — training teachers and empowering local women to build sustainable, yoga-based programs to help their communities cope with the daily stresses of living in conflict.</p>
<h3 class=""normal"">About Farashe</h3>
<p class=""normal"">Partnering with Anahata on this project is <strong>Farashe Yoga Center</strong> in Ramallah. Opened in 2010, Farashe's small volunteer staff has been offering safe, accessible yoga throughout occupied territories. Through this training, the organizations seek to empwer members of the local community to be a part of this effort — making it more sustainable and increasing the reach significantly. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p class=""normal"">We are just $4,000 away from raising the funds we need to send 3 teachers back to Ramallah this June for the second phase of teacher training. We need your help to cover travel costs, training materials, and yoga supplies to make this happen!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p class=""normal"">In July 2012, we completed a 60-hour foundational teacher training for 16 women in the West Bank City of Ramallah as part of our ongoing partnership with Farashe. Trainees were taught how to facilitate yoga and meditation classes with an emphasis on making self-care skills available to all while empowering women as local community leaders.</p>
<p class=""normal"">This summer's training will build on the foundation set last summer, with a focus in offering additional tools and resources in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trauma-sensitve yoga</strong></li>
<li><strong>Children's yoga &amp; prenatal yoga</strong></li>
<li><strong>Yoga Nidra &amp; meditation</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p class=""normal"">Everyone deserves a path to wellbeing—especially in areas of the world where conflict and restricted movement are a fact of daily life. Yoga has the power to promote healing and social change. Here is a little more on the difference our work in the West Bank has made so far:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Our 2012 trainees have been actively teaching and sharing what they have learned—introducing yoga to children in schools, to the elderly, to expecting mothers and other members of the community through local health organizations and public classes. Some of them are teaching as many as 8 classes per week!</span></li>
<li><span><span>Two </span><span class=""il"">of the 2012 graduates are in the process of opening up yoga studios to serve populations where they live—the very first yoga centers in Bethlehem and Nablus</span><span>.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>One graduates also share yoga as a tool for self care with people who have limited access to healthcare and who are living with diabetes and heart disease.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>""I</span><span> stopped being angry. I no longer have racing thoughts that keep me worried and awake through the night. I have this tranquility inside of me that I didn’t have before I started yoga."" - 2012 graduate, 25-year-old Abeer Abu Amrieh from the village of Zatara, near Bethlehem</span></p>
<p class=""normal""><strong>Every little bit makes a big difference; please help us with $10, $50, $100, or whatever you can manage. </strong></p>

<p><strong>     Hello, my name is Wanda Sewell.  I am starting my own business designing, producing and selling quality adaptive clothing for seniors and the disabled. </strong> My goal is to make dressing easier and more comfortable for anyone with mobility issues and those that care for them. </p>
<p>I have been accepted into a government program that would provide me with education, professional business advice, mentoring and personal financial support for one year.  This program will enable me to reinvest any profits realized back into my growing business.  However I require start up capital.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where the money from this campaign will go.</strong></p>
<p>Material and supplies for inventory - $4,690.00</p>
<p>Office equipment upgrades and software - $860.00</p>
<p>Brochure printing and mailing costs - $872.00</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Extra money will go to:</strong></p>
<p>Graphic design fees to help with the brochure</p>
<p>Development of new product designs</p>
<p>Web development fees to help with the website</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Several years ago I began designing adaptive clothing as a hobby and donated what I made to the nursing home where I was employed.  Some of my co-workers asked if they could purchase some of my designs for their parents.  After the CEO of the facility asked if they could purchase additional nightgowns and agreed to test my future designs at their facility.</p>
<p>In March of this year I was forced to take a medical leave from my job.  I have since found out that it may be some time before I can expect a full recovery.  Running my own business will allow me to work around my medical condition and be a contributing member of my community.  For several years, I managed a small business and dreamed of someday owing my own business.  Now I wish to turn that dream into a reality. </p>
<p>As our Baby Boomeras are aging there will be more pressure on a Health Care System that is already struggling to keep up.  In the coming years, the waiting lists for long term care beds will only be growing longer resulting in more seniors being cared for at home by family members or care providers.  Adaptive clothing makes dressing easier and less physically challenging for both the wearer and the care provider.  Help me to help make their life a little easier and more comfortable.</p>
<p>I am committed to protecting the environment for our future generations and have taken great effort to keep the company’s ecological footprint as small as possible.  I have found charities that can make use of leftover production fabric.  This will keep it out of the landfill and help out the charities at the same time.  I also believe in helping those in need so $1 of every garment sold will be donated to a charity that supports seniors or the disabled.  Each year we’ll choose a different to support.  I have yet to choose the charity for this year so if anyone has a charity that they’re passionate about please let me know.  If your charity is chosen I’ll make the donation in your name.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About the perks.</strong></p>
<p>Because Indiegogo is all about caring and sharing, all perks come in 2’s, one for you and one to share.  All perks are handmade using the finest quality material and workmanship.  All perk levels include vegetable seeds because it’s my way of giving back to <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">your</span> community so that this campaign can benefit as many people as possible.  All contributors will receive a hand written Thank You note from me as you and your support means so much to me.

<p>My name is Lauren, and I want to bring an educational beehive enclosure and pollination garden to my green neighborhood in Seattle, Washington.</p>
<h3><strong>Why?</strong></h3>
<p>High Point is home to many Somali, Cambodian, and Vietnamese families, and cultivating honey bees is part of our shared heritage.</p>
<p>Being part of the solution is a good thing. Bees are in trouble; we need them, and they need our help.</p>
<p>Pollination – West Seattle has beautiful plants and lush P-Patches– let’s keep them happy and pollinated</p>
<p>Honey to share and enjoy</p>
<p>Increased educational opportunities for kids and adults alike</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>Honey bees pollinate 30% of all the food we eat and 80% of all fruits and vegetables. The global honey bee population has suffered a dramatic decline in recent years. Wild honey bee populations in the US have decreased by 50% over the past 50 years, and bee colonies maintained by beekeepers have decreased by about two thirds. This is due to a variety of reasons - most of them man-made. Without intervention, the continued demise of these incredible pollinators would have a dramatic effect on our ecosystems and food supply.</p>
<p>I had heard about the plight of the honey bee, but I wasn't fully aware of the situation and importance until I saw the film <em>Vanishing of the Bees</em>. I posted my idea on the <a href=""http://westseattleblog.com/2012/05/laurens-idea-saving-bees-through-education-but-she-cant-do-it-alone"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Lauren's Idea on West Seattle Blog"">West Seattle Blog</a> asking how my neighbors felt about installing an educational beehive in a local P-Patch. The response was incredible and truly inspiring! So here we are, after more than a year, with a beautiful space for the bees and a pollination garden, a huge level of community support, local beekeepers to help us out (one has even taken me under her wing as an apprentice), pledged labor and funding from the <a href=""http://www.highpointneighborhood.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""High Point Neighborhood"">High Point Neighborhood</a> Association and Seattle P-Patch for sustained maintenance into the future, and a Department of Neighborhoods grant to get things rolling.</p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>We've come so far, but <strong>we need your support</strong> for the final push. We've gotten here thanks to the excitement and support of people just like you- friends who offered their time, money, expertise, and dedication. <strong>Will you join us? </strong></p>
<p>Every bit counts towards our goal. A donation of <strong>$5 buys one square foot of mulch</strong> for our garden- <strong>$250 fully outfits a novice beekeeper</strong>.  </p>
<p>So <strong>spread the word</strong>! Donate what you can, and tell friends and family. Best of all, come join us! <a href=""http://www.westseattlebeegarden.com/events.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sign up to volunteer</a> at an upcoming work party, and we'll see you in the garden.</p>

<p><strong>**Updated since campaign created in February**</strong></p>
<p><strong>Good news: Due to continued donated materials, labor and money (outside of our indiegogo campaign), our goal is now $8,000! Wow, big change! We can't change the official goal for this campaign, but wanted to let you know that we aren't as far off as you may think!</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What is the money for?</strong></h3>
<p>Thanks to the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods and other contributions, here is what we have:</p>
<p>- Fence for the pollination garden ($3,000 for material and labor)</p>
<p>- Polycarbonate to enable a transparent and secure beehive enclosure ($4,000)</p>
<p>- Remaining materials for the 9' tall beehive enclosure and shed ($3,000)</p>
<p>- Landscaping and grading, etc. ($2,000) - (this includes wood chips, gravel, compost, and plants for gardens, much of this is being donated as well)</p>
<p>- 2 traditional beehives and stands, butterfly house and mason bee structure ($500) - actual cost is $1250, but $750 worth is being donated)</p>
<p>- Equipment rental ($2,000)</p>
<p>- Materials to install a waterline, spigot and sink ($500)</p>
<p>-Translation and interpretation - final community meeting, invitations to meetings and work parties  ($1000)</p>
<p>- Supplies for mosaic (currently being constructed by WSE students) – ($200)</p>
<p>- Permit to build enclosure – ($520)</p>
<p>- Work party supplies, tools, tent ($1,000)</p>
<p>- Honeybees and mason bee larva ($300)</p>
<p>- Stainless steel donor’s sign ($300)</p>
<p>- Pavers ($100)</p>
<p>- Translation and interpretation (four languages) for signs and events so that everyone can participate ($1,500)<em> </em></p>
<p>-Solid wooden benches, enough for an entire classroom ($1,000). Acquired free lumbar from a local fallen tree, and help from a local furniture builder)</p>
<p>- Colorful educational signs ($4000) - (total funding goal for signs is $6500)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How your contributions will be spent:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>- </strong>Colorful educational signs on the enclosure and throughout the park: $2500 (in order to reach $6500 goal for signs)</p>
<p>- Beekeeping equipment, enough to share ($1,500)</p>
<p>- Food and drinks for volunteers during work parties ($1,000)</p>
<p>- 2 additional beehives with frames from Shipwreck Honey -local hive carpenter ($1000)</p>
<p>- WiFi webcam to place at entrance of hive - would create interactive component for visitors, and research opportunities for local educators ($250)</p>
<p>- Small solar panel for basic power ($500)</p>
<p>- Live demonstration supplies ($500)</p>
<p>- Additional educational signs for demonstrations (would purchase with any additional funding left over)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>The West Seattle Bee and Pollination Garden will teach visitors, residents and school children about bees and pollination. The beehives will be enclosed inside a primarily transparent enclosure. This enclosure heightens the flight path of the bees, minimizing direct human interaction and protecting curious children from getting too close to the hives. The space will be surrounded by beautiful flowers and trees, illustrating the symbiotic relationship of bees and plants.</p>
<p>Schools will be welcome to take field trips to the hives and see demonstrations with the bees. Visitors will learn about bees and pollinators through posted signs and observing the hives. Our community, families and local groups will be welcome to host meetings in the space. Seattle residents and community members will learn new skills and share experiences by being part of this great project.</p>

Inspiration and Motivation

My name is Bashir Munye and I am the Chef/Founder of My Little Dumplings. You may have seen me in Food and Drink Magazine, or at farmer's markets around Toronto, offering up global, seasonal, farm-fresh dumplings and steam buns. The inspiration for My Little Dumplings comes from my wife, Asha, and our own three ""little dumplings,"" Hamza, Zenzi and Lula. My passion for food is more than a desire to cook great things. I believe that everyone should have access to healthy, wholesome food. Our new kitchen will be a space where we can create new, innovative items and expand our commitment to making organic, farm-to-table food accessible to a wider community.





My Little Dumplings... our very first day at the market.


From a culinary perspective, I'm a bit of a nomadI was born in Somalia, grew up in Italy, and for the last 20 years, have made Toronto my home. My love of globally-inspired foods comes honestly. My mother was a great cook who prepared Somalian, Ethiopian, Italian and Kenyan fare... foods like roasted camel, goat meat, and injera - an Ethiopian staple. Throughout my childhood, fresh, seasonal organic food was the norm. As we traveled across the Mediterranean, I remember visiting presses where Italian families would bring olives from their trees to make their own oil. In France, Spain, and Switzerland, I grew to appreciate pâté and croissants, and later in Tunisia, couscous, Merguez, and Harissa. As an African in the diaspora, my inspirations are drawn fromall these diverse influences, and folded into little morsels of goodness.
      
We need a permanent, commercial space
For the past three years, we have been cooking in shared commercial rental kitchens and selling primarily at farmer's markets. Demand for our products and catering has increased to the point where we can no longer meet our customers' needs. We want to secure a permanent commercial kitchen so that we can:



Scale up production for artisanal global organic
dumplings

Increase our capacity to cater customized events
Develop home replacement meals
Prepare, process, and package our original sauces and condiments
Increase our presence at farmer's markets across the GTA
Increase our support for food literacy programs
Provide training and mentorship for youth and new immigrants 
Continue to support local farmers & the artisanal business community 


   

Our goal is to raise $45,000

This will enable us to lease a commercial space in Toronto and purchase the required equipment, including: 

Industrial bake and steam oven - $16,000
Large dough sheeter - $2,800

What happens if we do not reach our goal?
If we do not reach our goal (we are really hoping that we do), then we will use the funds to secure the new space and prioritize our needs. We would have to reduce the scale of the operation and continue to build slowly. For example, we would still secure the space and some equipment depending on how much we raise.

I'm majoring in Marketing Communication and am a captain of the Division III Women's Volleyball Team at California Lutheran University. </p><p>
</p><p>I am currently enrolled in an Event Planning class and a Funding
for Non-profits class this semester. While learning the high cost and stress involved with
fundraisers, I have been challenged to campaign and raise money for a foundation
of my choice. I decided to raise money for the wonderful foundation called ‘Life Rolls On’.  For those of you who don't know, Life Rolls On (LRO) is a 501(c)(3) non profit dedicated to improving the quality of life for young people affected by spinal cord injuries. This foundation puts on events in local areas, such as Santa Monica or Venice, that allows kids and young adults to participate in activities that they once thought were impossible.</p><p>I came across this foundation when I volunteered at the U.S. Surf Open last summer, where I was fortunate to meet Jesse Billauer, the founder and CEO of LRO, as well as the 2015 World Champion of Quadriplegic Surfing. His positive attitude and drive to live life to the fullest, beyond paralysis, really motivated me to get involved with nonprofits; specifically this one!</p><p>As a college student, I know best how tight money can be. All I ask is if you could give up that coffee you usually get and donate that $5 to this campaign. Because that $5 is going to go towards helping and turning some young kids idea of her/his ""impossible"" into possible. Which to me, is worth way more than any amount of money.<br/></p><p>
</p><p>I plan to raise at
least $500 to help support LRO in their event 'They Will Surf Again' that will take place on June 4th in Santa Monica this summer. All donations go towards extra necessities such as
food, drinks, giveaways, etc to help make it a great experience for those young
children and families.</p><p>Now that you've gotten to learn about me and my reasons for starting this campaign, please click 'Contribute Now'! Also, do not be afraid to share my campaign with friends or family because even if you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help! :) </p><p>To learn more about LRO, check out their website at <a href=""http://www.liferollson.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.liferollson.org</a></p><p>Thank you and God bless!</p></div>","Hello there!

fundraisers, I have been challenged to campaign and raise money for a foundation
of my choice. I decided to raise money for the wonderful foundation called ‘Life Rolls On’.  For those of you who don't know, Life Rolls On (LRO) is a 501(c)(3) non profit dedicated to improving the quality of life for young people affected by spinal cord injuries. This foundation puts on events in local areas, such as Santa Monica or Venice, that allows kids and young adults to participate in activities that they once thought were impossible.I came across this foundation when I volunteered at the U.S. Surf Open last summer, where I was fortunate to meet Jesse Billauer, the founder and CEO of LRO, as well as the 2015 World Champion of Quadriplegic Surfing. His positive attitude and drive to live life to the fullest, beyond paralysis, really motivated me to get involved with nonprofits; specifically this one!As a college student, I know best how tight money can be. All I ask is if you could give up that coffee you usually get and donate that $5 to this campaign. Because that $5 is going to go towards helping and turning some young kids idea of her/his ""impossible"" into possible. Which to me, is worth way more than any amount of money.
I plan to raise at
least $500 to help support LRO in their event 'They Will Surf Again' that will take place on June 4th in Santa Monica this summer. All donations go towards extra necessities such as
food, drinks, giveaways, etc to help make it a great experience for those young
children and families.Now that you've gotten to learn about me and my reasons for starting this campaign, please click 'Contribute Now'! Also, do not be afraid to share my campaign with friends or family because even if you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help! :) To learn more about LRO, check out their website at www.liferollson.orgThank you and God bless!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Many of our ideas and projects have run into the never-ending conflicts of finding space, money and time to carry as far as we would like. We started searching for a home base, a space we could use to launch bigger, more sustainable projects for genuine community growth and involvement; a space that will grow organically to fit the needs and goals of the people. We wanted a music venue, theater, infoshop, anarchist library, community garden, meeting space, a resource center, a food bank… Spaces are already being built and maintained by peers in Flagstaff and Tucson, but we don’t have a permanent anarchist venue in the Phoenix area. The space we envision will be maintained by the collective, but its projects will come from anyone who has an idea and the drive to see it through.</i></p>
<p><i>We have already found a perfect location, a working class neighborhood in Tempe, Arizona. The building is available for our collective to purchase and the owner is willing to work with us on making that happen, but we need to raise funds. Before we can open the doors, we will need to put in more work to build a stage, put in bookshelves, set up a community kitchen, and other projects. We have volunteers to help with renovation and create the garden as well as paint the place. We're all set and ready to go; we just need to pay the deposit to get the keys! We believe in this project so much, most of us have given everything we can and more to making it happen. We need help with the initial down payment for the building, and we decided as a group to ask the people for help. </i></p>
<p><i>We respect that many other groups in the Valley are building their own projects around local issues. To help support those efforts with our fundraising push, we have been able to offer rewards for contributions of $20 or more.  These will range from personalized shirts, custom stickers, professional banners and discounts on events and free shows.</i></p>
<p><i>What we earn will go towards the down payment, renovations and resources, regardless of whether we reach our goal or not. Anything you can contribute will alleviate the financial pressure of the individuals who have been putting everything on the line to see this space open its doors. If we hit our $5,000 goal, great! If we go over, even better! And if we don't reach it, we will still continue to fight for an open resource center to serve the community and all funds will be dedicated to that purpose.</i></p>
<p><i>This space will be invaluable to the Phoenix community. It will provide a safe space for people who feel marginalized and foster resistance to systemic oppression. It will strengthen ties within our community and provide tools and space to strategize for a life that we love. It will be a venue for local artists and bands, a practice space, a meeting space, a library, a kitchen, a garden and a shelter from the storm. The space will be alive, with zines, screenprinting, music, art, skill sharing and a communal garden for everyone. This is the biggest and most ambitious project that we have started, but it is only the beginning. Help us build.</i></p><p><i>Please share our fundraising page, and keep in touch! We will have lots of opportunities to become involved in building this space.

<p>As many of you know, I was divorced in 2009 and a month later I lost my job. For 2 solid years, I battled with (and have mostly won the war) on major full blown depression. I struggled to find anything that would help me support myself and my little miss. I was willing to take any job and applied to everything under the sun. I've had to carve my own plan to work - I have created businesses and I work as an independent contractor for companies I believe in and love. I work very hard and I'm proud of myself for getting out of the depression and out of the victim mode and really using my talents and resources. I have struggled so much to make ends meet and I've come so far in getting our lives on track. Now, I need a little help to get us to where we need to go next.</p>
<p>Last year, I was able to leave the apartment with the raining holes in the roof, bad memories, rusty pipes and 17 year old rug and moved into my sister's house. She generously offered for me to pay a small portion to live here. I have partially rented this house and we have found peace and tranquility that could not be found in that old place, under the flight path. I have found happiness despite barely surviving financially. Money has been a stressor but it was livable. I feel like my little miss and I both have been moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>Sometimes, things change so quickly. I have been so focused on life and building our future but thought I'd be able to stay in this house much longer. We have lived hand to mouth. Whatever else I've managed to earn, I've put toward growing Dulce Sweet, growing our future.  I found out on Monday that we need to move. My sister is now in a position where she immediately needs to rent it out entirely to cover the cost of the mortgage. And that makes sense and I understand it but I am not in a position to afford to pay that. </p>
<p>When we moved last year, I got rid of all my furniture and everything we owned. My credit is shot. To make things easier for my ex (and thereby easier for me and my kid), I took the bulk of the debt at the time of the divorce, then lost my job, and have been dealing with that ever since. I thought we'd be here for a while and would have a chance to rebuild before we moved on. </p>
<p>Yesterday, we went looking at places and theres so many immediate expenses involved in this. The added deposit because of the credit issue is enough to put me in this position. I'm asking for help in all of this. I'm asking because I'm at the end of my rope. I'm asking, openly and honestly, for a hand up.

into a dangerous street life. Whilst on the streets they are at high risk of
inhumane treatment, constant abuse and all types of exploitation from their
peers, adults, employers and people in authority. Up to 75% of street boys are
subject to continued sexual abuse and exploitation by other youths, adults and
foreigners. Glue sniffing is relatively new in Nepal but is increasing at an
alarming rate amongst this street community becoming a peer group activity.
Street children as young as 5 are known to be sniffing dendrite which is a
legal substance used as a carpet and shoe glue and its availability is
difficult to control. The effects are instant: suppressing hunger and giving an
anaesthetic effect. Deep breathing of the Dendrite or using a lot over a short
period of time may result in losing touch with their surroundings, violent
behaviour and loss of self -control unconsciousness or even death. In short,</span><span style='font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: ""Arial"",""sans-serif""; color: #7F7F7F;'> </span><b><span style='font-size: 9.5pt; font-family: ""Arial"",""sans-serif""; color: #7F7F7F;'>these incredibly vulnerable

Welcome To My Yard
is an innovative not-for-profit social enterprise working with Nepali young people on the street to
provide holistic community based support, education, training, and income generation programmes. We hope that through our
dedication and creative approaches to involve and inspire and enable young
people we will have a positive social impact in the community.
 
The street children and young
people of Kathmandu Nepal
The street community
is made up of children and young people that are either street-living,street-families or may have basic accommodation but are forced onto
the streets to provide for themselves (street-working). They age from
2-25 both girls and boys. No one knows the exact number of street children in
Kathmandu Valley but estimates state over 1,000 with 500 new children and young
people added to the streets every year. The reasons for street children are
multiple and complex but include experiencing abuse and violence at home,
witness to alcohol misuse, difficulties with step-parents or extreme poverty in
rural areas forcing children to come to the city to seek work and then falling
into a dangerous street life. Whilst on the streets they are at high risk of
inhumane treatment, constant abuse and all types of exploitation from their
peers, adults, employers and people in authority. Up to 75% of street boys are
subject to continued sexual abuse and exploitation by other youths, adults and
foreigners. Glue sniffing is relatively new in Nepal but is increasing at an
alarming rate amongst this street community becoming a peer group activity.
Street children as young as 5 are known to be sniffing dendrite which is a
legal substance used as a carpet and shoe glue and its availability is
difficult to control. The effects are instant: suppressing hunger and giving an
anaesthetic effect. Deep breathing of the Dendrite or using a lot over a short
period of time may result in losing touch with their surroundings, violent
behaviour and loss of self -control unconsciousness or even death. In short, these incredibly vulnerable
children and young people need support...
 
But thatâ€™s not all we know about this community.....
All the facts above are a terrifying
reality for the street community that we work with, but we also know that out
of the most difficult situations come many strengths and a great deal of
resilience. Someoneâ€™s trauma is not the sum of who they are. These children, young people and young families
also have many incredible resources, talents and abilities individually and as
a community....in other words, they are amazing!!!! We want to partner with the children and young
people to build on these strengths. This means partnering with them to help
realise their potential , achieve their goals in life, through emotional
support and equipping them with the tools they need to positively support
themselves and their family.
 
What do we need?
We need a project centre in the heart
of this street community. This will
become a safe contact point in
which children and young people can come, receive
support and get into our programme which
helps them with work experience, vocational training and education
opportunities. The project space will run the innovative bite size education
and education workshops, kids clubs and young peopleâ€™s groups and provide a
place for our key workers to provide individual emotional support.
 
The Art Space
As part of our strengths based work,
we want to dedicate an entire wall of our building just for them. Children & Young people will have the
opportunity to use this space to express themselves in any way they like; murals, photographs, paintings and
more! We
will then exhibit their work for 2-3 months and invite the local community to
come and see what they have created. Then, we will white wash and start all
over again!
 
What will your donation cover?
Your funds will pay for the rent of a
project space and bills for one year and purchase art materials. If we manage
to raise over the amount, we will put it towards other much needed items for
the project such as equipment and basic salaries for the team as currently we
are all working as volunteers.

the young people so far like our indoor rock climbing programme, street
children photography book and see how we have funded young people already into
education or vocational training.

I could NOT be more excited as it is one of Kiva's first partnerships in India !!!</p>
<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p>Having worked in the private sector for five years in India, I wanted to do some impact driven work and be part of a more entrepreneurial environment in India by creating aggressive small scale investment programs. I felt the need to do MBA focusing on Social enterprise /International Development and traveled all the way to Washington, DC to study at Georgetown University.Looking for an opportunity that would provide me the necessary transformational experience for my summer internship, I chose to be a Kiva fellow. I knew Kiva would be a good start as Kiva does just that - creating small scale investment programs and connecting people with resources to entrepreneurs in need of resources.</p>
<p><strong>The Kiva Fellows Program</strong></p>
<p>The Kiva Fellow is an<strong> unpaid position</strong> designed to increase Kiva's impact and to offer participants like <strong>me </strong>a unique insider experience in the world of microfinance. The Kiva Fellow is an integral part of the Kiva Team, acting as Kiva's eyes and ears in the field and helping to extend limited resources to maximum effect. The Fellows focus on helping to improve the knowledge, capacity, and systems within their assigned Microfinance Institution (MFI).</p>

<p><strong>Why should you support</strong></p>
<p>As the Kiva Fellows Program is an <strong>unpaid</strong> position I need your help in covering my expenses. In order to get there, live there, work there and learn all that this experience has to offer, I estimate it to cost me $5000.I am asking you to help me cover half of these through how much ever small donation you can make.

<p>Welcome to my page, I hope you enjoy reading about
this exciting vision and the steps to make it achievable.  </p><p><b>About Me...</b></p>
<p>So firstly, a little about myself for those that
don’t know…</p>
<p>My name is Jessica; I’m 27 years old and have been
living in Brighton for almost ten years.</p>
<p>In this time I have volunteered for the following:</p>
<p>City Light - a charity working with women who have
been trafficked, or who work in the sex industry.</p>
<p>The A21 Campaign - a charity working against the
injustice of human trafficking</p>
<p>Safehaven Women - providing a safe space and a hot
meal, as well as on-sight beauty treatments for vulnerable women in Brighton
and Hove</p>
<p>I have also served as a support worker for homeless
young women (16-25yrs) for the last two years. In this time I have had the privilege of helping countless
women restore relationships, deal with addictions and get back into safe
accommodation.</p>
<p>Before this, I worked in the behavioural department
in various secondary schools. In addition to this I have a BA (Hons.) degree in
English and Education,  a Level 2 award in Counselling Skills and a vast
amount of training around current issues that affect vulnerable people.</p>
<p><b>About
the Vision...</b></p>
<p>It has become apparent to me that there is a gap in
providing safe, ongoing support for women who are victims of sexual abuse and domestic
violence (DV). Although Brighton has a host of refuge houses through RISE and
other DV charities, there are none that offer long-term accommodation with a
holistic approach (offering counselling, teaching and medical care). There are
currently only three mainstream women-only houses in Brighton and Hove (band 2, 3 and low
support) and only the latter will offer placements to women over 25 years old.</p>
<p>It is my desire that a house may be established which offers higher support and creates a caring family atmosphere, where women can feel they are coming home and not just arriving at a hostel. As part of this, free or discounted counselling (depending on the woman’s financial situation) would be offered for those who are residents there, alongside an array of other services to provide for all of the women's needs.</p>
<p>The hope is to link the project to charities I am
currently involved with and with local Churches. There would be an emphasis on
encouraging women to explore their own meaning of life and to link in with a
local recovery course that has supported so many through their battle over
addiction. It may also be the case that others pioneer this project before I am
fully qualified, in which case it would be a privilege to be able to join them
as a counsellor.</p>
<p>I have already made links concerning funding towards
this house and volunteers for the running of it. Please do contact me for more
details and I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Additionally
if you are a charity, Church or organisation that would like to be involved in
this house in the future or would like my support, please contact me for more details.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What
steps must be taken?…</b></p>
<p>In order to effectively support this service, I am studying a Postgraduate Diploma in Humanistic
Psychotherapeutic Counselling at the University of Brighton. In this time I am continuously making links with local charities towards this vision and to help raise funds to see it established. </p>
<p>I am also working  a part-time job to fund my living costs, which fits around my study, placement and therapy. </p><p>There is no student loan available for counselling post-grad courses and students are expected to fund the course themselves.<br/></p>

<p><b>What

</div></div>","Our Story
Hi, I am Darren Alston Black co-founder of skilllyst.com. That’s skill lyst.com 
What does the name skill lyst mean? It simply means using your skill as a catalyst for opportunity.
Well, what is skilllyst.com really?
Skilllyst is an open source skills oriented opportunity networking platform, dedicated to persons, small businesses, companies and skilled service providers who need an avenue and catalyst for opportunity and cannot afford to pay for exposure on a global scale. Skilllyst.com will allow registered users to create and capitalize on opportunity by listing, promoting and showcasing their individual skills, competence, ability and talents to potential employers, business partners and colleagues. The platform will be equipped with state of the art technology designed to truly make it easy for persons to seek and find opportunity. 
 
Overall, what are we trying to accomplish with skilllyst.com?
1.      Our passion is trying to do our part in reducing global unemployment by giving people an avenue for opportunity.
 
2.      To be the premier opportunity website in the world.
 
3.      To organize and promote all the people in the world’s skills to make them easily accessible so as to create opportunity.
 
4.      To be the website where people go to and get information to verify someone’s skill level by looking at their global, country, state or city ranking in their particular field, along with being able to confirm their credibility by looking at their endorsements and other proof of competence persons choose to showcase.
 
5.      To enable persons to help themselves and each other so as to generate and encourage a truly global community.
 
6.      To be the first and probably only platform in the world that rewards persons for helping themselves and others.
 


The Impact

 
So, why are we building it?
We are building skilllyst.com out of the desperate cry by many of our families, friends, acquaintances and even ourselves, the millions and probably billions of people around the world who just don’t know what to do next to find a job, keep their business open or find some form of opportunity. With the global economy in tatters and global unemployment at an all time high, we believe that a platform like skilllyst.com may be the catalyst that the world needs to stimulate the fragile global economy.
 

Why should people even use skillyst.com? Well firstly, for the great incentive program for all users e.g. 
1.      The individual with the most endorsements at the end of every month on the entire site gets their profile showcased on the home page of the website and a cash reward of $500.00 USD. This person will be showcased on the home page as the “most demanded person”.
 
2.      The individual who has sent the most “job for you” messages to their friends and associates at the end of every month receives a cash reward of $300.00 USD and will be showcased on the homepage as a “job Samaritan”.
 
3.      The individual who refers the most persons to their colleagues and friends to help people, at the end of the month receives a cash incentive of $400.00 USD and is showcased on the home page as the “top recommender”.
 
4.      The individual with the most persons in their skill link network at the end of the month gets a cash incentive of $300.00 USD and is showcased on the homepage as the “top networker”.
 
5.      The individual that sends the most “hire me” requests at the end of each month but still cannot find a job from the platform gets a cash incentive of $500.00 USD and is showcased on the homepage as the “most persistent job seeker”. 
 
These Incentive amounts will increase as the platform grows in popularity and use.
 
Companies/Small Business 
1.      The company/small business that hires the most persons from the site at the end of the month gets to advertise free on those persons profile pages. The more people you employ from the site the more free advertising you receive.



2. The first 100 companies and small
businesses that register gets to advertise for free for the first two months
after the website is launched.3. The company/small business that advertises the most on the site at the end of each month gets to be showcased on the home page for the entire preceding month and will be termed “company/small business of the month”.
 
Skilled Service Providers
1.      Free promotion of their skills on the website and on the homepage, which will be ranked based on the number of endorsements. 
 
Secondly, persons should use skilllyst.com because of the innovative features it has that is not being offered by other professional and business oriented networking sites e.g.

<h2>What is the LOLA Mobile Personal Emergency Response Stytem (mPERS)</h2>

<p>LOLA has many, many more features that bring an enhanced freedom and less anxiety to loved ones and to caregivers..... a greater peace of mind.</p>
<h2>Getting the word out about LOLA!</h2>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">                 <img alt=""20130810130050-6939"" class=""fr avatar lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/979391/pictures/original/20130810130050-6939.jpg?1376164849"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> Round Table Associates is a partner in Life2Go Inc.providing marketing and  promotional services, primarily videos, to corporations and not-for-profit-organizations.  Recently, we discovered the amazing LOLA (mPERS) that can remove stress and anxiety for those that are looking after their elders or children with challenges. There are over 720,000 in Canada alone who are burdened with both the raising of children and care of their elders.  They are called the ""sandwich generation"". The aging of our population is growing rapidly and is putting an increased demand on our medical system and resources. <br/></p>
<p>There is such a need for LOLA and LocationNow system, that we applied and received the distribution rights for Laipac Technology products in Canada. In the first phase, our plans are to produce at least a dozen specifically targeted introductory and promotional videos.  These will be widely distributed, along with an attractive Media package, to key venues, such as the multitude of Senior's Residences in Canada, through Care Giving Agencies, Family Care Givers and through Social Media. Our goal is to publicize LOLA through live event presentations, interactive video media, and selective advertising.</p>
<p>Launch: Sept/Oct 2013.</p>
<h2><strong>Stretch Funding</strong></h2>
<p>In the second phase, as funds are available, we will launch a TV advertising campaign.  If you help us reach our goal and beyond, we will apply the funds to create 30, 60, 120 second promos and a 15 and 30 minute infomercials for airing on TV. Launch: Nov/Dec 2013.</p>
<h2> How LOLA Changes Lives and Solves Problems</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Many of you can relate to elders, children and vulnerable members in your family who could benefit from the freedom and peace of mind that LOLA offers.  You know the burden of anxiety and worry over the expenses incurred in care giving. For example. Note the sample statistic regarding those suffering from Alzheimer's and dementia:</p>
<p>                           <img alt=""20130810121809-lost_child"" class=""fr avatar lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/979346/pictures/original/20130810121809-lost_child.jpg?1376162291"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt=""20130810121305-lost_found_picture_1"" class=""fr avatar lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/979338/pictures/cubepeep/20130810121305-Lost_Found_Picture_1.JPG?1376161988"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>""Wandering has proven such a common behavior that Alzheimer's experts predict that 60% to 70% of all people with Alzheimer's will wander away from safety at least once during the course of their illness.

The recently developed LOLA is the smallest and most technically advanced mPERS and locator device available.  It comes as an attractive lanyard pendant, only 5.4 x 4.0 x 1.6cm in size.  LOLA is ideal for providing freedom, safety and security for the elderly, people with cognitive and physical  challenges, Autistic Children, and, generally for people who are frequently alone working or playing in remote locations.  LOLA is integrated with LocationNow.com, a comprehensive dashboard database that sends alerts, monitors and stores data on the activities of the user, keeping them safe and secure no matter where they are. 
 

 
LOLA's coverage is virtually limitless and covers Canada from coast to coast.  If in other countries or territories, the mini SIM card can be changed to adapt to that particular location.
 
 
 
LOLA works with any digital communications device: i-Phone 4S, i-Phone 5,  i-Pad 3, i-Pad4, i-Pad Mini, New i-Pad Touch, Samsung Galaxy S3 & S4, Samsung Galaxy Note 2.
 LOLA FEATURES:

                          



SOS Alert
The SOS button, when pressed, immediately opens up a 2-way conversation with a designated phone, and someone you know, who can respond quickly to your emergency situation.  At the same time, a text message of the exact location and time of emergency will be sent to the designated e-mail and accessed through any digital communication device.

                          

G-Shock Motion Sensor                                                                 
The LOLA has a programmable accelerometer that can be set for 8 different levels of impact, from falls or a vehicle accident. When an impact occurs, 2-way conversation is automatically initiated and a text message of the location is sent.

                                                             
Real Time Location                                                                          
The LOLA has AGPS & GXM/GPRS so family members and caregivers can find their loved one should they wander and become lost (via LocationNow). Invaluable real time position reporting and automatic alerts are sent (entering/leaving geo-fences)

                           

Speaker Phone
When the LOLA user is in an emergency situation, they simply press the SOS Button and a 2-way conversation begins with the designated caregiver. No phone numbers to remember, just the press of a button.  If the caregiver cannot reach the LOLA user through regular means, they can contact the LOLA device directly. When the LOLA is called the 2-way communication opens automatically.

                           

Geo-fencing
On the LocationNow.com dashboard, Geo-fences can be created to alert when a person exits a ""safe area"" or enters a ""restricted or dangerous"" area.  Multiple Geo-fences can be created for to control movements of the LOLA user.

                          

Personal Emergency Info
LocationNow.com has a built in data logger to record events, personal profiles, medical history and medications plus much more.  At the click of a mouse, all of the information is at hand.
LOLA has many, many more features that bring an enhanced freedom and less anxiety to loved ones and to caregivers..... a greater peace of mind.
Getting the word out about LOLA!
                 
 Round Table Associates is a partner in Life2Go Inc.providing marketing and  promotional services, primarily videos, to corporations and not-for-profit-organizations.  Recently, we discovered the amazing LOLA (mPERS) that can remove stress and anxiety for those that are looking after their elders or children with challenges. There are over 720,000 in Canada alone who are burdened with both the raising of children and care of their elders.  They are called the ""sandwich generation"". The aging of our population is growing rapidly and is putting an increased demand on our medical system and resources. 
There is such a need for LOLA and LocationNow system, that we applied and received the distribution rights for Laipac Technology products in Canada. In the first phase, our plans are to produce at least a dozen specifically targeted introductory and promotional videos.  These will be widely distributed, along with an attractive Media package, to key venues, such as the multitude of Senior's Residences in Canada, through Care Giving Agencies, Family Care Givers and through Social Media. Our goal is to publicize LOLA through live event presentations, interactive video media, and selective advertising.
Launch: Sept/Oct 2013.
Stretch Funding
In the second phase, as funds are available, we will launch a TV advertising campaign.  If you help us reach our goal and beyond, we will apply the funds to create 30, 60, 120 second promos and a 15 and 30 minute infomercials for airing on TV. Launch: Nov/Dec 2013.
 How LOLA Changes Lives and Solves Problems

Many of you can relate to elders, children and vulnerable members in your family who could benefit from the freedom and peace of mind that LOLA offers.  You know the burden of anxiety and worry over the expenses incurred in care giving. For example. Note the sample statistic regarding those suffering from Alzheimer's and dementia:
                           
""Wandering has proven such a common behavior that Alzheimer's experts predict that 60% to 70% of all people with Alzheimer's will wander away from safety at least once during the course of their illness. Many will wander 6 to 8 times before they are placed into a residential facility or an outside, qualified caretaker is brought into the home to help."" 
Then there are the millions of dollars a year spent on expenses in recovering a host of victims that wander and become lost.  
                       
""Without effective procedures and equipment, searches can involve multiple agencies, hundreds of officers, countless man hours and thousands of dollars. More importantly, because time is of the essence, every minute lost increases the risk of a tragic outcome for the Alzheimer's patient, their caregivers and their families,"" says Christine M. Platz, Director of Media and Communications for Project Lifesaver.

<h3 align=""justify"">Our Story</h3>
<p align=""justify"">Thanks for reading our story.  We are Sal &amp; Val and have been happily married for 14 years now.  Completly blessed with finding a love that many wait their entire life for.  We waited 42 years, surviving previous  marriages.  We cherish and appreciate each other and remain grateful no matter what we go through. Times changed for  us  a few years ago when the economy took a dive.  We fell on very hard financial times.  Never thought we would be in this place.  We had great jobs.  When the recession hit we both were laid off.  We felt like we were thrown out with the dirty bath water.  We tried to find new employment. I went back to work again but at a much reduced wage. Still I was happy to be working again.  But I was laid off again last May, double blow.  Discouraged  after many  rejections we decided to listen to our friends, and follow our dream by making our pasta sauces to sell.  It blessed our Italian hearts to feed friends by making them comfort food that is also healthy. Thats where our name came from. Italian Hearts.  Our  friend Nick Barouch painted us our fabulous art work that is our cover pic. Just waiting for funds to make it into a label.  We have been working our business for about 6 months now. We love working and being together, for us its great joy. We are better when we are together.  It shows in what we cook, hey we are Italians! We also believe God ordains our steps and nothing is ever wasted, each step brings us closer to our dreams being fulfilled. We know our foundation is being laid. So far  most of our money goes right back into the business advancing our steps.  We have learned a lot in 8 months and met many wonderful people.  Problem is we are hanging unto our home by a thread and barely keeping our utilities on with some food. We lost both our cars, currently we drive a friends car. We both have lost about 40lbs over this last year by food rationing.  We eat healthy so instead of eating processed or refined foods we ate much less.  Our hearts and passion is for organic healthy foods.  So in these hard financial times we wanted to create a healthy meal that is delicious,  fast and inexpensive.  Costs the same to serve our sauce with pasta for a quick meal as it costs to buy fast food that is not good for you at all.  Its easy to be a great cook, we help you by doing most of the work for you!  We saw others embrace this concept as our Christmas sales were wonderful praise God.  Many people gave our sauces as their Christmas gifts.  We did our first local show with rave reviews as we had samples for tasting.  All this has helped to sustain  us thus far!  We appreciate and understand this has been a journey as we grow and learn with each new step. We love our friends that have been so supportive and helped us on a local level. We're ready for more exposure.   As you invest in us and our business you will be a life changer!    And we will be forever grateful.  We have been  knocked down but not out!  Our spirits press forward daily. Word  to ""Foodies""  have you heard comfort foods are in especially Italian?!  WE can do this!   Please help us follow our dream.  We can produce fabulous food!  And there is something amazing that happens when we step out of our own little world and help someone else in need, its called compassion. You get to be a piece of someone elses journey, pieces that come together to release the dream.   Really leaving a positive footprint.  What if our entire economy was rebuilt on this concept of people helping people?  What a world we would have, be a life changer starting with us! That my friend is a Grassroots Movement!  PLEASE help make our dream happen.  Make a difference = be a difference.  We believe in this concept of building business by people helping other people so much that  we can't wait to be in position to do the same for someone else.  Let's  take back America on this concept of people helping other people. We are launching this business, and need some sponsorships to met goals.  </p>

We believe we will make it as we have had fabulous reviews and stores waiting to carry our sauces.  After we secure our living expenses so we do not become homeless we will use all and any funds to advance to new levels in our business.  We started with just great sauce and zero money! Friends helped us buy supplies to make our first batch to sell. We are people of faith and believe in Miracles. We also know by experience that God likes to use people who have hearts to help others to bring forth those miracles.  We hope you are one of those people.  We have already experienced this along the journey that we have been on up to this point.  Please spread the word of our story.  We had a call the other day from someone we did not know that said "" word on the streets is that you have the best sauce in the land, we want some!""  We love those street people!  We see this story involves many wonderful people, its bigger than just us.  We have watched God build people as He is building our business.  Please help us by being a people builder.

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>   My name is David...Im posting this to help my sister and her family. I live in Michigan and they live all the way in Ingleside Texas, so there is only so much I can do to help. Just 3 days ago, my sister's neighbors house caught fire. The fire was so intence, it spread to her house. The entire section of the house is a complete loss due to fire, smoke and water damage. The areas effected are, the laundry room, garage, living room, the kids play/class room and some of the kitchen. Everyone including the pets made it out ok.  </p>
<p>   My sister Candice and her husband Derrick have five children. Cayder-8, Parker-6, Aubrey-4, Aleisa-2 and last but not least, Kylie is only 5 months old. They also have 3 dogs. Candice is a stay at home mom and she home schools the older kids. Derrick works full time as a truck driver. As I was speaking with Candice today, they just found out that because the home owners insurance was not in their name, NOTHING inside of the house will be covered.</p>
<p>   PLEASE, ANY HELP WOULD BE SO GREATFUL!! They don't have the money to start over, so ANYTHING would help!!</p>
<p>   Any donations will go to a deposit to a new place to live, every day household items, school supplies and hope to a new beginning.</p>

<p>My name is Tamara Horton and I am trying to take the necessary steps in pursuing my passions in a more professional setting. I need your help with taking these steps.</p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><em><strong>A little about me:</strong></em></span></h3>
<p>I live on beautiful Whidbey Island, where I was born and raised. I am truly passionate about living in tune with nature in a modern way. I am an active community member, volunteering at multiple local non-profits. After attending college I chose to move back to my home town to help make a positive change in myself and my community.</p>
<p>I began my college career at Edmonds CC, where I received a General AA and Small Business Management/Entreprenuership Certificate. During my time at Edmonds I attended a study abroad program in Florence, Italy, Spring Quarter of 2005, after which I chose to travel Europe alone for the summer, it was an experience of a lifetime. After recieving the WAVE Grant (WA Award for Vocational Excellence) which paid for 2 more years tuition, I attended The Evergreen State College, receiving my Bachelor of Arts focused in Sustainability.</p>
<p>I have volunteered with WSU Extension Program: Waste Wise (waste remediation outreach program), Transition Whidbey, South Whidbey Commons Coffeehouse/Bookstore, Good Cheer Food Bank Garden, Outdoor Classroom (K-5 environmental education program), Americorps, and several others. These have all been and will continue to be truly fulfilling and educational experiences for me.</p>
<p>I have held a wide variety of jobs, but 90% of them have nothing to do with any of my ultimate goals. I am currrently a green housecleaner and milk woman...though I do enjoy my work I am trying to move more towards where my passions, abilities and community demand coincides.</p>
<p>My goal is to become a <strong>Sustainability Consultant</strong>, helping people and businesses function in a more sustainable way. I plan to start off by working with individuals and small businesses, as a sort of Sustainability Organizer or Assistant. Helping to gather together the information, insight and people necessary to achieve whatever the client is trying to do. I would do the footwork so they don't have to, whether that is analysis, research, correpsondance, organizing, referrals, project management, or actual implementation of a project. I might also incorporate selling retail products. I estimate I could increase my rate from $10-20/hr to $25-50/hr once I have completed these steps, with a possibility of more, but I want to keep my rates reasonably affordable.</p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Example of work:</strong></span></h3>
<p>Someone wants to do a lifestyle face-lift to reduce bills and carbon footprint while improving health and emergency preparedness/resilience. I might:</p>
<ul>
<li>organize an Energy Auditor to do a site analysis for them</li>
<li>help them change daily habits</li>
<li>purchase low-energy appliances and cost saving gadgets</li>
<li>choose healthier, lower impact food at a moderate price</li>
<li>introduce them to green cleaning methods</li>
<li>start a small garden/greenhouse or other landscaping projects</li>
<li>research and install a rain catchment system</li>
<li>help stock a pantry for emergencies</li>
<li>look into installing off-grid energy source alternatives</li>
<li>greywater remediation systems</li>
<li>composting systems</li>
<li>composting toilets</li>
<li>options for remodeling to better align with green building practices</li>
<li>researching permits, zoning, codes etc.</li>
<li>customized research reports, action plans and maybe even personal reminders</li>
<li>and much more</li>
</ul><p>I do have relevant degrees as welll as experience in this field through various jobs, volunteer work, personal projects and research...but I need more specific training/credentials in order to pursue this career path. These will all help me pursue several careers within this field. The early steps in this process are:</p>

<p><strong>This Campaign:</strong></p>
<p>The first step is attending a Permaculture Design Course coming up in July. I need to raise at least $1,600 ($1,200 for class + $300 for work missed + IndieGoGo fee). This course provides an internationally recognized certificate and experiential education in most of the areas I need training in at this moment. If I do not get the funds raised in time for the upcoming Permaculture program I will apply the money raised towards one or two of the other steps or find a Permaculture program at a different establishment.</p>

<p>Last year I had an overwhelmingly positive response to my request for help attending Generation Waking Up Leadership Training...<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">I raised over $1,000 in ONE DAY</span>, just from FB, word of mouth and a local list serve. My community has shown me time and time again that it is willing to invest in my future. This has moved me in ways I cannot describe, and I am very greatful for their support. It was difficult for me to ask for money, just as it is now.</p>
<p>The world needs more people helping to show how to have a smaller physical impact while having a larger societal and environmental impact. If we are to continue living on this planet we must do so in a way which balances financial and material wealth with the wealth of the natural world. I wish to help my community incorporate concepts such as: Whole systems approach, cradle to cradle, think globally act locally, triple bottom line, permaculture, 7 generations thinking, LEED, and zero net impact. By functioning in smarter ways in our daily lives both at home and at work, we can shift from a destructive society to a constructive one (see pic above), while still living a modern lifestyle. In order to do this there need to be guides...I seek to be one of those guides.</p>

can remember we have been food motivated, and that didn't change when I had to
go Gluten Free. It just got a little more difficult to find food to get really
excited about.</p>
<p>We are working to make that search a little easier. Between us, Chris
and I have almost 30 years in the restaurant industry. Food is our passion and
our calling. Almost nothing on Earth makes us happier than seeing people enjoy
good food with good company. Good food doesn't have to be fancy. It’s your
mother’s fried chicken or your grandmother’s pie crust.  It’s chocolate
cake on your birthday. It’s a big bowl of corn chowder in the winter or fresh
fruit cobbler in the summer. It’s crusty, chewy bread you can slather with
butter. It’s tasty, and it’s real, and it makes you feel good from the inside
out.</p>

They didn't provide much nutrition and our recipes came out gritty or gummy. It took over a year and a LOT of trial and error, but I developed an
all-purpose flour mixture that really mimics wheat flour for most applications.
AND it is 40% whole grains, which was important to me. </span><br/></p>
<p>Chris and I are here today to ask for your help in expanding the Angry
Duck Bakery. Your donation will help us build a professional production kitchen and bring our
flour and flour mixes to the table. Angry Duck flours are free of all eight
major allergens: wheat, milk, soy, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, shellfish, and eggs.
We use it every day in our house and our bakery. </p>
<p>Our goal is to open the Angry Duck Bakery in a permanent location
within 6 months. We currently do custom baking, including wholesale, and our
cakes and focaccia rolls are carried at Hazel in Brattleboro, VT, and the Flat
Iron Exchange in Bellows Falls, VT. We want to expand our reach in Vermont, New
Hampshire, the capital region of New York, Western Massachusetts, and beyond.
We’re willing to put in the time, passion, dedication, and energy. We’re asking
for your help with funding. Your donation will allow us to buy professional equipment like a standing oven, a 30 qt Hobart mixer, and a bread proofing cabinet.  The more money we can raise, the shorter our timeline.</p>
<p>As people and as a company, we believe in giving back. After our first
year in business, we will donate 10% of our profits to food banks in the
Connecticut River Valley region of New Hampshire and Vermont. There is no limit
on this gift; the more we make, the more we will donate.</p>
<p>If you fund us, you will receive our undying gratitude and an
enthusiastic thank you! Along with that, and some fun little perks like
stickers, mugs, and t-shirts, you will also receive a gift certificate for 10%
of your total donation amount which you can keep for yourself, give to others,
or donate back to us and we will pass on the equivalent amount of money or
goods to our local food banks.</p>
<p>You can help us realize our dreams. If you can, donate. If you can’t,
help us get the word out! Share our story with your friends, help us get people
interested; the Angry Duck is off the ground, you can help us make her soar.

<h4>It was another long desert ride back on the highway of cruelty. The engine roared through the night as the moon pierced the darkness. Gripping the wheel, his knuckles went white with ambition. A family of three siblings thirst for entrepreneurial desire. They ripped through a barrage of twisted ideas to better the haven they call, 'The City of Sin'.<br/>The union of soul and raw body, in which we call life, has been fed with the ultimate convenience through crushing metal technology, presenting more free time for pure thrashing enjoyment and treasures this world has to offer.

The youthful liquid we drown our sorrows and fill with the amusement of festivity and rock and roll. There was no doubt that the three could not ignore a concept of such marvel.

We have the solution for you..Who are we?    
Hello! We are two software engineers currently working in Ireland. We are very enthusiastic about technology, but our interests are not only in it. We have a shared passion for healthy food and a good culinary culture. We conceived the idea for homefood4u while having lunch one day.
 The idea was born as we realized that we do not like fastfood, but do not always have time to prepare home-cooked meals. Believing that there can be cooperation between people on food, we started working on this project during the our free time. We hope that homefood4u can be a start for people to see food in a different way.How are we going to spend the money?We have developed our application for free so far, during our spare time, week end, etc..But unfortunately not everything is for free. We'd need money for web hosting (in particular cloud services). Licences for software tools, designers, further developments like support new countries and languages and advertisement.How does our idea work?Visit web page www.homefood4u.com !When you access to the website, your position will be retrieved and daily offers around you will be shown in the map.Figure 1. Homepage Map.If you want to check all the offers available per date, position, name..etc..You can access the offers section. All the offers will be shown in order of distance.     Figure 2. Offer ListClicking on an offer you can discover more like the chef description, the chef reviews and other useful information..and of course, purchase the offer! attached here is a screenshot of the mobile version.                                                                                 Figure 3. Mobile SiteIn order to buy a meal you need to register in the website. When you place an order, the system will connect you with the cook..allowing both of you to communicate to each other through the messages section.. In the feedback section you can also leave a feedback and a review and let other knows about your experience.Of course, when you are registered to our website, 
you can also create offers. To insert an offer, just type the name, a 
description, when the order can be collected by your ""customers"" and 
when the offer will expire. Insert a fare price and add a picture to 
make the offer more attractive.        Figure 4. Creating an offer.When
 an order has been placed  by a customer, you will receive a 
notification message and the pick up information (the one set in your 
profile) will be sent to the customer.Please visit www.homefood4u.comThank you",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">You may think such bullying could never occur where you live. Unfortunately, it probably already has. Last year in Texas, for example, S.W.A.T. teams were deployed to the peaceful Garden of Eden Community as a Gestapo-style intimidation tactic. Officers arrested only one individual, based on unrelated traffic tickets, and issued a handful of citations for city code infractions. Officials found absolutely no drug-related violations, and all inhabitants of the community were unarmed.</span><br/></p>
<p>Each of the community members present in the group's house were initially handcuffed at gunpoint by heavily armed S.W.A.T. officers. This included the mother of a toddler and a two-week old baby. As part of the raid, many of the community's edible crops were destroyed. Officers removed a variety of materials the community had planned to use in sustainability projects.</p>
<p>Garden of Eden is a sustainable community which lives outside of the confines of the 'average lifestyle.' The community believes in coming together to produce the basic necessities of life, and members support one another through each step. They grow their own food and live quietly. Since 2009, the group has been providing food, shelter and sustainability education classes to the public for free.</p>
<p>We want Florida's ballot initiative to serve as the model for similar reform in other states. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Contribute to this campaign if you share our belief that something is terribly wrong with state and local governments criminalizing responsible, sustainable living.</b></span></p>

<p>Contributions will be used to collect the tens of thousands of signatures required to place our amendment on the 2016 ballot. In addition, we will hire attorneys to prepare for mandatory legal proceedings before the Florida Supreme Court. </p>
<p>As a major campaign, we need election consultants and media advisers to assist us. In the six months leading up to the vote, we will need money for billboards, television commercials and radio ads, not to mention yard signs and bumper stickers.</p>
<p>Because we anticipate well-funded opposition from the fossil fuels and utilities industries, it is imperative that we assemble a team of highly-qualified campaign professionals to ensure our success.

Currently, statutes and ordinances make it illegal to disconnect a Florida home from local utilities. Last year, those laws were used to jail Cape Coral, Florida resident Robin Speronis for five weeks, including two weeks in solitary confinement. Her crimes? Collecting rainwater and using solar power to meet her daily utilities needs. Speronis' story has made international headlines. See Bloomberg Businessweek  for a recent example. Contribute to this campaign if you agree that individuals should have the right to select reasonable alternatives to monopolized local utilities services.



Why Should You Care?
You may think such bullying could never occur where you live. Unfortunately, it probably already has. Last year in Texas, for example, S.W.A.T. teams were deployed to the peaceful Garden of Eden Community as a Gestapo-style intimidation tactic. Officers arrested only one individual, based on unrelated traffic tickets, and issued a handful of citations for city code infractions. Officials found absolutely no drug-related violations, and all inhabitants of the community were unarmed.
Each of the community members present in the group's house were initially handcuffed at gunpoint by heavily armed S.W.A.T. officers. This included the mother of a toddler and a two-week old baby. As part of the raid, many of the community's edible crops were destroyed. Officers removed a variety of materials the community had planned to use in sustainability projects.
Garden of Eden is a sustainable community which lives outside of the confines of the 'average lifestyle.' The community believes in coming together to produce the basic necessities of life, and members support one another through each step. They grow their own food and live quietly. Since 2009, the group has been providing food, shelter and sustainability education classes to the public for free.
We want Florida's ballot initiative to serve as the model for similar reform in other states. Contribute to this campaign if you share our belief that something is terribly wrong with state and local governments criminalizing responsible, sustainable living.


Our Financial Needs
Contributions will be used to collect the tens of thousands of signatures required to place our amendment on the 2016 ballot. In addition, we will hire attorneys to prepare for mandatory legal proceedings before the Florida Supreme Court. 
As a major campaign, we need election consultants and media advisers to assist us. In the six months leading up to the vote, we will need money for billboards, television commercials and radio ads, not to mention yard signs and bumper stickers.
Because we anticipate well-funded opposition from the fossil fuels and utilities industries, it is imperative that we assemble a team of highly-qualified campaign professionals to ensure our success. Between now and the November 2016 election, there will be fierce competition for public approval. Contribute to this campaign if you want to send a message to ""Big Utilities"" that paid lobbyists should not control public policy.


Our Philosophy
The late Nelson Mandela once said, ""To be free is not merely to cast off one's chains, but to live in a way that respects and enhances the freedom of others."" Contribute to this campaign if you agree with that idea. 


For working together, like Mr. Mandela, we can change the world.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are Mandie, Dominic and Golde and we are a little family who hope to make a local coffee joint in Ennis a reality.</p>
<p>When we moved here over a year and half ago after getting hitched in California, we were just two crazy kids who were shocked to learn there was no local coffee spot.  The old historic area seemed like the perfect place for one. We said, 'Someone should really open one up! It would be so great to have a spot to hang out in'.  Soon, those someones became us. Mandie had been tinkering at home for years to create her own coffee recipes and they seemed to be a big hit when she served them to friends and family. When Dominic and Mandie heard about vendors needed at the local Farmer's Market they thought, 'What the heck? Let's try to sell a few!' Through all of the support from amazing Ennis locals, it wasn't long before our humble coffee stand became a hit. We were no longer the ""Crazy Californians"" but became the ""Coffee Couple"" (Ennis likes alliteration).  </p>

<p>Our vision for the coffee shop focuses on being local. Did you know that Ennis has one of the best locally roasted source of beans in North Texas? Buna Bean serves locations all around the Dallas area and Waxahachie. Yet, there has sadly been no local coffee shop in our town to serve that coffee. Let's take local to the next level! A spot to serve locally roasted coffee, a place to sit down while enjoying a day at the fantastic new Ennis Farmer's Market, a hangout for groups of all kinds.</p>
<p>With a background in non-profit management and now working for the local Catholic church, Dominic knows just how important community is to keeping people healthy and happy. We need our community to bounce ideas off of, support us in the hard times and celebrate with the good. </p>
<p>Because a warm cup of coffee is sometimes all someone needs to open up to someone else, the coffee shop has proven to be an amazing place to congregate and share our passions, a place to escape for some relaxation, a place to grow together with others, a place for different people to intersect and interact -  church groups, stay-at-home moms, teens to hang out after school. Both Mandie and Dominic have extensive experience hanging out in coffee shops and know just what makes a comfortable relaxing place to relax with a book or a friend.</p> </div> <div> <h3>This Goal of Ours</h3>
<p>If we do not manage to reach our goal, we will still be open as our shop is already self-sustaining, but it may be on a part-time basis and the espresso machine will probably have to wait.  We have to purchase some equipment that is absolutely necessary to be a professional coffee shop. </p>
<p>If we go over our goal, there is plenty of places for that money to go! We would most likely be able to purchase more furniture for sitting areas and decorations to create a more inviting atmosphere. We will already be spending as much of our own money as we can to expand, but every little bit more helps to make us grow that much quicker.</p>
<h3>So What's the Challenge?</h3>
<p>We are starting small. We won't be open 7 days a week, 12 hours a day any time soon. However, we still think we can give you a great tasting product and keep slowly expanding as our resources allow.</p>
<p>Almost every dollar we make from this coffee shop has been poured directly back into improvements. We have already upgraded and expanded so many items since we started with the coffee shop under the pop-top. Because this is not the primary source of support for our family, reinvesting our profits back into the company is exactly what we plan to do for the foreseeable future.  And then eventually, with your help, maybe all the big ideas we are dreaming about will become reality!</p> </div> <div> <h3>And There Are Other Ways To Help</h3>
<p>Share and prayer. These are the two secret weapons of our coffee shop and this campaign. Share as much as you can on social media, your friends, and the people you work with.  Every little bit counts so even if you don't have the funds, you may know several people who may.  And we could always use your prayers so that we know where this coffee shop is headed and do with it as God intends.</p>

<p>Many thanks for all your support so far, it's really appreciated! We really look forward to continuing to serve all of you and helping make our local community more inviting to all! </p>

<p>This campaign is important to us for many reasons.

<p>When you contribute to Vegan Royalty you aren't just contributing to a dream of ours, but to the non-profits we believe in. One of those non-profits is an animal sanctuary and the other an organization that helps to put gardens in schools. </p>
<p>To get our profit margins higher, we
need to order in higher volume. We are now at the point we need to take this
product line to the next level. As the
Founder, over the last year, I have worked out the details. I have found the
materials, the printers, the embroidery and the designer of logos etc. and
produced the website. I have gotten this project as far as I can being a single
Mother. I want to truly see the other products come to life.<span>  Your contributions will help us to order more
product at one time, in the end get the profit margin higher which will allow
us to give back to the non-profits that are in alignment with our mission. We
currently are working to give back to two local non-profits. One is an animal
sanctuary for farm animals here in Las Vegas and the other places gardens and
health &amp; fitness programs in local low income schools. Both of these
non-profits are close to our hearts. </span></p>
<p>Vegan Royalty is also paying a
little more to be private labeled. We are very excited to see this come to life
as well.</p>
<p>We are also having our Launch Party
in Las Vegas the first week in March.<span>  We
are getting a lot of the details in line now and some of those details are
being donated and some will require a few dollars to make it all go. I am
currently working on recycled pieces for the models to wear with the tees and
tanks already produced. I would love to have more available not only on our
website by then, but in hand to sell that evening for a special price. This
Launch Party is going to be a Fashion Show. We have a D.J. donating their time,
lights and food and beverage. It will be held at a local art gallery in
Downtown Las Vegas. We are looking forward to making this a really big deal. I
have experience with event planning and won’t miss a detail! The event will be
exposed in the media and be featured in a local style magazine. If we exceed
the goal I will but some towards any marketing of the product. </span></p>
<p>Right now my main hurdle is funds to
purchase in higher volume. I feel like I have done the research on most things
already and worked out any kinks the last year. </p>

<h3>The Guerrilla Street Food Brick and Mortar</h3>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are Brian Hardesty and Joel Crespo.</p>
<p>We own Guerrilla Street Food, St. Louis' first and only Filipino food truck.  Over the last 2 years, we have been working hard to build and maintain a food truck that strives to provide our guests with the best possible experience they can have dining on the street. What you may not know is we have also been planning and working towards building a brick and mortar restaurant.</p>
<p>The demand for our food has been through the roof, especially since appearing on the Food Network show, <i>""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives</i>."" It also didn't hurt that our dish, ""The Flying Pig"", was named the best dish in St. Louis', over all other restaurants in the city! And now after being named #17 Best Food Truck in the country by Dailymeal.com, we feel that<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> the time is right to push forward and put all of our chips in the middle. It's time for a home for Guerrilla Street Food.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Our Goal is $115,000</h3>
<p>We realize that our goal is pretty lofty so, let us break it down for you.</p>
<p>100% of the funding will be going towards renovating and equipping an existing space in the city. We will be updating the exterior, purchasing ovens, sinks, cash registers, building custom equipment like a wood fired Lechon grill, a handmade immersion circulator, signage, etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/75656/files/20130915120042-lechon.jpg?1379271642"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>When completed, we will immediately establish ourselves as the finest Filipino Restaurant in the city. You will be able to get your usual food truck favorites at one convenient location, as well as a new expanded menu of dishes what we have not previously been able to offer.  Furthermore, the restaurant will also act as a hub for our food truck and more trucks to come in the future!</p>
<p><b>If we do not reach our goal</b>, we will hold on to these funds and add to them, via applying for loans, private investors, etc. The plan will then be to reach that goal as soon as we possibly can and move forward with the space.  We will also consider alternative locations that can accommodate our budget if need be.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Guerrilla Street Food has always been the little guy. Our truck was handmade by us and our close friends; getting our hands dirty and calling on the generosity of those that believe us. So, it feels natural to give crowd-source funding a try. Our fans have always been kind to us, as well as honest about what they want to see from us: quality, affordability, and just really good food. I believe we continue to make good on that.  We put our own blood, sweat and tears into this business and so we operate out of a genuine desire to do our best for you all.  And rest assured, we will continue to do so in our restaurant. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Karma Coffee Shop is a independently owned coffee shop located in Wayne, MI. We have been in business since 2010 and have created a haven for people young and old, in a city where there previously was none.</p>
<p>We have live music every weekend for only the price of a drink and open mic on Tuesdays which has become a staple for many. Karma hosts many events and shows enabling locals to display their talents where they may not have had an outlet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In June of 2011, we were informed that our lease would not be renewed and would have to find a new location.</p>
<p>This has caused our shop to be closed untill we find a new building. By having to move so suddenly we were not prepared to start over and rebuild a store front from scratch.</p>
<p>Luckily we have found a possible new building and would like to move in soon, but we need funding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A coffee shop makes a city, it gives a place to relax, meet with friends, enjoy music, or just work in a different location. Help our city get its beloved Karma Coffee Shop back. It would mean the world to us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Karma Coffee Shop has become a home away from home for our customers. We create all our drinks with love and know the majority of our customers by name or favorite drink.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe that every city needs a coffee shop and want to reopen Karma Coffee Shop and bring our ideas back to life.</p>
<p>Without out Karma Coffee reopening in Wayne, where will aspiring artists and budding musicans go to showcase there talent? The impact will be devistating to our customers and to us. We believe in bringing the arts and a feeling of a home away from home to the people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Please help our Baristas get back to work and let us give our city a nice place to hang out.</p>
<p>If we are unable to get enough funds we will be forced to stay closed permantly.</p>
<p>This is not an option that we or our customers are comfortable with.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Doesn't everyone need an independent coffee shop in their town?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To reopen Karma we will need around $3,000 to pay for city fees, lease down payment, supplies,and misc costs associated with opening.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since Karma has been an established business for over a year and a half, we do not need to buy equipment,counters, tables, etc associated with running a coffee shop. We have all of these items already in storage and waiting for a new home.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Thanks to our wonderful customers we recieved a nice donation towards our moving costs, but we still need more.</p>
<p>This is where you can help! Any amount you can help with will be put to good use towards opening our new doors!</p>

I am 27 years young and live in a <a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps?q=eck+en+wiel&amp;hl=nl&amp;sll=27.7,85.333333&amp;sspn=0.165059,0.338173&amp;hnear=Eck+en+Wiel,+Buren,+Gelderland,+Nederland&amp;t=m&amp;z=13"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">tiny village</a> in the middle of Holland where everything is as flat as can be. My dream is to start up a business in a whole different landscape: near the foothills of the Himalaya in <a href=""https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Kathmandu,+Nepal&amp;hl=nl&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=37.735377,86.572266&amp;oq=kathmandu&amp;hnear=Kathmandu,+Bagmati,+Central+Region,+Nepal&amp;t=m&amp;z=12"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Kathmandu</a>. Why you ask? Please allow me to tell you a bit more and I'll even answer the what, who and when. <br/><br/></p>
<h2><strong>Why?</strong></h2>
<p>It’s not that I just woke up one day and thought: “You know what would be nice? Let’s go to the other end of the world and start up a business there!” No, I’ve already been to Nepal quite a few times over the years.</p>
<p>During my first stay I did some volunteer work <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/88969735@N05/8128347905/in/photostream"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">teaching English</a> at a tiny school. I met the most wonderful people over there (but more about them at the who-part) and had the time of my life. Two years later I started an organization called <a href=""http://www.stichtingfairchance.nl/nl/english/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fair Chance</a> with some friends of mine. Fair Chance helps underprivileged children through school and college in Nepal. When we started out we had just 4 boys in school, now we are already up to 50 kids!</p>
<p><img alt=""Nepal"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.nepal.nl/images/kaartnepal.gif"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: top;""/></p>
<p>I love Nepal and the people over there. I would love to be able to spend more time there and it is possible. Nepal is wedged in between India and Chine, two of the biggest emerging markets in the world. The Nepali economy is also growing at a quick pace. Even though Nepal is still a 3<sup>rd</sup> world country, things are <a href=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kgnZz4W-ooY/TqEbBbWvwLI/AAAAAAAAP54/L5plEx_9WEc/poverty%252520trends%252520in%252520Nepal.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">changing quickly</a>. In 2001 over 55% of the population still had to live on less than $1 a day. That number has dropped to about 19% in 2010 and it’s still declining! Nepal’s middle class is growing rapidly. More and more people have a little extra to spend, which brings us to the what.      <br/><br/></p>
<h2><strong>What?</strong></h2>
<p>Laser tag! What? Yes, you heard me: laser tag. As I said the Nepali middle class is growing rapidly. More and more people have some money to spend in their free time. Right now there aren’t that many options for Nepalis to choose from. There are a handful of <a href=""http://qfxcinemas.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">big cinemas</a> who have about 200.000 visitors a month. Other than that there are just a few bowling alleys and a buck load of cheap bars, but that’s about it.</p>
<p><img alt=""Laser tag!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8048/8122933102_8ab951b33b_z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span lang=""EN-US"">So laser tag! The Roswell Incident</span> will be the very first laser tag arena in Nepal. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_tag"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Laser tag</a> is a popular game all over the world. The game is comparable to paintball, but instead of firing balls of paint people wear <a href=""http://www.lasermaxx.com/uploads/widget/photos/.thumbs/01_lasermaxx-lasertag-evo5-vest_3dc819.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">vests with hit points</a> and shoot with laser guns. Laser tag is being played in an indoor <a href=""http://www.lasermaxx.com/uploads/widget/photos/12_lasermaxx-lasertag_arena3.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">arena</a>. To create an incredible experience for the players, the arena is filled up with fog, black light and all kinds of funky decorations.</p>
<p>This ‘product’ is the first thing that will set us aside from our competition. We have plans to build a laser tag center, complete with bar in <a href=""http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/36217213.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">American ’60 Diner style</a>, instruction- and vesting area and of course a 300 square meter laser tag arena that will be big enough for 20 players at a time.</p>
<p>The second thing that will set us aside is quality. In Nepal things have ‘the tendency to break down’. Whenever you are out to enjoy yourself, something is about to break. It’s a major pain in the *ss. What will set us aside from the competition is good quality equipment. The laser tag equipment that we’ll use has been build according to the highest standards in the business. It can be run over by a truck and will still work!</p>
<p>Third is service. Once you enter The Roswell Incident you will feel welcome. The staff will be very friendly and you’ll immediately feel like you belong.<br/><br/></p>

<h2><strong>Who?</strong></h2>
<p>I won’t be running this business alone, two very dear friends of mine will help me out. Let me introduce you to them as well:</p>
<p><strong>Uttam<br/><br/></strong><img alt=""Uttam"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8465/8122982613_661414d4b1_m.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px; float: right;""/>First up is Uttam. Uttam is 19 and has lived in Kathmandu his whole life. He hasn't had a very good start in life. His family has been falling apart pretty much from the day that he was born. His father left the family when Uttam was still very young. Uttam’s older brother left too when Uttam was just 9 years old. At that point his mother made him quit school and start looking for work. He ended up on the streets of Thamel selling self-made drawings to tourists.</p>
<p>Uttam was 12 years old when he went to the zoo one day with two of his closest friends. At 5:00 pm the boys returned home, where Uttam got the shock of a lifetime. When he opened the door of his apartment all was gone. The only things that remained were his clothes and a bed. The lady next door had to tell him that his mother had left with her boyfriend to go live with him. His mother said Uttam was old enough to take care of himself. At the age of 12, Uttam was all alone.</p>
<p><img alt=""Uttam's house"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8328/8109782764_f43f5eddee_z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>He didn’t have time to realize what had happened. He just went back to drawing pictures and selling them the very next day. He managed to collect enough money to stay alive for about a month. That’s when I ran into him. We started a conversation and it didn’t take him long to explain what had happened to him. I felt sorry for him and wanted to help out. Luckily I would be in Nepal for another 5 months. I helped Uttam move to a new place where the father of his best friend agreed to keep an eye on him. Also Uttam went <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/fair_chance/3299683065/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">back to school</a> again for the first time in 3 years.</p>
<p>Uttam is now 19. He did very well in school and passed his high school exams with flying colors. At the moment he’s studying Management at a college in Kathmandu. He’s living together with his girlfriend and enjoys life every day. His big dream is becoming independent. Starting a business is his way of doing that. A dream that you can now help him with.     </p>
<p><strong>Sunil</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Sunil"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8188/8109774871_bfddea7cc1_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px;""/>The third partner in this venture is Sunil (20). His start in life also wasn’t optimal. Sunil actually lived on the streets as a <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/fair_chance/3282511996/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">street kid</a> for quite some time when he was about 11 years old.</p>
<p>When I met Sunil he was living on the street. One day I was waiting for a traffic light with a friend of mine. Two young boys appeared out of nowhere and jumped on the back of our bikes. They ‘ordered’ us to start driving. When the traffic light turned green, there was not much else we could do. The two kids had the time of their life back there and after a kilometer or so they jumped of and ran back in the direction where we came from.</p>
<p>That night I walked through the city on my way to a bar. In a narrow alley I saw a kid going through some trash, looking for something to eat. When I came closer I noticed it was the same kid that had sat on the back of my bike that very morning. That’s how I met Sunil. </p>
<p>Sunil hang around for a few more months. When I had to go back home, I couldn’t leave Sunil there on the streets. Through a French organization I was able to put Sunil in a child home. I became his sponsor and we stayed in touch.  </p>
<p>In the home Sunil got the chance to go back to school again. An opportunity he grabbed tight with both hands. Sunil passed his high school exam last year and is now in college. His big dream is to be independent as well. He wants to be able to help out others that are in the same situation as he has been in. He sees this business as his opportunity to fulfill his dreams.<br/><br/></p>
<h2><strong>When?</strong></h2>
<p>If all goes to plan, it should take about a year before The Roswell Incident will open its doors. Our goal is to open our doors in October 2013, right around the Nepali festival season. But before we can even think about opening, there are a million things to take care of. Some of which, you could help us out with…</p>
<p><img alt=""1 year"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://files.myopera.com/ErosmanTR/albums/5797782/Four%20Seasons.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2><strong>What we need</strong></h2>
<p>What we need most of all is money. Hopefully with your help we can reach our goal of $20.000 at Indiegogo. If you think that $20.000 isn't enough money to start a laser tag arena you would be completely right: it won't be enough. In total we will roughly need $180.000.</p>
<p>It will however be a huge step forward for us in accomplishing our goals. This first $20.000 will enable us to register our company in Nepal (the amount of $20.000 is the minimum amount required by Nepali law for a foreign investment in an existing company). </p>
<p>Further, we will use the money to secure the rest of our funding. Once we have our first investment, it will be easier for others to follow. Other investors will be more likely to pitch in. Having capital already also will make it a whole lot easier getting a loan from the bank (especially in these days).</p>
<p>If you want to know exactly how we will spend the money once we are fully funded, please feel free to contact us. We can tell you all about our financial plans in detail, but don't want to bother everyone with this boring info ;-)<br/><br/></p>
<h2><strong>How you can help</strong></h2>
<p><em>With money</em><br/> First of all: make a contribution! For our plans to become a reality we need money. Simple as that. Look through our perks and pick your favorite that suits your budget.</p>
<p><em>Without money</em><br/> Of course we know that not everybody can make a contribution. Luckily there are other ways to help us as well. Everyone can help us out by making noise! We don’t mean that you have to scream in your neighbors ear, but you can <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/TheRoswellIncident"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">like, comment and share</a> our campaign with all your friends on facebook, so our campaing hits it big on social media. </p>

<p>Last but not least: if you have a good idea or knows some tips or tricks for us, please feel free to contact us at any time. We would be glad to hear you out. Anything that could help us is welcome!</p></div>","Hi! This is me. My name is Rens Pothuizen. I am 27 years young and live in a tiny village in the middle of Holland where everything is as flat as can be. My dream is to start up a business in a whole different landscape: near the foothills of the Himalaya in Kathmandu. Why you ask? Please allow me to tell you a bit more and I'll even answer the what, who and when. 
Why?
It’s not that I just woke up one day and thought: “You know what would be nice? Let’s go to the other end of the world and start up a business there!” No, I’ve already been to Nepal quite a few times over the years.
During my first stay I did some volunteer work teaching English at a tiny school. I met the most wonderful people over there (but more about them at the who-part) and had the time of my life. Two years later I started an organization called Fair Chance with some friends of mine. Fair Chance helps underprivileged children through school and college in Nepal. When we started out we had just 4 boys in school, now we are already up to 50 kids!

I love Nepal and the people over there. I would love to be able to spend more time there and it is possible. Nepal is wedged in between India and Chine, two of the biggest emerging markets in the world. The Nepali economy is also growing at a quick pace. Even though Nepal is still a 3rd world country, things are changing quickly. In 2001 over 55% of the population still had to live on less than $1 a day. That number has dropped to about 19% in 2010 and it’s still declining! Nepal’s middle class is growing rapidly. More and more people have a little extra to spend, which brings us to the what.      
What?
Laser tag! What? Yes, you heard me: laser tag. As I said the Nepali middle class is growing rapidly. More and more people have some money to spend in their free time. Right now there aren’t that many options for Nepalis to choose from. There are a handful of big cinemas who have about 200.000 visitors a month. Other than that there are just a few bowling alleys and a buck load of cheap bars, but that’s about it.

So laser tag! The Roswell Incident will be the very first laser tag arena in Nepal. Laser tag is a popular game all over the world. The game is comparable to paintball, but instead of firing balls of paint people wear vests with hit points and shoot with laser guns. Laser tag is being played in an indoor arena. To create an incredible experience for the players, the arena is filled up with fog, black light and all kinds of funky decorations.
This ‘product’ is the first thing that will set us aside from our competition. We have plans to build a laser tag center, complete with bar in American ’60 Diner style, instruction- and vesting area and of course a 300 square meter laser tag arena that will be big enough for 20 players at a time.
The second thing that will set us aside is quality. In Nepal things have ‘the tendency to break down’. Whenever you are out to enjoy yourself, something is about to break. It’s a major pain in the *ss. What will set us aside from the competition is good quality equipment. The laser tag equipment that we’ll use has been build according to the highest standards in the business. It can be run over by a truck and will still work!
Third is service. Once you enter The Roswell Incident you will feel welcome. The staff will be very friendly and you’ll immediately feel like you belong.

I major in Design Studies, with a minor in Communication, and am currently working on my senior honors thesis/creative project. I would love for you to help me make my dream (and project) a reality that lives far past my senior year.</p>
<p><br/>My project—currently named <strong>Força </strong>(which is Portuguese for ""strength"" and slang for ""kickass"")—is to develop a<strong> fully-functioning, community-building, website that features contributions in the form of essays, articles, videos, slideshows, and more from all kinds of artists, musicians, journalists, independent thinkers, activists, writers, and influential people of all sorts of varying ethnicities and backgrounds. The dream is for it to be a fashion, arts, music, culture, important issues and news site that is directed toward younger people of color.</strong> A place for young adults to get a solid grasp of amazing work being done in various fields around the country (and ideally, around the world) by other people of color. The target audiences for the site are the many groups of people who are otherwise underrepresented or misrepresented and otherized in mainstream news— and sometimes even alternative news. The site’s purpose is not only be showcase talent and conversations from a range of ethnicities, but also to be extremely inclusive of other groups of people whose<strong> voices are largely muted or underrepresented</strong> (LGBT community, etc.). <br/><br/>Many sites, like Latina Magazine and Ebony.com, offer news to smaller minority groups, but don't attempt to bridge multiplicities of identities. My ultimate goal is this: to build a website that will be updated daily, and present information and viewpoints that are not only beneficial to communities of minorities, but to everyone. I want to create a non-otherized space for normally otherized people, a place where they are inspired to be big, to build networks, to understand that their goals and dreams and desires for their futures are all not only valid and worthwhile, but also supported and strongly encouraged. This site is for young adults growing up in a world that tries to tell us what we need and who we are, instead of encouraging us to define those needs and understandings.</p>
<p><strong>The main goal?</strong> To create a generation-oriented culture map that works to foster developing identities of young adults of color by encompassing a wide range of underrepresented voices and viewpoints in hopes of instilling pride, passion, and a willingness to succeed in its audiences.</p>
<p><strong>Why is this important?</strong> The site will give the multiplicity of our identities as people of color, or as otherized people—and not simply the otherized and stereotyped ones portrayed in the mainstream media—a place to navigate and heal through the trauma induced by the forced simplification, deconstruction, and reconstruction of our identities to the expectations of mainstream culture.<br/><br/><strong>Breakdown of Expenses:</strong></p>
<p>What we need now are funds to get this site online, pay for site hosting and our domain name, web design, photography, content, and future incentives for contributors. My goal is $700. It sounds like a lot, but if 140 of you donate $5, we can make it. If we raised more, it would be amazing, but right now I would just love to have enough to cover the costs to get the basics running. Can't contribute? Share! The more people who know about this, the better!</p>

The facility opening this fall is much smaller,  but will have just as big an impact on its users. The idea for the Dreamplex formed when a local pediatric therapy group noticed the lack of opportunities available to its aged-out clients for social involvement and physical fitness.  They wanted to create something that would help fulfill the needs of their clients: a place to achieve health and wellness, a place for social interaction, and a place of employment.  Central Florida Pediatric Therapy Foundation was formed in 2009, and has since been addressing various needs of the disabled population while working towards its long-term vision of building the Central Florida Dreamplex. In an effort to both effectively serve our clients AND continue towards developing the larger final product, we are moving forward with opening a smaller version that will serve as a ""welcome center"" to introduce our vision of the larger facility and will allow us to grow our programs and serve a larger audience.  This smaller venue is scheduled to open in September, 2014 in Clermont, FL.  It will include a fitness center with ""total access"" capabilities designed for users with disabilities and special needs.  It will also house our ballet/dance and Tae Kwon Do classes for children with special needs.  Suspended gymnastics equipment, a rock wall, and other specialized equipment will be utilized for alternative therapies.The Central Florida Dreamplex, in its eventual larger state or the more-imminent smaller state, will be ""home"" to many families to collaborate and offer each other support.  Membership at our facility will mean so much than a place to work out; it will be a larger family where ideas, struggles, and accomplishments will be shared!


What We Need & What You GetAs with any new venture, our 501(c)3 faces many start-up costs.  We must complete the build-out of our leased space, install rubberized flooring, and purchase equipment.  For this campaign, we are focused solely on purchasing the specialized equipment that allows for total access to all users.  Our first priorities are the rock wall, gymnastics equipment, and three specialized cardio-workout machines.  Whether we fall short of our goal, or far exceed it, all funds will go towards providing the best equipment available for our members.  Your contribution will allow us to offer this equipment while keeping costs minimal to our members.The ImpactSpecial needs children/youth/adults are often left out of many activities that able-bodied individuals take for granted.  On Saturday morning, for instance, when many children head out to play football, basketball or soccer, special needs kids and their families sit at home, isolated.  The Dreamplex will change that.  The ultimate goal is to build a 100,000 sq ft facility on land (already donated) in Wellness Way, just south of Clermont, FL.  The infrastructure for that property will not be in place until about 2016, so the Foundation has decided to open an interim facility to begin providing services immediately.  Although it will not have all the bells and whistles of the ultimate Dreamplex, it will provide a venue for Tae Kwon Do, Ballet, rock-climbing wall, gymnastic and suspended equipment and various workout machines geared toward the special needs population.Children with autism and sensory integration deficits benefit from suspended equipment because they seek sensory input.  Gymnastic equipment and bikes that target upper body muscles while others work out lower body will be connected to X-box games to bring out the fun while working out specific muscle groups.Participating in these activities will help children/youth develop confidence, fitness and sense of well-being and inclusion.  The target population for the Dreamplex is disabled children and adults living in Lake County, Orange County, and beyond.  In 2013, there were 2,477 children under the age of 18 who had one or more disabilities, according to  Quality of Life: A Snapshot of Lake County 2013.  Although the program will be located in south Lake County, it is hoped that many children with disabilities from throughout the county and surrounding areas will participate, due to its unique nature.  The program will benefit children with disabilities by giving them a place to improve their muscle tone by exercising on adaptive equipment, build friendships with other children, develop self-confidence and have fun.  Although having fun might seem trivial, fun is sometimes woefully lacking in the lives of disabled children.In addition, the Dreamplex will provide a place where parents of disabled children can interact with other parents whose children face similar difficulties in life.  Often these parents can become isolated and the Dreamplex will allow them to share ideas and camaraderie.At the Central Fl Dreamplex in Clermont, children with disabilities will walk on balance beams, climb a rock-wall, tap moving lights on a light wall, jump on a trampoline and swing from the ceiling on suspended exercise equipment.  At the same time, other disabled children will play on exercise bikes with integrated Xbox or Nintendo games, which will challenge them physically and hold their interest while they pedal with their hands or feet.  In another area of fitness, patient and entertaining instructors will teach children how to perform ballet or Tae Kwon Do.  The Central Florida Dreamplex will collaborate with entities such as Building Blocks Ministry, Special Olympics, CARD and New Vision for Independence.

<h3><span style=""font-family: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; color: #81868B; line-height: 1.5em; font-weight: normal;"">Basic Training has been leading people on adventures across San Francisco’s varied natural terrain and breathtaking landmarks for five years. No one knows her curves and contours as well as we do. But there are places in the city where access to this terrain is not immediate, and there are times (like on a lunch break from work or on your way home) when you don't have time to get to the Presidio or the Lyon Street stairs. The Pop-Up Fitness Hub at PROXY is our solution to this problem. We'll be the first to admit we've got a little crush on this city. Whether catching the sun rise at Land's End, running sand dunes at Ocean Beach, doing pull-ups along the Embarcadero, or backwards bear crawls all the way up to Coit Tower, we've been going on dates with San Francisco every day for five years. Rain or shine, with our without the company of Karl tour inspiration, our dream girl, if you will. In this video, photographer Eva Kolenko follows founder Jenn Pattee as she travels through San Francisco in a classic Basic Training way, on an epic run to work. It's our tribute to the places and people who make our job so rewarding, a testament to why we love what we do, our love letter to San Francisco.

						<span>
<br/></span>
<span>
<br/></span>
						Before the Central Freeway was demolished as a result of the Loma Prieta Earthquake, Hayes Valley was lacking any kind of town square or green space. The removal of the freeway provided a unique opportunity to think creatively about the neighborhood. We are now witnessing a vital and vibrant Hayes Valley, and a central piece of this success story is PROXY, currently being developed by Envelope A+D, which won the competitive bid to bring inventive, cutting-edge architectural designs to a set of unused lots at the corner of Hayes and Octavia.
						<span>
<br/></span>
<span>
<br/></span>
						The workout hub will offer exercise opportunities to a greater population than has had access to it before, addressing public health in an innovative way, and playing a role in PROXY’s larger goal of bringing ""culture, commerce, and play"" to Hayes Valley.""

We are Basic Training, a San Francisco-based outdoor fitness company, and we are installing an outdoor workout space for public use in Hayes Valley. The free, pop-up  fitness hub will transform a previously unused parking lot within Hayes Valley's PROXY project into a bright, colorful, beautifully designed multi-use space (see below!) Everyone knows we spend too much time tied to our desks and computers, but breaking these habits can be tough. The Basic Training fitness hub is an innovative answer to the problems city dwellers face when there are few, if any, open-air fitness options outside their door or office. This ""hub"" will be a place where people can mix things up on their way to and from work by jumping, climbing, swinging, running, pushing, playing, or simply pondering the possibilities of free, unfettered, activity for all -- 24 hours a day. As California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom put it, ""This communal facility provides a blueprint for a healthy, livable, and vibrant community.""





Why Us. 
Basic Training has been leading people on adventures across San Francisco’s varied natural terrain and breathtaking landmarks for five years. No one knows her curves and contours as well as we do. But there are places in the city where access to this terrain is not immediate, and there are times (like on a lunch break from work or on your way home) when you don't have time to get to the Presidio or the Lyon Street stairs. The Pop-Up Fitness Hub at PROXY is our solution to this problem. We'll be the first to admit we've got a little crush on this city. Whether catching the sun rise at Land's End, running sand dunes at Ocean Beach, doing pull-ups along the Embarcadero, or backwards bear crawls all the way up to Coit Tower, we've been going on dates with San Francisco every day for five years. Rain or shine, with our without the company of Karl tour inspiration, our dream girl, if you will. In this video, photographer Eva Kolenko follows founder Jenn Pattee as she travels through San Francisco in a classic Basic Training way, on an epic run to work. It's our tribute to the places and people who make our job so rewarding, a testament to why we love what we do, our love letter to San Francisco.

										What it will look like.
										







The Basic Training Pop-Up Fitness Hub will include a workout wall, jumping station, and open space. Together, these elements offer the ingredients for a vast array of classes and infinite combinations of movements for circuit training. It’s the ultimate adult playground for adventure race training, working out solo on your way to or from work, or just having a good time with your friends on the weekends.

Monkey bars for climbing, open space for gathering, moving, and playing with friends
									





















We need this.






By creating a prototype for a mobile playground that could be replicated and installed throughout San Francisco and beyond, the workout hub's forward-looking design re-imagines what is possible for a parking lot, our health, and the future of urban planning. 

















""I am proud to support the efforts of Basic Training on their plans to install an outdoor workout space for public use in Hayes Valley. This communal facility provides a blueprint for a healthy, livable, and vibrant community.""  
							




- Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom 













Spearheaded by California Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom during his tenure as mayor of San Francisco, PROXY has become a revolutionary experiment in urban renewal and interim use. 
						



						Before the Central Freeway was demolished as a result of the Loma Prieta Earthquake, Hayes Valley was lacking any kind of town square or green space. The removal of the freeway provided a unique opportunity to think creatively about the neighborhood. We are now witnessing a vital and vibrant Hayes Valley, and a central piece of this success story is PROXY, currently being developed by Envelope A+D, which won the competitive bid to bring inventive, cutting-edge architectural designs to a set of unused lots at the corner of Hayes and Octavia.
						



						The workout hub will offer exercise opportunities to a greater population than has had access to it before, addressing public health in an innovative way, and playing a role in PROXY’s larger goal of bringing ""culture, commerce, and play"" to Hayes Valley.""
					



							People are using cities in ways urban planners never imagined -- and that's a good thing. We want to make it even easier, and safer, for people to take their workouts outside gyms and into public spaces beautifully designed and specifically built for this purpose,” says Basic Training founder Jennifer Pattee. “Our goal is to make the corner of Hayes and Octavia a bright spot in the neighborhood, and in the bigger story of public health in America today.""
						








Where your money is going.





If we reach our stretch goals, we'll add a filtered water station and outdoor movie screen for community events, guest speakers, and movie nights.
