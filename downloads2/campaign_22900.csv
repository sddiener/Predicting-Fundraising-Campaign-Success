<p>PROOF is a Pulitzer Prize winning play by David Auburn, that follows Catherine, her estranged sister Claire, and a former student of their father Robert's named Hal, during the days after Robert's sudden death.

Catherine is also dealing with the possibility of inheriting her father's insanity, which lead to the demise of his mathematics career.</p>
<p>After it's Broadway debut in 2000 starring Mary Louise Parker as Catherine, PROOF won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama, took home multiple Tonys including Best Play, and was adapted into a film starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Anthony Hopkins in 2005.</p>

<p>I was living in Boston after the Marathon Bombing, and almost immediately the One Fund developed to support victims of the violence and their families - it certainly didn't fix everything, but it seems it has made a difference, and has given people a way to show their support of families who can feel isolated and unseen even in the midst of their grief.

<p>So this is a fundraising campaign to show our support, ending on November 1st, All Saints Day, when I hope we can honor and remember all who have died in our city this year. I would love to figure out a way to get this directly to victims' families, but since I don't really understand how that would work legally or logistically yet, and I don't know how much we can raise that would be meaningful for the at least 312 murder victims already this year (you can find their names here: <a href=""http://homicides.redeyechicago.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://homicides.redeyechicago.com/</a>), for now the promise is that the money will go to CeaseFire Illinois, an organization with a proven track record in reducing violence in Chicago which has recently had to shut two offices because of lack of funding from the city and state: <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-13/news/ct-met-cease-fire-contract-20130914-36_1_ceasefire-illinois-2-communities-domestic-violence-charges"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-09-13/news/ct-met-cease-fire-contract-20130914-36_1_ceasefire-illinois-2-communities-domestic-violence-charges</a>.

<p>Elisabeth Schiffbauer &amp; The BigStrongGang is dedicated to dance, movement, and artistic expression. Through our work we aim to do away with pre-conceived notions and stigmas surrounding dance.Our goal is to break boundaries between music and movement and to challenge our audience by showing then something unique and unfamiliar. Our works exemplify the core themes of freedom, rebellion, immediacy, and progressiveness of contemporary music. We believe that dance resonates and connects with individuals more than other art forms because it is through the physical body.

Liz Ulmer, Moxyrah Productions,
and Dreamcatcher Entertainment are aiming to present a one-night only concert
reading presentation of the parody Twilight: The Musical (A parody) January 16th, 2012 at 8pm to benefit national charity organization Blessings
in a Backpack. The concert will be directed by Gabriel Barre, with music
direction by David John Madore, and will presented at New World Stages in Times
Square. (To purchase tickets, please call telecharge, or go to: 
http://www.telecharge.com/go.aspx?MD=102&PID=8718&AID=CRP000871800
For more information please visit www.thetwilightmusical.com)
 
All net proceeds will benefit national charity organization Blessings in a Backpack. 
 
Blessings in a Backpack (http://www.blessingsinabackpack.org/)
is a unique program designed to feed elementary school children whose families
qualify for the federal Free and Reduced Price Meal program, and have little to
no food on the weekends. Better test scores, improved reading skills,
positive behavior; improved health and increased attendance have all been
attributed to the success of this program. $80 feeds a child in the program for
an entire school year.
Blessings in a Backpack is a 501 C
(3) non-profit organization currently feeding over 55,000 children in
318 schools in 37 U.S. states and three countries - Canada, Columbia
and Haiti.
 
 
Twilight: The Musical is a parody of the Twilight saga in the vein of Urinetown
and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Twilight: The Musical examines
our culture of obsession through the story of teenage outsider Bella Swan who
risks everything when she embarks on a star-crossed romance with Vampire Edward
Cullen.
 
Twilight: The Musical was created by Ashley Griffin, and features a book by Ashley
Griffin, with music and lyrics by Jeremy Ezell, Ashley Griffin, Sean Mahoney,
David Mallamud, and Michael Sutherland. The show had its first workshop in NYC
in 2010 at the LABA theater, and is currently in development in NYC.
 
 
The concert will feature
wonderful Broadway performers (casting to be announced soon) - and everyone is
donating their time and resources in order to give back as much as possible to
Blessings in a Backpack.  
 

The Impact
This concert, besides being a
wonderfully entertaining evening, has the potential to raise a significant
amount of money for this fantastic charity. If we don't raise enough money for
overhead costs, this great opportunity will be lost. 
 
What We Need & What You Get
Right now we've set our campaign
goal at $5,000 - though we would love to try and raise more than that. Reaching
this goal will guarantee our overhead costs for the space will be met, and will
significantly ground our footing proceeding with this event. We are currently
in the process of pursuing other funding sources including corporate
sponsorship, and private donations. We've already received support from Sam Ash
- who have provided some wonderful perks for indiegogo donors. Any amount of
money raised will help this event move forward, but the more we can raise, the
better (and the more we raise, the more we'll be able to donate to Blessings in

<p>We cordially invite you to contribute to <a href=""http://www.blackwomensblueprint.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black Women's Blueprint's</a> <em><a href=""http://www.mothertonguemonologues.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mother Tongue Monologues for Lesbian Ancestral Wives and Revolutionary Women Speaking the Unspeakable</a>, a</em>s we make a critical pivot in the movement for gender-justice, speak truth to power and link our local stories to the global voices of women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people and allies who want to love freely and without persecution. February 16-18 at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York, NY.</p>
<p>This play is for you. This play is about us. Women-loving-women, men-loving-men, human-loving-humans who have had to love, in secret, in shame, and far too often, in fear. This work of daring truth telling is about those of us who have watched love ones live in isolation, trepidation, and with too few affirmations. And, this night is about those of us who by the grace of the universe and beat of our boots, fought to create spaces where we could love, live, and lust in full bloom.  Cause like it was said in the 1990’s: every time we make love, we win.  And anytime we mouth the words to our wives, husbands, or gender non-conforming sweethearts, we rewrite the story and defy the status quo. Tonight, we are here to celebrate, rage, and honor the courage it has taken to persist.  This production is our moment.  </p>
<p>Poets, drummers, dancers and actors dramatizing and performing community will speak of gay and lesbian identities of people in Black communities that remain even today, hidden, intensely controversial, and/or dismissed as an insignificant aspect of their lives. The Black lesbian in particular, who stands at the crossroads of two well-developed ideologies in America, one about women and one about “the Negro”, remains a dangerous site saturated with the belief that female sexual energy deserves punishment.<br/><br/><img alt=""Ancestral Wives"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.blackwomensblueprint.org/wp-content/uploads/New-Picture-8.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><strong>The performance shatters the dominant paradigm that insists on seeing only tragedy in lesbian existence, by lifting up the narratives of<em> </em>ancestral wives—lesbians of pre-colonial Africa, contemporary lesbians, and defiant lesbians</strong> like Barbara Smith, Audre Lorde, Cheryl Clark, and Jewelle Gomez. These women are among many who’ve contributed to liberation struggles, the American civil rights, Black power, feminist and gay rights movements and whose existence continue to take on a particular poignancy of courage. For Black women, trapped in families, communities, and internalized hatred, their words have been a place of solace, understanding, and validation.  Their words for some have been the breath needed to keep living---affirming the right to exist and revel in our splendor.</p>

Visitors from 11 African countries, funded by your generosity, will also be present at the production to bear witness to these stories, tell their own, build bridges and solidarity with gender justice movements across the Atlantic, and ensure that this evening is the start to a movement.</p>

We cordially invite you to contribute to Black Women's Blueprint's Mother Tongue Monologues for Lesbian Ancestral Wives and Revolutionary Women Speaking the Unspeakable, as we make a critical pivot in the movement for gender-justice, speak truth to power and link our local stories to the global voices of women and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people and allies who want to love freely and without persecution. February 16-18 at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in New York, NY.
This play is for you. This play is about us. Women-loving-women, men-loving-men, human-loving-humans who have had to love, in secret, in shame, and far too often, in fear. This work of daring truth telling is about those of us who have watched love ones live in isolation, trepidation, and with too few affirmations. And, this night is about those of us who by the grace of the universe and beat of our boots, fought to create spaces where we could love, live, and lust in full bloom.  Cause like it was said in the 1990’s: every time we make love, we win.  And anytime we mouth the words to our wives, husbands, or gender non-conforming sweethearts, we rewrite the story and defy the status quo. Tonight, we are here to celebrate, rage, and honor the courage it has taken to persist.  This production is our moment.  
Poets, drummers, dancers and actors dramatizing and performing community will speak of gay and lesbian identities of people in Black communities that remain even today, hidden, intensely controversial, and/or dismissed as an insignificant aspect of their lives. The Black lesbian in particular, who stands at the crossroads of two well-developed ideologies in America, one about women and one about “the Negro”, remains a dangerous site saturated with the belief that female sexual energy deserves punishment.The performance shatters the dominant paradigm that insists on seeing only tragedy in lesbian existence, by lifting up the narratives of ancestral wives—lesbians of pre-colonial Africa, contemporary lesbians, and defiant lesbians like Barbara Smith, Audre Lorde, Cheryl Clark, and Jewelle Gomez. These women are among many who’ve contributed to liberation struggles, the American civil rights, Black power, feminist and gay rights movements and whose existence continue to take on a particular poignancy of courage. For Black women, trapped in families, communities, and internalized hatred, their words have been a place of solace, understanding, and validation.  Their words for some have been the breath needed to keep living---affirming the right to exist and revel in our splendor.
Transgender men and women, gender non-conformers and straight allies will also share center stage as a force to demand an end to domination. Visitors from 11 African countries, funded by your generosity, will also be present at the production to bear witness to these stories, tell their own, build bridges and solidarity with gender justice movements across the Atlantic, and ensure that this evening is the start to a movement.
When you open your wallet to contribute to Mother Tongue Monologues, you send a powerful statement that our sexuality will not be silenced. If you have ever been paralyzed by fear, uncertainty or ignorance, now is your time to step up and show support to someone you were not able to do that for before. Stand with us in solidarity. The costs of a high-impact show, however, are not low. 
-----------------
Now in its third year, Mother Tongue Monologues has been wildly successful-- a critical catharsis for the Black community and allies to gather and speak truth to power. This year, we want to speak the unspeakable.  
We lay claim to all that is lush, rich, warm, hollow, happy and somber. It is all ours. We lay claim to moving freely, from shore to shore and land to land. Every place belongs to us. We lay claim to intimacy. We lay claim to love. 
Join us on our journey. Please donate.
--------------------------
We understand that times are difficult for many, but that ability to pay should never interfere with the ability to give voice to our collective demands. If you are unable to donate to the production, there are a few other actions you can take to help us reach our goal. We'd be forever grateful if you could:

Share our campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr or other social networks and ask your contacts to donate on your behalf (you can use the Indiegogo buttons right on this page!)
Write a blog post about Mother Tongue Monologues and ask your readers to donate.
Talk about Black sexual politics with your friends, family, neighbors and young women in your sphere and tell them about the campaign.

<p>I’m <strong>Bess Welden</strong>, a Portland, Maine-based actor and writer. Over the last several months I’ve been working with an incredible team of collaborators to prepare for the <strong>world premiere of my latest one-woman show, BIG MOUTH THUNDER THIGHS: A Solo Vaudeville. </strong>The creative staff includes: Jennie Hahn (director), Stacey M. Koloski (set/props), Christine Nilles (costumes), Chris Fitze (sound), Emily Kenny (lights), Alexander Adams (puppet maker), Deb Freedman (choreographer), and Emily Dixon (stage manager) <em>Check out all of our bios at <a href=""http://www.bigmouththunderthighs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> www.bigmouththunderthighs.com</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>On the one hand, BIG MOUTH THUNDER THIGHS is memoir storytelling. On the other, it’s a highly-theatrical, unpredictable, and outrageously entertaining variety show</strong> featuring: roller-skating, stand-up comedy, country-western singing, flamenco dancing, a Shakespearean monologue, a Broadway style song and dance number, an Inuit folktale, original Spoken Word-style poems, and a series of five “Death-Defying Acts.” And, in the crucial role of the perfectionist arch nemesis - Skinny Bitch - a puppet like you’ve never seen before. <strong>It’s a one-woman extravaganza about hunger, appetite, fear, largeness, enoughness, loneliness, aloneness, and what it takes for us to accept ourselves. It’s deeply personal and surprisingly funny.</strong></p>
<p>The show will have its first run in the debut season of the Portland Stage Studio Rep (<em><a href=""http://www.portlandstage.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.portlandstage.org</a></em>) this coming February and March, which will set the stage for future productions around the country.</p>
<p><strong>We need to raise $5,000</strong> to reach our overall budget of $13,000, <strong>which will cover production expenses and marketing the show to future producers.</strong> The great news is that we already have $8,000 in the bank from a grant from the Maine Arts Commission and contributions from people who have seen readings of the play and believe in its message.</p>
<p>With just five weeks before Opening Night, I’m turning to you to ask for contributions that will help pay for:</p>
<p>1) Production Expenses: fees for artistic collaborators (director/designers/stage manager); rehearsal space; props, set and costumes; materials for puppet construction</p>
<p>2) Marketing investments to attract future producers/presenters: video shoot of live performance; video editing; custom website creation and hosting; still photography; reproduction costs of show DVD</p>
<p>In exchange for your contribution, you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing you helped bring a brand new play to life and get a fun perk or two. <strong>More importantly, though, you will be helping people who struggle with food and their bodies to see how having the courage to tell the truth about ourselves and laugh can be the first step toward giving up the fight once and for all.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>The Rivalry</strong></h3>
<p>Here in Chicago, we have a bit of a rivalry with New York. Deep dish pizza vs. Thin crust. Bears vs. Giants. Sweet smelling transit system vs. Sweet smelling transit system.</p>
<p>But when something as big as the recent superstorm affects so many people, you have to put petty rivalries off to the side and do everything you can to help. This campaign and benefit performance are meant to do just that.</p>
<h3>The Show (12/2/2012 @ 7 p.m.)</h3>
<p>We are putting together a diverse lineup of comedy acts together from all over the area to perform on <em><strong>Sunday, December 2nd at the Skokie Theatre just outside the city at 7 p.m</strong></em>. Tickets for the show are $20 a piece and all proceeds will go directly to the Red Cross to benefit victims of Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Beyond the Show</h3>
One of the reasons we ran the campaign through IndieGoGo is so that people who can't attend the show would still be able to help. Even if you contribute $1 you will be listed as a donor on our website. Donate $10 and we'll put you in the program. Donate more and you can even be listed as a Silver or Gold Donor or have your business represented in the program with an advertisement.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>All donations are going to the Red Cross and are therefore tax-deductable.</em></div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Please share this campaign far and wide. Spread it around on Facebook, Twitter, etc. We've set a funding goal of $2,500, but if we sell out the show and get a lot of additional donors, we may be able to far surpass the goal. Meeting or exceeding the goal will truly show that Chicago cares.</div>
<div>
<h3>FAQs</h3>
<p><em>Why does it look like there are only 40 tickets available?</em></p>
<p>There are actually 150 seats in the Skokie Theater. We're just keeping the perk at 40 available to compensate for people who buy multiple tickets. If you want to buy more than one ticket, just donate $20 for each ticket you want to buy. We will make more tickets available here soon.</p>
<p><em>What if I want to be a Gold or Silver Donor and get one or more tickets?</em></p>
<p>If you donate more than $50 and you want to attend the show, select the $20 ticket perk. We'll still list you as a Silver or Gold Donor, we just want to keep track of how many tickets have been claimed.</p>
<p><em>Why do I have to enter my shipping info for the ticket? Will you be shipping the tickets?</em></p>
<p>No, we will not be shipping the tickets, we'll handle all of that digitally. While you have to put in the shipping information (because we made the ticket a limited perk), we will not be using that shipping info for anything, so don't worry, your info is safe with us.</p>
<p><em>What acts are performing at the show?</em></p>
<p>We are negotiating with several awesome Chicago comedy groups to come. Currently we have the Underage Sugar Addicts, Rom-Com, Urlakis and Cusick, comedic musician Matt Griffo and Pimprov confirmed and we'll update this list with more performers as we have them.</p>

<p><em>How do I get to the Skokie Theater?</em></p>
<p>The Skokie Theater is located at 7924 Lincoln Ave. in Skokie. The theater is a half-mile away from the Oakton-Skokie station on the CTA's Yellow Line. There is street parking available in the area in addition to several parking lots. More information on parking is available here:</p>

<p>As of 11/11/2012, the Red Cross was sheltering some 3,700 people and had delivered more than 4.8 million meals or snacks, and more than 477,000 relief items, according to NBC News.</p>

Even if you contribute $1 you will be listed as a donor on our website. Donate $10 and we'll put you in the program. Donate more and you can even be listed as a Silver or Gold Donor or have your business represented in the program with an advertisement.
 
All donations are going to the Red Cross and are therefore tax-deductable.

Other Ways You Can Help
Please share this campaign far and wide. Spread it around on Facebook, Twitter, etc. We've set a funding goal of $2,500, but if we sell out the show and get a lot of additional donors, we may be able to far surpass the goal. Meeting or exceeding the goal will truly show that Chicago cares.

FAQs
Why does it look like there are only 40 tickets available?
There are actually 150 seats in the Skokie Theater. We're just keeping the perk at 40 available to compensate for people who buy multiple tickets. If you want to buy more than one ticket, just donate $20 for each ticket you want to buy. We will make more tickets available here soon.
What if I want to be a Gold or Silver Donor and get one or more tickets?
If you donate more than $50 and you want to attend the show, select the $20 ticket perk. We'll still list you as a Silver or Gold Donor, we just want to keep track of how many tickets have been claimed.
Why do I have to enter my shipping info for the ticket? Will you be shipping the tickets?
No, we will not be shipping the tickets, we'll handle all of that digitally. While you have to put in the shipping information (because we made the ticket a limited perk), we will not be using that shipping info for anything, so don't worry, your info is safe with us.
What acts are performing at the show?
We are negotiating with several awesome Chicago comedy groups to come. Currently we have the Underage Sugar Addicts, Rom-Com, Urlakis and Cusick, comedic musician Matt Griffo and Pimprov confirmed and we'll update this list with more performers as we have them.

How do I get to the Skokie Theater?
The Skokie Theater is located at 7924 Lincoln Ave. in Skokie. The theater is a half-mile away from the Oakton-Skokie station on the CTA's Yellow Line. There is street parking available in the area in addition to several parking lots. More information on parking is available here:

What is the Red Cross doing to help?

<h2>THE MUSICAL:</h2>
<p>What would you do when the love you’ve sacrificed your world for betrays you? Inspired by the life of Marie Laveaux and adapted from Euripides <em>The Medea, </em>this rarely-produced musical by Michael John LaChiusa explores what it means to love unconditionally and culminates in incomprehensible vengeance when that love is betrayed.</p>
<p>In 1896, deep in the heart of New Orleans genteel creole society, a young priviledged woman of color finds herself mired by the men and social demands that govern her life. With headstrong disobedience and a gift for the power of Voodon she finds her escape in managing the love affairs of others. When an ambitious sea captain passes through town, she discovers her own all consuming love. Together they chart the waters of their romance to the burning streets of Chicago’s First Ward with a trail of blood along the way.</p>
<h2>
<br/><strong>WHY NOW?</strong>
</h2>
<p>Marie Christine was the last major musical produced in New York City in the 20<sup>th</sup> century. It created quite a stir in the theatre community during its short lived run due to it’s controversial subject matter and the complexity of its structure. The show has never been produced in America since its Lincoln Centre closing. Thirteen years later the story is itching to be told again. In the wake of recent political debates, it has become clear that issues of race, basic human rights and feminist support still fall short of a level playing field. The United States is wrought with double standards. This deeply moving musical is a reminder that we as a “liberal” society, are not that much further along in our “free thinking” as we were in the late 1800’s. We need to challenge ourselves with art like this to keep forging ahead towards true equality regardless of race, orientation, sex or class. At the same time, this play deals with the brutal theme of murdering one’s own children. Recent events in America have demonstrated that such gruesome acts are a part of our reality. Regardless of what people’s positions on gun control are, one thing is clear: change is necessary. This theatre piece allows us to glimpse into the mind of a person who can contemplate such atrocities. It challenges its audience to consider how far their fury would take them and hopefully will enable people to consider the their own values and the necessary political change to a stronger and more proactive degree.</p>

<p>Its title derives from a remark made by Rock Feilding-Mellen, former Deputy Leader of Kensington and Chelsea Council, that <i>the village does not dictate to the estate</i>.</p>
<p>Using contemporary blog posts, emails and council records, it tells the story of the renovation of the tower and residents’ attempts to hold the council and contractors to account. At the same time, it places these events in a wider context of austerity, estate regeneration and deregulation.</p>
<p>The production will run for two weeks in November 2021 at the Maxilla Social Club, a popular local venue five minutes’ walk from Grenfell Tower. A digital version of the production will be filmed onsite and released in early 2022.</p>
<p>The production team will also collaborate with a local youth charity to help them stage a performance that will open the play.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why we are making Dictating to the Estate </strong></p>
<p>The Grenfell Tower fire, in which seventy-two people died, was the worst residential fire in Britain since the end of the Second World War. It happened in the wealthiest borough of the one of the wealthiest cities in the world, in a building managed by a council that held hundreds of millions of pounds in reserves. The plays aims to present, in dramatic form, an account of how such an event could occur.</p>
<p>The aims of this production are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Broaden understanding among audiences beyond North Kensington and housing activists of how the fire came to happen</li>
<li>Provide people with information that may help them scrutinise and challenge the actions of their own local authority</li>
<li>Place these events in the context of deregulation, austerity and estate regeneration, showing how key local government decisions are determined by national policy</li>
<li>Raise awareness of the campaign to have similar cladding removed from tall buildings around the UK</li>
<li>Help maintain pressure on the authorities to ensure that those responsible will be held to account</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why we need you</strong></p>
<p>We have managed to raise a good proportion of the budget so far, but we still need another £13,697.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic, funding available from grant bodies has become a lot scarcer. We had always planned a fundraising campaign, but in the current circumstances it has become more vital than ever.</p>
<p>The funds raised will go towards paying for the cast and crew, the venue hire and the play’s equipment, set and props. It will also help fund our partnership with the local youth charity by paying for the young people’s tutors and expenses.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who we are</strong></p>
<p>Nathaniel McBride is a writer and translator who lives in Kensington and has been involved in a number of local campaigns around housing.</p>
<p>Allegra Nespoli is a creative producer who makes works about social justice and human rights. She has produced work that has been shown at the Royal Court theatre, Hackney Showroom, Birmingham Rep and Roundhouse.</p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>The pandemic has affected our original schedule and budget. The uncertainty of the post-lockdown climate has led us to believe the best way forward is to mount a free digital production alongside a socially distanced theatre production.</p>
<p>This means that whatever happens, the play will still go ahead safely and responsibly and will reach a wider range of audiences. A digital performance will also bring the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It will remove any financial barriers to audiences attending the theatre, since it will be free</li>

<p><strong>LE STORY</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Le Kleitoris Ballet</i></strong> is the fruit of a joyous odyssey that began at Ecole Philippe Gaulier International Theatre and Clown School in France. Two years ago, a Brazilian actress, an American actress, and an Italian actress walked into a bar… and set off on a crazy journey.</p>
<p>Originally inspired by Sartre’s adaptation of Euripides’ <i>Trojan Women</i>, we began to explore and debate feminine issues and gender inequalities – harassment, abuse, beauty standards, pay gap, genital mutilation… <i>Trojan Women</i> screamed, “injustice”, “invasion”, “violence”, “control”, “appropriation”, “rape”, “slavery”: women, ostensibly victims of their own bodies, born in a world where penis is law. We asked, “What if…?”</p>
<p>The evocation of many Greek plays and myths- <i>Trojan Women, Lysistrata, The Bacchea, Pandora’s Box-</i> and our reactions to contemporary cultural depravity came together and captivated us. We set out to create a show that encompassed our questions and assumptions. To cultivate an utterance of hope in response to all the “pussy grabbing” Trumps, Weinsteins, Temers, Berlusconis, those who abuse the power they possess. We examined different forms of expression, looking at avenues of creative inspiration to confront these injustices and timeless human degradation. What if WE react differently? How?</p>
<p>At Ecole Philippe Gaulier, with Greek tragedy, vaudeville, and red nose clowning behind us, in the throes of the Buffon workshop our ‘What If” found its voice. The Buffons- societies outcasts- experience deep suffering and pain in the depths of human misery. They find freedom through comedy, parody, and truth. They laugh! Their audience laughs too. Serendipitously, in the midst of this epiphany, we came upon the ancient Greek word for Clitoris, “Kleis”: “<strong>THE KEY</strong>”! Through comedy, pleasure, laughter, and joy, costumed as the Clitoris, dancing, our “form” was unlocked.</p>
<p>As Cassandra displayed the brutal strength to not submit, but to laugh and dance in the face of horror – movement, humor, and pleasure, sans guilt, shame, or fear, became our “kleis” to insubordination. As modern day Buffon, we claim the lasting pleasure of seriously not being serious. We join the swelling current of rising voices. A cri du coeur and a cackle in the face of the grotesque. This is a unique moment of resistance. A work in progress. The Kleitoris Ballet is a groan of pleasure and a giggle of freedom.</p>

</div></div>","LE STORY
Le Kleitoris Ballet is the fruit of a joyous odyssey that began at Ecole Philippe Gaulier International Theatre and Clown School in France. Two years ago, a Brazilian actress, an American actress, and an Italian actress walked into a bar… and set off on a crazy journey.
Originally inspired by Sartre’s adaptation of Euripides’ Trojan Women, we began to explore and debate feminine issues and gender inequalities – harassment, abuse, beauty standards, pay gap, genital mutilation… Trojan Women screamed, “injustice”, “invasion”, “violence”, “control”, “appropriation”, “rape”, “slavery”: women, ostensibly victims of their own bodies, born in a world where penis is law. We asked, “What if…?”
The evocation of many Greek plays and myths- Trojan Women, Lysistrata, The Bacchea, Pandora’s Box- and our reactions to contemporary cultural depravity came together and captivated us. We set out to create a show that encompassed our questions and assumptions. To cultivate an utterance of hope in response to all the “pussy grabbing” Trumps, Weinsteins, Temers, Berlusconis, those who abuse the power they possess. We examined different forms of expression, looking at avenues of creative inspiration to confront these injustices and timeless human degradation. What if WE react differently? How?
At Ecole Philippe Gaulier, with Greek tragedy, vaudeville, and red nose clowning behind us, in the throes of the Buffon workshop our ‘What If” found its voice. The Buffons- societies outcasts- experience deep suffering and pain in the depths of human misery. They find freedom through comedy, parody, and truth. They laugh! Their audience laughs too. Serendipitously, in the midst of this epiphany, we came upon the ancient Greek word for Clitoris, “Kleis”: “THE KEY”! Through comedy, pleasure, laughter, and joy, costumed as the Clitoris, dancing, our “form” was unlocked.
As Cassandra displayed the brutal strength to not submit, but to laugh and dance in the face of horror – movement, humor, and pleasure, sans guilt, shame, or fear, became our “kleis” to insubordination. As modern day Buffon, we claim the lasting pleasure of seriously not being serious. We join the swelling current of rising voices. A cri du coeur and a cackle in the face of the grotesque. This is a unique moment of resistance. A work in progress. The Kleitoris Ballet is a groan of pleasure and a giggle of freedom.

LE TEAM

Julia Henning grew up in her parents’ music school in Brazil and studied singing during her adolescence. She studied theatre and received a Degree in Pedagogical Studies at the University of São Paulo. She went on to co-found the Experimental Laboratory of Art Education and Culture with the Faculty of Education at the University of São Paulo, and began to teach theater in 2006. Julia has participated in several creations of the Titere Azul Cie under the direction of Rafael Rios. She has taken part in many workshops with Julia Varley from Odin Teatret, Yoshi Oida, and Tapa Sudana. She went on to obtain a Master 2 in Performing Arts at Paris 8 University, focused on the theatre of Peter Brook. Her professional theatrical training continued under the direction of Jean-Paul Denizon. In 2011 she created the company Cie des Sens and produced many productions in France, in collaboration with Jean-Paul Denizon and Rafael Rios. Julia won the 3rd prize at the 2011 OISTAT Theater Architecture Competition in Prague. In 2017, after two years of training with Philippe Gaulier, she began to participate in the creation and work of the Tête de Babel Collectif.

Bianca Maria Lay is a recent graduate of École Philippe Gaulier, which was a culmination of her special interest in comedy and clown.  She had previously studied with Merche Ochoa (Estudis Berty Tovías), Nicolas Cohen (Escuela Internacional de Teatro) and Eric de Bont’s International Clown School. She has collaborated with the Italian comic Stefano Manca and is a member of Barbigialli, a theatre company based in Sardinia. Bianca is an accomplished dancer who has won multiple Italian national competitions in Latin American dance. She has performed with the Sardinian dance companies Jana, Teatro Danza Leonarda, and Balletto Del Mediterraneo. Her work as a choreographer includes multiple solo and group performances that tour throughout Sardinia. She recently had a starring role in the Italian feature film Bianco di Babbudoiu.

Dain Alexandra Rubin is an actress. She was born in the mountains of Aspen, Colorado. From age 11 to 18 she studied Drama at The Denver School of the Performing Arts. In 2005 she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in Acting from Emerson College in Boston Massachusetts.  After a year's solo voyage throughout Europe, Dain settled into New York City to pursue her theatrical dreams. In 2008 she began to study with master teacher Wynn Handman. While working in many staged productions, readings, short films, and commercials, Dain went on to complete a yoga teacher training in 2009. Her passion for physical comedy led to her participation in workshops with clown teachers Christopher Bayes and Kendall Cornell. This work inspired her journey across the Atlantic to France and to the prestigious École Philippe Gaulier. There she completed the two year program in 2017. After falling in love with a French man she decided to make France her home! Dain is now creating theatre in English for primary schools in the french national education system. She is currently a yoga/movement/theatre arts teacher at Ecole Mines ParisTech and Ecole Philippe Gaulier. Dain is a principal in the creation and work of Tête de Babel Collectif with her collegues.

<p>San Francisco International Arts Festival (SFIAF), Central American Resource Center (CARECEN) and the Mission Cultural Center for Latino Arts (MCCLA) present playwright Paul S. Flores’ premiere of PLACAS, directed by Michael John Garcés of Cornerstone Theater and starring Ricardo Salinas of Culture Clash<em>.</em> PLACAS will premiere at the Lorraine Hansberry Theater in San Francisco’s Union Square, September 6 – 16, 2012.</p>
<p>PLACAS has also been co-commissioned through the National Performance Network by MACLA in San Jose, Su Teatro in Denver, CO, The GALA Theatre Center in Washington, DC and Pregones Theatre Center in New York City and is scheduled to go on a national tour in September of 2013.</p>
<p>PLACAS (barrio slang for graffiti tags, a nickname or body tattoos) is a stage drama that focuses on the human and local community ramifications of geo-political events. Set in today’s San Francisco it looks at the impacts that U.S. foreign policy during the Civil War in El Salvador in the 1980’s still has on migrant and refugee communities in the United States and throughout the Americas. In particular it addresses the issues of Central American street gangs that are a bi-product of the war and breaking the cycles of violence. PLACAS focuses on intergenerational relationships between young men and their fathers and uses the metaphor of tattoo removal as a way of moving forward and as a path to a possible solution.</p>
<p>PLACAS stars Ric Salinas as Salvadoran immigrant Fausto Carbajal, a now middle-aged ex-gang member recently released after nine years in prison. As a requirement of his parole Fausto must remove the tattoos that mark him as a member of his gang. Wearied by what has been a lifetime of violence, he accepts the terms. He is determined to reunite his family, traumatized by three decades of war, forced migrations and street crime. He returns to San Francisco to live with his mother, a war refugee, and hopes to re-unite with his ex-partner, Claudia and their now teenaged son, Edgar. But Edgar, who has not seen his father for most of his life, resents Fausto and displays disturbing character traits that remind Fausto of himself in his youth. It is clear that the reunion will be difficult.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>
<p>We’ve raised the money to develop the script, we’ve raised the money to pay the artists and we’ve raised the money to pay the rent on the Lorraine Hansberry Theater. Now, we are in the last three months before we open the show, we need to raise additional funds to market the show and fully realize its production and visual elements. Lorraine Hansberry has a big stage and we have some exciting ideas in regards to a set design. But it is a stretch for our current budget to realize these ideas. Plus, as we described above, after the show has premiered in San Francisco, over the course of the next 18 months it will tour to at least five cities across the country and hopefully more. Therefore, we need a set that is both striking and well designed so that it is easy to take on the road. Over the long term, it is a good investment, but creating this set (and then storing it) is initially more expensive than just building something that will get thrown away at the end of the San Francisco run.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>Marketing Support</strong></h3>
<p>We have over 4,000 tickets to sell at the Lorraine Hansberry Theater and a portion of a surplus from the production will go to CARECEN's Second Chance Tattoo Removal Program. Removing a gang members tattoos is seen as an important step on the path to leaving the gang. Any help you can give towards marketing support will increase the numbers of tickets we can sell towards achieving this goal. <strong><br/></strong></p>
<div>
<h3>If you can't donate funds</h3>
<p>We are looking for skilled carpenters and electricians who are interested in donating their time. Or if you have a scenic or prop shop and can donate space and/or building materials, these things will be invaluable to us.</p>
If your skill set or inventory does not include the above, there are plenty other ways to volunteer or get involved with the production. Just get in touch with us either by calling our office or dropping us an e-mail.</div></div>","PLACAS

<h4><i>A note from Ellen:</i></h4>
<b><i>Thank you for taking the time to read about my experiences, and my
 hopes for attending SDL. What I desire to take away from my time there 
is a new perspective on what kind of dancer I am and what kind of dancer
 I could be; I truly believe the instructors can help me get there. With
 the 5-week program I have the chance to participate in the Apprentice 
program with an acclaimed choreographer and dancer who will no doubt 
bring out a better dancer in all the students. </i></b><b><i> Every penny counts, and it would really be a blessing to be able to experience this!</i></b><br/>

Thank you for auditioning for Summer Dance Lab's 2015 program. <b>We greatly enjoyed viewing your work in class</b> and are very happy to inform you that you have been accepted to this Summer's SDL intensive! <br/><br/><b>Because of your performance in class, we strongly encourage you to attend the full five weeks of the program.</b> We see that you did not mark this as a preference on your application, but if you were open to reconsidering the amount of time that you would attend, <b>we feel that at your current stage of training the intensity and immersion of the full five weeks would benefit you immensely.</b> In addition, we'd also like to offer you some financial assistance in the form of one of our <b>tuition merit scholarships in the amount of $450.00. This scholarship is offered based on attendance for the full five week session. </b><br/><br/>Additionally, all of our five week students are eligible to audition for our <b>Apprentice Program.  We think that you would be a very strong candidate. </b>The dancers chosen will have the opportunity to <b>perform in a new work to be created on our students by guest Repetiteur Brett Perry in an exciting work by world renown choreographer Trey McIntyre. This work will share the program on the annual Walla Walla Dance Festival to be held in Cordiner Hall on July 31st. </b>Whether our five week students are chosen for the apprentice program or not, our small classes with highly individualized attention and broad spectrum of dance faculty, encompassing the very best of the current dance world, ensures that our dancers leave the program with greater strength, physical awareness, and artistry to take with them on their individual path in dance. <br/><br/>Again, congratulations on your acceptance to SDL! We are <b>proud of your good showing at our audition,</b> and we look forward to dancing with you this summer!    <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>John Passafiume &amp; Lydia Tetzlaff, Directors, Summer Dance Lab<br/></i><br/><h4>Is it any wonder she wants to attend for the full five weeks now??

$2,039
<br/>

Room and Board
$2,655
<br/>

Admin. Fee

<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<h3><strong></strong></h3>
<strong>
</strong><p>With the cost of nonstop year-round dancing, renting our place in Bellingham, an older daughter in college, substantial medical bills each year, a one-income household and everyday living, paying for the full five week program just isn't feasible.  We looked into several local scholarships, but all required the 
recipient to be a student of the public school system, and Ellen is a 
home-schooled student.  So we look to you, our community, to help us:  it takes a village to send a dancer to a summer intensive! Every little bit helps.  Know that your contribution <b>will</b> go towards SDL's dance intensive.  If our goal isn't reached, we'll use any funds received 
toward the remaining balance (most likely of the 3-week program) and kiss Dad a million times for being such
 an understanding Artist's father.  If there happens to be any extra funding, it will all go
 directly into our Dancing ForJoy account for future dance expenses.</p>
<br/>For every $100-299 contribution, you will receive this lovely mini - poster <br/> featuring Ellen and her fellow Jubilee Dance Co. member (and boyfriend), Elijah Ryan to thank you for supporting the art of dance!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1420534/files/20150427191752-poster.jpg?1430187472"" src="""" style=""width: 359.264px; height: 546px;""/>Actual size:  11.25"" x 17.3""</p>

<p> ""I have had the privilege of working as an apprentice for KT and Yayoi for two summers now. It has been an incredible experience both times. The two women really treat all the apprentices like professionals.

Both years I have been so proud to be able to perform alongside the other apprentices, who feel like they have become a part of my family. We all worked extremely hard, and it truly paid off when we performed in the beautiful Cordiner hall in front of the audience of the Walla Walla Dance Festival.  Being in the apprenticeship gave me a small taste of what being a professional dancer can be like, and now I'm hooked. Working with fellow apprentices, as well as so many amazing professionals has helped me to know that I am meant to be a dancer.

</div><br/><br/></div>","A note from Ellen:
Thank you for taking the time to read about my experiences, and my
 hopes for attending SDL. What I desire to take away from my time there 
is a new perspective on what kind of dancer I am and what kind of dancer
 I could be; I truly believe the instructors can help me get there. With
 the 5-week program I have the chance to participate in the Apprentice 
program with an acclaimed choreographer and dancer who will no doubt 
bring out a better dancer in all the students.  Every penny counts, and it would really be a blessing to be able to experience this!

Dear Friends,

Welcome!  from the Peterson family of beautiful Whidbey Island, WA:  Brian and Molly, Hannah, our college student on the right, and youngest daughter Ellen, standing next to Dad.  Our sixteen-year-old Ellen has been dancing since age 4, twelve of those years at The Ballet Slipper Conservatory under the direction of Diane Geragotelis, an amazing ballet teacher and choreographer. Here are two photos of her as Alice, in Alice in Wonderland, just after she had turned 12 years old:
           
And some from her last year at The Ballet Slipper Conservatory:
     
Nutcracker, 2013
Ellen rose to the highest class by age 11, and enjoyed the opportunity to perform many lead roles, choreograph to various music styles, and even teach all four levels of ballet class for a day while Miss Diane was on vacation!Recently, Ellen and I (Molly) made a temporary move in order for her to join the Jubilee Dance Co. of Dancing For Joy (DFJ from now on), a dance company she fell in love with after meeting several members at a summer dance intensive.  Read a great article about the directors of DFJ here.  Imagine how thrilled we all were as we watched her dance the part of Mary in the Christmas Nativity show, 'We Danced Our Best For Him' performed at the beautiful Mount Baker Theater in Bellingham, WA this December!  


   





(Click on 'gallery' at the top for more fun photos - dance through the years!)

Along with taking ballet, jazz, modern, hip hop, contemporary and lyrical dance at DFJ, Ellen has participated in many community events and enjoyed being a teacher's assistant.  One of her favorite experiences was choreographing a modern piece for five dancers for DFJ's  Thirst No More March benefit to raise money for Evangeline International's Sweet Water Wells project.  The dancers succeeded in securing funds for a 5th well donated by DFJ as well as funds toward a 6th! Each year, the students are given an update on the building progress of the wells they have worked so hard for - the fruit (or shall we say, drink?) of their labors!Check out this cool video created by Anthony Fiorillo of Ellen and her friend, Ian (who also danced as Joseph in the Nativity) at a women's day retreat at Hillcrest Chapel.  They are performing a piece they danced for the March benefit, (set to different music in the video): This spring, a group of the Dancing For Joy students carpooled to Seattle in order to audition for SDL, the summer dance lab held at Whitman College where Ellen first met her DFJ friends. It was such an honor for her to be remembered by the directors of the program, Lydia Tetzlaff and John Passafiume.  On completion of the audition, Ellen received a $450 scholarship, and was highly recommended to apply for the apprenticeship program led by guest Repetiteur Brett Perry if she chose to attend for the full five weeks.  Due to the high cost of the program, Ellen had only signed up for three weeks, which was a financial stretch to begin with!  Here is a portion of her acceptance letter:Dear Ellen, It was good to see you again. Thank you for auditioning for Summer Dance Lab's 2015 program. We greatly enjoyed viewing your work in class and are very happy to inform you that you have been accepted to this Summer's SDL intensive! Because of your performance in class, we strongly encourage you to attend the full five weeks of the program. We see that you did not mark this as a preference on your application, but if you were open to reconsidering the amount of time that you would attend, we feel that at your current stage of training the intensity and immersion of the full five weeks would benefit you immensely. In addition, we'd also like to offer you some financial assistance in the form of one of our tuition merit scholarships in the amount of $450.00. This scholarship is offered based on attendance for the full five week session. Additionally, all of our five week students are eligible to audition for our Apprentice Program.  We think that you would be a very strong candidate. The dancers chosen will have the opportunity to perform in a new work to be created on our students by guest Repetiteur Brett Perry in an exciting work by world renown choreographer Trey McIntyre. This work will share the program on the annual Walla Walla Dance Festival to be held in Cordiner Hall on July 31st. Whether our five week students are chosen for the apprentice program or not, our small classes with highly individualized attention and broad spectrum of dance faculty, encompassing the very best of the current dance world, ensures that our dancers leave the program with greater strength, physical awareness, and artistry to take with them on their individual path in dance. Again, congratulations on your acceptance to SDL! We are proud of your good showing at our audition, and we look forward to dancing with you this summer!    Sincerely,John Passafiume & Lydia Tetzlaff, Directors, Summer Dance LabIs it any wonder she wants to attend for the full five weeks now??


Introducing: Our Campaign!The total cost of five weeks at Summer Dance Lab is:Five-Week Program: June 28 - August 1

Tuition
$2,039


Room and Board
$2,655


Admin. Fee
$45Pointe shoes, character shoes, character skirt $283Total: $5,022Thankfully, we have a few subtractions:SDL scholarship  - $450Personal Donations (friends/family-including Ellen's Dad!)  - $1,272Total Adjusted Balance: $3300
 



With the cost of nonstop year-round dancing, renting our place in Bellingham, an older daughter in college, substantial medical bills each year, a one-income household and everyday living, paying for the full five week program just isn't feasible.  We looked into several local scholarships, but all required the 
recipient to be a student of the public school system, and Ellen is a 
home-schooled student.  So we look to you, our community, to help us:  it takes a village to send a dancer to a summer intensive! Every little bit helps.  Know that your contribution will go towards SDL's dance intensive.  If our goal isn't reached, we'll use any funds received 
toward the remaining balance (most likely of the 3-week program) and kiss Dad a million times for being such
 an understanding Artist's father.  If there happens to be any extra funding, it will all go
 directly into our Dancing ForJoy account for future dance expenses.
For every $100-299 contribution, you will receive this lovely mini - poster  featuring Ellen and her fellow Jubilee Dance Co. member (and boyfriend), Elijah Ryan to thank you for supporting the art of dance!Actual size:  11.25"" x 17.3""



You can be a vital part of making Ellen's dream a reality!  
Imagine knowing that with your help, Ellen has had the training and expertise it takes to become a professional-level dancer and solid dance teacher and choreographer!   And she will bring this training home with her to help her studio bless the community of Whatcom County and beyond.   We would love for you to pass this on to anyone you know interested in supporting young dancers!

Hi! My name is Sebastian Pray and I am currently a senior Theatre and Performance major at Purchase College. For my senior thesis, I am adapting and devising an experimental theatre piece based on Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story The Yellow Wallpaper. The process has been absolutely thrilling and thought provoking. I am working in collaboration with a talented ensemble, a playwright, and designers in the Theatre Design/Technology program. There's just one thing missing--funding. Creating new and exciting theatre can be difficult, but it's important to me to tell this story with the integrity that it deserves.
   ""It was not intended to drive people crazy, but to save people from being driven crazy, and it worked."" - Gilman, on The Yellow Wallpaper

The narrator becomes fascinated with the wallpaper, and begins to see women creeping about within it. In her text, Gilman examines the gender roles and the expectations of women in the Victorian Era.

<h3>Why Studio Azul? </h3>
<p>Studio Azul is more than a dance studio- It's a community that inspires people to reach their full potential. I'm Lily, owner, founder and artistic director of Studio Azul. Two years ago when I opened the doors to my little 800 SQF space on Lake City Way I was looking for a place for me and my 15 dancers to rehearse and grow. It was beyond my wildest dreams that what I was truly doing was making a space for our student base to quadruple, creating a home where people feel safe, understood and confident all while giving myself a platform to push the envelope of Latin Dance in Seattle and around the country. It is because of my belief in our community and our commitment to one another that we have outgrown our current studio and will be expanding to a new home opening December of 2019. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What do we need to do this? </h3>
<p>In addition to small business loans for the major construction of our space we are looking for crowd funding to help with costs associated specifically with our studio and equipment needs. Funding raised in this campaign will go towards- </p>
<ul>
<li>Mirrors for approximately 80 feet of wall length </li>
<li>Sound equipment including speakers and microphones </li>
<li>Equipment for dance conditioning and yoga (new mats, yoga blocks, stretching bands, balls, pilates rings and weights) </li>
<li>Furniture for our new lobby waiting area </li>
</ul>
<p>Every contribution is treasured- our goal is to create an incredible experience for every person who walks through our doors and these additions to our facility will be priceless. This list is in priority order- if we do not reach our campaign goal we will start at the top and use funds until we run out. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>With great space comes great responsibility- </h3>
<p>While we are stoked to be able to offer double the classes we currently do, expand our team programs, kids program and beginners program. While there is a need in our new neighborhood building classes from the ground up can be challenging. Having this funding will allow us more flexibility to stay consistent with our classes as they build. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sometimes monetary commitment just isn't an option- and we totally understand! Other ways you can support us include- </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>From 2010 to 2015, Between the Seas established itself in New York as the only platform presenting and promoting the work of independent Mediterranean artists and encouraging cultural exchanges between Mediterranean and North American artists. After a 4 year break during which we expanded our activities around the world, we return to New York with a 4 day Mediterranean performing arts platform.</p>
<p>Between the Seas has always been and will remain a grassroots, independent platform ran by artists and for artists, taking risks in our programming and offering opportunities to emerging performers. We work voluntarily and we cover part of our expenses from ticket sales. Which is why YOUR support is vital in allowing us to exist and continue our work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The way Between the Seas works is that we cover the production costs of organizing the platform in NYC, while artists take care of their flight and accommodation costs. The basic costs of production include: theater space rental, press and marketing, and technical support staff.

<p>We hope that you'll get interested in our programming and you'll become a part of our community. Between the Seas makes every effort to offer quality, interesting and socially relevant programming in a highly professional setting, and create those conditions that will allow our community of artists, audiences and friends, to get together, meet, exchange ideas and experiences. As an independent organization, we cannot do this without your help!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our vision with Between the Seas is to contribute to the ecology of New York's performing arts with the exciting, diverse voices of Mediterranean artists; and to give those artists the opportunity, to experience this exciting city, and share their work with the world. In the 8 years we have been operating between New York and Greece, we have created a strong community of artists with whom we collaborate on a regular basis:  we have presented artists in NYC that have later been invited to Greece and vice versa; and we have introduced to NYC Mediterranean playwrights whose work has then been produced. Ultimately, what we care for is dialogue and communication - between artists and audiences. Seeing the increasing corporatization of culture, the increasing isolationism and fear of others, we really think it is important that we stay in the picture and defend our place in the world - as artists, cultural practitioners, and citizens operating at the grassroots level. By supporting us you become an integral part of this vision and you help sustain the cultural diversity that we urgently need.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>No amount is small in this effort - imagine that if 100 people give $10, that's already about half the money we seek to raise!</p>
<p>Yet if you can't donate, we totally understand. But if you still believe in us and want to get involved, you will greatly help us by helping us promote this fundraiser, by spreading the word about the festival so audiences come and see it, and of course by coming to see some of our shows this May!</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
From 2010 to 2015, Between the Seas established itself in New York as the only platform presenting and promoting the work of independent Mediterranean artists and encouraging cultural exchanges between Mediterranean and North American artists. After a 4 year break during which we expanded our activities around the world, we return to New York with a 4 day Mediterranean performing arts platform.
Between the Seas has always been and will remain a grassroots, independent platform ran by artists and for artists, taking risks in our programming and offering opportunities to emerging performers. We work voluntarily and we cover part of our expenses from ticket sales. Which is why YOUR support is vital in allowing us to exist and continue our work.

 
What We Need & What You Get
The way Between the Seas works is that we cover the production costs of organizing the platform in NYC, while artists take care of their flight and accommodation costs. The basic costs of production include: theater space rental, press and marketing, and technical support staff. The amount we are trying to raise through this campaign will go towards covering about half of these costs while the other half we seek to cover through ticket sales.
We hope that you'll get interested in our programming and you'll become a part of our community. Between the Seas makes every effort to offer quality, interesting and socially relevant programming in a highly professional setting, and create those conditions that will allow our community of artists, audiences and friends, to get together, meet, exchange ideas and experiences. As an independent organization, we cannot do this without your help!

<h3>New Year, New Dances</h3>
<p>This January over 300 choreographers across the country will take the NACHMO challenge and choreograph a new dance piece in one month. It will be our 11th season of giving dancers, choreographers, and movers of all kinds a choreographic kick in the pants!</p>
<p>At the end of the month, we produce a series of informal studio shows and two fully produced theater shows in NYC so that choreographers can share their new pieces with the public. In a nutshell, NACHMO is a creative challenge culminating in a festival of new dances. Our goal is to encourage and support the creation of new dance work by providing a deadline, a community of peers, and low-cost performance opportunities. The shows allow choreographers to see their work in performance - they are a learning opportunity, a way to strengthen ties among participants, and a celebration of the effort that went into the creation of the new dances.</p>
<p>This campaign will help us fund these shows by ensuring that we have the cash to pay for studio and theater rentals while keeping ticket prices and choreographer fees super low. Your contribution facilitates the creation of new dances, strengthens the NYC dance community, and gives the public opportunities to see new dances for as little as $10. Thank you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need And Where it Goes</h3>
<p>To cover the cost of renting studios at the Mark Morris Dance Center and the Mark O'Donnell Theater at the Actors Fund Arts Center, while keeping studio tickets to $10 and theater tickets to $20, NACHMO NYC needs $1,200 at the start of the season.</p>
<p>100% of the funds from this campaign go to our performance rental fees.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Perks!</h3>
<p>We're grateful for a gift of any amount, and we'd love to thank you with a postcard, a tote bag, a personalized dance, or any of the perks listed at right.</p>

The company was originally created after a visit from the Royal Shakespeare Company who brought a very scholarly and dry approach to the work- so our idea was ‘what if that if there were no footnotes, or title page, would someone reading the play discover comedy or satire within what has been labeled as Tragedy?’ We thought it would be fun to try and mine that from the text. We use the actual text with some careful editing and a few modern references to create an all new version of the play. Our plays attempt to give the Bard back to the Groundlings-you know, bawdy and brash! As an independent theatre ‘company’ it is difficult to find funding to bring our works to the stage so we are asking for your help! It is extremely expensive for a company like ours to find the finances required to bring our plays to the stage, but we feel that what we offer is fun and fresh.

Whether it is lack of performance space or the price tag to rent it, or lack of funding to present the show in the best possible light or any number of other roadblocks, self-producing is not an easy task. Six on Shakespeare has been lucky enough to have produced several well received and funny shows (The Comedic Tragedy of Hamlet (featuring a ‘speak the speech’ audition session), The Comedic Tragedy of Romeo &amp; Juliet (featuring a 6’ 4” male Juliet), the cult classic Comedic Tragedy of MacBeth (featuring a Scotch Tape design set that fell apart as the kingdom crumbled) and Hamlet the Vampire Slayer (a horror homage with Werewolves, Vampires and Sadomasochistic lesbian Rosencrantz and Guildenstern) over the past decades but haven’t been able to find space since 2002. Now we have! Now we need your help! If you ‘know’ Shakespeare the scripts are filled with winks and nods to other works for deeper chuckles.

It is hard to find sponsors for one off productions like ours without a full ‘season’ to advertise. We rely on the kindness of others to produce shows we think (and have proven to present) are highly entertaining and enjoyable.

</div></div>","Articulate Theatre Company is an award winning ensemble-based
company that was created in early 2013 and is committed to challenging and
connecting audiences & artists with clearly structured work that is
intelligent, thought-provoking and visually striking. 
Theatre is an art but it’s also a business
- and it can be a very tough business in New York City.  Tough or not we
are determined to bring you, our audience, performances you will be talking
about long after the show is done.  And with your assistance we can
make this happen!
ATC is helmed by Cat Parker (Artistic Director), Brittney Venable (Managing Director), and Maeve Yore (Producing
Director) but its heart and soul is our Company:
the professional actors, designers, playwrights, producers, as well as people
with experience in radio, television, and film, that round out this talented
group. 
Articulate
Theatre Company's First Season was far more successful than we
could ever have hoped - thanks to you! 
Here is a
look back at our season:
Our award
winning first production Dragon





Paying Homage to a Puitzer Prize winning Wordsmith, Seamus Heaney

Our first Articulating
the Arts, a benefit that finds inspiration from other art forms
for new plays

 And we even found time to partner
with The New York Shakespeare Exchange to create a Sonnet Video.



All of these
came together extremely well. Now we're ready to move into year
two and challenge ourselves even more! 
We
are determined to not slow down but we need your help to keep us going in the right direction! This is us practicing our ""Please, won't you donate today?!?!"" faces. Now - Once more with feeling!

<p><b>The Spectrum Theatre Company creates professional productions that promote artistic excellence through thought provoking stories of the human condition as seen through the spectrum of the African American experience.</b></p>
<p>Our Illumination Celebration was an undeniable success as you can see from the video highlights supplied by RAW Entertainment Films.</p>

<p>The event was graced with not only some of Austin's finest performers by trade (including Julius Tennon, Eugene Lee, Pamela Hart, The Tim Curry Trio, Blue Gardenia, and Dynasty), but also by some of Austin's most respected members of the political and legal community, like State Representative Dawnna Dukes, Chief of Police Art Acevedo, Asst. City Manager Anthony Snipes, Asst. District Attorney Gary Cobb, and Brigid Shae, throwing their support behind Spectrum Theatre Company by taking the stage themselves.  Take a look at this hilarious scene featuring ""The Beautiful Ms. Dee Dee"" supplied by RAW Entertainment Films.</p>

<p>It was a lot of fun, and the community
support was very warm and very generous.</p>It was a great beginning, and our work continues!<p></p>
<p>Spectrum
Theatre Company’s  goal is to create professional productions that promote artistic excellence through thought provoking stories of the human condition as seen through the spectrum of the African American experience. To this end, one of the pieces that we're looking to present is ""Once on this Island,"" a Caribbean-flavored musical by the Tony Award-winning songwriting
team of Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty based upon the book ""My Love, My
Love"" by Rosa Guy, set in the French Antilles in the Caribbean Sea. The
show also includes elements of the Romeo and Juliet story, as well as the
fairytale of ""The Little Mermaid."" The story concerns a peasant girl
on a tropical island who uses the power of love to bring together people of
different social classes.</p>
<p>Spectrum Theatre Company is committed to developing new works, conducting educational outreach, providing community enrichment, and ensuring that plays contained in the canon of Black Theatre do not go forgotten, but find life on its stage.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Spectrum Theatre Company was founded by veterans of the stage.  We recognize that quality theatre does not occur in a vacuum, as patrons of the arts, you know this, too.  It costs, and its creators deserve to be compensated for their contributions.</p>
<p>Our budgetary breakdown is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$4,670.00 is needed for performance royalties and rental of associated materials.</li>
<li>$10,000.00 is needed scenic construction materials and costumes.</li>
<li>$12,900.00 is needed to employ directors, designers, technicians, managers and crew.</li>
<li>$13,020.00 is needed to employ actors, dancers and musicians.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>$3,000.00 is needed for media publicity and advertising.</li>

</div><div> <p>Your support of this campaign will do much more than fund a production, you will be involving yourself as a forceful agent in helping to propel Spectrum Theatre Company's more altruistic goals, which are:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing public awareness of the significant
     contributions of African Americans in creating a diversified American
     theatrical tradition.    </li>
<li>Encouraging and facilitating a culturally diverse and
     all-inclusive America by using theatre to teach, criticize, comment
     and model.</li>
<li>Using theatre to create an American mythology that
     includes African Americans and other peoples of color in every thread of
     the fabric of our society.</li>
<li>Continuing to maintain and stabilize a black performing
     arts community.</li>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/822600/files/20140830080622-RBB-AS-YOU-LIKE-IT-DUKE_FREDERICK.jpg?1409411182"" src="""" style=""width: 327.297709923664px; height: 397px;""/>                                                           </p>
<p>received these reviews for his performances in William Shakespeare's ""Richard III and Sean Michael Rice's ""'Rounds"":<br/></p>
<b><i>""Brown's is the most complete
transformation of actor into character I've seen in Shakespearean
theater.  He combines the majesty, the lofty distance, which Shakespeare's
language requires of a prince and king such as Richard with immediacy, the
sense of real presence as a person...he is villainy personified."" 
Also, ""My favorite production this season, hands down, was Richard III...I
will remember Reginald Brown as Richard III for the rest of my living
days.""</i></b><br/>
</div><div>
<p><b><i>
<b><i>Steven Davison (The Home News)</i></b></i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>“Welcome back,
Reginald C. Brown.  Brown has been a presence
on the New Jersey theater scene, having co-founded Ensemble Theatre of
Newark.  Before that he acted at
Crossroads Theatre and the George Street Playhouse…Let’s be glad he’s returned,
for he’s riveting in “Rounds”, currently at 12 Miles West in Montclair...Brown is the outstanding one, though.  What a pleasure to see so natural an actor, trick-free,
quietly confident that he understands the character and can play him for height
and depth.  When he reminisces on his
childhood, then on the vast amounts of work his hands have done, he does each
with brave dignity.  But, he’ll return to
the matter at hand and zero in on his quest not to be a victim one more time.  When Freeman tells him, “Violence isn’t the
answer,” Brown makes the observation that, “It gets their attention” in a way
that sounds level-headed.  “Pride, that’s
it,” he states.  Well, Brown can be very
proud of his performance.”                                                                       Peter Filichia (The Star Ledger)</i></b></p>
<p><span>The following reviews of Jacqui Cross' (STC
Managing Director) award winning turns in ""Mahalia"" by Tom
Stolz, and ""Dreamgirls"" with music by Henry Krieger and lyrics and
book by Tom Eyen, are testaments to her amazing artistic contributions.</span></p>

<br/><p><b><i>“So stirring is Jacqui Cross' readings of
Jackson's songbook. There is no way an audience can refrain from clapping along
to the infusion of energy and good religion encapsulated in those soulful,
four-four time numbers.  The amazing Cross receives just as amazing
backing from Janis Stinson and Billy Harden. Some of the best moments are when the three
go at it a cappella, for intricate, soulful songs that seem to flow from
characters too full of the Lord's music to keep quiet.” <br/><span>Robi Polgar
(The Austin Chronicle)</span></i></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<b><i>“Enough cannot be said about Jacqui Cross'
forceful performance as the turbulent Effie. Cross' voice finds the bottom of
your soul, toys with it awhile, then yanks it right out of your body. Yes, she
is that good.”                     Adrienne Martini (The Austin Chronicle</i></b>)<br/><br/>In awarding Janis M. Stinson (STC Associate Director) the ""Best Voice of Authority"" award, the Austin Chronicle declares:<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/824283/files/20140831071414-Janis_M_Stinson_Blues_in_the_Night.jpg?1409494454"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b><i>“Some stage
performers need time to develop that convincing sense of experience that
grounds them in a character or a song. Not Janis Stinson. The instant this
warm, funny actress/singer opens her mouth, whether it's to belt out
""Blues in the Night,"" deliver the poetic musings of a grieving widow
in <span>The America Play, or
take us ""Way Over Yonder"" via the music of Carole King, she convinces
you that she Knows Whereof She Speaks, that she's Been There and Done That. For
Stinson always draws her rich, ripe, husky voice from deep within, straight
from her soul, and it gives her automatic authority. That voice, matched with
an electric presence and priceless comic savvy, puts Stinson in the top rank of

The Spectrum Theatre Company creates professional productions that promote artistic excellence through thought provoking stories of the human condition as seen through the spectrum of the African American experience.
Our Illumination Celebration was an undeniable success as you can see from the video highlights supplied by RAW Entertainment Films.

The event was graced with not only some of Austin's finest performers by trade (including Julius Tennon, Eugene Lee, Pamela Hart, The Tim Curry Trio, Blue Gardenia, and Dynasty), but also by some of Austin's most respected members of the political and legal community, like State Representative Dawnna Dukes, Chief of Police Art Acevedo, Asst. City Manager Anthony Snipes, Asst. District Attorney Gary Cobb, and Brigid Shae, throwing their support behind Spectrum Theatre Company by taking the stage themselves.  Take a look at this hilarious scene featuring ""The Beautiful Ms. Dee Dee"" supplied by RAW Entertainment Films.



It was a lot of fun, and the community
support was very warm and very generous.It was a great beginning, and our work continues!
Spectrum
Theatre Company’s  goal is to create professional productions that promote artistic excellence through thought provoking stories of the human condition as seen through the spectrum of the African American experience. To this end, one of the pieces that we're looking to present is ""Once on this Island,"" a Caribbean-flavored musical by the Tony Award-winning songwriting
team of Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty based upon the book ""My Love, My
Love"" by Rosa Guy, set in the French Antilles in the Caribbean Sea. The
show also includes elements of the Romeo and Juliet story, as well as the
fairytale of ""The Little Mermaid."" The story concerns a peasant girl
on a tropical island who uses the power of love to bring together people of
different social classes.
Spectrum Theatre Company is committed to developing new works, conducting educational outreach, providing community enrichment, and ensuring that plays contained in the canon of Black Theatre do not go forgotten, but find life on its stage.

Spectrum Theatre Company was founded by veterans of the stage.  We recognize that quality theatre does not occur in a vacuum, as patrons of the arts, you know this, too.  It costs, and its creators deserve to be compensated for their contributions.
Our budgetary breakdown is as follows:

$4,670.00 is needed for performance royalties and rental of associated materials.
$10,000.00 is needed scenic construction materials and costumes.
$12,900.00 is needed to employ directors, designers, technicians, managers and crew.
$13,020.00 is needed to employ actors, dancers and musicians.


$3,000.00 is needed for media publicity and advertising.



The Impact

 Your support of this campaign will do much more than fund a production, you will be involving yourself as a forceful agent in helping to propel Spectrum Theatre Company's more altruistic goals, which are:


Increasing public awareness of the significant
     contributions of African Americans in creating a diversified American
     theatrical tradition.    
Encouraging and facilitating a culturally diverse and
     all-inclusive America by using theatre to teach, criticize, comment
     and model.
Using theatre to create an American mythology that
     includes African Americans and other peoples of color in every thread of
     the fabric of our society.
Continuing to maintain and stabilize a black performing
     arts community.

While this is Spectrum Theatre Company's inaugural season, its members are seasoned award winning performing artists and directors whose credits range from regional, to international.  Check out Janis Marie Stinson, Felicia Dinwiddie and Jacqui Cross:

Critical Praise For STC Members
Awards received by STC members include, but are not limited to, the B. Iden Payne Award, the Austin Critics Table Award and the Ostrander Award.  Here's what some of the critics have said about some of our member's performances.
Reginald C. Brown (Artistic Director of Spectrum Theatre Company) seen here in Austin Shakespeare's ""As You Like It"":
                                                           
received these reviews for his performances in William Shakespeare's ""Richard III and Sean Michael Rice's ""'Rounds"":
""Brown's is the most complete
transformation of actor into character I've seen in Shakespearean
theater.  He combines the majesty, the lofty distance, which Shakespeare's
language requires of a prince and king such as Richard with immediacy, the
sense of real presence as a person...he is villainy personified."" 
Also, ""My favorite production this season, hands down, was Richard III...I
will remember Reginald Brown as Richard III for the rest of my living
days.""


Steven Davison (The Home News)

“Welcome back,
Reginald C. Brown.  Brown has been a presence
on the New Jersey theater scene, having co-founded Ensemble Theatre of
Newark.  Before that he acted at
Crossroads Theatre and the George Street Playhouse…Let’s be glad he’s returned,
for he’s riveting in “Rounds”, currently at 12 Miles West in Montclair...Brown is the outstanding one, though.  What a pleasure to see so natural an actor, trick-free,
quietly confident that he understands the character and can play him for height
and depth.  When he reminisces on his
childhood, then on the vast amounts of work his hands have done, he does each
with brave dignity.  But, he’ll return to
the matter at hand and zero in on his quest not to be a victim one more time.  When Freeman tells him, “Violence isn’t the
answer,” Brown makes the observation that, “It gets their attention” in a way
that sounds level-headed.  “Pride, that’s
it,” he states.  Well, Brown can be very
proud of his performance.”                                                                       Peter Filichia (The Star Ledger)
The following reviews of Jacqui Cross' (STC
Managing Director) award winning turns in ""Mahalia"" by Tom
Stolz, and ""Dreamgirls"" with music by Henry Krieger and lyrics and
book by Tom Eyen, are testaments to her amazing artistic contributions.



“So stirring is Jacqui Cross' readings of
Jackson's songbook. There is no way an audience can refrain from clapping along
to the infusion of energy and good religion encapsulated in those soulful,
four-four time numbers.  The amazing Cross receives just as amazing
backing from Janis Stinson and Billy Harden. Some of the best moments are when the three
go at it a cappella, for intricate, soulful songs that seem to flow from
characters too full of the Lord's music to keep quiet.” Robi Polgar
(The Austin Chronicle)

“Enough cannot be said about Jacqui Cross'
forceful performance as the turbulent Effie. Cross' voice finds the bottom of
your soul, toys with it awhile, then yanks it right out of your body. Yes, she
is that good.”                     Adrienne Martini (The Austin Chronicle)In awarding Janis M. Stinson (STC Associate Director) the ""Best Voice of Authority"" award, the Austin Chronicle declares:
“Some stage
performers need time to develop that convincing sense of experience that
grounds them in a character or a song. Not Janis Stinson. The instant this
warm, funny actress/singer opens her mouth, whether it's to belt out
""Blues in the Night,"" deliver the poetic musings of a grieving widow
in The America Play, or
take us ""Way Over Yonder"" via the music of Carole King, she convinces
you that she Knows Whereof She Speaks, that she's Been There and Done That. For
Stinson always draws her rich, ripe, husky voice from deep within, straight
from her soul, and it gives her automatic authority. That voice, matched with
an electric presence and priceless comic savvy, puts Stinson in the top rank of
Austin stage artists.”

And, Judy R. Arnold-Hunter (STC Company Member), garnered the following review for her role in ""Crowns"" by Regina Taylor, adapted from the book by Michael Cunningham and Craig Marberry:
“Judy Arnold raises
the roof (and very nearly old Lazarus himself) when she sings ""Mary, Don't
You Weep."" Jacqui Cross makes ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow"" into a
commanding anthem of both belief and liberation.  Crowns doesn't spend much time discussing
civil rights or slavery, but when Cross belts out ""I sing because I'm
free,"" it seems to come from the heart of the African-American experience
and an emancipation dearly purchased after generations in chains.""                                                                                                                              Robert
Faires (The Austin Chronicle)

As well as a trophy and inauguration into the EuroStar Hall of Fame, the winners will also receive free passes to 63 swing dance events around the world, to encourage them to pursue their love of dancing. Marcos will basically need support for fly tickets, accommodation and food.For the next year, Marcos Agote will become one of the most closely followed Lindy Hoppers in the world. THE REASON? He is the 2013 winner of the Eurostar Award – an annual prize given to two dancers who best embody the spirit of swing dancing. The Eurostar award comprises of 63 tickets to the most prestigious Lindy Hop events around the world - an incredible gift and something most Lindy Hop dancers could only ever dream of getting their hands on. A typical Lindy Hop event consists of training with international teachers, performance opportunities and plenty of chances to compete.              
                       They often start on a Friday and last until breakfast time on Monday morning (Lindy Hoppers dance ALL night long).                                        Lindy Hop events are widely documented on YouTube, Facebook, and Flikr. It is not unusual for performances to attract thousands of views once they’re uploaded onto YouTube. Over the next year, Marcos will be photographed and filmed performing, training and competing thousands of times. He is fast becoming ‘the one to watch’.And deservedly so: 
Only a week after winning the Eurostar award in London, Marcos has already competed in and won first place in Showcase Division at Lindyshock (Budapest) - an event renowned for attracting the most talented Lindy Hoppers in the world:All this after only dancing for 1.5 years.       Finding the money to fund the flights for this once in a life-time Lindy Hop adventure is now the only thing holding Marcos back from taking full advantage of this incredible opportunity - one which will solidify his deserved position amongst the swing dancing elite.                  
Without funding, Marcos will have to forgo the vast majority of the events donated by the Eurostar Award - missing out on the opportunity to learn from the best dancers in the world and also perform, compete and develop his own teaching skills. Marcos is now working against the clock, looking for funding and sponsorship that will allow him to pursue his passion and take full advantage of this truly amazing prize.          Marcos Agotewww.marcosagote.com",11.0,3,"1 Campaign

</div><p><b>About SA Met Ballet</b></p>
<p>San
Antonio Metropolitan Ballet, founded in 1983 as San Antonio Dance Theatre, is a non-profit youth dance
company, member Regional Dance America. The Company trains local dancers and
choreographers age 9-24 with a foundation of ballet and modern styles. Artistic
Director, Susan B. Connally and Associate Director, Karin Connally Heiden, both
earned their Bachelor of Fine Arts in Dance from The Boston Conservatory. SA
Met Ballet has collaborated with such professional companies as Ballet West and
Mejia Ballet International for their productions of “The Nutcracker” and The
Royal Ballet Covent Garden for their US Production of “The Sleeping Beauty.” </p>
<p>San
Antonio Metropolitan Ballet’s mission is to provide high quality,
pre-professional instruction to local dancers and choreographers in a
stimulating and nurturing environment through the presentation of
cost-conscious, family-oriented productions, aimed at uplifting the San Antonio
arts community.</p>
<p>SA
Met Ballet seeks funds to produce two public performances and one closed-
performance for elementary students for the fall presentation of “Snow White,”
a new 3-act ballet.</p>
<p>Our
goal is, for the first time in our 30-season history, to present our fall
ballet with live music, accompanied by members of the Mid-Texas Symphony.</p>
<p>This
production benefits the following areas:<br/>
  1) Educational Outreach – the Children’s
Series performance is being presented to five area Elementary Schools that have
Title I qualifications. This means greater than 50% of the population served by
these schools are considered to be economically disadvantaged and culturally
underserved. Our Children’s Series program offers much needed arts programming
not realized at schools that have experienced recent budgetary cuts. Last
season, when bringing her school to our production of “A Mid-Summer Night’s
Dream,” a local middle school drama teacher exclaimed,“The
experience was amazing for my students.  It surpassed my expectations!
 This is the only way I've been able to effectively address the evaluation
TEKS for theatre that require students be able to compare different modes of
performance.”<br/>
  2) Community Service – Through our
Children’s Series programming, our company dancers are taught about giving back
to their community through service hours performing for the Title I Schools. SA
Met Ballet also offers admission-free ticket vouchers to local Social Service
Agencies to the public performances. In past seasons, agencies such as Roy Maas
Youth Alternative, the local Ronald McDonald House and St. Joseph’s and St.
Peter’s Children’s Home have participated in our performance voucher program.
In 2009, SA Met Ballet was able to offer over $40,000 worth of program tickets
to Title I Schools and Social Service Agencies. <br/>
  3) Economic Impact of the Arts on
the Local Community – We are able to provide paid work for local professional
dancers, seamstresses, stagehands, and musicians. We utilize locally-owned,
small businesses to provide printing, costume and set construction services.
Local restaurants and hotels are booked for guest travel. <br/>
  4) Community Inclusion – Through our
Extra Student Dancer Roles, we are able to include a wide cross-section of the
community in our fall performances free-of-charge. Community students
participate in weekly rehearsals over a period from mid-August through
performances in November. We provide costumes and headpieces at no cost to the
participants as well.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The total project of “Snow White” will cost
     approximately $67,000. We do have funding from the City of San Antonio
     Department for Culture and Creative Development that will help cover approximately
     20% of this program.</li>
<li>Funding for this project will go to the following basic
     categories: Theatre Rental, Costumes, Sets/Props, Guest Artists,
     Choreographer/Composer, the Symphony, Stagehands and most importantly –
     the Children’s Series Educational Outreach Program.</li>
<li>We’ve got some great perks for lovers of ballet and
     theatre. From playbill “Patron Thank-Yous” to Performance T-Shirts to Performance
     Tickets to Meet &amp; Greets, we have a wonderful perk for every donor
     level. For those who would specifically like to help the Children’s Series
     program – We have a category just for you!</li>
<li>We believe in the tried and true phrase, “The Snow must
     go on – I mean, the SHOW must go on!” Any portion of our funding will be
     utilized to produce our performance of “Snow White.” Your contribution
     will help keep our program running for the talented youth of San Antonio.</li>
</ul><p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Feel free to explain
more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their
contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>SA Met Ballet dancers range in age from 9 to 24. We are
     training students not only to be good dancers, but also productive,
     well-rounded citizens.</li>
<li>The Washington Post recently published a blog that
     speaks to the work we do on a daily basis: “Top 10 Skills Children Learn
     from the Arts” – 1) Creativity, 2) Confidence, 3) Problem Saving, 4)
     Perseverance, 5) Focus, 6) Non-Verbal Communication, 7) Receiving
     Constructive Feedback, 8) Collaboration, 9) Dedication and 10)
     Accountability.</li>
<li>San Antonio Metropolitan Ballet has a 100% high school
     graduation rate. Currently, our two featured company dancers are 1) in the
     top 5% of her graduating class and 2) pre-accepted into her top-choice college
     dance department.</li>
<li>Two of our performances are for the public and one of
     our performances is for an audience of Elementary Students and their
     Teachers/Chaperones. The Student Performance is an Admission-Free
     performance for economically disadvantaged and culturally underserved
     students from San Antonio area Title I schools. Many of these students
     have never before experienced live theatre productions. Included with this
     program is a lecture-demonstration that is presented in their school to
     prepare them for the ballet they are coming to see. SA Met Ballet
     volunteers travel to the schools to introduce the students to the music of
     the ballet, theatre etiquette, costume examples, ballet movement and
     theatre-specific projects. We traditionally have a list of schools who
     contact us directly to ask if their school will be able to attend our
     student programming. These repeat attendees reaffirm the need we fulfill
     in their school’s curriculum and the quality of the product we continue to
     present. Performances such as these also provide hope and inspiration for
     the attending students and give many options for their life path they may
     have not realized was out there.</li>
<li>Our Student Series program also teaches our company
     members the responsibility of giving back to your community. The sooner
     our students learn that their contribution to society is far-reaching
     through these types of productions, the more likely they will be
     productive citizens in the future.</li>
</ul><p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Since we perform in a city facility theatre venue, we
     are required to use a national ticketing agency to sell our tickets. This
     means that we do not see a penny of ticket sales until 2-3 weeks after the
     performance is over; therefore, we must fundraise ahead of time to produce
     our shows. This is sometimes a challenge when there are so many worthy
     causes out there.</li>
<li>We have maintained our season programming for 30 years
     without ever having to cancel a single performance. Even when times have
     gotten hard financially, we have still pulled through with the generosity
     of donors like you. We feel it is because they believe in the quality of
     the work we do and the impact it continues to make on the lives of
     students and their families.</li>
<li>Any time you produce a new performance, there are risks
     and challenges. In this day and age of technology, we must continue to
     reinforce the importance of interpersonal interaction and the value of the
     arts as a much needed factor of one’s collective being.</li>
</ul><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>We understand that everyone may not have the
funds to donate, so we ask you to help in the following ways:</p>

campaign your time and energy to help spread the word of our mission.</p>

cost-conscious, family-oriented productions, aimed at uplifting the San Antonio
arts community.
SA
Met Ballet seeks funds to produce two public performances and one closed-
performance for elementary students for the fall presentation of “Snow White,”
a new 3-act ballet.
Our
goal is, for the first time in our 30-season history, to present our fall
ballet with live music, accompanied by members of the Mid-Texas Symphony.
This
production benefits the following areas:
  1) Educational Outreach – the Children’s
Series performance is being presented to five area Elementary Schools that have
Title I qualifications. This means greater than 50% of the population served by
these schools are considered to be economically disadvantaged and culturally
underserved. Our Children’s Series program offers much needed arts programming
not realized at schools that have experienced recent budgetary cuts. Last
season, when bringing her school to our production of “A Mid-Summer Night’s
Dream,” a local middle school drama teacher exclaimed,“The
experience was amazing for my students.  It surpassed my expectations!
 This is the only way I've been able to effectively address the evaluation
TEKS for theatre that require students be able to compare different modes of
performance.”
  2) Community Service – Through our
Children’s Series programming, our company dancers are taught about giving back
to their community through service hours performing for the Title I Schools. SA
Met Ballet also offers admission-free ticket vouchers to local Social Service
Agencies to the public performances. In past seasons, agencies such as Roy Maas
Youth Alternative, the local Ronald McDonald House and St. Joseph’s and St.
Peter’s Children’s Home have participated in our performance voucher program.
In 2009, SA Met Ballet was able to offer over $40,000 worth of program tickets
to Title I Schools and Social Service Agencies. 
  3) Economic Impact of the Arts on
the Local Community – We are able to provide paid work for local professional
dancers, seamstresses, stagehands, and musicians. We utilize locally-owned,
small businesses to provide printing, costume and set construction services.
Local restaurants and hotels are booked for guest travel. 
  4) Community Inclusion – Through our
Extra Student Dancer Roles, we are able to include a wide cross-section of the
community in our fall performances free-of-charge. Community students
participate in weekly rehearsals over a period from mid-August through
performances in November. We provide costumes and headpieces at no cost to the
participants as well.
What We Need & What You Get

The total project of “Snow White” will cost
     approximately $67,000. We do have funding from the City of San Antonio
     Department for Culture and Creative Development that will help cover approximately
     20% of this program.
Funding for this project will go to the following basic
     categories: Theatre Rental, Costumes, Sets/Props, Guest Artists,
     Choreographer/Composer, the Symphony, Stagehands and most importantly –
     the Children’s Series Educational Outreach Program.
We’ve got some great perks for lovers of ballet and
     theatre. From playbill “Patron Thank-Yous” to Performance T-Shirts to Performance
     Tickets to Meet & Greets, we have a wonderful perk for every donor
     level. For those who would specifically like to help the Children’s Series
     program – We have a category just for you!
We believe in the tried and true phrase, “The Snow must
     go on – I mean, the SHOW must go on!” Any portion of our funding will be
     utilized to produce our performance of “Snow White.” Your contribution
     will help keep our program running for the talented youth of San Antonio.
The Impact
Feel free to explain
more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their
contribution will make:

SA Met Ballet dancers range in age from 9 to 24. We are
     training students not only to be good dancers, but also productive,
     well-rounded citizens.
The Washington Post recently published a blog that
     speaks to the work we do on a daily basis: “Top 10 Skills Children Learn
     from the Arts” – 1) Creativity, 2) Confidence, 3) Problem Saving, 4)
     Perseverance, 5) Focus, 6) Non-Verbal Communication, 7) Receiving
     Constructive Feedback, 8) Collaboration, 9) Dedication and 10)
     Accountability.
San Antonio Metropolitan Ballet has a 100% high school
     graduation rate. Currently, our two featured company dancers are 1) in the
     top 5% of her graduating class and 2) pre-accepted into her top-choice college
     dance department.
Two of our performances are for the public and one of
     our performances is for an audience of Elementary Students and their
     Teachers/Chaperones. The Student Performance is an Admission-Free
     performance for economically disadvantaged and culturally underserved
     students from San Antonio area Title I schools. Many of these students
     have never before experienced live theatre productions. Included with this
     program is a lecture-demonstration that is presented in their school to
     prepare them for the ballet they are coming to see. SA Met Ballet
     volunteers travel to the schools to introduce the students to the music of
     the ballet, theatre etiquette, costume examples, ballet movement and
     theatre-specific projects. We traditionally have a list of schools who
     contact us directly to ask if their school will be able to attend our
     student programming. These repeat attendees reaffirm the need we fulfill
     in their school’s curriculum and the quality of the product we continue to
     present. Performances such as these also provide hope and inspiration for
     the attending students and give many options for their life path they may
     have not realized was out there.
Our Student Series program also teaches our company
     members the responsibility of giving back to your community. The sooner
     our students learn that their contribution to society is far-reaching
     through these types of productions, the more likely they will be
     productive citizens in the future.
Risks & Challenges

Since we perform in a city facility theatre venue, we
     are required to use a national ticketing agency to sell our tickets. This
     means that we do not see a penny of ticket sales until 2-3 weeks after the
     performance is over; therefore, we must fundraise ahead of time to produce
     our shows. This is sometimes a challenge when there are so many worthy
     causes out there.
We have maintained our season programming for 30 years
     without ever having to cancel a single performance. Even when times have
     gotten hard financially, we have still pulled through with the generosity
     of donors like you. We feel it is because they believe in the quality of
     the work we do and the impact it continues to make on the lives of
     students and their families.
Any time you produce a new performance, there are risks
     and challenges. In this day and age of technology, we must continue to
     reinforce the importance of interpersonal interaction and the value of the
     arts as a much needed factor of one’s collective being.

we bring dance to children who may never have the opportunity or resources to access us
 
50 DAYS TO RAISE $5,000
Sharron Miller’s Academy for the Performing Arts (SMAPA) has been  offered a matching challenge grant to raise $5,000 to continue providing an inclusive year-long dance residency to underserved  K–5 students at the  and further, to expand the program to include 6th, 7th and 8th grade students.
 Help us meet the Victoria Foundation’s matching challenge grant so we may continue to bring quality dance education to all the students of Quitman Street Community School. 
 
WHO WE ARE
Sharron Miller’s Academy for the Performing Arts (SMAPA) has provided inclusive, comprehensive, developmental training in dance and related theater arts to children, teens, and adults for 17 years.  SMAPA's teaching philosophy focuses on exploring and nurturing the creative possibilities within every student and is designed to develop the whole person by building skills, stimulating creativity, and fostering self-discipline and self-esteem. 
 SMAPA was founded in 1996 by Sharron Miller - Juilliard-trained, former soloist with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, and Broadway veteran. Year-round training at SMAPA serves more than 1,500 students in four divisions: Preschool (2-5), Junior (6-11), Prep (12 -18), and the Adult division, which also includes a seniors exercise program. The most advanced students from the Prep and Junior Divisions are invited to join the Performance Workshop Ensemble (PWE). Ten students on full merit-based scholarship currently comprise the PWE, receiving the opportunity to work with directors and choreographers on presentational material to be performed within the community.  The PWE  and Junior PWE Programs are supported in part by a generous grant from The Stone Foundation. 
 Beyond classes held at the Montclair facility, SMAPA is committed to developing and implementing meaningful in-school arts experiences with hundreds of young people in collaboration with public schools.  The Quitman Street Community School is one of these collaborations.
 
WHY DANCE?
Dance nurtures the body and the mind. The original concept behind the Quitman program was to reinforce math skills through dance.  Of course, dance is geometric shapes, form, counting, time, recognizing the differences in general and personal space.  For the students at Quitman, the everyday four walls transform into a studio space where the concepts of symmetry and  asymmetry become the lexicon and the body the conductor. The kinesthetic intelligences of hundreds of children are nurtured as the study of dance allows students to work creatively to problem solve, develop sharp listening skills and learn to take control of the body as it moves through space.
 Through our collaboration, we’ve learned that dance creates another viable road for children to express while learning transferable academic skills.  The children with whom we work return to their classrooms with a  more positive self-image, a greater ability to focus and the application of conceptual learning skills.  In addition, the teaching of West African and Latin dance promote a deep sense of cultural grounding and pride.
 
WHAT WE’VE DONE SO FAR
For several years, Mr. Glover, the Quitman School principal,  has created the space for every child in K–5 to experience what we offer throughout the entire school year:
 Creative Movement  Grades K-1
Rhythm & Tap   Grades 2-3
Latin & West African   Grades 4-5
 
HOW THE FUNDS WILL BE USED 
The only way this program can continue is with your support.   
Outside of challenge grant donations, the residency is fully funded by foundational support.  The Victoria Foundation has strongly encouraged us to seek more divergent funding sources and we hope you can join us in meeting our November 14th deadline.  The grant compensates our teaching-artists for providing 14 classes a week for 36 weeks, buys tap shoes for all 2nd and 3rd grade students, and covers the program’s administrative expenses.
 
WHAT WE ENVISION
The  has now  expanded to serve children through the 8th grade.  Our goal is to expand SMAPA’s residency, to offer a combined 6th, 7th and 8th grade dance elective once a week for the entire school year.
Modern, Jazz, Hip-Hop and  Theatre Dance would be offered during this yearlong residency allowing the older students with interest and/or ability the skills necessary to Audition for Newark’s Arts High School.

<p></p></div>","Who We Are
The Young Americans’ Theatre Company (YATC) was founded
in 2008 by six high school students. Since our inception, we have produced a
summer season each year at a different Seattle venue, continually expanding our
company of actors, directors, administrators, and audience. YATC’s work
is entirely produced by teenagers ages 14 – 21. Now, in its seventh year, YATC is
a vibrant piece of Seattle’s theatre community and youth culture. Each year, a
new board of students take over the company’s administration, keeping it fresh
and relevant. YATC provides young
people with opportunities to explore every aspect of the theatre, including tech,
acting, directing and learning about business and marketing as board
members. YATC is completely youth run, and participants have
the rare opportunity to experience program management while still in high
school. Working with YATC is a truly empowering and life
changing experience.            
Why We're Asking for Donations
We want to make our seventh season bigger and better than ever
and we need your help to do that. 
What We Need To Pay For


Space
     This season we are performing at The Eclectic Theatre on Capitol Hill, in
     the heart of Seattle. 

Rights 
     Since we are performing more plays than ever this season we need extra
     money to pay for performance rights. 
Props 
Costumes

Marketing 
     We want to extend our impact on the Seattle community through outreach and
     publicity. 

Tech 
     We want to make sure that the technical elements of our performances are as high quality as the acting and directing that we put so much work into. 

Impact
Participating in any of our programs is always free. We offer an intern training program where students learn project management and business skills. There are also opportunities to direct, act, and work on technical theatre technique every season. YATC provides an opportunity for teens to stay involved in the arts during the summer without having to pay for expensive summer camps. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are unable to provide financial support, you can still help us out by spreading the word about our campaign and YATC as an organization. Please share this campaign to your friends if you can. Most importantly, theatre is nothing without an audience.

<p>Curious Beast Theatre Co. believes that theatre is an
essential tool in bringing about a dialogue on important issues that face
a community as diverse as Los Angeles. We believe that storytelling is at
the forefront of the theatrical experience because it bridges the
gap between seemingly diverse populations and shines a light on our common
human experiences. For without story we are mindless beasts linking
together pieces of information without the framework to understand their
context and application. We honor stories that engage us in an emotional
and cerebral way to inspire conversation about social equality, including sex,
race, religion, as well as civic duty and personal responsibility. With an
emphasis on new works, re-imagined classics and multi-disciplinary projects
incorporating music and dance we will bring to the community stories that
inspire us, haunt us, demand of us, and, in some small way, change us,
always helping us find a way to humanize us all. This year we are producing two
plays for the renowned Hollywood Fringe Festival in Hollywood, California. This
festival bring 35,000 theatre lovers from around the world. </p></span></h3>
<p>One of the plays chosen is called REBORNING by up
and coming playwright Zayd Dohrn. A dark comedy about life-like baby
dolls, latex and phallus. Kelly, an orphan doll maker and Daizy, a hippy art
school dropout, who now use their skills to fill the void of those in need. A
demanding client may be the key to kelly’s past; as she tries to unravel the

While listening to any one of my musical giants from Chaka Khan to Erykah Badu to the Cranberries I began to improvise and record scenes and dialogue.  During this process I also utilized family videos. Inspired by the support of the faculty at UCSD I continued developing my piece. After moving to New York City I started to write and rehearse my solo piece as part of a weekly acting class with JoAnna Beckson. Upon joining the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater Writers Lab, I  continued the process of writing, rehearsing and performing Speak!  There I met director Andreas Robertz, who like the teachers at UCSD, saw something in this piece that was worth developing. With a great director at the helm, I am beyond excited, for the opportunity to perform this show at Under St. Marks Theater, but I can't get there without your financial support!

</div></div>","Hello and welcome to the 2015 FUNDRAISING CAMPAIGN for SCI-FEST LA: The 2nd Annual Los Angeles Science Fiction One-Act Play Festival!
2014 was a very cool year.  After a decade of acting on TV shows like BOSTON LEGAL, MAD MEN, TRUE BLOOD & JUSTIFIED, I got to fulfill a lifelong dream by teaming up with my friends (and veteran LA theater producers) Lee Costello and Michael Blaha to create an utterly unique Sci-Fi Festival here in Hollywood.  

Last May, SCI-FEST LA debuted, bringing 2 rotating evenings of scary, hilarious and mind-bending short plays to Los Angeles starring an incredible cast of actors famous for their work on such iconic TV franchises as STAR TREK, THE X-FILES, LOST, STARGATE: UNIVERSE, HEROES, TRUE BLOOD and FRINGE.  The Fest was such a success (with packed houses & great press) that it's brought a whole new set of even more challenging and amazing scripts our way including knock-out adaptations of Neil Gaiman's ""The Case of Four and Twenty Blackbirds"" and Clive Barker's acclaimed short story, ""The Departed,"" (sent to us by Mr. Barker himself).  We're tremendously excited about bringing all these new stories of time travel, ghostly obsessions and intergalactic journeys to life, but to do them justice, we will need to substantially increase our production budget.  


Last year, we raised an impressive $81,000.00 on Kickstarter and produced a groundbreaking month-long Festival.   Luckily, our major donors believe (as we do) that this opportunity to take Sci-Fest LA to the next level is too amazing to pass up. These incredible people have made us a very generous offer.  If we can raise $100,000.00 via this IndieGoGo campaign, our major donors will contribute an additional 30% MATCHING GRANT!  This would be a real game changer for us. 


Sci-Fest LA is on an utterly unique path.  Unlike the ""cons"" or fan gatherings, Sci-Fest LA is passionately dedicated to the creation of NEW Sci-Fi content.  This year, in addition to our stage shows, we have initiated two new Sci-Fi short fiction contests: THE ROSWELL AWARD (for adult Sci-Fi writers from around the globe) and THE TOMORROW PRIZE (for LA County High School Students).   All funds raised at the presentation ceremony for the Tomorrow Prize will be awarded to the winner's high school science department. Info: www.Sci-FestLA.com  

What We Need & What We Can Offer

Last year, we floated astronauts in space and figured out how to make an live actor's face grow out of an elastic wall.  Almost all the shows we're doing in 2015 will need some kind of specially designed props, lighting, sound effects or prosthetic make up.  All these cool effects require a lot of our designers' time and effort.  This also means paying for more rehearsal time in the theater to perfect those effects before our first audience arrives.  Like last year, the majority of Sci-Fest's budget will be spent on theater rental and the cost of physically producing the plays with only a small portion devoted to modest salaries for key design and production people.

Contributions for the charitable purposes of Sci-Fest LA can now be easily made via Fractured Atlas and are
tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.

The casting has begun, and we have several war veterans in key roles and as members of the ensemble!  With your financial help, we will bring this production to the public!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Raising Oleanna<br/></strong></h2>
<p>We are thrilled to be asking for funding for our innaugural production:  Oleanna by David Mamet.</p>
<p>Why this show?  Read the blog post:  <a href=""http://jaybirdproductions.blogspot.ca/2012/07/why-this-piece-why-now.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://jaybirdproductions.blogspot.ca/2012/07/why-this-piece-why-now.html</a></p>

<h3>Oleanna by David Mamet</h3>
<p>In this critically acclaimed two character play (one of my personal favourites), a college student accuses her professor of sexual exploitation, an act which loses him tenure.  The power struggle between them is riveting.  But who is in the right and who is in the wrong?  You be the judge.</p>

<h3>Our Funding Goal</h3>
</div>
<div>We are looking to raise funds for 1) the rights, 2) theatre, and 3) rehearsal space by the middle of October -- these costs total about $2,500; so this is our funding goal.  We have a great many perks to offer our supporters and, as always, our thanks for anyone who is willing to contribute to the production in any way.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we are able to exceed this goal we will add shows, hire local musicians to create live music for the show, and sock money away for Jaybird's second production.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Currently, a large pool of very talented performers are working at the Community Theatre level in Toronto.  These performers are interested and willing to take up the challenge of edgier work.  We are trying to present shows that are rarely, if ever, performed at this level - Oleanna is one of those shows.  Some community theatres may be making very safe choices at this time but these difficult, relevant stories still deserve to be told.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Folks!  Want to help out the production?  Get props? Costumes?  Hang lights?  Or help us out by spreading the word both about the show and/or this fundraising event. </p>

We can provide our program to seven additional students this summer, too - but we need your help! RLTP is a 501c3 not-for-profit organization, so your donation is tax deductible. All donations, no matter the size, will be recognized in the programs for our Final Presentation Nights. RLTP will also provide a variety of Perks to thank you for your support, according to the level of your donation. There are some fun Perks available, but the most valuable Perk will be the experience that you help supply to these students! Every little bit helps, and every five hundred dollars we raise will allow us to provide our service to another young theatre artist in WNY. If you're not able to donate, please help us spread the word. Use those Indiegogo share tools! Tweet, retweet, Share, phone a friend, or text them, or heck, even mention it in conversation to other human beings, in person. I'll appreciate it, but the students that this campaign supports will appreciate it even more. What do you want to do this summer? We at RLTP want to help kids to write and stage world premiere plays, never before seen
outside of their imaginations; we want to enable them to assume roles onstage
that they’ve only ever fantasized about playing; we want to make their dreams
come true. Will you help us?Thank you for your consideration &
for all that you do!",0.0,7,"1 Campaign

<p><i>I was raised and educated in a high conflict zone in northern Israel. This has
had a tremendous effect on my artistic life and work. I have dedicated my artistic life to increasing communication for peace and understanding. I believe in equality, in reaching out to
unprivileged communities, and in raising social and political issues through dance.  I believe in finding ways to cross artistic boundaries
to reflect of our society. During the last three years, I've been creating 'I Capuleti e I Montecchi', a dance opera, as a response to the need for societies and individuals to co-exist. My exploration and
expression unites the art forms of opera and dance, which I continue to present through a
variety of public talks, master classes, and of course, performances! This US
tour, which will include both Israeli and American artists, will play an extremely important role in the creation of a global community

<h3>What is this epic theater piece with the weird title?</h3>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE: </strong>Sara Farrington &amp; Reid Farrington are a wife and husband team collaborating together for the first time. Sara  is a playwright, Reid is a director and new media artist. Working together on CasablancaBox, Sara and Reid have created a perfect fusion of ""old media"" and ""new media.""</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IT IS: </strong>CasablancaBox is a contemporary theater piece, an elegant dance of light, shadow, story and cinema. The movie serves as the spine from which a myriad of stories branch off. Employing simple wooden canvas flats and a large cast, CasablancaBox is a full film set onstage. Inspired by a roving camera style, the piece captures everyone's story, from the most famous players to the hundreds of real-life European refugees who peopled the “atmosphere” of Rick’s Café Americain.  </p>
<p><strong>HOW WE DO IT: </strong>With new media technology, gorgeous manipulation of the film itself, 17 actors and a killer script. CasablancaBox dives into things like the psychology of Peter Lorre's inescapable morphine addiction, of Bogart's violent 3rd wife Mayo Methot, the real life German actors who escaped death at the hands of the Nazis only to be typecast as a Nazi in Hollywood, of stagehands with disturbing pasts, of Bergman's love affair with Roberto Rossellini, of Paul Henreid's outrageous contractual demands and his own escape from Austria, of the team of screenwriters' struggles to write that ending. Simmering just beneath the surface of CasablancaBox is the question on everyone's mind: <i>How will this war (and movie) end? </i>The narratives are endless, funny and moving, always returning to the Casablanca. Whether you love the Casablanca, haven't seen it in years or haven't seen it ever, CasablancaBox is for you. You'll get it.</p>
<p><strong>WHY SHOULD I DONATE?: </strong>This is a huge moment for Sara and Reid and this project deserves to be fully realized. They are thrilled to be bringing this project to life, one they have worked on for many years, and with such an incredible team of performers and collaborators.

This is the largest festival for new works in NYC, and one of the largest in the world.
The play is a two-act drama. Somewhat experimental in nature, it weaves together the story of a high-school romance with themes from Shakespeare's ""As You Like It,"" and T.S. Eliot's ""The Waste Land.""

We believe in a collective spirit where all elements of the creation process are a shared endeavour. Driven by our fantasies and inspired by pop culture, we create worlds of contrast where the audience is transported to places both familiar and unknown. We are intuitive, lighthearted, and devoted to the pursuit of pleasure. </p><p>After our serendipitous meeting in Tel Aviv in 2012, Geneviève (Montreal), Erin (Calgary) and Laura (Ottawa), reunited in Montreal and formed the collective LA TRESSE in 2014. Since then, we have created two works, performed extensively, received public funding, and been supported by several creative residency programs. Our first work, “Beauté Brute” was shown at Montreal festivals: Zone Homa, Vue Sur La Relève, and OFFTA, in Toronto for the Dance Matters Series, and in Québec City at La Rotonde. Our second piece, “Volume II” was presented at Festival Quartiers Danses in 2016 and won the Audience Choice Award (“Prix Coup de Coeur du Public”). </p><p><strong>WHAT IS THE PROJECT?</strong></p><p>The piece, “A Walkabout”, will be presented by the 2017 Festival Quartiers Danses. Part of the festival’s mandate is to make contemporary dance more accessible to the people of Montreal by offering performances at public spaces throughout the city, free of charge.  Performing in outdoor public spaces will give greater visibility to our work and help us create a dialogue with new audiences. </p><p>To date, we have created work uniquely on ourselves. This project will be the first time we invite additional artists to perform with us as a larger ensemble. Dancers from Tel Aviv, New York, and Los Angeles are flying to Montreal to join us in the creation and performances of “A Walkabout”. We first worked with Shahar Sarit Sharashove, Lindsey Mattheis, and A.J. Parr during the Springboard Danse Montreal program this June where we were invited choreographers. As a result of this process we established a strong artistic connection with these dancers and a desire to continue the collaboration.</p><p>This project includes: one week of creation for Geneviève, Erin, and Laura; one additional week of intensive rehearsals for all 6 cast members; 3 outdoor public performances.</p><p><i>Thursday, September 7th, 12:30pm – Place des Festivals </i></p><p><i>Tuesday, September 12th, 5pm – Place Émilie Gamelin</i></p><p><i>Wednesday, September 13th, 5pm – Place Émilie Gamelin</i></p><p>In this new piece focused on orchestrating and encompassing a vast outdoor space, LA TRESSE Collective will continue to explore a feminine force through uninhibited physicality. Employing music and references from both pop culture and antiquity, the collective endeavours to transport the audience to places both familiar and unknown. “A Walkabout” will bring a continuation and evolution of the characters developed in LA TRESSE’s prior works “Beauté Brute” and “Volume II”.</p><p><strong>WHY ARE WE FUNDRAISING? </strong></p><p>Fundraising Goal: <strong>$4000</strong></p><p>We are raising money to cover the artist fees associated with this project. It is important to us to adequately compensate our collaborators for their artistic contributions. </p><p>In the event that we exceed our $4000 goal, the Collective will be able to pay themselves for the preparation and rehearsals leading up to this process. It will also contribute to the cost of costumes and research materials. </p><p><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP?</strong></p><p>Every dollar helps and will contribute to the success of this project. </p><p>We recognize that there are so many wonderful artists struggling to fund their own projects, so a simple share of this campaign would be more than appreciated. </p><p>Thank you for your support!</p><p>//</p><p><strong>QUI SOMMES NOUS?</strong></p><p>LA TRESSE est un collectif de Montréal, composé de Geneviève Boulet, Erin O’Loughlin, et Laura Toma. Nous croyons dans un esprit de collaboration où tout les éléments du processus créatif sont une expérience partagée. Entraînées par nos fantasmes et inspirées par la culture pop, nous créons des univers contrastants où le spectateur voyage entre ses références et l'inconnu. Nous sommes intuitives et dévouées à la poursuite du plaisir sans jamais se prendre trop au sérieux. </p><p>Suite à leur rencontre à Tel-Aviv en 2012, Geneviève Boulet (Montréal), Erin O’Loughlin (Calgary) et Laura Toma (Ottawa) se sont réunies à Montréal pour former le collectif LA TRESSE. En trois années seulement, le Collectif connait un franc succès. Elles ont créé deux oeuvres qui ont été présentées plusieurs fois pour lesquelles elles ont reçu des bourses ainsi qu'une multitudes de résidences de création. Leur première pièce Beauté Brute a été présentée à Zone Homa, Vue Sur La Relève, OFFTA (Montréal), Dance Matters (Toronto) et à La Rotonde (Quebec ). Leur deuxième trio Volume II,a remporté le prix “Prix Coup de Coeur du Public”  lors de sa première au 2016 Festival Quartiers Danses.</p><p><strong>DESCRIPTION DU PROJET</strong></p><p>Notre nouvelle pièce,  “A Walkabout”, sera présentée dans le cadre du Festival Quartiers Danses en septembre 2017. Le mandat du festival est en grande partie de rendre la danse contemporaine plus accessible aux citoyens en offrant des performances in-situ gratuites dans différents lieux de la ville. Ce sera une belle occasion pour nous de présenter notre travail à un public beaucoup plus large. </p><p>À ce jour, nous avons chorégraphié uniquement sur nous-même. Dans ce projet, nous souhaitons intégrer des nouveaux danseurs de sorte à passé d'un trio à une plus grande forme. Des artistes de Tel Aviv, New York et Los Angeles seront à Montreal pour participer au nouveau processus. Nous avons d'abord rencontré Shahar Sarit Sharashove, Lindsey Mattheis, and A.J. Parr durant le stage de Springboard Danse Montréal où nous avons été chorégraphes invités. Ce fut une rencontre riche et inspirante et nous avons très hâte de continuer notre collaboration avec elles.</p><p>Pour la réalisation de ce projet, nous allons répéter une semaine toutes les trois, suivi d’une semaine intensive à 6 et de 3 représentations.</p><p><i>jeudi le 7 septembre, 12h30, Place des Festivals </i></p><p><i>mardi le 12 septembre, 17h, Place Émilie Gamelin</i></p><p><i>mercredi le 13 septembre, 17h, Place Émilie Gamelin</i></p><p>Dans cette nouvelle chorégraphie in-situ,  nous continuerons à explorer la force de la féminité à travers des corps libérés et fougueux. Ce sera la suite de notre univers unique où la musique et la culture pop cohabitent avec des références aux archétypes de l'antiquité. Nous souhaitons faire osciller le spectateur entre terrains connus et perte de repères. “A Walkabout” sera la continuité et l’évolution des personnages développés dans nos deux premières pièces “Beauté Brute” et “Volume II”. </p><p><strong>OBJECTIF </strong></p><p>Montant Visé: <strong>$4000</strong></p><p>Nous amassons des fonds pour pouvoir assurer le cachet des artistes. Il est primordiale pour nous de pouvoir rémunérer adéquatement tout nos collaborateurs.</p><p>Si nous dépassons notre but de 4000$, nous serons en mesure de nous rémunérer pour les heures de répétitions fait en amont ainsi que de payer pour des nouveaux costumes et des matériaux servants à la recherche.</p><p><strong>COMMENT AIDER? </strong></p><p>Chaque dons est d'une grande valeur et contribue directement au succès de notre projet</p><p>Nous sommes conscientes que plusieurs artistes talentueux vivent les mêmes réalités que nous alors un simple partage de notre campagne est grandement apprécié. </p><p>Merci pour votre support! </p></div>","(Version en français plus bas) WHO ARE WE?LA TRESSE is a Montreal-based dance collective established by Geneviève Boulet, Erin O’Loughlin, and Laura Toma.

Our first work, “Beauté Brute” was shown at Montreal festivals: Zone Homa, Vue Sur La Relève, and OFFTA, in Toronto for the Dance Matters Series, and in Québec City at La Rotonde. Our second piece, “Volume II” was presented at Festival Quartiers Danses in 2016 and won the Audience Choice Award (“Prix Coup de Coeur du Public”). WHAT IS THE PROJECT?The piece, “A Walkabout”, will be presented by the 2017 Festival Quartiers Danses. Part of the festival’s mandate is to make contemporary dance more accessible to the people of Montreal by offering performances at public spaces throughout the city, free of charge.  Performing in outdoor public spaces will give greater visibility to our work and help us create a dialogue with new audiences. To date, we have created work uniquely on ourselves. This project will be the first time we invite additional artists to perform with us as a larger ensemble. Dancers from Tel Aviv, New York, and Los Angeles are flying to Montreal to join us in the creation and performances of “A Walkabout”. We first worked with Shahar Sarit Sharashove, Lindsey Mattheis, and A.J. Parr during the Springboard Danse Montreal program this June where we were invited choreographers. As a result of this process we established a strong artistic connection with these dancers and a desire to continue the collaboration.This project includes: one week of creation for Geneviève, Erin, and Laura; one additional week of intensive rehearsals for all 6 cast members; 3 outdoor public performances.Thursday, September 7th, 12:30pm – Place des Festivals Tuesday, September 12th, 5pm – Place Émilie GamelinWednesday, September 13th, 5pm – Place Émilie GamelinIn this new piece focused on orchestrating and encompassing a vast outdoor space, LA TRESSE Collective will continue to explore a feminine force through uninhibited physicality. Employing music and references from both pop culture and antiquity, the collective endeavours to transport the audience to places both familiar and unknown. “A Walkabout” will bring a continuation and evolution of the characters developed in LA TRESSE’s prior works “Beauté Brute” and “Volume II”.WHY ARE WE FUNDRAISING? Fundraising Goal: $4000We are raising money to cover the artist fees associated with this project. It is important to us to adequately compensate our collaborators for their artistic contributions. In the event that we exceed our $4000 goal, the Collective will be able to pay themselves for the preparation and rehearsals leading up to this process. It will also contribute to the cost of costumes and research materials. HOW YOU CAN HELP?Every dollar helps and will contribute to the success of this project. We recognize that there are so many wonderful artists struggling to fund their own projects, so a simple share of this campaign would be more than appreciated. Thank you for your support!//QUI SOMMES NOUS?LA TRESSE est un collectif de Montréal, composé de Geneviève Boulet, Erin O’Loughlin, et Laura Toma. Nous croyons dans un esprit de collaboration où tout les éléments du processus créatif sont une expérience partagée. Entraînées par nos fantasmes et inspirées par la culture pop, nous créons des univers contrastants où le spectateur voyage entre ses références et l'inconnu. Nous sommes intuitives et dévouées à la poursuite du plaisir sans jamais se prendre trop au sérieux. Suite à leur rencontre à Tel-Aviv en 2012, Geneviève Boulet (Montréal), Erin O’Loughlin (Calgary) et Laura Toma (Ottawa) se sont réunies à Montréal pour former le collectif LA TRESSE. En trois années seulement, le Collectif connait un franc succès. Elles ont créé deux oeuvres qui ont été présentées plusieurs fois pour lesquelles elles ont reçu des bourses ainsi qu'une multitudes de résidences de création. Leur première pièce Beauté Brute a été présentée à Zone Homa, Vue Sur La Relève, OFFTA (Montréal), Dance Matters (Toronto) et à La Rotonde (Quebec ). Leur deuxième trio Volume II,a remporté le prix “Prix Coup de Coeur du Public”  lors de sa première au 2016 Festival Quartiers Danses.DESCRIPTION DU PROJETNotre nouvelle pièce,  “A Walkabout”, sera présentée dans le cadre du Festival Quartiers Danses en septembre 2017. Le mandat du festival est en grande partie de rendre la danse contemporaine plus accessible aux citoyens en offrant des performances in-situ gratuites dans différents lieux de la ville. Ce sera une belle occasion pour nous de présenter notre travail à un public beaucoup plus large. À ce jour, nous avons chorégraphié uniquement sur nous-même. Dans ce projet, nous souhaitons intégrer des nouveaux danseurs de sorte à passé d'un trio à une plus grande forme. Des artistes de Tel Aviv, New York et Los Angeles seront à Montreal pour participer au nouveau processus. Nous avons d'abord rencontré Shahar Sarit Sharashove, Lindsey Mattheis, and A.J. Parr durant le stage de Springboard Danse Montréal où nous avons été chorégraphes invités. Ce fut une rencontre riche et inspirante et nous avons très hâte de continuer notre collaboration avec elles.Pour la réalisation de ce projet, nous allons répéter une semaine toutes les trois, suivi d’une semaine intensive à 6 et de 3 représentations.jeudi le 7 septembre, 12h30, Place des Festivals mardi le 12 septembre, 17h, Place Émilie Gamelinmercredi le 13 septembre, 17h, Place Émilie GamelinDans cette nouvelle chorégraphie in-situ,  nous continuerons à explorer la force de la féminité à travers des corps libérés et fougueux. Ce sera la suite de notre univers unique où la musique et la culture pop cohabitent avec des références aux archétypes de l'antiquité. Nous souhaitons faire osciller le spectateur entre terrains connus et perte de repères. “A Walkabout” sera la continuité et l’évolution des personnages développés dans nos deux premières pièces “Beauté Brute” et “Volume II”. OBJECTIF Montant Visé: $4000Nous amassons des fonds pour pouvoir assurer le cachet des artistes. Il est primordiale pour nous de pouvoir rémunérer adéquatement tout nos collaborateurs.Si nous dépassons notre but de 4000$, nous serons en mesure de nous rémunérer pour les heures de répétitions fait en amont ainsi que de payer pour des nouveaux costumes et des matériaux servants à la recherche.COMMENT AIDER? Chaque dons est d'une grande valeur et contribue directement au succès de notre projetNous sommes conscientes que plusieurs artistes talentueux vivent les mêmes réalités que nous alors un simple partage de notre campagne est grandement apprécié. Merci pour votre support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Although written close to 2500 years ago, LYSISTRATA is rife with political themes that are almost identical to some of the issues we face today.

<p>LYSISTRATA shows us an uplifting way around both of these problems, primarily by reminding us that we have the power to take matters into our own hands, that we each have a voice, and that when raised in unison, our collective voice is truly formidable. </p>

The goal was to create an ensemble-governed space where new works were developed, utilizing a lengthy critical process before opening. We constantly ask ourselves if the stories we select are worth telling. Rather than immediately jumping in, we like to question “why?” or “why not?”  Currently, we are in a multi-year collaborative process that is thematically exploring righteousness versus justice. CPT emphasizes transmedia approaches that look to all mediums - broadening stories that emphasize places of difference between peoples and how stories might bridge those gaps.</p>
<p>Along the way, we've performed at Dixon Place, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and off-Broadway and won the Audience Choice Award for <i>A List of Irrational Fears for Future Leaders of the World</i> at FRIGID New York 2014 and several AudioVerse Awards and the Rod Serling Memorial Award for our sci-fi anthology podcast<i> The Grayscale</i>.</p>
<p><strong>OUR MISSION:</strong> We are inventors at our core. We seek to take in stories unknown, combine them with vision and action, and bring these experiences to life through performance. Our ensemble strives to pair our own development with that of changing communities. We want to stand among and between states of matter to explore beyond boundaries.</p>

<h3><strong>WHAT IS <i>JERK</i>?</strong></h3>
<p>James claims to be a sex addict. Elizabeth isn't so sure. What they do know is that neither one of them is alright. What appears to be a play about the contemptuous relationship between a patient and his doctor, devolves into madness after a sudden change in everyone's circumstances, ending in a nightmarish frenzy of self-medicating. <i>JERK</i> is a psychological drama about the state of monogamy in burgeoning adults. A nightmare that lies somewhere between an expressionistic dream sequence, and a series of worn out memories.</p>
<p>JERK was created through the hand of a singular artist, Andrew Terrance Kaberline, and washed and rinsed through a developmental process with Critical Point Theatre that encompasses the ideas, stories, and feedback from the ensemble. <img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500392888/rntv8h41qlexfi4td3gk.jpg"" hspace=""4"" src="""" style=""width:300px;height:250px;"" vspace=""4""/> Our first reading of the production took place in Blacksburg, VA in 2014. During this time, the concept was wildly different than the play was now. Another stab was taken in NYC in early 2015, with a revamped script. Eventually, we held a series of feedback sessions as Andrew evolved the work, culminating in a second staged reading in Manhattan in October 2016. We've spent years seasoning JERK to perfection, and now the project is ready to simmer. We will be performing at The HIVE Art Space in Brooklyn in late August in a production led by CPT's Dylan James Amick. But as an ensemble company full of book publishers, electricians, hotel workers, and bartenders, we're hoping to gather community support in order to ensure all of our artists are paid and production costs are minimalized. That's why we are coming to you!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY DONATE?</h3>
<p>We produce all of our shows independently, financing only from collective donations from individuals like you. It's next to impossible for artists without a long business history and legal help to obtain large grants, so we rely on small, grassroots funding campaigns like this one in order to produce our work. CPT operating costs have been funded 70% from individual giving over our four year history.</p>
<p>This year, we're hoping to get that extra boost from individual, small donor amounts. They say it takes a village to raise a child, and we say it takes only a small portion of the East Village to forgo a single nitro cold brew and raise an independent theatre production. <strong>Amounts of $5 are being posted here in order to get to our goal</strong> - to raise the funds we need for our base production costs. Any funds raised above these goals will go to the salaries of our actors, director, stage manager, and production help.</p>
<p>We're trying to stretch the breadth of our networks, not the depth of your pockets. Any amount makes a difference in pushing bold art onstage, and if you can't lend a buck or two, lend us a share on Facebook, Twitter, or Insta. We appreciate that you're living for the 'gram, and we'll help you do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If 300 people each give $5, we will have our venue cost paid.</li>
<li>If 100 people each give $15, we can get three actors their much needed due in a city where ""credit and copy"" doesn't pay the rent.</li>
<li>If 60 people each give $25, we make our goal and there's a pizza party. Better than the one your third grade teacher threw after you aced the spelling test.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>ATTENDING THE PERFORMANCE</h3>
<p><i>JERK</i> is more than a performance. It's a night out in a box with a Brooklyn bow on it. If you can't donate but you're planning to come by, know that there will be food, drinks, music, and a killer way to call out the jerks in your life. To get an all-inclusive ticket (open bar? heck yeah), choose the Perf + Party option and know that your appetite for food, cocktails, and fun will be supporting the ensemble continuing to produce bold ideas in a laboratory space.</p>
<p><i>JERK</i> runs August 24th-September 2nd, on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at 7:30 PM, as well as 2:30 PM Saturdays.</p>

Our first reading of the production took place in Blacksburg, VA in 2014. During this time, the concept was wildly different than the play was now. Another stab was taken in NYC in early 2015, with a revamped script. Eventually, we held a series of feedback sessions as Andrew evolved the work, culminating in a second staged reading in Manhattan in October 2016. We've spent years seasoning JERK to perfection, and now the project is ready to simmer. We will be performing at The HIVE Art Space in Brooklyn in late August in a production led by CPT's Dylan James Amick. But as an ensemble company full of book publishers, electricians, hotel workers, and bartenders, we're hoping to gather community support in order to ensure all of our artists are paid and production costs are minimalized. That's why we are coming to you!
 
WHY DONATE?
We produce all of our shows independently, financing only from collective donations from individuals like you. It's next to impossible for artists without a long business history and legal help to obtain large grants, so we rely on small, grassroots funding campaigns like this one in order to produce our work. CPT operating costs have been funded 70% from individual giving over our four year history.
This year, we're hoping to get that extra boost from individual, small donor amounts. They say it takes a village to raise a child, and we say it takes only a small portion of the East Village to forgo a single nitro cold brew and raise an independent theatre production. Amounts of $5 are being posted here in order to get to our goal - to raise the funds we need for our base production costs. Any funds raised above these goals will go to the salaries of our actors, director, stage manager, and production help.
We're trying to stretch the breadth of our networks, not the depth of your pockets. Any amount makes a difference in pushing bold art onstage, and if you can't lend a buck or two, lend us a share on Facebook, Twitter, or Insta. We appreciate that you're living for the 'gram, and we'll help you do it.

If 300 people each give $5, we will have our venue cost paid.
If 100 people each give $15, we can get three actors their much needed due in a city where ""credit and copy"" doesn't pay the rent.
If 60 people each give $25, we make our goal and there's a pizza party. Better than the one your third grade teacher threw after you aced the spelling test.

 
ATTENDING THE PERFORMANCE
JERK is more than a performance. It's a night out in a box with a Brooklyn bow on it. If you can't donate but you're planning to come by, know that there will be food, drinks, music, and a killer way to call out the jerks in your life. To get an all-inclusive ticket (open bar? heck yeah), choose the Perf + Party option and know that your appetite for food, cocktails, and fun will be supporting the ensemble continuing to produce bold ideas in a laboratory space.
JERK runs August 24th-September 2nd, on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays at 7:30 PM, as well as 2:30 PM Saturdays.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Learical Jonez, CEO of Learical Jonez Entertainment Group, LLC. I am a mother, writer, poet &amp; entrepreneur.</p>
<p> I began writing The Life Monologues as an outlet for friends and family. All of the monologues are real life situations that I have experienced or someone I know has gone through. I am the voice that so many are afraid to be. I believe that once you see that someone else is going through the same thing that you are, you can begin your healing process.</p>
<p>I have an opportunity to return to my hometown of Fort Wayne, Indiana and perform The Life Monologues. This will be something that goes down in the books. Everyone is so afraid to leave the small town of Fort Wayne, but I would like to return to let them know that there is life outside.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I will need $3,000 to cover the expense of the trip for the cast, staff and myself. This will include travel, hotel stay and food.</p>
<p>If this is something that you think you would be able to help out with, you will receive recognition on the ljegroup.com website as well as a number of other places. Also if you are in the Atlanta area or surrounding cities, you will receive tickets to one of my productions.</p>
<p>If I dont reach my goal here on Indiegogo, I will still travel to Indiana by any means because I believe this production will help a number of people begin their healing process as it has here in Atlanta.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The production is very powerful. During The Life Monologues March-April run, all 3 shows were standing room only. Each and every night there were patrons that approaced me after the show with tears in their eyes stating they did not know someone else had gone through something similar.  </p>
<p>The Life Monologues give hope. The production lets you know that although you have gone through hardship, there is sunshine at the end...and you can let it go peacefully.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>No contribution is too small. If you cant make a contribution, please get word to your friends, family and colleagues. Please remember to use the Indigogo share tools.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and I look forward to seeing you at an LJEG production.</p>

</div></div>","Our Story
My name is Anthony W Johnson. I am the creator of Ballet Magique. Ballet Magique is a fusion of dance, magic, illusion, music, theatre and wushu. The performers not only dance but perform magic and illusion. We have been offered the opportunity to perform  for the Chinese New Year celebration in San Diego California. as well as other festivals abroad. 
Our goal is to raise enough capital to re-mount a spectacular performance of our show The Ring of the Rose. 
Ring of the Rose The Ring of the Rose is a passionate story of love versus obsession, beauty versus commitment and pain versus sacrifice.


In this tale of love lost, then found, everyone desires the “Rose”. 

Two couples fight with all of their might to win the love, respect, power and admiration of the Rose. As each couple vies for his desire, they eventually resort to manipulation, deception and jealous rage towards one another.  

Like so many stories we see on television shows such as “The Bachelorette”, lovelorn hopefuls, unaware of the sheer destruction caused by their own blind ambition; ultimately lose sight of the true value of the very thing that they are seeking and all of the reasons why.

Behind the masks their true heart and nature is revealed.

In the end, however, their selfish efforts prove futile as the Rose ultimately decides to honor those closest to him who have proven their respect and loyalty to him; the very thorns by his side, as it is they whom have loved and protected him all along from the ugliness which surrounds him. 

With a ring of solidarity, the Thorns teach the Rose, the couples and the audience the meaning of sacrifice, devotion and selflessness; for the rose is universally cut from it’s bush and offered each Valentine’ Day as a symbol of true love...
and for these “Thorns” their conviction forever lies within... the Ring of the Rose. 

The Ring of the Rose was first performed by Ballet Magique in Glendale CA to great success, with four Lester Horton Nominations and offers to perform the 10 minute act in various places around the world. Unfortunately as we were about to move forward Gene Wooley my former partner took ill and needed a liver transplant. He eventually, after many struggles and lots of pain, succumbed to his illness and passed away. Because this was and still is our dream, I am determined to keep his memory alive. One way I believe I can do this is to pick up where we left off, and mount the full version of Ring of the Rose for investors as well as the public who have supported us this far and use the capital from that performance to mount the tour that Gene and me always dreamed of.

Our goal is to mount the full version here in Los Angeles. We hope that you you will help us make that goal a reality!

Over the years, as a teacher, Anthony has spawned many dancers who have danced for me in Ballet Magique and gone on to fantastic careers with Cirque du Soliel, Alvin Ailey Dance Theatre on on Broadway in shows like The Lion King, Come Fly Away, Movin Out and The Color Purple, as well as tours with Janet Jackson, Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears.
Ballet Magique’s mission is to inspire dancers of all nationalities, and to create a new an exciting form of entertainment fusing not only the cultural arts but media technology and illusion.
By fusing classic art forms, including several different kinds of dance, magic, music, theatre, and visual effects, we elevate all of them to a new and glorious level that entrances all audiences even those who have seen all of our competitor’s productions. 
Ballet Magique Entertainment stands alone in the pantheon of artistic achievement and we are committed to enriching current and future generations by offering a fascinating outlook on the virtuosity of the human body, while engaging the mystique of the human psyche.

 The funds that we are raising here will help tl to help mount the show in Los Angeles in Memorandum to Gene Wooley.

The Fringe tradition was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1947 to provide a platform for indie, underground, original theater companies and artists to show their stuff. Since then, Fringe festivals have taken over like a communist plot, popping up in lots of countries and in many major cities in the U.S. Atlanta is a perfect place to provide this platform in the Southeast, complementing our fellow Fringes in Orlando, New Orleans, and Asheville. </span><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">The Atlanta Fringe Festival has been in planning and development stages for almost two years. It’s taken us a long time to put it together because we are all volunteers with more ambitions than start-up funds. Since 2010, we’ve managed to sign on six venues, throw three events to raise friends and funds, and collect submissions from all over the country and even abroad! It's given us a really incredible, diverse lineup for our very first Fringe, representing 11 states and two countries! This festival will allow Atlanta to play host to the most exciting performance artists in the world for years to come. </span><br/><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">We've also created a festival you can enjoy even if you're not in Atlanta. The AFF is currently the only Fringe with a radio element. We are developing a web archive of radio plays and sound art to be hosted on our website, opening us up to participation from artists and audiences who can't actually travel to the city. Other Fringes are looking to see how we set this up so they can maybe try it too! With any luck, we'll make a valuable and lasting contribution to the entire Fringe circuit! </span></span>

This campaign is not only geared toward the success of this first year, but our second year as well: We have the future on the brain. </span><span style=""font-size: 15px; background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;"">And not just our future; the future of Fringe artists, as well.

</div></div>","Our Story
Hello Indie GoGo! 
Twinhead Theatre is producing Atlanta’s first Fringe Festival and we’re looking to you for help to make it happen! The Fringe tradition was born in Edinburgh, Scotland in 1947 to provide a platform for indie, underground, original theater companies and artists to show their stuff. Since then, Fringe festivals have taken over like a communist plot, popping up in lots of countries and in many major cities in the U.S. Atlanta is a perfect place to provide this platform in the Southeast, complementing our fellow Fringes in Orlando, New Orleans, and Asheville. The Atlanta Fringe Festival has been in planning and development stages for almost two years. It’s taken us a long time to put it together because we are all volunteers with more ambitions than start-up funds. Since 2010, we’ve managed to sign on six venues, throw three events to raise friends and funds, and collect submissions from all over the country and even abroad! It's given us a really incredible, diverse lineup for our very first Fringe, representing 11 states and two countries! This festival will allow Atlanta to play host to the most exciting performance artists in the world for years to come. We've also created a festival you can enjoy even if you're not in Atlanta. The AFF is currently the only Fringe with a radio element. We are developing a web archive of radio plays and sound art to be hosted on our website, opening us up to participation from artists and audiences who can't actually travel to the city. Other Fringes are looking to see how we set this up so they can maybe try it too! With any luck, we'll make a valuable and lasting contribution to the entire Fringe circuit! 



The Impact
We have 29 productions to mount, 20 theater technicians to hire, two parties to throw, an Internet radio station to create and host, not to mention a 2013 festival to start planning.  If we don't raise this money, we won't be able to do any of that; the productions won't get what they need to be amazing, the festival's impact won't be felt as deeply, the less chance we have of lasting. This campaign is not only geared toward the success of this first year, but our second year as well: We have the future on the brain. And not just our future; the future of Fringe artists, as well. In Fringe festivals, the artists get to keep a majority of their ticket sales, putting money in artists’ pockets and a smile on their faces. Not to mention a ton of new Facebook friends and professional contacts.
What We Need & What You Get
Operation PollinationWe need to raise $10,000 to make this festival a reality! $10,000 is not an arbitrary number; that’s the amount it takes to be a Presenting Sponsor of the Atlanta Fringe Festival. We want the community to be a presenting sponsor. By turning to our community for sponsorship, our friends, our fellows, our colleagues and kin, we can plant strong roots for this Fringe to grow and last in Atlanta until the Fringe becomes a yearly tradition. Our entire cash budget for the Atlanta Fringe is $15,000. This includes production costs for our 25 Fringe shows (including pay for fringe technicians and house managers), insurance for the festival, security for our events, merchandise procurement, any accrued miscellaneous festival costs, and best of all, a nest egg for next year. We'll be raising additional funds through submission fees and ad sales, but we have limited potential for corporate sponsorship and grants because we’re in our first year.

<div> </div>
<div>My name is Natasha Greenblatt and my play, <em>The Peace Maker</em>, has been chosen for the Next Stage Festival in January of 2013. <em>The Peace Maker</em> is a full length political drama, filled with music and humour that immerses the audience in the world of Israel and Palestine through the eyes of one young idealist who attempts to ""make peace"" in the Middle East. It asks us to consider the difference between peace and justice and the seductive yet dangerous concept of dialogue. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So yes, <em>The Peace Maker</em> is my Israel/Palestine play. It was written after I spent three months in the West Bank and throughout Israel; traveling, teaching learning, laughing, playing, crying and falling in love with the people, the politics and the heightened emotions that ran through the everyday life I experienced.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But it is more than that. It is also a serious attempt to create the type of political theatre that I want to see. The kind that entertains, provokes, laughs at itself and leaves it's audiences with more questions than answers, more passion than despair.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h3>THE PLAY</h3>
<div><em> </em></div>
<div>
<em>The Peace Maker</em> is the story of a young Canadian woman named Sophie whose desire to ‘make a difference’ ends up creating more conflict. <em>The Peace Maker</em> weaves together two story lines: Sophie’s experiences on Birthright, an Israeli Government sponsored trip to Israel for Jewish people under 27 in the Diaspora, and her subsequent fall from grace as a volunteer music teacher in the West Bank when she brings a group of Palestinian students to play for Holocaust survivors in Jerusalem.</div>
<div> <br/>Music plays an integral part of both the style and story of this piece. Eight musicians will play live music throughout the piece, acting as the ensemble or chorus. In the Birthright scenes they play the Israeli Defense Force soldiers that accompany the trip and in the story line set in Palestine they transform into the Horns of Freedom, the youth band that Sophie teaches.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h3>THE FESTIVAL</h3>
<p> </p>
<div>
<em>The Peace Maker</em> was one of ten new Canadian plays selected to appear in the Next Stage Festival. Next Stage is curated by the fine people that run the Toronto Fringe: <a href=""http://fringetoronto.com/next-stage-festival/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://fringetoronto.com/next-stage-festival/</a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It is an exciting festival, filled with a awesome array of shows and I am honoured to be a part of it this year. But this show isn't a small task. It has musicians, a large cast and a multi-faceted story that tackles one of the biggest political dilemmas of our time. So... </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h3>THE TEAM</h3>
<div> </div>
<div>I have assembled a formidable team to help me with this mission:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jennifer Brewin is a veteran theatre director and the Artistic Director of Theatre Columbus. Last year she won the Dora award for Independent Director for her production of The Story. Glenn Davidson is a celebrated lighting and set designer, who has designed for theatre, ballet, chamber music and rock shows and is the recipient of the Pauline McGibbon Award. Musical Director Samuel Sholdice is a quickly emerging force in Toronto, designing and composing for Native Earth, the Blyth Festival and SummerWorks Festival. And costume and prop designer, Lindsay Code just came back from the wilds of Cow Head, Newfoundland, where she's served four years as Head of Wardrobe/Resident Designer for the Gros Morne Theatre Festival.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The production features the incredible talents of: Rebecca Auerbach, Jeff Irving, Sam Khalilieh, Michael Rubenfeld, Harveen Sandhu, Razi Shawahdeh and Maryem Tollar.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And me? I am an actress, writer, and now producer! That's how it often works in our community, you have to do it all if you want it done. But it takes a village to raise a child (or so I've been told) and this is where you can help.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>THE IMPACT</h3>
</div>
<div>We have applied for grants to pay the artists and are hosting a huge fundraiser on Toronto Island: (<a href=""http://mad.ly/839023"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mad.ly/839023</a>) but we need help raising initial start up funds to build the set, buy the costumes, rent rehearsal space and make our posters. Anything you can give will help us make this production the best it can be.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are Birdsnest Theatre, we are passionate about creating exciting theatre for children under 5 and their adults. </p>
<p>Our work is very design led and always contains live music. We believe that children should have accessibility and opportunities to experience high quality theatre created especially for them.  We create a striking and simple aesthetic in intimate spaces.  Where children and their accompanying adult can get lost in the world of their imagination together, where props and set are thoughtfully designed, beautifully made and integral to the their experience. We want to give the audience the sense that their imagination is bringing the space to life to reveal secrets and surprises.  We believe A child’s experience of theatre should be welcoming, inclusive, tangible and interactive.  </p>
<p>The founders of Birdsnest Theatre are Beth and Emily. Between us we have experience in theatre, schools, the music industry, visual art and performance. Now with young families of our own, we are inspired to make our own theatrical experiences for the very young. We are based in the UK and will also tour other European countries in the coming year.</p>
<p>Birdsnest like happy faces; Something out of nothing; magical moments; beautiful things; simplicity; surprising people; playing; playing with words; sounds; rhythms; touching things; sharing; intriguing spaces; journeys; stories.</p>
<p class=""western"">Birdsnest would like lots of people to join in. As many as possible. We believe in exploring the world through the magic of theatre.</p>
<p class=""western"">Birdsnest know that the best way to create great theatre is  to learn from children and so we always involve children's groups in our devising processes through workshops and residencies. We get children involved before their theatre visit. We invite children to stay and play after our shows.</p>
<p>Blown Away, a show for 3-5 year olds is Birdsnest's first project, developed with the generous support of The Arts Council England and Trestle Arts Base in 2011. The strength of the work created earned the invaluable support from established theatre's and theatre companies who are themselves committed to creating excellent theatre for children. Through artistic and business mentoring as well as support in kind we have been generously supported by The Polka Theatre for Children, Oily Cart and The Royal and Derngate Theatre.</p>
<p>We are now at a stage where we have fee and accommodation costs to meet in order to ensure this exciting show is seen in theatres, community spaces and children's centres across the country.</p>
<p>We urgently need money to cover the costs of our rehearsal period and upcoming tour. Our tour will take us to the Take Off festival in Durham, Lincoln Drill Hall, rural venues in Shropshire through Arts Alive, Polka Theatre, The Albany Deptford as well as many more. The Take Off Festival of Theatre for Children and Young People is England's leading sector development event for those working in the field of theatre for young audiences.  We know that giving Blown Away this platform will ensure interest in the show, bringing with it further touring opportunities.  Tours beyond this will then begin to fund themselves. This tour will incorporate Children's Centres and community centers, giving families who may not usually have access to the arts an opportunity to experience excellent theatre for children. </p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We have brought together a dedicated team of talented artists to create this wonderful show and allocated three weeks of rehearsal time in which to do it.  The rehearsal space has been generously donated to us at no cost by Polka Theatre and Royal and Derngate Theatres but we still need to cover the cost of fees, transport and accommodation of the artists, that is the actors, musical director, director, designer, writer and stage manager. </p>
<p>We have a range of exciting perks with which to incite you to donate! From hand printed Birdsnest tote bags created lovingly by a granny in Skipton to a chance to have your very own Blown Away party!

<p>We don't have any photos available yet of the products you can buy as they are being made now, but if you go to the image section of this campaign you will see some drawings of the designs.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we do not manage to reach our entire goal we will cut fees, namely our own.  we are committed to this project and believe so completely in it's importance that we are willing to sacrifice our own fees. </p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Ensuring our audiences receive the very highest quality of theatre means time spent in rehearsals, this costs money in fees transport and accommodation.  We believe strongly in paying our artistic team properly with fees which reflect the value of the work they do.  All the artistic team will be paid rates approved and recommended by equity.  </p>

<h2><strong>""In Case of Counterpoint""</strong></h2>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<h3><strong><em>Our Story:</em><br/></strong></h3>
<p>During their years as principal dancers with Oregon Ballet Theatre, Artur and Gavin were frequently paired together.  Their movement styles, musicality, and dramatic instincts outweighed their physical differences (he's a whole foot taller than she is), and they developed an artistic partnership that deeply resonated with audiences.  Although they performed together for seven seasons with OBT, their opportunities to dance together were cut short when Gavin retired from OBT in 2010.  Interestingly enough, however, Artur's own retirement from the company in spring 2012 opened the door for partnership again.</p>
<p><br/>They decided to follow their instincts (and listen to a gnawing sense that something was missing from a life without performance) and create opportunities of their own to work on choreography, hone new techniques, and perform for audiences.  Now that Artur and Gavin are both full-time ballet teachers, their focus and approach to their own dancing has shifted slightly, each of them looking at technique, partnering, dependency, and interdependency almost as new people- certainly as new artists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In August of 2012, Gillmer Duran, resident choreographer and artistic director of Alaska Dance Theater, came to Portland to create a new pas de deux for Gavin and Artur.  With music by Steve Reich and Acid Lounge, ""In Case of Counterpoint"" is a dance in three sections, each exploring different shades of human relationships.  Gillmer describes his creation this way:</p>
<p><em>""Counterpoint is a relationship between musical themes that are harmonically interdependent, but independent in rhythm and contour.  I decided to analyze this concept by visually integrating patterns with different kinds of alignments, symmetries and speeds within the context of human interaction"".</em></p>
<p><br/>The experience of working with Gillmer was amazing-- in four days, he layered movement on top of, within, and around complementary shapes as well as contrasting ones, and created an 8-minute duet that alternately soars and whispers.  Long lines and fluidity unexpectedly end in crumples and re-emerge in conversations between the two dancers.  By the end, the viewers will be left wondering what it really means to be ""independent""...</p>
</div>
<div>

</div></div>","""In Case of Counterpoint""
 
Our Story:
During their years as principal dancers with Oregon Ballet Theatre, Artur and Gavin were frequently paired together.  Their movement styles, musicality, and dramatic instincts outweighed their physical differences (he's a whole foot taller than she is), and they developed an artistic partnership that deeply resonated with audiences.  Although they performed together for seven seasons with OBT, their opportunities to dance together were cut short when Gavin retired from OBT in 2010.  Interestingly enough, however, Artur's own retirement from the company in spring 2012 opened the door for partnership again.
They decided to follow their instincts (and listen to a gnawing sense that something was missing from a life without performance) and create opportunities of their own to work on choreography, hone new techniques, and perform for audiences.  Now that Artur and Gavin are both full-time ballet teachers, their focus and approach to their own dancing has shifted slightly, each of them looking at technique, partnering, dependency, and interdependency almost as new people- certainly as new artists.
 
In August of 2012, Gillmer Duran, resident choreographer and artistic director of Alaska Dance Theater, came to Portland to create a new pas de deux for Gavin and Artur.  With music by Steve Reich and Acid Lounge, ""In Case of Counterpoint"" is a dance in three sections, each exploring different shades of human relationships.  Gillmer describes his creation this way:
""Counterpoint is a relationship between musical themes that are harmonically interdependent, but independent in rhythm and contour.  I decided to analyze this concept by visually integrating patterns with different kinds of alignments, symmetries and speeds within the context of human interaction"".
The experience of working with Gillmer was amazing-- in four days, he layered movement on top of, within, and around complementary shapes as well as contrasting ones, and created an 8-minute duet that alternately soars and whispers.  Long lines and fluidity unexpectedly end in crumples and re-emerge in conversations between the two dancers.  By the end, the viewers will be left wondering what it really means to be ""independent""...


What We Need & What You Get:
Gavin and Artur will perform ""In Case of Counterpoint"" as part of an evening of dance by Northwest choreographers at the BodyVox theater on November 16 and 17, 2012.  They must cover all the costs associated with the creation of the pas de deux and its performance themselves, and are looking to YOU-- their fans from the past, friends old and new, dance and art lovers who want to support the creation of new ballets on seasoned professionals, and who are taking a leap into not just their own futures, but that of dance in our region.  You will also be supporting the work of choreographer Gillmer Duran by making it possible for his creation to be seen by a wider audience.

<div>aWe Creative Group is thrilled to announce the premiere of Amy E. Witting's play FALLING at The New York International Fringe Festival. Not only are we truly excited to have this special piece produced, but also hope that you will be able to come see it. </div>

<p>aWe Creative Group was founded in 2005 by Amy E. Witting and her constant collaborators, Kerry Fitzgibbons and Billy Weimer.

Together they produced and performed the widely acclaimed show, GI Joe Jared, which was performed both in New York City and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2011. All four artists are committed to make exciting original theater that will not only move their audience but will also, hopefully, make people think in a different way. aWe is also responsible for the wildly succesful 24Hour PlayFun, which encourages like minded writers, directors, and actors to get on their feet and create!<strong><br/></strong></p>

<h3>The Breakdown:</h3>
<p>We are Therese Barbato and Mary Wiseman, both second year students at the Juilliard School and huge fans of the play God's Ear by Jenny Schwartz. The impetus for this project was our mutual love of the play and our desire to share it with a broader community.</p>
<p>God's Ear is the story of a young family trying deperately to recover after the loss of their eight year-old son. Ms. Schwartz uses heightened and stylized text to illuminate how paltry language is in the face of unspeakable grief.</p>
<p>Nina Steiger, director of the Writer's Center at Soho Theatre, London said of God's Ear:</p>
<p>""The play presents a mosaic; each of it's tiles offer grace notes of misunderstanding, odd applications of every day idioms, overturned cliches, and phantom lines from one character in the mouth of another. What emerges from the fragments is a compelling portrait of grief and recalibration. It's a perfect snapshot of a family in transition and it articulates aspects of the human heart and the modern condition.</p>
<p>God's Ear is directed by Lee Sunday Evans and stars: Noah Averbach-Katz, Therese Barbato, Alex Breaux, Brandon Hall, Vella Lovell, Mallory Portnoy, and Mary Wiseman</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">What We Need:</p>
<p>We are investing in proper rigging equipment and expertise.  We are purchasing 5 double pic harnesses (hmmm....sounds very techinical....feeling more and more like a real life stunt woman....these are harnesses with 'pick up' on the sides that we then attach to another strap so we can move side to side then we clip into rope or bungee depending on the piece....oy, are you following me?).  We need lots and lots of rope.....enough for 6 lines:  3 for the harness peeps and 3 for bungee peeps.  We are using a local rigger for basic setup and then bringing in a a rigger from LA.....a Cirque du Soleil rigger no less to help us with rehearsals and for the show.  We will be paying 3 riggers or rigger type people to work the show.  I am also bringing in a dancer from LA to perform with Vault.  So.....I have 2 out of town guests to provide flight for and fees (they are staying with friends, whew!).  We already have the rigging for the wall piece (but need more rope otherwise it's hard to stay up there....you know....without the rope).  I have to purchase thousands of marbles for 'Continuum' and a few more costumes.  'Torn' needs all new costuming (we have costumes for outside performance but they don't work in a black box theater).  <br/></p>

is Amy Ell’s newest dance endeavor.  With her masterful
cohorts, she explores multifaceted movement encompassing the entire performance
space.  The results challenge convention and gravity alike, capturing a
delicate sense of timelessness and freedom.  Timelessness that allows us
to stop and be aware.  Freedom to expand within the natural world around
us.

Amy Ell
is the mother of Area Dance, dance in any particular extent of space or on any surface. She is the Artistic Director of Vault, and the owner/director of GYROTONIC® Houston (soon to become VAULT), a facility providing instruction in aerial fabric, trapeze, harness/wall dancing, Pilates, and GYROTONIC®.





Excerpts from ConTornTion were performed at Frenetic Theater (Houston, Texas), SpaceTaker’s
Gala at Spring Street Studios (Houston, Texas), and on the outside wall of the MJC in La Baule, France earlier this year.  The wall excerpt will be performed, as a teaser, at Miller Outdoor Theater on September 23 and 24, 2011.  ConTornTion can be seen in its entirety at DiverseWorks on September 29, 30, and October 1,
2011.

Valor-Visions Theater company began in January 2012. We are a new company but we have very big dreams. It was founded by me, Tracey Pope, after my decision to resign from my job and step out on faith in order to pursue my dreams. I have always dream of walking in my mom's footsteps and becoming a great playwright and director. Right now, our office is run from my home, but I dedicate more hours to working for my own company at home than I did when I worked full-time outside of my home. I am passionate about my company and our current project, Mama's Child. It is a comical, but serious gospel musical about family life, drug addiction, loss and forgiveness. We plan to have a top-notch band, moving music, and a powerful message that will wow our audience.
 


The Impact
The impact that Mama's Child will have on the community comes in the form of 2 deep moral messages: As long as you still have life, you still have hope; and Forgiveness is the purest kind of love you can exercise.  The vocals and the music is what will help to get this message across in the most effective way. Proceeds from this play will go to a pre-selected charity - tentatively The Boys & Girls Club of NC.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<h3><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Inkling Productions has recently become the first UK company to be granted the rights to THE EXONERATED since its debut in 2006. We plan to mount a 4-week production of the piece in March 2011 that is loyal and honest to the text itself, but delivered with a significantly different approach as compared to the last time it was seen by a British audience. </span></h3>
<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Inkling Productions has thus far successfully produced two pieces of new writing to critical acclaim, while under the previous guise of “Inkling Media”. Following the success of these works, and following the exciting opportunity that has just been offered to the company based on this success (to mount our production on a high-impact central London stage), we are looking to expand our approach to include both new writing and previously performed texts across all genres. </span>
</h3>
<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Jaclyn McLoughlin (our director) has most recently directed BIG SHOE at the King’s Head Theatre, and THE COMMON GOOD at the Arcola Theatre. Jackie also Assistant Directed WET WEATHER COVER earlier in the year, and followed the production on its West End transfer to the Arts Theatre. </span>
</h3>
<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;""></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal;"">Kate Monro (our producer) is a former civil service project manager. Over the past year, Kate has executive produced not only Inkling Productions, but also Paper Balloon Theatre Company, which focuses on devised children’s productions. Kate’s skills in producing extend across the fields of theatre, as her success stems from an ability to establish long-term relationships and eager support of the work that is being done under her leadership. She has produced a number of pieces for Scrawny Cat Theatre Company as well, including THIS COULD BE THE LAST TIME, an original site-specific piece based on the history of St. Andrew’s Holborn during the blitz; and UNACKNOWLEDGED ACTS OF DESIRE, which was commissioned by the V&amp;A Museum and inspired by works of art held within it during their ‘Making a Scene’ event in 2009.</span>

</div></div>","Our Story
Inkling Productions has recently become the first UK company to be granted the rights to THE EXONERATED since its debut in 2006. We plan to mount a 4-week production of the piece in March 2011 that is loyal and honest to the text itself, but delivered with a significantly different approach as compared to the last time it was seen by a British audience. 

Inkling Productions has thus far successfully produced two pieces of new writing to critical acclaim, while under the previous guise of “Inkling Media”. Following the success of these works, and following the exciting opportunity that has just been offered to the company based on this success (to mount our production on a high-impact central London stage), we are looking to expand our approach to include both new writing and previously performed texts across all genres. 


Jaclyn McLoughlin (our director) has most recently directed BIG SHOE at the King’s Head Theatre, and THE COMMON GOOD at the Arcola Theatre. Jackie also Assistant Directed WET WEATHER COVER earlier in the year, and followed the production on its West End transfer to the Arts Theatre. 


Kate Monro (our producer) is a former civil service project manager. Over the past year, Kate has executive produced not only Inkling Productions, but also Paper Balloon Theatre Company, which focuses on devised children’s productions. Kate’s skills in producing extend across the fields of theatre, as her success stems from an ability to establish long-term relationships and eager support of the work that is being done under her leadership. She has produced a number of pieces for Scrawny Cat Theatre Company as well, including THIS COULD BE THE LAST TIME, an original site-specific piece based on the history of St. Andrew’s Holborn during the blitz; and UNACKNOWLEDGED ACTS OF DESIRE, which was commissioned by the V&A Museum and inspired by works of art held within it during their ‘Making a Scene’ event in 2009.



The Impact
We aim to produce at least one production every year which ties in directly with a charity of our choice. This past year, a portion of our proceeds from THE COMMON GOOD benefited the Chernobyl Children’s Lifeline, with whom we partnered leading up to the production. And this upcoming year, a portion of our proceeds from THE EXONERATED will benefit Amnesty International, with whom we are also partnering.

Inkling Media is completely committed to not only producing a piece of strong artistic merit, but also to using this opportunity to draw attention to the human rights issues raised in the play. We are collaborating with Amnesty International to develop a partnership that will raise the profile of Amnesty's work in this area. We intend to hold a benefit performance to raise proceeds for Amnesty's campaign for abolishing the death penalty, as well as a series of post-show functions (guest speakers, expert forums etc) to draw attention to this work. 


Inkling Media is also in discussion with a range of human rights defenders from the legal world and Reprieve and is seeking their input for these events.


Although THE EXONERATED focuses on the death penalty in the US, we strongly believe that the issues transcend its immediate location. We need look only at the case of Linda Carty, a 51-year-old British citizen currently awaiting execution in Texas, and still pleading her innocence, to see that capital punishment on American soil can still reach British land. And we need only to look at the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, a 43-year-old woman who just barely escaped execution by stoning in Iran earlier this year to see that capital punishment in its many forms occurs in countries and cultures throughout the world. 


THE EXONERATED is not only an outstanding piece of writing, it is also an important piece of theatre that shines a light on a very real, important and urgent human rights issue that we are dedicated to maximising during the course of the production.


Amnesty International is being provided with an allotment of tickets for people in need with whom they have been working as well, and we will also be offering a discounted ticket option for members of select communities who would otherwise have difficulty affording West End theatre prices - i.e., school groups, asylum seekers, unemployed. Our intent is for our production and its educational value to be accessible to everyone, and to once again invite people back into a welcoming theatre.



While learning where to find further information in these areas, our audience members will also be reminded of the strength of the human spirit that they have just witnessed within every character of THE EXONERATED. Every one of our characters are real people, still alive today. And every one of them are living icons of the strength of the human spirit to overcome the most grave of injustices in life.

<h2><b>“Entre deux eaux”</b></h2>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Three
good friends, experienced circus artist, for not saying old, share some of
their touring experiences, their funny stories, their doubts, their dreams,
their regrets. Briefly, three friends tell their life. What is it about to be a
circus artist? What’s it to have reached the 30’s, that your body wants to calm
down, but your spirit and creativity are more active than ever? The world of
“entre deux eaux” is exactly that moment where the acrobat can succeed or fail;
where the body asks him, for how long can you do this? When he asks himself if
he wants to stay nomad or become sedentary.</p>
<p>In
2013, the Canadian council for the arts believed in this theme and awarded us a
grant to do a research and creation process. Investigate how to mix our stories

“Entre deux eaux”
Three
good friends, experienced circus artist, for not saying old, share some of
their touring experiences, their funny stories, their doubts, their dreams,
their regrets. Briefly, three friends tell their life. What is it about to be a
circus artist? What’s it to have reached the 30’s, that your body wants to calm
down, but your spirit and creativity are more active than ever? The world of
“entre deux eaux” is exactly that moment where the acrobat can succeed or fail;
where the body asks him, for how long can you do this? When he asks himself if
he wants to stay nomad or become sedentary.
In
2013, the Canadian council for the arts believed in this theme and awarded us a
grant to do a research and creation process. Investigate how to mix our stories
with circus disciplines. How to bring theater inside a circus act. Now we need
the help of all of you to bring this nice research into a real show. Our goal,
to present a first run of our creation “Entre deux eaux” the 21th of May at the renowned Montreal theater “Monument National”.

<p>Latin Addiction is a dance studio in Christchurch, New Zealand teaching Salsa, Bachata, Samba, Cha Cha, kids hip hop and Zumba.

<p>Most of us are amateurs and have normal day jobs on top of the training commitments. This means that we are turning to our friends and family to help support our journey to not only perform at these elite competitions, but to kick butt at them.<br/></p>

History of Our Past Partnership



2 Years Ago You Sent This Teaching Artist Back to Haiti

After the 2010 earthquake ravaged through Haiti, I joined a team of artists and socially conscious people of color to return to Haiti and help the people of Leogane, Haiti process, grieve, celebrate life, and support the re-opening of the adobe clinic that was built just the year before by the collective.  The collective’s manifesto, or written statement declaring their intentions publicly, suggested they were cultivating “genuine people-to-people solidarity among people of African heritage while reinforcing the strength and autonomy of Haitian residents.

Now, as adults we journey through their marriages and relationships and witness the emotional handicaps abandonment has brought into their lives. Dexter, 29, is dealing with trust issues between himself and his wife after two miscarriages and they continue to struggle with infertility. Devin, 26, is stuck with childish ways. He is more consumed with video games, partying and his friends than his wife, Tatiana, and their two daughters, Ashiya, 10, and Kennedy, 4. Erin, 19, is a college sophomore with big dreams of being an attorney. She finds out that she and Adam are pregnant and is faced with a very difficult decision that could alter her life forever. Gramz, their grandmother, is trying to keep their family together and uses her faith and words of wisdom to steer them in the best direction she knows.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Bleu Royalty Needs &amp; What Y O U Get</h3><p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Bleu Royalty presents #BrokenPiecesTSP Expenses:</b><br/></p>

<p><b>Our Company</b></p>
<p>Butterfly with a Bomb Productions was formed in
2013, when we collaboratively produced an hour long play;  a
project which culminated in two well-attended and well-received
performances at Glasgow's The Old Hairdressers. Our first piece was
made on a budget of £100, which covered props, costumes and the
occasional rehearsal space. Venue hire and tech were made possible
through sponsorship and favours from friends. As much as possible, we
used our own living spaces to rehearse in order to cut down costs. We
are now about to begin rehearsals on our second project, but in order
that this can be a step up from our previous work, we are in need of
some additional funding.

<p><i>Giving up the Ghost </i>is a darkly comic
exploration of life and death, seen through the eyes of a psychic
medium, an evangelical exorcist, a rock-star zombie and the teenage
girl caught between them. 
</p>
<p><i>Carrie Clairvoyant is an acclaimed psychic
medium, who has never succeeded in raising a genuine spirit. This
changes when Dean appears onstage during one of her public shows,
claiming to have been reincarnated. When Carrie flees the stage to
escape him, Dean takes up residence in her house, leaving Carrie with
no option but to call on her estranged exorcist sister, Mary. With
all eyes on the crisis at hand, Mary and Carrie are initially
oblivious to the attraction Dean holds for Mary's conflicted
daughter, Jess. Will Jess leave her beliefs behind for a man who may
well be the devil incarnate? Is there any point in Dean carrying on
living when he's not truly alive? And will Mary and Carrie ever face
up to the events that drove them apart twenty years earlier?</i><b> </b>

<h3>Who's Who</h3>
<h4>Director</h4>
<div>
<b>Maria Aladren </b>is a professional director
originally from Zaragoza, Spain.  Early on, she developed a
love for overlapping different forms of human expression in a variety of
cultures and time periods.  In the
pursuit of such bridges, Maria started a theatre company in Austin, Texas,
directing a number of productions ranging from classical works to foreign
material to original pieces that put together science and theatre.  In recent years, Maria has taken a hiatus to bring twin baby girls into
the world and to develop the conservatory theatre program at the School of
Performing Arts-MCVTS, teaching and directing young actors.  At the School of Performing Arts Main Stage
program which creates collaborations between professionals and students she has directed pieces such as <i>The
Education Project, The Tempest, </i><i>Comedy of Errors</i>,<i>Neighborhood 3:
Requisition of Doom</i>, <i>Midsummer Night's Dream, Anton in Show
Business, A Bright Room Called Day, Top Girls </i>and<i>The Living. </i>Maria trained as a director at the
University of Texas-Austin, where she received her MFA, and as a dramaturg at the Theatre School at Washington University
in St.  Louis.  She has also trained
with Barta Heiner and Jane Lapotaire of the Royal Shakespeare Company and with
Gabriel Chame from Clu de Clown in Madrid.</div>
<h4>Stage Manager</h4>
<p><b>Rowen Clarke</b> is a junior in MCVTS Theatre, double-majoring in Stage Management and Acting. She has had a passion for Theatre since she was young, but only recently found her niche in Design and Production. For MCVTS, Rowen has staged managed <i>The Education Project</i>, the 2014 Senior Showcase, the 2014 Freshman Showcase, and was the assistant stage manager for the 2013 Senior Showcase. She was also the assistant stage manager for Cake/ATEH's production of Moliere's <i>Learned Ladies</i> and is the assistant stage manager for Cake's production of <i>This Lingering Life</i> in New York City. She appeared as a Spirit in MCVTS’s production of Shakespeare’s <i>The Tempest</i>, and as Willie in Tennessee Williams' <i>This Property is Condemned</i>. Rowen hopes to continue pursuing Stage Management and Acting through college and eventually into her adult life.<br/></p>
<h4>Cast: </h4>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Rachel Caplan</b><b> </b>is a graduate of the Stella Adler Studio as well as a proud Alum of the School of Performing Arts at MCVTS.  She has been privileged to work with a variety of wonderful theatre companies, but is excited to be working with Pegasus51, which reunites her with her very first director, Maria Aladren, and the students of MCVTS. Past roles include Mo in <i>Cadence: Home</i> at the Straz Center with TE'A, Suma in Knight and Brinegar's <i>Doomsurfing</i>, Phile in Michael Milligan's original work <i>Phaeton</i>, the title role in <i>Lily Dale</i>, Jacqueline in <i>Boeing-Boeing</i>, and Lavatch in <i>All's Well that Ends Well</i>. Rachel is also honored to be an Associate Company Member of Theatre East.</p>
<p><b>Colin Friend</b> studied at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting in NYC. Stand-out roles include Macduff in The Scottish Play, Gratiano in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> and The Player in <i>Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern are Dead</i>. More recently Colin has collaborated with Ensemble Atria on their NYC premiere show <i>Envoy</i> and again this summer in <i>Frame 313</i>. Both were part of the Midtown International Theatre Festival. <i>Envoy </i>was nominated for Best Ensemble in the Midtown International Theatre Awards.</p>
<h3>The Play</h3>
<p><i>None of the Above</i> centers on Jamie, an Upper East Side high school senior who has a packed social calendar and an unopened SAT book on her desk.  Enter Clark, the grad student hired by her parents to boost her scores.  The two combine about as well as oil and water: she's a privileged, acid-tongued brat, and he's a by-the-book, word-obsessed freak.  As the test draws nearer and the pair spend more time together, each surprises the other, and they both learn how to exercise intelligence that has nothing to do with a standardized test.  Jenny Lyn Bader's two-hander takes on topics of social class, addiction, and the pressure to succeed with sharp insight and lots of laughs.</p>
<h3>Why it Matters</h3>
<p>This production is special for a number of reasons.<br/><br/>For <b>Pegasus51</b>, this marks a reintroduction into the New York theatre community after a hiatus.  The company is glad to be doing to with a project that embodies its values so completely and involves young artists. <br/><br/>For the <b>actors</b> involved, this is the first foray into self-producing.  It is important and empowering to produce, exercise creative control, and gain a greater understanding of creating independent theatre.  This is a chance for us to show what we can do with a fantastic script and excellent collaborators.<br/><br/>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, for the <b>students</b>, this is an opportunity to dip their toes for the first time in the world of professional theatre.  They will be sitting in on rehearsals and taking on behind-the-scenes positions, which will give them the opportunity to see the process from page to stage.  They will be observing firsthand the real-life application of the concepts they've been learning in school.  This play is largely about the experience of a high school student, and we want to create our production with high school students in mind.  We could think of no better way than to involve them directly and are so excited to have them incorporated into our creative team.  Though we will undoubtedly benefit tremendously from working with these stellar young artists, we hope this experience will also assist them in applying to top theatre programs around the country. <br/></p>

develop classical theatre pieces, throw them in the air, scramble them up,
shorten them and give them context that allows the actors and audience
to see and experience them in a way that they never have
before.  We create ensemble-driven, irreverent, inventive classical
theatre that incorporates various types of performance, including but not
limited to: dance, music, acrobatics, circus and clowning. </p>
<p> Our goal is to stay true to the text, while making
it relatable to a younger, modern audience. We tailor every
play to fit the space in which it is performed. Thus, the site becomes the set.
We aim to create a relationship between both the actor and the audience, who we
hope will walk away with a profound understanding of each play and an exciting
new perspective of what classical theatre means today. </p>

The Impact


CAMP GOALS:



To mount
a story by a French author as a one-week play, teaching kids teamwork,
confidence, and creativity.


To
empower kids to find their voices through theater and persuasive skills through
scene work.


To
cultivate lasting friendships and an appreciation of the arts.


To
provide a summer camp that does not turn campers away because of tuition (by
providing full and partial scholarships and by fundraising on Indiegogo).


To
provide a training ground for young adult theatre artists to serve in the
capacity of Camp Intern so they may receive training on leading workshops and
running a camp for students.


WHY IT MATTERS:
In our experience in Atlanta, government funding cuts have made it difficult for schools to provide valuable, hands-on experiences related to foreign language and the arts. Kids in these same schools cannot afford the luxury of attending an expensive summer camp. Été des Rêves means ""Summer of Dreams,"" and that is what we aim to offer for kids who otherwise could not have this unique experience. Our camp will empower kids across the boundaries of social and economic background. Through this experience, local kids will establish lasting friendships and learn to cultivate an appreciation of the arts and for other cultures.

As an organization, TdR has been providing foreign language/theatre educational experiences for kids in Atlanta for 17 years. In that time, many teachers and parents have thanked us for reaching out and inspiring kids. Ms. Johnson of Price Middle School wrote, ""As a result of these visits, students have learned the value

If you would like your contribution to be tax-deductible, please get in touch with us at allgonewest(at)gmail(dot)com before making your donation and we will make it happen. Thank you so much!What’s this all about?Well, glad you asked! All Gone West is a play about real people pursuing their dreams and coping with the outcomes.  It mirrors our lives and we'd bet yours too.  Whether or not our dreams are fulfilled, we must come to terms with the results and continue to live our lives.  Watching your dream explode can be devastating; having your dream fulfilled is exhilarating.  This is what our two main characters experience in All Gone West, and we want you to be a witness to their journeys.  Join us for the dreams, the jazz, the plot, the love, the disappointments, and the victories.We've been cooking up this play for two years, and we're sure it's going to be our best yet. We will be producing All Gone West this coming season at a theater in Manhattan, and to do so, we need your help to raise $10,000.We’ve assembled an incredible team of jazz musicians and designers already, with an awesome cast and crew in the works. We are here now asking for your support to bring this to life. We really can't do it without you.A little lot of help from our friends. A life in the theatre is never easy, but it’s the life we've chosen, and love. We’ve been at this for years and have the experience, both individually and as a team, but we need your help with the resources. Your donation today will go such a long way toward getting All Gone West in the theater this coming season. Please help us take our dream off the ground and onto the stage!
Where will the money go?Thanks to our incredible supporters, we’ve already raised $15,500! We need an additional $10,000 to produce All Gone West this coming season at an off-off Broadway theater in Manhattan, and here's where the money will go:
Theater rental and insurance, $2,500 a week for four weeks = $10,000
Costumes, sets, props, lighting =  $2,500
Actors, musicians, designers, crew, publicist/marketing = $10,000
All other expenses = $2,500
TOTAL: $25,000Who are we? We are Jonathan Fluck (l) and John Attanas (r), with the extremely talented group of jazz musicians and designers you see listed below, and soon-to-be brilliant cast. We met through Interborough Repertory Theatre (IRT), which Jonathan co-founded and ran from 1986 to 2006. Through IRT, Jonathan produced, directed, and acted in over fifty shows, from Equity showcases to traveling shows for children, including directing four of John’s plays on Theatre Row. John is a graduate of the LaGuardia High School of Performing Arts and NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts. He’s had over twenty plays produced and has published three children’s books.Now we have one more play to present. And it’s going to be the best yet.We really need your help to make this production a reality! If you make a donation, you will be helping two experienced Off-Off Broadway veterans get a show off the ground and into a theatre.TestimonialsQuotes from Glen Williamson, Actor""Jonathan Fluck is delightful to work with. He is both professional and fun. He has a ton of experience as a director, as a producer and as a performer. It is always a joy to work with him.""""John Attanas is a skilled and sensitive playwright. I've had the privilege of originating and reviving roles in several of his plays.

aspirations of one day becoming a professional modern dance company. Through
Conversion Dance Project I mostly set works on myself, fellow freelance dance
artists and dance students, which are then generally performed in various dance
festivals and colleges. However, I have always had the desire to produce my own
show. Dance festivals can be a wonderful way to get your work out there in a
really cost efficient way. But, I wanted to push beyond showing my work at a
dance festival. While festivals can offer lots of exposure, especially to up
and coming choreographers, it’s not likely that you will have the opportunity
to show more than one work, and on some occasions, more than one performance. I
wanted the opportunity to be able to showcase a body of my selected works in one
concert event. I’m also hoping this will give Conversion Dance Project the
exposure it needs to continue pushing forward. <br/><br/><p><b>WHAT WE ARE DOING</b><br/></p>

Phoenix Metropolitan area. We need help in raising the funds necessary to put

<p>MEGAN BASCOM &amp; DANCERS (MB&amp;D), a modern dance company based in NYC, has been invited to bring their latest project, <strong>STAKE</strong>, to Miami, Florida as part of the Inkub8 Arts Open Studio Series during the Wynwood Arts Walk. In an effort to cover the costs of this project, including travel, rehearsals, costumes, original sound score, and dancers' stipends, we are asking for your help with a tax-deductible donation! The incredible performing artists whom your donation will support are: Anna Barker, Carly Berrett, Robin Cherof, Megan Sinnwell, Ben Wolk, Megan Bascom and composer Max Hershenow. We aim to raise $3000 for this tour to Miami.</p>
<h3><strong>ABOUT STAKE</strong></h3>
<p>Structured as a series of vignettes, <strong>STAKE</strong> looks into the ways in which we re-arrange our circumstances to better suit our lives.  Our new arrangements can be revealing, shedding light on what we truly value. Inspired additionally by the physical architecture of fences and gates as barriers and openings, the six dancers encounter scenarios they must compromise around and weave through. This work exists in a place both ethereal and grounded, involving continuously changing moments of comfort, unease, humor, loss, surprise, monotony and beauty.</p>
<div>
<h3>WHAT YOUR SUPPORT FUNDS &amp; WHAT WE'VE GOT FOR YOU!</h3>
<p>Your donation will support MB&amp;D's travel expenses, rehearsal and performance stipends for the beautiful dancers, an original commissioned score, rehearsal space, and costumes.</p>
<p>The company is thrilled to undertake our first out-of-state tour, and subsidizing the travel expenses for six dancers is of the utmost importance! This project would never have come to fruition without the valuable time and efforts of the collaborating artists. Our secondary, and equally important goal, is to compensate the dancers for their artistic contributions. It is easy to donate online and EVERY level of donation helps.</p>
<p>We are so grateful for your support and to count you as our friends and backers. To show our appreciation, MB&amp;D has some Floridian delights set up for our donors!</p>
<p><strong>We'd love to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>List you on our website's donor page </li>
<li>Mail you a postcard from Miami signed by the dancers</li>
<li>Send you homemade marmalade made from fresh Florida oranges</li>
<li>Send you a copy of the original score for STAKE by Max Hershenow</li>
<li>Immortalize-You-In-The-Dance by creating a dance move for STAKE and naming it after YOU! </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How your donation makes a difference:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>$10 goes towards one hour of the artist's time</li>
<li>$50 covers rehearsal studio rental for one week</li>
<li>$100 covers one artist's food and living expenses for 4 days in Miami</li>
<li>$250 covers one artist's flight to Miami</li>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is J Lyn and I am a professional dancer that teaches dance to youth all around the NYC area at non-profits, public schools, charter schools, and dance studios. A year and a half ago I visited Togo and Ghana and had the opportunity to teach dance. The students showed so much passion and dedication that I've been moved to start BTAM.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>BTAM (Black To Africa Movement) is dedicated to using the performing arts to raise money to send West African youth that may not usually be able to afford tuition to school. I will be traveling to Accra, Ghana in late December to teach dance workshops and help the students create their own dance production for the community. The final production will be held at the University of Ghana at the end of the program. Nearby dance companies will perform and two students demonstrating need and exceptional talent will receive scholarships to help them continue their education.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In 2003, only 27% of Togolese youth and 36% of Ghanaian youth enrolled into school. An estimate of 1/3 of Togo's population lives below the poverty line. Students wishing to enroll into school must pay a tuition fee for all grade levels, even in public schools. Too many families cannot afford to send their child to school and this program is designed to address this need. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In addition, I believe that performing artists are called to do more than dance in music videos or to perform on stage in front of thousands, but to also make a positive difference in our communities with our talents. The arts are powerful and have the ability to inspire people. This is what BTAM is about.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding for the following:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>-Stipend for youth participants to afford travel to and from program</p>
<p>-Reserving rehearsal space at the University of Ghana</p>
<p>-Finances to bring a guest artist to perform for and inspire youth attendees to final show</p>
<p>-Set design and equipment rental for the final show</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For all supporters, you will receive links to rehearsal footage, interviews of our 10 Ghanaian high school participants, and video of the final show. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For donations of $100 and greater, you will receive a hand-crafted piece of artwork created in Togo. You will have the choice of jewelry, clothing, or painting.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word! This is will be the first annual program and BTAM could use all the support possible!</p>

ArtEffects Theatre Company was founded in 2009 by three theatre artists in New York City - Kristi McCarson, Zach McCoy and Phil Newsom. Our goal is to provide a safe place for all artists to create, learn, and grow. Since that time we have built a strong relationship with many actors, writers and directors through a series of productions, workshops, and play readings. The company mission statement is as follows:
 
ArtEffects Theatre Company strives to provide a positive environment where each artist can express themselves freely without judgement. Our company focuses on creative processes that include equal appreciation and collaboration among all artists.


The Project

We are now embarking on our biggest undertaking yet - presenting the New York premiere of the award-winning play ""The Birthday Boys."" Playwright Aaron Kozak has written one of the most thrilling, moving, and realistic portrayals of American soldiers in Iraq that we have ever read. If you have not heard of ""The Birthday Boys"" or Kozak, you soon will.  This play won a major award at last year’s LA Fringe Festival (Outstanding Contribution to LA Theatre Overall Fringe Performance), and the reviews were stellar:To say that this very well may be the best thing to go up in the Fringe is an understatement. The Birthday Boys is written, directed and performed to perfection.
- Marcus Kaye (LA Theatre Review)

 
This play about three POW’s cuts straight through to the core. The ending left my jaw on the floor.  Excellent writing, excellent acting and an excellent fringe production.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
This campaign's goal is to raise the funds to pay for airfare and lodging for the cast and crew to Dublin this May. Anything we raise over that will go directly into the production (see below!)<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It will cost $635 (roundtrip) to send each person to Ireland (and bring them all back!) We need to send 7 people  (cast, director, production stage manager, playwright). Total cost of airfare: $4475. Once there, the cast &amp; crew will stay in a furnished apartment that will cost about $1700 total.</p>
<p>Successfully completing our goal for this campaign means that we can cover the plane tickets and lodging; anything over that will go to 1) groceries to stock the larder in the apartment; 2) a per diem for the actors; 3) promotional expenses (posters, postcards, photos) with which to plaster Dublin (and not ourselves. We can pay for our own drinks!)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Do you know someone in Dublin? Tell them to come see our show! That's putting money in our pocket.</p>
<p>Do you have a mailing list? Would you consider doing an e-blast?</p>
<p>Share this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and write, post, or blog about it.</p>

The Impact
This campaign's goal is to raise the funds to pay for airfare and lodging for the cast and crew to Dublin this May. Anything we raise over that will go directly into the production (see below!)


What We Need & What You Get
It will cost $635 (roundtrip) to send each person to Ireland (and bring them all back!) We need to send 7 people  (cast, director, production stage manager, playwright). Total cost of airfare: $4475. Once there, the cast & crew will stay in a furnished apartment that will cost about $1700 total.
Successfully completing our goal for this campaign means that we can cover the plane tickets and lodging; anything over that will go to 1) groceries to stock the larder in the apartment; 2) a per diem for the actors; 3) promotional expenses (posters, postcards, photos) with which to plaster Dublin (and not ourselves. We can pay for our own drinks!)


Other Ways You Can Help
Do you know someone in Dublin? Tell them to come see our show! That's putting money in our pocket.
