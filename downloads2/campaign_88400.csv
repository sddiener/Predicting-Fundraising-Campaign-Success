A few years back, entrepreneur Tony M. Galazin was making a purchase in an Apple Store. He was given an iPod to sign with his finger and noticed a visible layer of grime and grease on the surface. He realized that dirty public touch screens were becoming unavoidable and we needed a solution to the health risks they posed. To solve this problem, Slivver was invented.





Slivver is a credit card sleeve that doubles as an antimicrobial stylus, or touch screen pen. Just slide it onto any credit card and hold it in your hand to activate it. Slivver uses state of the art, conductive plastic so you can swipe, tap, and sign without using your finger. It is available in five bold colors that make staying healthy a fashion statement.

Touch screens
are everywhere today, but these unavoidable new devices have an untold story of
contamination.  Common wisdom says that we
should not touch the toilet seat or the bottom of a shoe because they are dirty,
but we have yet to understand the health risks of touch screens. Public
touch screens are constantly used by sick cashiers, waiters, and customers,
making them ideal surfaces for transferring disease. Scientific studies confirm
this concern.      

The Impact









Slivver will be made in the USA from
state-of-the-art, conductive resins that activate touch screens by touching
you. This way, you can use touch screens without touching them at all. All
while supporting local manufacturing.  Slivver is essential to the public as we move forward in a

Well, no wonder most smartphone batteries last only 8 hours on average, after about 750 cycles (charge and recharge) the battery will be completely dead steadily going down each year in terms of overall capacity and on average, according to Forbes, they are obsolete in just 2 years! If you are looking for a way to avoid this we've found a better way to extend your battery life for years without ever needing to plug it in the wall to charge it again. Support us in our campaign to combat your dead batteries, to prevent climate change and to end energy poverty. Singularity is attracting the most brilliant minds like Drs.

Ideal for business and leisure travellers, the extreme gamer, the gadget obsessed, also suitable for outdoor activities like camping, hiking and anyone who has had a device low on power at the most inconvenient time.
XTRON comes in 2 awesome colors: black & white!
 
 


 

XTRON operates with world-class USB-C smart-control ICs and charging/discharging chips from TI (Texas Instruments), the same as those found in Apple’s new MacBook 2015.


 
 
XTRON uses FR-4 (Fire Retardant 4) T6135 4-layer PCB (Printed Circuit Board) of 2 oz copper thickness for greater thermal resistance and improved product performance, achieving expected product effectiveness, whilst most other brands only use a 2-layer PCB of 1 oz. 

 A maximum output of 4.2A recharges your devices in no time, taking you to a whole new level of high-speed charging. 3.5 hours of charging time extends your new MacBook's battery life for extra 8 hours. 

Supports pass-through charging: XTRON charges itself while charging other connected devices, that makes XTRON faster and efficient.

 
XTRON juices up your MacBook, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, iPhone 6s, iPad Pro, Beats solo2, Jabra Sports Pulse, PS4 controller, GoPro Hero 4 session and more!

 

Charge all your USB-C connector devices quickly and safely, using just our USB-C to USB-C cable with premium aluminium connectors. Built into the cable's USB-C connector is an electronic marker (E-marker). The e-marker is a chipset that enables the connected devices to identify the capabilities of the cable. This feature ensures optimum performance and compatibility between the connected devices and the cable.
Note: * USB-C to USB-C cable NOT included, must be purchased separately.


 

Equipped with USB-C and standard USB-A ports, XTRON allows you to charge 2 devices at the same time with super fast speed.



The material used for the casing of XTRON is PC+ABS (UL 94-V0 flame-retardant fire rating), thus making the enclosure of XTRON flexible and non-brittle.
We have also enhanced the matte surface coating to provide users with both a visual and a tactile experience like no other, this creates a highly desirable soft-touch tactile feel with the visual ceramic-like finish to give a full sensory combination, delivering a high quality, yet durable and easy-to-clean finish.


 



 




 



 
 
 
 



 
By carrying the XTRON with you, you don’t have to worry about losing power and fighting or running for a seat next to a power socket in airports or Starbucks will be a thing of the past.


 

 
 


 
 
 
 

 
Do you enjoy grabbing a coffee or pastry in Starbucks while using your MacBook to do some work, download music, watch videos on YouTube, check Facebook or e-mails or surf the net? Are you a frequent flyer in New York today and in Tokyo tomorrow, and then in London the next day and need to use your MacBook constantly to reply e-mails to customers, work on a presentation or search for information? As a uni student, do you often park your MacBook in the library and spend an entire day writing assignments or discussing with other classmates of your workgroup on the graduate showcase exhibition?
 
 


 

 




 

  
 
 
 
 

 
 Using XTRON couldn’t be easier. Simply plug in one end of the charging cable to the XTRON and use other end to plug into the device you wish to charge. Next, press and hold the power button and XTRON will start charging device automatically.

This project is created with the basic idea to provide tiny, cheap and versatile PCB for ATtiny25/45/85 microcontroler, that you can leave it in your project with no regret of losing expensive Arduino board. With the fraction of the Arduino price this small, but powerful uC ATtiny25/45/85 can be leave wherever you want. Many project can be simply shrink down to fit in to  ATtiny85 with 8k of flash memory. PCB fit to 8 Pin IC's like ATtiny13, ATtiny15 ,ATtiny25, ATtiny45, ATtiny85. This small PCB fit in to the bread board, so you can develop your idea at first. And when you are ready just leave it in your final project because it is so cheap.What is nice about ATtiny25/45/85 PCB that it have extremely narrow design that you can use 4 pins on each side of the bread board.For compare you can see how many space do we lose with Arduino Micro.Here is an example of classical blinking sketch running base on ATtiny25.What makes this PCB so cool is that it is full reversible SMD and THT. It mean that depending on your soldering skills you can use one of the two options, SMD on one side and THT on the other side. You can also mixed both version depending on components in your warehouse.Another example show ATtiny85 running OLED display SSD1306 via I2C interface.Standard 6 pin ISP connector allowed you to program in easy way ATtiny25/45/85.It has a really tiny size.ATtiny85 running 2 servos.Here is the video for How-To Shrinkify Your Arduino with detail explanation.Each pin on this PCB is well describe on silkscreen that you don't need any documentation when you are playing with your prototype.

<p>This project has several components.  First, we
have to finalize the design.  The prototype has showed proof of
concept.  We have already added several updated features to improve the
functionality of the device.  We added some no slip pads, and some snaps
to ensure the unit stays flat and closed when not in use.  We also are
working on a prototype that will be a little bigger than a credit card, but
will be able to accommodate a bigger tablet than just an iPad mini. 
 The manufacturer that we are using is located in Bristol, PA.  They
helped with the final design, and created the prototype.  The prototype
had to be machined by hand.  Once we reach our funding goal, we can mass
produce the product.  We also welcome any suggestions from our
funders.  Since the molds haven't been created yet, it's a perfect time to
make suggestions.  The molds will take about eight weeks to create, so we
are hoping to have them created by the holidays. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442679283/of7iidfvhl9hbndlgqo7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1442679307/bgcea7y2b1dyeuc1yewz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

The MagniSun was conceived as a USB solar charger that can be easily clipped on to any umbrella or tent using magnetic straps. No other USB solar chargers offer magnetic straps for mounting on umbrellas or the fabric of tents, backpacks, tarps, outdoor sunshades, and awnings. The flexible panel can even be left attached to an umbrella while folded up and can fold up with it. While unattached, the MagniSun can be laid out on any flat surface.</span></p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions<br/>
</h3>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>What electronic
devices can be charged with the MagniSun solar charger?</i></p>
<p>The MagniSun charger can be connected to any electronic
device that can be charged or powered with a standard USB male connector.  The 4W solar panel is be capable of producing
up to 800 mA of current at 5 V from its female USB port.  However, on partly-cloudy days, the panel
would be producing about half that amount of mA.  USB cables can charge a wide variety of
devices, with a wide variety of power demand. 
So it is important that the user determine that the 4W panel can
satisfactorily power or charge a particular device with at most 670 mA, or more
than one device using a splitter hub.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the 4W panel does not provide enough power
to charge an iPad, which has a required current required of 1 Amp (1,000 mA)
via USB at 5V.  Also, laptops and
macbooks need more power (usually around several amps at 5 V) than could be
provided by this 4W panel.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that USB adapters for
device-specific charging connector types, other than standard USB, are not
included with the MagniSun.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>What solar PV
USB-charging umbrellas are already on the market?</i></p>
<p>There are a few umbrellas with permanently mounted
PV-powered USB chargers on the market, but they have tended to be larger,
heavier patio umbrellas costing several hundred dollars. Also, the entire
umbrella must be purchased, as the solar PV-panels are permanently attached to
the umbrella. The MagniSun is much more appropriate for the portable
applications such as the beach or camping, uses any existing umbrella, and is
much more affordable.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>What could
interrupt the MagniSun’s charging?</i></p>
<p>The MagniSun charging’s can be interrupted if the PV
panel becomes shaded, or is turned away from the sun. If clouds
pass overhead, or if a shadow is cast over the MagniSun, the charging can
become interrupted. Phones will often reject the charge in cases like these. Connecting
the MagniSun to a USB-compatible battery pack (see below) is recommended, which
can still charge until much lower light conditions than a phone, and can store
the energy to be used later (including at night).</p>
<p>Certain phones, such as the common Apple iPhone 4 and
iPhone 5 models, may display ""Accessory may not be supported"" or
similar message after being connected to a MagniSun charger, after which it
stops charging. This is just because of the software of the phone’s power
management system, and the MagniSun charger will still charge the phone with a
couple simple steps. When the USB charging cable is connected to the phone, the
smartphone firmware will detect if the power input is enough or not. If it is
below the minimum ""startup"" power level, iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 will
show this message and cut off charging. But an iPhone 4S will not have this
problem because it has a different power management system. After the phone
displays the message ""Accessory may not be supported"", follow these
two steps (repeat if necessary):</p>
<p>  1. Position the
solar panel under good sun light (if available)</p>
<p>  2. Re-plug the
charging cable</p>
<p>It should be noted that any cell phone being charged
should not be left in the direct sun on a warm day, or under a dark object in
the sun, for an extended period. An overheated phone will not charge
efficiently. It is recommended that the phone be kept in the shade if possible.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>Does the solar
charger store energy with a battery?</i></p>
<p>The MagniSun does not have its own internal battery to
store the solar energy, for use when the sun is not shining (charge during the
day for use at night, for example). However, on the market there are a variety
of compact and portable USB-compatible battery packs which could be connected
to the MagniSun. As described above, OC Outdoor Solar has recently partnered
with battery pack manufacturer XPAL Power as part of this crowdfunding campaign. XPAL Power’s PoP'n 1 battery pack,
with 2000 mAh of energy storage capacity, is equipped with suction cups to
attach to any smooth surface, including the back side of the MagniSun. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i>Is the flexible solar
panel waterproof?</i></p>
<p>The MagniSun will withstand rain or minor splashes on the
panel, although it is not designed to be totally submerged in water.  </p>
<br/><p>If you've made it this far, you know too much.  Consider joining our team and share our project with your solar-loving friends or donate now.  Thanks in advance for your support!<br/></p>
</div>
</div></div>","MagniSun
Now any beach umbrella or tent can be put to work charging a phone, or USB-compatible device, with the clean power of the sun. The MagniSun was conceived as a USB solar charger that can be easily clipped on to any umbrella or tent using magnetic straps. No other USB solar chargers offer magnetic straps for mounting on umbrellas or the fabric of tents, backpacks, tarps, outdoor sunshades, and awnings. The flexible panel can even be left attached to an umbrella while folded up and can fold up with it. While unattached, the MagniSun can be laid out on any flat surface.

The MagniSun solar charger can power USB-compatible devices including mobile phones, iPods, battery packs, cameras, GPS devices, vaporizer pens and ebooks. In direct sunlight, the MagniSun will take about 4 hours to fully charge an average smart phone.The 4 Watt solar PV panel is flexible and fold-able, with 5 V USB jack output (max current output: approx. 800 mA).



Dimensions-
Folded: 8"" (200 mm) x 5.2"" (130 mm) x 1.2"" thick (30 mm)
Expanded: 8"" (200 mm) x 14"" (355 mm) x 0.1"" thick (2 mm)
Weight: 7 oz. (200 g)
Part of the back side of the MagniSun solar charger (opposite side as the solar panel), has a smooth laminate surface for small battery packs with suction cups to be attached, such as the XPAL PoP’n (described below).

Whether for safety, social media, pictures or videos, everybody wants their smartphones charged and ready no matter where they are. The market trend is to add USB-compatible charging ports or cords to just about any type of small electronic device.



                                                                                             
Approach 
OC Outdoor Solar's founder has always wanted to keep a phone charged (mostly for taking pictures, or for emergency use) while camping or hiking, and has been been experimenting with portable solar chargers for over two years. One
 day he brought one of these solar panels to the beach, and laid it out on a beach
 towel. While the panel did a fine job charging an iPhone in the summer 
sun, extra care had to be taken to 
not let sand get in the USB port.  

Beachgoers
who want to charge their phones with a solar charger do not want to lay a
charger on the sand, as sand could get into the charging port.  Beach
towel space is also often at a premium.  The logical solution is
to mount the solar charger up on the top surface of any beach umbrella,
and no other adaptable solution for doing this is yet on the market. Experimenting with several existing solar panels, initial efforts of OC Outdoor Solar focused on finding a way to mount solar PV panels on umbrellas. The first prototype with the umbrella-mounting of a flexible 3 Watt PV array had it semi-permanently attached to the umbrella fabric, with permanent holes to be punched through the fabric. 
The MagniSun, using magnetic straps, was conceived to allow the solar charger to be easily clipped on to any existing umbrella, without any permanent holes cut into it. The magnetic straps also allow the charger to be temporarily attached all kinds of fabric surfaces: tents, tarps, outdoor sunshades, and awnings.

Never have your cell phone dead at the beach ever again.
Put your sun umbrella to work, charging your phone. Unfold it from your
backpack or beach bag, clip it on to your beach umbrella with the magnetic
straps, and have power all day! Enjoy the beach time to speak freely, listen to
music, or call and text friends because you will always have mobile power. 

Hiking
and Camping-
Solar power on demand in the great outdoors! The MagniSun
charger can be attached to the fabric of tents or a tent rainfly. Backpackers,
far away from their vehicles or civilization, can keep their phones and other
devices charged.


Canopy Tents/Outdoor
Events-
Attendees of outdoor events and
festivals, who have no convenient source of power, can attached the charger to
their sun umbrellas and canopy tents. Concertgoers commonly use their smart
phones at concerts to take pictures and record videos.  At outdoor events,
vendors can also mount the charger onto their canopy tents.



                                                                                            
Future Vision
OC Outdoor Solar‘s “Global Vision”-
In the future, OC Outdoor Solar seeks to help provide off-grid charging solutions such as solar phones or external solar chargers in emerging markets. Around the world, there are hundreds of millions of mobile phone users without access to the electricity grid, a factor which severely limits communication opportunities.
Simple uses of electricity such as small lights, radios, or cell phones help improve people’s lives in significant ways, and can all be charged or directly powered with a small solar charger. Sun umbrellas, tents, canopies, tarps, awnings and other fabric sunshades are common all over the world. As
 part of the crowdfunding campaign, OC Outdoor Solar will donate 5% of 
the total amount raised to Green Empowerment and other organizations 
dedicated to getting clean energy into the hands of people around the world
 without reliable sources of electricity. 
Green Empowerment is an amazing organization that
 works with local partners around the world to strengthen communities by
 delivering renewable energy and safe water. Click here to learn more. 

                                                                                           
Storing the Energy of the MagniSun
Storing the Solar Energy in a Battery; Partnership in XPAL Power-
OC Outdoor Solar has recently partnered with battery pack manufacturer XPAL Power, who are also based in Orange County. As part of this crowdfunding campaign, XPAL Power has generously offered to let us include their PowerSkin PoP'n 1 USB battery pack in the MagniSun campaign offerings. The amazing PoP'n 1 battery pack, with 2000 mAh of energy storage capacity, is equipped with suction cups that can attach to any smooth surface, as seen below. The PoP'n can be charged while being attached to the new MagniSun prototype, which has a smooth laminate surface on the back (non-PV panel) side. With the PoP'n battery pack, you can take your MagniSun-generated solar energy from the beach (or anywhere outside) and use it anywhere indoors or later at night.




                                                                                           

What We Need & What You Get

Material and production costs: $1,500
Equipment, tools, misc. supplies: $500
Shipping: $250
Misc.: $125
Nonprofit donations (5% of total raised): $125 (Min.) 
Total: $2,500
Funds raised through Indiegogo will help us bring MagniSun to life. We will need to cover upfront costs such and minimum order quantity thresholds of suppliers. Once built, each unit will need to be tested and certified to assure what we have built is safe and reliable. At the end of it all, we will be able to deliver a great product that you helped build.



Over the next couple months, we will be working on minor improvements, such as refining the smooth surface material (for attaching the suction cups of the battery pack) selecting a cap on the end of the female USB connector, to keep out sand, dirt, etc. when it is not in use.
The main source components are manufactured in Asia, though the complete solar umbrellas will be integrated and assembled in Orange County, California. There will be some risk factor in the quality control and lead times of contract manufacturing of the source components due to the distances to the suppliers. However, quality of the source product samples of the chosen component suppliers has been excellent.

Frequently Asked Questions


What electronic
devices can be charged with the MagniSun solar charger?
The MagniSun charger can be connected to any electronic
device that can be charged or powered with a standard USB male connector.  The 4W solar panel is be capable of producing
up to 800 mA of current at 5 V from its female USB port.  However, on partly-cloudy days, the panel
would be producing about half that amount of mA.  USB cables can charge a wide variety of
devices, with a wide variety of power demand. 
So it is important that the user determine that the 4W panel can
satisfactorily power or charge a particular device with at most 670 mA, or more
than one device using a splitter hub.
Unfortunately, the 4W panel does not provide enough power
to charge an iPad, which has a required current required of 1 Amp (1,000 mA)
via USB at 5V.  Also, laptops and
macbooks need more power (usually around several amps at 5 V) than could be
provided by this 4W panel.
It should also be noted that USB adapters for
device-specific charging connector types, other than standard USB, are not
included with the MagniSun.

What solar PV
USB-charging umbrellas are already on the market?
There are a few umbrellas with permanently mounted
PV-powered USB chargers on the market, but they have tended to be larger,
heavier patio umbrellas costing several hundred dollars. Also, the entire
umbrella must be purchased, as the solar PV-panels are permanently attached to
the umbrella. The MagniSun is much more appropriate for the portable
applications such as the beach or camping, uses any existing umbrella, and is
much more affordable.  

What could
interrupt the MagniSun’s charging?
The MagniSun charging’s can be interrupted if the PV
panel becomes shaded, or is turned away from the sun. If clouds
pass overhead, or if a shadow is cast over the MagniSun, the charging can
become interrupted. Phones will often reject the charge in cases like these. Connecting
the MagniSun to a USB-compatible battery pack (see below) is recommended, which
can still charge until much lower light conditions than a phone, and can store
the energy to be used later (including at night).
Certain phones, such as the common Apple iPhone 4 and
iPhone 5 models, may display ""Accessory may not be supported"" or
similar message after being connected to a MagniSun charger, after which it
stops charging. This is just because of the software of the phone’s power
management system, and the MagniSun charger will still charge the phone with a
couple simple steps. When the USB charging cable is connected to the phone, the
smartphone firmware will detect if the power input is enough or not. If it is
below the minimum ""startup"" power level, iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 will
show this message and cut off charging. But an iPhone 4S will not have this
problem because it has a different power management system. After the phone
displays the message ""Accessory may not be supported"", follow these
two steps (repeat if necessary):
  1. Position the
solar panel under good sun light (if available)
  2. Re-plug the
charging cable
It should be noted that any cell phone being charged
should not be left in the direct sun on a warm day, or under a dark object in
the sun, for an extended period. An overheated phone will not charge
efficiently. It is recommended that the phone be kept in the shade if possible.  

Does the solar
charger store energy with a battery?
The MagniSun does not have its own internal battery to
store the solar energy, for use when the sun is not shining (charge during the
day for use at night, for example). However, on the market there are a variety
of compact and portable USB-compatible battery packs which could be connected
to the MagniSun. As described above, OC Outdoor Solar has recently partnered
with battery pack manufacturer XPAL Power as part of this crowdfunding campaign. XPAL Power’s PoP'n 1 battery pack,
with 2000 mAh of energy storage capacity, is equipped with suction cups to
attach to any smooth surface, including the back side of the MagniSun. 

Is the flexible solar
panel waterproof?
The MagniSun will withstand rain or minor splashes on the
panel, although it is not designed to be totally submerged in water.

<p>  Smartphones have now become a necessity in our everyday lifestyle lets face it. From sending text's, to checking Facebook and Instagram, to just browsing the Internet to buy some time, the list of possible uses is endless. The downside? Well that's simple. Sooner or later you're going to run out of power when you need it most! The solution? myPOWL. The myPOWL concept first came about from looking at how people use their devices everyday and where they run out of power most. We found ourselves and the vast majority of people living in today's society out of the house and nowhere near a charger when this was occurring. Whether it be for dinner, drinks, at gigs, music festivals or simply just out of the house doing some shopping, it became clear that there needed to be a system that would ensure we remained in touch and informed. Now the obvious solution was to buy one of the vast options of power banks available on the market, but lets face it, most are the size and weight of a smartphone themselves, cost a days salary and require a labyrinth of external cables in order to fit the device you're wanting to charge. Not particularly something we wanted to be carrying around when trying to have fun and socialize or generally carry around when we’re out and about. We found the solution obvious yet not one brand could fit the bill so we created a super slim and small power bank that sits comfortably in your wallet, purse or pocket, yet is versatile and powerful enough to charge your most used devices. Using the built in cable it can easily be plugged into your chosen device, which is compatible to most Apple Lightning and Micro USB devices. This means no mess, no bulkiness, and no excessive cables, just a slim, powerful, strong and lightweight all-in-one myPOWL power bank. The myPOWL power bank is available in a 2500 mAh capacity, which is able to charge most of your devices up to 100%. With myPOWL we believe, we’ve delivered the ultimate portable power solution that completely eliminates on the go charging problems. </p>

<p>  Most power banks on the market today require you to not only cary an expensive, bulky battery around for extra power but also rely on messy and awkward cables to charge your devices, and even then only have the capability to charge either an Apple device OR a Micro USB device. The myPowl can charge both. No longer do you need to carry around any additional cables or connectors, it's as simple as pulling out the small cable built into the myPOWL and charge your device, thats it! </p>

  During the past few months we have established close relationships with our manufacturing partners in Shenzhen, China, who will be manufacturing the myPOWL devices with grade A quality lithium ion batteries and durable injection moulded outer casings. However, we have also procured another relationship with a backup supplier in Guangzhou, China. They both have been proven as reliable and top quality manufacturers with high production capabilities ensuring manufacturing and production risks are kept at a minimum. 
Expected challenges we may face generally involve the delivery and shipping to our customers outside Australia. Customers may experience slight delays due to the changing nature of regulations surrounding the transportation of batteries however this will only mean a likely revision in the design of the myPOWL packaging. 


  If you are unable to help us out with a full purchase pledge of the myPOWL device don't worry thats completely fine. We still appreciate your interest and only ask you to spread the word. Sharing our Facebook or Instagram page to friends and family would help us out immensely. Spreading the word about what we are doing and what we plan to do is just as valuable as any financial help we receive!
We know you'll love the device/devices if you do decide to help out and would love to hear your feedback as well. If you can find the time once you have received your device we would also greatly appreciate any constructive comments sent to feedback@myPOWL.com.
Again thank you for your help and contributions. We look forward to continuing to work on the myPOWL devices and furthering POWL's innovation.

</h3> <p>When I recently wanted to build some Arduino based sensors with a wireless interface to a Raspberry Pi board, I ended up building lots of little prototype board configurations and had various degrees of success.<br/></p>
<p>There are certainly many wireless radio options available out there these days for sending sensor data between devices, and each one has its own unique advantages and drawbacks.    I came to a solution that worked well for me and suited my most important criteria best, namely:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Low cost</li> <li>Reliable<br/>
</li> <li>Good range <br/>
</li>
<li>Easy to use</li>
</ul>
<p>With this project it is my wish to share what I have learned with you.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>One development board that can do a lot of things<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435655946/igqb17vsplvkf5rr3mii.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>The EasyPeasy development board contains the following commonly used parts to make it easier for you to prototype your ideas: <ul> <li>433 Mhz or 315 Mhz Radio Receiver<br/>
</li> <li>433 Mhz or 315 Mhz Radio Transmitter</li>
<li>Socket for Arduino Pro Micro (or compatible) board</li>
<li>Dallas DS18B20 temperature sensor</li>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.adafruit.com/products/1938"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NeoPixel</a> RGB color 5mm LED   (see note)<br/>
</li>
<li>Button</li>
<li>Buzzer</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Note : </b>Only the EasyPeasy for Arduino will have a Neopixel LED.  The EasyPeasyPi for Raspberry Pi will just have a normal RGB  LED<br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<p>A prototype board of this nature is only valuable if it is also accompanied by great examples, libraries and source code.    So I also provide the following software to aid tinkerers and developers to fast track development<br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>EasyPeasy library for Arduino <br/>
</li>
<li>Lots of EasyPeasy examples which includes the following:</li>
<li>Working example of a wireless temperature sensors</li>
<li>Working example of a transmitter/responder (ping-pong) <br/>
</li>
<li>Working example of RF repeater (range extender)</li>
<li>Working examples of C++ code for Raspberry Pi (more details below)</li>
</ul>
<br/><h3>Saves you time and effort</h3>
<br/>The main purpose of EasyPeasy is to make things easier for anyone to build their own wireless sensors and devices,    <br/><br/>You can avoid time consuming trial and error pitfalls by starting your project with known working hardware and source code and then build out on that baseline with your own ideas and requirements.  In many cases you may even find that you can use the EasyPeasy board and the example code that comes with it directly as part of your proof-of-concept ideas<br/><br/><h3>Some of the boards will be removable</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435657543/nunsgmckybqshywtmhbc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Since this is essentially intended as a developer board, I decided to put some of the parts on header sockets such as the ones shows here.   For example the transmitter, receiver and Arduino Pro Micro will all be on removable sockets.   That means you an easily plug them out and try them in your own project.   Or maybe you just want to unplug them to use their I/O pins for something else.<br/><br/><br/><h3><b>Source code and circuit diagram provided</b></h3>
<b>
</b><p>I will supply you with the circuit diagrams and all the source code 
of the libraries I used to make EasyPeasy.  This should enable you to 
easily test out your ideas and then simply import this into your own 
designs.<br/></p>
<p>The examples provided cover all aspects of how to use the hardware 
and more. Please watch the campaign video to see just what I mean.<br/></p>
<br/>
<h3><b>Range and power<br/></b></h3>
<p>One of the things I like most of the transmitters and receivers used in EasyPeasy,  are the good range I get out of them.   In open air line-of-sight conditions it is about 200 meters and inside buildings with walls in between it about halve of that.   To give you an example.... my house is quite big and yet I could easily cover every part of my house or yard from any other part of my house or yard.   And even if range is still a problem, you can always use an extra EasyPeasy as a range extender, but I did not even need to do that.</p>
<p>The devices are really light on power consumption as well.   The receiver uses about 2 mA while the transmitter uses about 20 mA (but only while its actually transmitting).   This makes battery powered applications possible as well.<br/></p>
<p>Another thing that I like about these particular devices is that there is no ""pairing"" required as in the case of bluetooth etc.   You just transmit and every single receiver in range with get the signal.   This means your can easily have a one to many configuration if your application has such a requirement.</p>
<h3>433Mhz or 315Mhz?</h3>The receivers and transmitters used in EasyPeasy come<br/> in 433Mhz and 315Mhz flavors and since they cost the same price I will make this one of the option choices.   I only use the 433 Mhz in my own projects.   To give you a guideline, in Europe the official allowed frequency EU / CE R&amp;TTE regulations is 433Mhz, so I recommend that users from Europe choose that option to stay on the right side of the law.    But both 315Mhz and 433Mhz are used in USA,<br/>

<h3> EasyPeasy vs EasyPeasyPi</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The same basic PCB are used both Arduino and Raspberry Pi A, B+ and RPi 2 development.<br/></p>
<p>How is this possible?  Well for Arduino development  you plug in
 an Arduino Pro Micro into the socket that are fitted on the board.  This is then 
referred then as EasyPeasy.  </p>
<p> But in  Raspberry Pi mode 
(also referred to as EasyPeasyPi)  there is no Arduino Pro Micro socket fitted. Instead
 there is a 26 way connector  on the bottom of the board that plugs 
directly into the Raspberry Pi's IO connecter.  All the signal lines have
 been fitted with voltage divider resistors or drivers so that , even though the 
Raspberry Pi works on 3V3, it can still drive 5V devices like the buzzer
 or the RF devices.</p>
<b>Summary:<br/></b><p><b>EasyPeasy is for Arduino</b> development.   Comes with the sockets for an Arduino Pro Micro board, but not the Raspberry Pi connector.  All you need is to fit and Arduino Pro Micro board and start develing.   (There are also some other components that are only required for Raspberry Pi implementation, which will not be fitted on the normal EasyPeasy board)<br/></p>

<i>Picture shows EasyPeasyPi</i><br/><br/>When you <b>choose your perks</b> in your contribution, you will have to option to specify that either EasyPeasy or EasyPeasyPi or both.    You'll need one of each in a project where an Arduino based sensors needs to send stuff to a Raspberry Pi board and vise versa.    Both boards use more or less the same parts and cost about the same to manufacture.  So I kept the price the same and leave the choice up to you.  <br/><br/><br/><h3>Spare IO pins<br/>
</h3>
<p>Not all of the IO pins of the Arduino or Raspberry Pi is used by the EasyPeasy.   Those lines are still available for usage of your own application and for your convenience they have been brought out to some header pin sockets for easy wiring.   The free pins that is still available to you include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serial UART Txd and Rxd</li>
<li>SPI (MOSI, MISO, SCLK and SSEL)</li>
<li>Some general IO pins (including analog input pins in case of Arduino)</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that you can easily still use SPI, I2C, UART or analog on your EasyPeasy board in conjunction with the features that EasyPeasy brings to the table.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Examples of what you can do with your EasyPeasy<br/>
</h3>
<p>For such a small simple board, this is amazingly versatile.   I will indulge in just a few examples ideas to wet your appetite:</p>
<h4>Improved wireless doorbell<br/>
</h4>
<p>Why not make yourself an improved doorbell that reaches further and can ring in various parts of your home.   You can even ad features like logging the time that someone last pressed your doorbell or interface it to your RPi to send you an email when someone pressed your doorbell.  </p>
<h4>Customized security system<br/>
</h4>
<p>The RF receivers and transmitters used in this project can receive and transmit signals to a variety of cheap passive infrared detectors (PIR) and magnetic door and window sensors.  This means you can easily devise your own customized security system system.  </p>
<h4>Control home automation devices</h4>
<p>There are a variety of home automation devices (light dimmers etc) that uses radio technology that is compatible to the transmitters and receivers in the EasyPeasy project.   That means you can send signals to and receive signals from these devices.</p>
<h4><b>Wireless sensor</b></h4>
<p>Why not make a sensor that detects the level of an outside water tank which will send a signal to your RPi when water levels are running low.  The PRi in turn can send you an SMS to warn you your water tank is almost empty.  <br/></p>
<p>Or perhaps you just want to monitor the temperature of a couple of fridges in a warehouse.   The EasyPeasy board includes and accurate temperature sensors and we include an example of how to transmit the measured temperature to a remite device.    <br/></p>
<p>The Arduino Pro Micro also has some spare A/D lines.   You can thus use the Arduino based EasyPeasy as a wireless A/D measurement device for your Raspberry Pi (which does not have built in A/D).</p>
<h4>Long Range active RFID tag</h4>
<p>Most RFID tags have a range of only a few centimeters.   But now you can easily build your own customized long range RFID tag that will work for up about 200 meters based on the transmitter/responder example we include with the EasyPeasy project.</p>
<h4>Wireless RGB LED indicator</h4>
<p>Since the EasyPeasy also includes an RGB LED, it makes it very simple for you to make a wireless RGB LED indicator to indicate for example when someone is occupying the board room at the office or the health status of some vital computer system.   It is quite simple to interface on EasyPeasy via USB to a PC.  The PC then checks the health status of another online computer system and sets the remote LED to green, red or blue via its connected EasyPeasy board.</p>
<h4>Control your robot</h4>
<p>Probably one of the most obvious and simple applications is to control a robot.  Since you have bi-directional communication, it lends itself to all kinds of interesting possibilities in robot making.   <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h4>You own ideas<br/>
</h4>
<p>Most  these ideas are now easily accomplished using the examples that 
come with EasyPeasy.   I can thing of many more examples, but I hope these would be enough to spur up your own imagination of just what is all possible.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What will be done with crowd funding</h3>The reason why I am searching crowd funding for this project is the following:<br/><br/><h4>Making yet another revision of the PCB</h4>
<p>I have already had two different revisions of the PCB.   Each time I realized another a small change was required to make things even better.   Before I send out the perks for this campaign I would like to add one or two more small improvements first.<br/></p>
<h4>Making a website for EasyPeasy</h4>
<p>One of the things I would like to do if this campaign is successful is to make a special website for EasyPeasy.  The idea would be to have a place where the circuit diagrams and libraries can be downloaded but also where I wish to put a number of practical example projects that can easily be realized using the EasyPeasy project.</p>
<h4>Bulk buying of components and making EasyPeasy boards</h4>
<p>I want EasyPeasy boards to be low prized so that anyone can afford them and play with them.   To do this I need to buy some of the components in bulk.   The higher the number number the cheaper things get.   Same goes for the actual manufacturing itself.   If its just a few boards, I can easily solder them up myself.   But I work slowly and costly.   I would much rather prefer to contract a small manufacturing company to do it professionally for me.   But to do that I need at to make a substantial number of them.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Risks</b></h3>
<p>The risks are very small.    I have already built working examples of the EasyPeasy boards and written the libraries and code examples  of how to use them.  It is not a difficult board to make or test and I'm confident there would not be any issues in that either.    So for me personally the only risk I can think of is that I completely misjudged other people's perception of the usefulness  of this product.  I hope I am right and other out there people will find it just a useful as it was for me.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>UPDATE : RGB LED replaced by NeoPixel LED<br/></b></h3>Users of EasyPeasy for Arduino will be pleased to know that instead of a normal RGB LED on the board, I plan to fit a <a href=""http://www.adafruit.com/products/1938"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NeoPixel</a> LED.    This has the advantage that you can set it to any color or brightness.   The EasyPeasy board will also expose the the Neopixel pins so you can easily attach a whole strip of NeoPixel LEDs if you wish.      This is good news....  the the NeoPixel is more expensive than regular RGB LED's, but so much more worth it.<br/><p>Unfortunately the EasyPeasyPi will still just feature a regular three color LED.  The reason why I did not include NeoPixel LED for the Raspberry Pi as well is that I simply could not manage to get it work well on the new RPi 2, even though it worked well on the RPi B+ mode.    But to keep consistency, all EasyPeasyPi's will have a regular three color LED.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Questions</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q: </b> I would like to use the EasyPeasy to interface to a 433 Mhz  wireless PIR sensor.  Can you advise how I would go about to intercept those signals.<br/></p>
<p><b>A: </b> Very simple.   One of the examples that come with Arduino EasyPeasy  allows you to see all kinds of info about the signal that the receiver see.   You can just monitor what code it receives and use that in your own code.   <br/></p>

</div></div>","Introduction
 When I recently wanted to build some Arduino based sensors with a wireless interface to a Raspberry Pi board, I ended up building lots of little prototype board configurations and had various degrees of success.
There are certainly many wireless radio options available out there these days for sending sensor data between devices, and each one has its own unique advantages and drawbacks.    I came to a solution that worked well for me and suited my most important criteria best, namely:  Low cost Reliable
 Good range 

Easy to use

With this project it is my wish to share what I have learned with you.

    One development board that can do a lot of things
 



The EasyPeasy development board contains the following commonly used parts to make it easier for you to prototype your ideas:  433 Mhz or 315 Mhz Radio Receiver
 433 Mhz or 315 Mhz Radio Transmitter
Socket for Arduino Pro Micro (or compatible) board
Dallas DS18B20 temperature sensor

NeoPixel RGB color 5mm LED   (see note)

Button
Buzzer

Note : Only the EasyPeasy for Arduino will have a Neopixel LED.  The EasyPeasyPi for Raspberry Pi will just have a normal RGB  LED


A prototype board of this nature is only valuable if it is also accompanied by great examples, libraries and source code.    So I also provide the following software to aid tinkerers and developers to fast track development


EasyPeasy library for Arduino 

Lots of EasyPeasy examples which includes the following:
Working example of a wireless temperature sensors
Working example of a transmitter/responder (ping-pong) 

Working example of RF repeater (range extender)
Working examples of C++ code for Raspberry Pi (more details below)

Saves you time and effort
The main purpose of EasyPeasy is to make things easier for anyone to build their own wireless sensors and devices,    You can avoid time consuming trial and error pitfalls by starting your project with known working hardware and source code and then build out on that baseline with your own ideas and requirements.  In many cases you may even find that you can use the EasyPeasy board and the example code that comes with it directly as part of your proof-of-concept ideasSome of the boards will be removable

Since this is essentially intended as a developer board, I decided to put some of the parts on header sockets such as the ones shows here.   For example the transmitter, receiver and Arduino Pro Micro will all be on removable sockets.   That means you an easily plug them out and try them in your own project.   Or maybe you just want to unplug them to use their I/O pins for something else.Source code and circuit diagram provided

I will supply you with the circuit diagrams and all the source code 
of the libraries I used to make EasyPeasy.  This should enable you to 
easily test out your ideas and then simply import this into your own 
designs.
The examples provided cover all aspects of how to use the hardware 
and more. Please watch the campaign video to see just what I mean.

Range and power
One of the things I like most of the transmitters and receivers used in EasyPeasy,  are the good range I get out of them.   In open air line-of-sight conditions it is about 200 meters and inside buildings with walls in between it about halve of that.   To give you an example.... my house is quite big and yet I could easily cover every part of my house or yard from any other part of my house or yard.   And even if range is still a problem, you can always use an extra EasyPeasy as a range extender, but I did not even need to do that.
The devices are really light on power consumption as well.   The receiver uses about 2 mA while the transmitter uses about 20 mA (but only while its actually transmitting).   This makes battery powered applications possible as well.
Another thing that I like about these particular devices is that there is no ""pairing"" required as in the case of bluetooth etc.   You just transmit and every single receiver in range with get the signal.   This means your can easily have a one to many configuration if your application has such a requirement.
433Mhz or 315Mhz?The receivers and transmitters used in EasyPeasy come in 433Mhz and 315Mhz flavors and since they cost the same price I will make this one of the option choices.   I only use the 433 Mhz in my own projects.   To give you a guideline, in Europe the official allowed frequency EU / CE R&TTE regulations is 433Mhz, so I recommend that users from Europe choose that option to stay on the right side of the law.    But both 315Mhz and 433Mhz are used in USA,

  Works on both Raspberry Pi and Arduino
The EasyPeasy board was designed to facilitate developers of both Raspberry Pi and Arduino with the same basic hardware configuration.   More about this in the next paragraph. 
 EasyPeasy vs EasyPeasyPi

community members, spread across the word, as we are these days?  Or perhaps you are thinking of starting up a group’s
website so you can all stay in touch and share photos and other documents with
each other. </p>
<p>Building that kind of secure website is not cheap and there
are plenty of groups and small associations, scattered across the globe,
particularly in the developing countries, that simply cannot afford to set up
their own and pay the cost of keeping it maintained. That’s where we come in.
We created something called WebForGroups, a cost effective, a very affordable
way for groups of people to stay in touch with each other, in a matter of
minutes.

created a portable massage unit capable of various treatments from acupressure
to muscle relaxation. iMassageo technology was based off the Technology of the
TENS (T</span>ranscutaneous Electrical Nerve
Stimulation) unit.</p>

<span> </span><div>
<div><b>What is Transcutaneous
Electrical Nerve Stimulation? </b></div>
<div> Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation is often referred to as TENS
technology. There are a couple of theories on why TENS technology works to
relieve chronic and acute pain. The first theory is that the electrodes
stimulate nerves and “scramble” pain signals to the brain. The second theory says
that the electrodes help the body produce endorphins, which block the
perception of pain.</div>
<div>
<br/> 
<p><b>How we are different</b></p>
<p><span>Our
product competitors have a remote control that connects to the electrode pads.
iMassageo is the only company of its kind with technology to activate the
massager over the phone. Users can control all the features of iMassageo
through a user-friendly app. It’s totally wireless!                                                                                      </span><span>Our product is small and
easily portable, yet made for the full massage experience.</span></p>
<p>Upgrades
and additions are easy and automatic through the app! The app can also track
customer use, your favorite massage settings, length of use and more !</p>

technology. There are a couple of theories on why TENS technology works to
relieve chronic and acute pain. The first theory is that the electrodes
stimulate nerves and “scramble” pain signals to the brain. The second theory says
that the electrodes help the body produce endorphins, which block the
perception of pain.

 
How we are different
Our
product competitors have a remote control that connects to the electrode pads.

massager over the phone. Users can control all the features of iMassageo
through a user-friendly app. It’s totally wireless!                                                                                      Our product is small and

customer use, your favorite massage settings, length of use and more !

<h2>Our Hardware</h2>
<p>We’ve scoured the research labs of the biggest companies and most exciting startups for the latest and greatest mobile technologies to specify the first-generation Z8. Crafted from cool, textured titanium metal, the Ubuntu Z8 has a distinctive, and very precise look. Gestures are the next big thing in mobile, and our testing has found that a 4.7in screen is ideal for comfortable control of all four corners with one hand.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521251266/n0q3enxza5fhdd32hbqd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We also believe the race for ever higher resolution has become a distraction. Beyond 600ppi you’re adding overhead rather than improving display clarity. We think colour, brightness and dynamic range are now the edge of invention so we’ll choose a display for its balance of resolution, dynamic range and colour accuracy. We’ll protect that gorgeous display with something vastly tougher than glass: pure sapphire crystal, a material so hard only diamond could scratch it. For a phone to run a full desktop OS, it must have the raw power of a PC. We’ll choose the fastest available multi-core processor, at least 16GB of RAM and a massive 500GB of storage. The battery will use silicon-anode technology, so we can squeeze more energy into the same dimensions.</p>
<p> With that kind of muscle, this phone can be your main PC anywhere -- and we really do mean anywhere. You can use the desktop wherever you can find a standard HDMI screen, and the dual-LTE chip will get you online with 4G even when you’re travelling abroad. It’s desktop computing gone truly mobile.</p>
<h2>The OS Software</h2>
<p>The Next-generation hardware deserves innovative software. The Ubuntu Z8 will dual-boot both the Ubuntu phone OS and Android, and convert into a fully integrated Ubuntu desktop PC.</p>

With the initial seed funding from family and friends we have done the research and development of this product. We now plan to sell 500+ units of our hardware units to get much needed traction for our startup. This will help us gain user base, continue our excitement for developing next version and also to spread the word.
This amount will be spent on following tasks

Procure 500+ units and ship to users who pledged
Do online marketing and advertising to reach wider audience.
Start research on next version
Move into a better office as we currently operate from a residential apartment

<h3>The Blade Protector- An Impact Protection Device</h3>We set out to
make a product that protects the teeth of all electric and manual hair cutting
clipper blades. The purpose of this product was to give clipper
owners a sense of security while traveling with and storing their clippers. While
transporting, clipper owners usually wrap their clippers in either the power
cord itself, or some sort of soft cloth material.  The idea was simple; a quality, protective clipper guard. The Blade Protector attaches to the
still blade and protects the cutting blade. The Blade Protector device prevents damage to the teeth of
the blade which could possibly be caused by impact from another object. 
Along with the shock
absorbent fins, the blade protector utilizes a magnetic hold, whereas the guard
attaches securely onto the upper portion of the stationary blade. </div><div>
<p>When storing
clippers in moist areas, the protector assist in repelling moisture from the teeth and most
of the stationary and cutting blade, which helps to prevent rust and other water related
damage(s).  This will extend the life
expectancy of each individual blade.</p>

</div><div> <p></p>
The Blade Protector provides
real time protection where an operator can attach the device to a clipper blade
while in use, not in use, in transport and or storage. Clipper operators tend to drop their clippers
very often. The Blade Protector absorbs impact of the clipper blade and the
ground, offering shock absorbent fins with a hard plastic outer shell and soft interior
material that extend outwards from the clipper. This allows the Blade Protector
to serve as an impact protection device if the hair cutting blade has first contact
with the floor or another object.  </div><div>The greatest impact of the device is that it is universal and the first of its kind. The Blade Protector is currently Patent Pending. </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>

<div>
<div>
<p>The development of the Blade Protector is nearly complete. Clipper Companies are reinventing hair clippers and blades everyday. We want to remain the forefront in clipper blade protection.  Our ultimate goal is to partner with every clipper company and offer a protector for every clipper blade made to date.  Once we reach our funding goal we intend on improving the material of the device to offer more protection and also offer the protectors in different colors.</p>

<p><b style=""color:#006fd1;"">I know nothing about encryption. Do I need to learn?</b></p>
<p>No. Just use email as you normally do. EasyCrypt will manage encryption  transparently. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">If you want to learn more, see our </span><a href=""https://easycrypt.co/blog/email-privacy-crash-course-part-1-introduction/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: #0000EE;"" target=""_blank"">Email Privacy Crash Course</a><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b style=""color:#006fd1;"">Can I and my correspondents use different email services? </b></p>
<p>Yes. You and the people communicating with you can continue to use the email services and addresses that you are are already using. This is a major advantage of EasyCrypt.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;color: #006fd1;"">Can I send encrypted messages to people who do not subscribe to EasyCrypt?</b></p>
<p>Yes. They will be able to read and reply to your messages in browser, using a password that you supply to them.</p>
<p><b style=""color:#006fd1;"">Will you disclose my email data or metadata under subpoena?</b></p>
<p>We are technically unable to do so.</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;color: #006fd1;"">I plan to use Gmail to communicate with other EasyCrypt subscribers. What will Google learn by inspecting my mailbox?</b></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Google will learn <i>when </i>the emails were sent to or from you, and their <i>size</i>. Nothing else.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;color:#006fd1;"">Nothing? No names, no email addresses, no contents, no subject, no IP addresses, no personal metadata</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">?</span></p>
<p>Correct, none of those. Your email address will be shown, but since it is <i>your </i>mailbox that is being inspected, there will be no new information in this.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b style=""color:#006fd1;"">My perk includes a USB security key. How does it work?</b></p>
<p>The key adds another layer of protection to your EasyCrypt account. Your account will not be accessible without the key, even if your password is stolen. The same key will secure also your Gmail and Dropbox accounts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b style=""color:#006fd1;"">Will EasyCrypt be free?</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Initially EasyCrypt will be available only to our Indiegogo backers. After we release it for other users, EasyCrypt will always have a free plan. Paid plans will  provide unlimited anonymous messages and advanced features (such as multiple email accounts and time-limited messages).</p>

</div></div>","FR| PT| ES| Русский| Türkçe| فارسی| EasyCrypt will protect privacy of your email while allowing you to use email as usual. Google and other email providers will not be able to scan your mail; overreaching governments and spy agencies will no longer  be able to surveil it; hackers will not be able to read it even if they break into your email account.   


EasyCrypt is the first email privacy service that provides end-to-end encryption, anonymity and metadata protection at your existing email address. Using EasyCrypt is super easy - just use email like you normally do.

 
 
 
 

 
 

Use EasyCrypt as Webmail and/or as app on your mobile device
 


Send and receive email as usual, from your existing email address, using mobile devices, Webmail or Outlook. Privacy protection is performed transparently in the background.
 Your messages will be encrypted on your device and decrypted only on the device of the recipient. Nobody will be able to read your messages except you and your correspondents. 
 EasyCrypt encrypts also the information about you and your messages, such as your IP address, email address, message subject, etc. Nosy email service operators and spy agencies will no longer be able to see your metadata. Nobody will. 
""Metadata is extraordinarily intrusive. As an analyst, I would prefer to be looking at metadata than looking at content, because it's quicker and easier, and it doesn't lie.""  Edward Snowden
 
 

 You  can choose to communicate under email  pseudonyms, so that nobody will know that you are the author of your messages or learn your email address.
Emails exchanged between you and other EasyCrypt subscribers will be protected, no matter what email services you and they are using. You can exchange encrypted messages even with people who do not subscribe to EasyCrypt.
 Your messages will be stored by your regular email service provider while being fully protected from its prying eyes. You can use a big and stable provider - no need to worry about it going out of business and taking your emails with it. 
 


We are technically unable to access your messages or metadata, let alone disclose them to a 3rd party.  Do not take our word for it. Source code of EasyCrypt will be published, allowing verification of our ""zero knowledge"" claims. Moreover, our service will operate under the strictly privacy-protecting jurisdiction of Switzerland.


 

 
 

Existing email encryption services have serious limitations. Most of them require use of a dedicated email address. Others let you communicate securely only with subscribers of the same service or charge exorbitant fees for email storage.
Moreover, other email privacy solutions do not protect your metadata, including your IP address, the subject of your messages and your email address, and do not support real anonymity.
EasyCrypt is unique in overcoming all of these limitations and creating perfect email privacy.      
 
 
EasyCrypt compared to other solutions*
 



* See our Email Privacy Crash Course to learn more.
 

 

EasyCrypt extends the OpenPGP encryption standard while closing its main privacy loopholes: lack of protection of user identity and metadata. EasyCrypt's innovative integration with Tor network (aka ""Deep Web"") allows it to achieve sender anonymity and metadata protection. EasyCrypt can read neither the content nor metadata of your encrypted messages, and  cannot identify you as the author of your messages.
 
 

 

We are a team of passionate technologists and privacy enthusiasts. We embarked on a mission to empower people to defend themselves against overreaching government surveillance and predatory invasion of privacy by Internet giants. We use advanced cryptographic technologies but focus on ease-of-use by ordinary email users. 
We have spent a year and a half developing the EasyCrypt concept, architecture and algorithms. Initially we developed and tested several proof-of-concept prototypes. This was followed by development of internal beta versions of EasyCrypt Webmail and Android app.
 
 

 



 
 

So far we financed EasyCrypt research and development from our personal savings and through our own hard work. Reaching our goal of $100,000 will allow us to accelerate the development and launch the EasyCrypt service with Webmail and Android app. Due to ease of use, openness and future availability of a free plan, we expect EasyCrypt to  go viral and become even more valuable to users due to the ""network effect"".  
We need you on board not just as a backer but as an active participant, providing us with valuable feedback and influencing features and product plans. We need you to help us to implement our vision of empowering people to get their privacy back. 
Please share the campaign using the buttons below, and invite your friends to join you in backing and using EasyCrypt! 
  

 
 

We are committed to pushing the limits in helping people to protect their digital privacy, not only for email. Our next major goal is to integrate support of cryptocurrency payment privacy in EasyCrypt. Here are our stretch goals for this campaign:
 

 


 
 

 
(Scroll up to see detailed perk descriptions)
 

 

 
 

 

I know nothing about encryption. Do I need to learn?
No. Just use email as you normally do. EasyCrypt will manage encryption  transparently. If you want to learn more, see our Email Privacy Crash Course.
 
Can I and my correspondents use different email services? 
Yes. You and the people communicating with you can continue to use the email services and addresses that you are are already using. This is a major advantage of EasyCrypt.
 
Can I send encrypted messages to people who do not subscribe to EasyCrypt?
Yes. They will be able to read and reply to your messages in browser, using a password that you supply to them.
Will you disclose my email data or metadata under subpoena?
We are technically unable to do so.
I plan to use Gmail to communicate with other EasyCrypt subscribers. What will Google learn by inspecting my mailbox?


Google will learn when the emails were sent to or from you, and their size. Nothing else.
 
Nothing? No names, no email addresses, no contents, no subject, no IP addresses, no personal metadata?
Correct, none of those. Your email address will be shown, but since it is your mailbox that is being inspected, there will be no new information in this.
 
My perk includes a USB security key. How does it work?
The key adds another layer of protection to your EasyCrypt account. Your account will not be accessible without the key, even if your password is stolen. The same key will secure also your Gmail and Dropbox accounts.
 
Will EasyCrypt be free?
 
Initially EasyCrypt will be available only to our Indiegogo backers. After we release it for other users, EasyCrypt will always have a free plan. Paid plans will  provide unlimited anonymous messages and advanced features (such as multiple email accounts and time-limited messages).
 
Can I communicate securely with hardcore PGP users?
Yes, easily. See the FAQ on our website for details. 
 
Can I access my encrypted messages without using EasyCrypt?
Yes. You can export your  keys and access your email directly at your email account, using any 3rd party PGP client. 
 
Can I use Tor browser to access EasyCrypt webmail? 
Yes.
Will EasyCrypt be released in open source?
Yes.
Where can I get more information and ask questions?
Please visit How it works and FAQ pages on our website. You can also read our Email Privacy Crash Course or email us at support@easycrypt.co. You can also post comments above. We love user questions!
Can I contribute in Bitcoin?
Of course! Our bitcoin address is N3pvQwNbQmt3rnAUqp8CaegW76HCJ4qnu. Please email us at indiegogo@easycrypt.co with the details, so we can give you a perk. You can also contribute using PayPal or credit card.

<p><b>The Peeple App changes the way people learn about each other online. </b></p>
<p><b>Yelp for People. <br/></b></p>
<p>You may of heard about us last October 2015 when our app concept was exposed to the world and went global and viral in 24 hours...a trending topic on all social media and thousands of articles written about us. We have come a long way since then. We have successfully launched our iOS app on March 7, 2016 in Canada and the US with huge success of over 18,500 users in the first month. <br/></p>
<p>We gave the people what they wanted and made 4 major changes to the app before we launched: <br/></p>
<p><b>1. Full control over your profile</b></p>
<p><b>2. Ability to deactivate your account</b></p>
<p><b>3. No 5 star rating system just a Peeple Number that is the total number of recommendations you have received. <br/></b></p>
<p><b>4. No one can start your profile</b></p>

<p></p>
<div>
<p>Years
 ago, Nicole set out to change the way people can learn about each other
 online. She knew the value of a referral and then it struck her – why 
is there nothing that provides recommendations and commentary on aspects
 that truly matter to us?</p>
<p>Teaming up with her best friend Julia, the two innovative women set 
out to change the way people can learn about each other online. The 
Peeple app allows you to better choose who you hire, do business with, 
date, become your neighbours, roommates, landlords/tenants, and watch, 
teach, and care for your children. There are endless reasons as to why 
we would want this reference check for the people around us.</p>
<p>Looking at everyone in the three ways you could possibly know someone
 – personally, professionally and romantically – you can provide a 
recommendation on everyone you come in contact with, while allowing 
yourself to be recommended.</p>
<p>Once armed with these recommendations you can turn them into your new
 form of currency to get better job opportunities, better dates, growing
 relationships, and networking opportunities. The online social media 
space was lacking a safe place to manage your online reputation.</p>
<p>We are confident that with Peeple you deserve to have it all!</p>
<p>Help us build Android and launch by August 2015.</p>

</div>","The Peeple App changes the way people learn about each other online. 
Yelp for People. 
You may of heard about us last October 2015 when our app concept was exposed to the world and went global and viral in 24 hours...a trending topic on all social media and thousands of articles written about us. We have come a long way since then. We have successfully launched our iOS app on March 7, 2016 in Canada and the US with huge success of over 18,500 users in the first month. 
We gave the people what they wanted and made 4 major changes to the app before we launched: 
1. Full control over your profile
2. Ability to deactivate your account
3. No 5 star rating system just a Peeple Number that is the total number of recommendations you have received. 
4. No one can start your profile
Our Story


Years
 ago, Nicole set out to change the way people can learn about each other
 online. She knew the value of a referral and then it struck her – why 
is there nothing that provides recommendations and commentary on aspects
 that truly matter to us?
Teaming up with her best friend Julia, the two innovative women set 
out to change the way people can learn about each other online. The 
Peeple app allows you to better choose who you hire, do business with, 
date, become your neighbours, roommates, landlords/tenants, and watch, 
teach, and care for your children. There are endless reasons as to why 
we would want this reference check for the people around us.
Looking at everyone in the three ways you could possibly know someone
 – personally, professionally and romantically – you can provide a 
recommendation on everyone you come in contact with, while allowing 
yourself to be recommended.
Once armed with these recommendations you can turn them into your new
 form of currency to get better job opportunities, better dates, growing
 relationships, and networking opportunities. The online social media 
space was lacking a safe place to manage your online reputation.
We are confident that with Peeple you deserve to have it all!
Help us build Android and launch by August 2015.

Let’s collaborate to build the Peeple Android App and use social currency to help you get more of what you want in life!



Where will your money go?


5% will go to Indiegogo
3% - 5% will go to PayPal
90% will go to our development team partners to build this app for ANDROID!


When will the app be available?

* Development will start May 2016 and will continue as we raise the money. 





$100,000 CDN will allow us to create an app for ANDROID (August 2016) and anything additional will significantly speed up our development process and allow us to add even more features. 

The faster we achieve or surpass this goal, the greater possibilities we have to get funding from other sources and investors.

<p>Exploded Diagram to show how easy this Product can be mass manufactured. This design only has 5 components, excluding the battery and internal microchips, this makes mass manufacture particularly easy, considering that the most complex materials can be easily formed and prefabricated as shown bellow. This takes away a plethora of risks commonly associated with most crowed funded projects. I personally have see many projects with a very well thought out design but no feasible means of manufacture. We make everything easier here at MTS.</p>

<p>Seamless Open/Close mechanism, air tight security, long lasting design. How many times have you heard a loud SCREECH, when it comes to opening your door? Not with this lock, we gave the design a good amount of tolerance whist also keeping the connection air tight and secure (Not 100% air tight). We were able to accomplish this through having a tolerance of less than 1/32nd of a millimeter between connections.</p>

<p><strong>Colour Works -</strong> a great new way to decorate your door. <i>(Reece Mitchell Colour Works Developer)</i></p>
<p>Colour works is a project set to change the way we look at door locks, we often see them as clutter, something that usually acts as an eye sore on our doors, that's why we produced color works, an application that can change the color of the led on your lock, perhaps you may want this to link different colours to rooms they represent, or just perhaps the aesthetic qualities that it serves.</p>

<p>Software is still currently in development, how ever it will be finished upon completion of this project. This software will enable you to control every door lock in your home remotely from your phone, or from your tablet, this can be operated from any where in the world, just as long as your lock has a viable means of power (1xAAA Battery). Its a revolutionary new way to lock up your home from afar. <strong>Forget to lock the front door? No worries.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Don't worry! </strong>you're in safe hands with us! Unlike most ""smart locks"" ours will shut down the network and trap the intruder, it will also send a message to the correct authorities (police) so everything is taken care of and nothing valuable is taken. With many locks you may not know for days whether someone has actually been inside your home, if you happen to be away. This is a very common problem and one we have believed to have fixed. <strong>This feature could mean the difference between life or death quite literally! </strong>So don't waste your hard earned money on some cast aluminum Swiss army knife, that you have to bore a massive hole through your door to install. With our easy insulation (very friendly for people renting their properties) you won't have to worry about a thing. After all would you rather rest the protection of your home and family on a cheaply manufactured and expensive aluminum gadget, or a solid titanium alloy enclosure, a material heavily trusted by NASA and other military agencies and institutions? <strong>You do the math.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Titanium Alloy - </strong>We need this material to keep the locks at a small size, but keep the level of strength very high.

<p>There are many risks and challenges of creating a product so complicated, one of the biggest risks we are currently considering is difficulty to manufacture on a large scale, we need skilled workers and a very (progressed) manufacturer to produce our product. Our product is of a higher quality and higher advancement of anything else on the market, and mass production will be expensive. But it will be worth it to deliver you the best product possible. The second risk is that it may not function as expected, never the less a small re-design or tweak may fix that, we are working around the clock to constantly improve our products. Nothing is going to get in our way, we are diligent, organized and ready for anything. The third and final risk, is that it may not become a popular product. Never the less we will still continue to make our product popular though our marketing campaigns e.c.t.</p>

<p><strong>Frequently asked questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q:Will it work with any device?</strong></p>
<p>A:Our short answer is yes it will work with any device, so long as your device operates on iOS or Android, and your locks have power. You'll also need WIFI for this feature.</p>
<p><strong>Q:Is it water proof?</strong></p>
<p>A:To a degree, though this isn't a very planed feature of ours. Our locks are only designed for <u>indoor use only</u> so we found water proofing to be pointless and drive the cost up for the consumer, which is never a good thing. </p>
<p><strong>Q:Do you need WIFI to operate it?</strong></p>
<p>A:No you do not need WIFI, however if you wish to connect locks to a network and have them all function a certain way, then you will need a WIFI connect. If you just want to use it as a simple every day lock with no app-connect and all the 'fancy' software upgrades you may. I too prefer things to be kept simple.</p>
<p><strong>Q:Do you need a iOS or Android device to operate it?</strong></p>
<p>A:No the lock can function as a normal lock and you can open it with our key-fob, though if you intend to operate the lock with a phone, it may come in handy to have one.</p>
<p><strong>Q:How much force does it need to take before it alerts authorities? </strong></p>
<p>A:It will take around 1000lbs of impact force before it sends a distress signal, the force is about that of a sledge hammer, but believe me, the lock can survive it. The idea behind it being 1000lbs of force, is for the door to shatter, showing heavily signs that the door is being literally forced open. This way you won't get a scare from the police simply by just knocking in to it, punching the lock won't make it go off either.</p>

We are Market Trading Solutions™ (Engineering Works) We are a very small yet well organized. we come from Telford, England. We currently have a team of four, all of us have years of experiences in varying fields. two of us have heavy CAD/manufacture and design backgrounds, while one of us has a very deep history in business and marketing. We have existed for around one year, not very long by industry standards, though what we have done in that time is fairly substantial. We have a very bright future ahead of us, but we need your help to get there.
""No one is truly self made"" - Gary Keller (From New York Times best seller 'The One Thing')



We spend more time drawing, designing and re-designing, than any other company out there. Why? We do it because we care about the quality that we deliver to our customers. if you scroll down you can learn more about our major project.



Development Work -  Some images showing our true to life renderings. Here's a simple fly by view, enjoy the rest! This took us some time.


Exploded Diagram to show how easy this Product can be mass manufactured. This design only has 5 components, excluding the battery and internal microchips, this makes mass manufacture particularly easy, considering that the most complex materials can be easily formed and prefabricated as shown bellow. This takes away a plethora of risks commonly associated with most crowed funded projects. I personally have see many projects with a very well thought out design but no feasible means of manufacture. We make everything easier here at MTS.


Seamless Open/Close mechanism, air tight security, long lasting design. How many times have you heard a loud SCREECH, when it comes to opening your door? Not with this lock, we gave the design a good amount of tolerance whist also keeping the connection air tight and secure (Not 100% air tight). We were able to accomplish this through having a tolerance of less than 1/32nd of a millimeter between connections.








Colour Works - a great new way to decorate your door. (Reece Mitchell Colour Works Developer)
Colour works is a project set to change the way we look at door locks, we often see them as clutter, something that usually acts as an eye sore on our doors, that's why we produced color works, an application that can change the color of the led on your lock, perhaps you may want this to link different colours to rooms they represent, or just perhaps the aesthetic qualities that it serves.

How does the colour system work? - Have a look for your self bellow

Lets take a look at the app? The app for color works will have an interface similar to that of Photoshop, you will have a wide selection of millions of colours that you can precisely tweak to your liking.


Ambient Light Sensor - A very efficient method to save power. (Jay Hanna Ambient Light Sensor Developer)
The ambient Light Sensor is more so an idea developed for young children who have trouble sleeping at night, as appose to smart adults who may see this feature as a waste of battery power. This feature can be turned On/Off via the app.

Day Time LED Effect - During the day time, the ambient light sensor detects light in the room and tones down, or switches off the LED depending of how bright the area surrounding the lock becomes.

Night Time LED Effect - During the night time the ambient light sensor is Frequently active due to the low lighting in the room at night.


Key-less Entry - A brilliant new way to keep your home safe without the hassle of keys. (Kevin Smith Key-less Entry Developer)
Software is still currently in development, how ever it will be finished upon completion of this project. This software will enable you to control every door lock in your home remotely from your phone, or from your tablet, this can be operated from any where in the world, just as long as your lock has a viable means of power (1xAAA Battery). Its a revolutionary new way to lock up your home from afar. Forget to lock the front door? No worries.


(Reece Mitchell Developer)
Don't worry! you're in safe hands with us! Unlike most ""smart locks"" ours will shut down the network and trap the intruder, it will also send a message to the correct authorities (police) so everything is taken care of and nothing valuable is taken. With many locks you may not know for days whether someone has actually been inside your home, if you happen to be away. This is a very common problem and one we have believed to have fixed. This feature could mean the difference between life or death quite literally! So don't waste your hard earned money on some cast aluminum Swiss army knife, that you have to bore a massive hole through your door to install. With our easy insulation (very friendly for people renting their properties) you won't have to worry about a thing. After all would you rather rest the protection of your home and family on a cheaply manufactured and expensive aluminum gadget, or a solid titanium alloy enclosure, a material heavily trusted by NASA and other military agencies and institutions? You do the math.







Our App is currently under construction, we are working tirelessly to get everything right, we don't want to miss a detail or a design flaw that may hinder the security of our users.

For such a premium product we want to offer you the best with out asking for a premium price. We've done this by cutting down our net earning on each unit to approximately £3 per unit. We feel at Market Trading Solutions™ (Engineering Works) that everyone deserves to best quality for the best price, we will be one of the few groups that plans makes less then 10% ROI every sale. Security is everything when it comes to running a home, so we chose the most versatile materials on the planet to help keep you, your family and your possessions safe.

Titanium Alloy - We need this material to keep the locks at a small size, but keep the level of strength very high. This material is costly, but our customers deserve to be kept safe. (Fun fact: NASA uses Titanium Alloy on the ISS because of its incredible strength to weight ratio!)

Poly-carbonate - This material is one of the strongest polymers known to man, along with ABS, though this material is also costly we believe that this is the best to secure the delicate housing of fragile components.

Neodymium - This material is highly magnetic and helps to keep a strong forceful grip on any object that emits its apposing pole. We believe by study and practice that this material is best to help secure the emergency lock ins and connectors between both parts of the locking mechanism

Copper - This material is probably one of the best electrical conductors, bedsides gold, when it comes to directing electricity, we believe that this works magnetically too, when a electrical charge is run through it.



We can't offer much, but we will do our best to give you value for money! We appreciate every £ that comes our way! But we do offer rewards for those looking to go above and beyond to help our project see the light of day! Thank you all of you for your help and support!

What if I could make this item a cool wedding gift for the guests?” Franko searched on the market for days after, but nothing comes close to his high expectation in terms of quality. Thus he decided to make his own.</p><p>He first approached his friend from a long time back, Kelvin (Co-Founder), because he knew Kelvin has a plastic moulding business and his design experience would be invaluable. Over the next few months and after two prototypes, a final design is completed.  Then, they took it to a trade show to test the waters.</p><p>To Franko’s pleasant surprise, the trade show was a tremendous hit. Many people inquired about the product.

What if I could make this item a cool wedding gift for the guests?” Franko searched on the market for days after, but nothing comes close to his high expectation in terms of quality. Thus he decided to make his own.He first approached his friend from a long time back, Kelvin (Co-Founder), because he knew Kelvin has a plastic moulding business and his design experience would be invaluable. Over the next few months and after two prototypes, a final design is completed.  Then, they took it to a trade show to test the waters.To Franko’s pleasant surprise, the trade show was a tremendous hit. Many people inquired about the product.

Night Mode ThemeHey I was just using your app and I thought of a possible addition. Having a dark and amoled theme would be really cool (and good for the eyes).The night mode would be amazing, and of course so would a normal dark theme option. 


Bigger User ImageI would like to be able to click onto people's profile pics and see a bigger version of their picture. Actually, my main request would be to be able to click on the profile picture and have a large one appear in the app. Sometimes I'm like'oh what's that in the picture?' and it's a bit of a pain to have to open it through the twitter client.

<p>We
attempt to create a device that integrate daily joy and satisfyingly function.
This functional keyboard could heal your inner and mood. Meanwhile, we want to reproduce the typing feel of Alps keyswitches used in
some of most legendary keyboards from the last century as well. <br/></p>

<p>Our idea was
inspired in a keyboard fans meeting. After numerous tests
and discussions, we brought our prototype to a select group of experts who dedicated
in keyboard industry for more than 30 years. We shared different ideas and
discussed feedbacks, which drive the necessary change to perfection. <br/></p>

</span>Joy and Fun: Lego and Detachably Decorating Plates</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The toys, even games, have changed dramatically and very
different from the toys we played 30 years ago. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Comparing the modern offerings,
the previous toys seem almost primitive. It is true that technology has changed
the way we play. Innovated toys might seem to be altering human behavior at lightning
speed. However, if we take a closer look and really examine the toys and games we
are playing with, we’ll discover that although the items for playing have changed,
the principles behind playing remain the same.If we look at the popularity of Minecraft or other similar
games, we could easily find that underpinning game is very helpful for creativity
(i.e., people could design everything on their own). Therefore, we designed the
plate that users could create their unique keyboards by Lego bricks. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.cool3c.com/files/media/1/3/2/4/6/3/4/3/1/1/13246343_1146304582057757_2732653445818575227_o_01.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>OK. Some might wonder why we use the concept of Lego. Here
are the reasons.

</p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Simple</span>
</li></ul>
<p>It's one of the things that
almost anyone can do just because it's such a simple concept. Putting the
bricks together and create something on your own. The creation could
be very complicated, or simple enough. It's all on your terms. You decide if
you want to make a small table or the empire state building. All you need if
the imagination.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464505265/a_lego_keyboard_014_aadntt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Ageless</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>Basically,
Lego is a toy indeed. But even adult could play these toys. The process makes
people happy and relax. Don’t forget Lego has stood more than 60 years. Lego is
very adaptable by your inner no matter how old are you.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464505297/_yea0311_djf9ay.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Creativity</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>With
different pieces, Lego could release your imaginative mind and you create
everything you want. There are so many possibilities and the wide range is so broad
that there is still so much more that can be done. Meanwhile, when you design
your own items, it gives you the right to manage everything with it. Do it on
your own way and that where the creativity begins. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464505331/13275301_1146361458718736_1054035381_o_fji5ze.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Fun</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<p>It
is fun to play Lego because your imagination lies in your hands. Lego is a lot more than a
toy. It’s a creative expression. A lot of people, even adults, hugely engaged
with it. With Lego you can make the most amazing things — things you’d never
imagine. Furthermore, these colorful bricks could be disassembled in the end of
a day and you could start a new design next time. As long as you have a
creative imagination (and childishness!), you will have infinite joy. </p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p>Lego pieces of all varieties constitute a universal system. We
designed a plate based on this universal system so that people could build
bricks on their keyboards.</p>

No problem! We also designed detachable top plates. You could choose the one you love and just change it. Depending
on the purpose of your nameplate, this can be as simple as one color printed plastic or
it can be as complex as building something with Lego.<p></p>

</span>The Renascent Legend: Alps</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mechanical
keyboard fans rejoice. We spent a lot of time make a step closer to make a legend switch
reborn of our keyboard. Alps is a Japanese company and
brand that well known in the keyboard community primarily for the Alps
SKCL/SKCM series (Originally made by Alps) of mechanical keyswitches. These
switches have stopped production for a long time ago, but Alps clone switches
are still manufactured by many other manufacturers. Here is the whole story of
how we reach the disappeared legend switch.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul><li>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;background-color: initial;"">History of Alps switches</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.cool3c.com/files/media/a/l/p/s/s/a/m/p/l/e/alpssample.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With perhaps the
most complex background and story of any switch type, Alps switches are much
more difficult to categorize than most other mechanical switches. Alps Company
has been out of business for years, and the Alps name is now used out of
convenience to denote the stem type found on the switch. According to the data and products we could find, Alps
switches could be sorted as below:</p>
<p><b>Alps
SKCL/SKCM series</b></p>
<p>Commonly referred to as complicated Alps,Alps Bigfoot, and Alps CM due to its complicated design. First introduced as early
as 1983,the Alps SKCL/SKCM series
has been one of the first commonly available, compact-design keyboard switches.
This series probably was the most common type of Alps switches used in computer keyboards
when desktop computer from 1985 to 1990. Over the years there have been many
variants of the keyswitches, including changes in color and design. Early
variants of the Alps switch did not carry the Alps logo on the top part of the
case, and only had it stamped in on the switch bottom.</p>
<p><b>Alps
SKBL/SKBM series</b></p>
<p>Commonly known assimplified
Alpsdue to its
reduced part count overAlps
SKCL/SKCM series. This series of switches appeared to have been manufactured byForward Electronicsin Taiwan around 1999. In
2000, Alps ended up the 30-years long joint venture with Forward Electronic.
From this point onward, this series has no relationship with Alps. This also
led to the switches refereed to “Fukka” or “Fuhua Alps” that are misreading Taiwanese
name.</p>
<p><b>Alps clone</b></p>

</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.cool3c.com/files/media/0/i/m/g/0/5/0img_05.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>This series refers
to a keyboard switch not made by Alps<span> but interchangeable with
SKCL/SKCM series and SKCL/SKCM
series switches. </span>Because many
switches are very similar to Alps SKCL/SKCM and SKBL/SKBM series switches, and
because earlier SKCL/SKCM switches were not visibly brand mark, it became
common to mistake a wide variety of switches for being ""Alps""
switches. </p>
<p>Because of historic background and reasons,
we would like to highlight the following factors.</p>
<p>1.<span> 
</span>Since Alps is out of switches
business for years, a lot of keyboard players are very familiar with ALPS switches
but consider ALPS switches entry level products. This opinion is somewhat
correct because the current Alps switches are not Alps original design. The
different design leads the typing feeling changed and this feeling is hard to
describe by words. </p>
<p>2.<span> 
</span>Before the membrane keyboard
debuted, mechanical keyboard was the primary choice of input equipment. Alps
also dominated the switches market many years. At that time, Cherry focused on
niche market and became current market dominator in switch market.</p>3. The
purpose of Alps switches categories is to sort out different types of Alps
switches. It doesn’t mean that one type is definitely better than another.<br/> </div><div>

<span style=""font-weight: bold;background-color: initial;"">Development
and reproduce the feeling of Alps</span><p></p>
</li></ul></div><div>
<p>Switches are the soul of a keyboard. Good switches should have a bright, crisp feeling, with a slightly tactile feedback that
tells you when the press has registered just half way through the key travel.
That’s totally different from a membrane keyboard, where you have to press the
key down to the bottom. <span>When typing
on a keyboard you actually felt good respond and feedback. You'd press a key
and you could feel a nice, satisfying, mechanical click. When talking about the
feeling, it’s very subjective. We usually use following criteria to describe
the feeling.</span></p>
<p>1. Tactile</p>
<p>Some switches have clearly
tactile feedback while some are not. A strong tactile feedback makes the pressing
process have two phases. Comparing the linear switches, tactile switches make
typist clearly and definitely feel the whole process of typing. </p>
<p>2. Clicky</p>
<p>Yes. It’s the noise that
made from typing. Due to the mechanical design, some mechanical keyboards have
noisy reputation. The typing sound may be a problem if you work in an office. But
some typist love these rhythmic clatters cause it helps typist in a good typing
pace. </p>
<p>3. Force</p>
<p>The force means actuation
force. Some switches need more actuation force than other switches. That gives
typists totally different feeling. </p>
<p>4. Travel Distance</p>
<p>Travel distance means the
typing distance that actually detonates by contact. Mechanical keyboards
usually have longer travel distance than that on membrane keyboards. </p>
We
visited many enthusiastic keyboard experts and borrowed several legendary
keyboards that used Alps switches. It takes almost 2 years and countless modifications to meet our criteria.
Since mechanical keyboards use separate complete switches underneath every key,
each switch is composed of a base, a spring, and a stem. Depending on the shape
of the stem, such keyboards have varying actuation and travel distance. Switches
also come in three variants, linear with consistent resistance, and tactile
with a non-audible bump or with an audible click. Meanwhile, depending on the
resistance of the spring, the key requires different amounts of pressure to
actuate. Mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps.
Finally, we have made four different keyswitches.<br/>

<p>The blue switch provides
clear tactile and clicky feedback. The tactile force is 60g and the operating
force is 35g. The design of blue switch is for a typical mechanical keyboard.

<p></p>
<p>The
red switch is virtually identical to the blue switch except for the absence of the
“tactile peak.” There is a consistent force throughout the full stroke of the
key so there is no tactile feedback unless the switch bottoms out. That is the
reason why we called it linear feeling. Some people prefer the switches with linear
feeling due to their “smoother” feel. Since there is no peak or tactile force,
the total effort required to reach the activation force of 40 g is slightly
less than with the tactile (blue and brown) switch.</p>

<p>We take geek switch as
an advanced linear switch. While the total effort required to reach the activation force on
red switch is 40g, the effort on geek switch is 28g. The feedback is so special
and polarizes people into two extremes: love it or not. That’s also the reason
why keyboard fans called light linear switch “geek switch”.</p>

i-Rocks Fun Keyboard Project Goals

1.  Fun with Lego bricks
2.  Changeable decorating plates
3. 
Reproduce the satisfyingly tactile with
a delightfully clicky feel of Alps tradition



We
attempt to create a device that integrate daily joy and satisfyingly function.
This functional keyboard could heal your inner and mood. Meanwhile, we want to reproduce the typing feel of Alps keyswitches used in
some of most legendary keyboards from the last century as well. 


Our idea was
inspired in a keyboard fans meeting. After numerous tests
and discussions, we brought our prototype to a select group of experts who dedicated
in keyboard industry for more than 30 years. We shared different ideas and
discussed feedbacks, which drive the necessary change to perfection. 


When
the product is ready for production, we ensure that each step of manufacturing
is handled with attention to detail but most importantly quality. This
ultimate keyboard is a joint of joy, fun, and a renascent legend.

What Makes i-Rocks Fun a Wonderful Keyboard
 


1. 
Joy and Fun: Lego and Detachably Decorating Plates

The toys, even games, have changed dramatically and very
different from the toys we played 30 years ago. 

Comparing the modern offerings,
the previous toys seem almost primitive. It is true that technology has changed
the way we play. Innovated toys might seem to be altering human behavior at lightning
speed. However, if we take a closer look and really examine the toys and games we
are playing with, we’ll discover that although the items for playing have changed,
the principles behind playing remain the same.If we look at the popularity of Minecraft or other similar
games, we could easily find that underpinning game is very helpful for creativity
(i.e., people could design everything on their own). Therefore, we designed the
plate that users could create their unique keyboards by Lego bricks. 


OK. Some might wonder why we use the concept of Lego. Here
are the reasons.




Simple

It's one of the things that
almost anyone can do just because it's such a simple concept. Putting the
bricks together and create something on your own. The creation could
be very complicated, or simple enough. It's all on your terms. You decide if
you want to make a small table or the empire state building. All you need if
the imagination.




Ageless

Basically,
Lego is a toy indeed. But even adult could play these toys. The process makes
people happy and relax. Don’t forget Lego has stood more than 60 years. Lego is
very adaptable by your inner no matter how old are you.




Creativity

With
different pieces, Lego could release your imaginative mind and you create
everything you want. There are so many possibilities and the wide range is so broad
that there is still so much more that can be done. Meanwhile, when you design
your own items, it gives you the right to manage everything with it. Do it on
your own way and that where the creativity begins. 




Fun

It
is fun to play Lego because your imagination lies in your hands. Lego is a lot more than a
toy. It’s a creative expression. A lot of people, even adults, hugely engaged
with it. With Lego you can make the most amazing things — things you’d never
imagine. Furthermore, these colorful bricks could be disassembled in the end of
a day and you could start a new design next time. As long as you have a
creative imagination (and childishness!), you will have infinite joy. 



Lego pieces of all varieties constitute a universal system. We
designed a plate based on this universal system so that people could build
bricks on their keyboards.


Not in the mood for playing? No problem! We also designed detachable top plates. You could choose the one you love and just change it. Depending
on the purpose of your nameplate, this can be as simple as one color printed plastic or
it can be as complex as building something with Lego.


2. 
The Renascent Legend: Alps

Mechanical
keyboard fans rejoice. We spent a lot of time make a step closer to make a legend switch
reborn of our keyboard. Alps is a Japanese company and
brand that well known in the keyboard community primarily for the Alps
SKCL/SKCM series (Originally made by Alps) of mechanical keyswitches. These
switches have stopped production for a long time ago, but Alps clone switches
are still manufactured by many other manufacturers. Here is the whole story of
how we reach the disappeared legend switch.


History of Alps switches


With perhaps the
most complex background and story of any switch type, Alps switches are much
more difficult to categorize than most other mechanical switches. Alps Company
has been out of business for years, and the Alps name is now used out of
convenience to denote the stem type found on the switch. According to the data and products we could find, Alps
switches could be sorted as below:
Alps
SKCL/SKCM series
Commonly referred to as complicated Alps,Alps Bigfoot, and Alps CM due to its complicated design. First introduced as early
as 1983,the Alps SKCL/SKCM series
has been one of the first commonly available, compact-design keyboard switches.
This series probably was the most common type of Alps switches used in computer keyboards
when desktop computer from 1985 to 1990. Over the years there have been many
variants of the keyswitches, including changes in color and design. Early
variants of the Alps switch did not carry the Alps logo on the top part of the
case, and only had it stamped in on the switch bottom.
Alps
SKBL/SKBM series
Commonly known assimplified
Alpsdue to its
reduced part count overAlps
SKCL/SKCM series. This series of switches appeared to have been manufactured byForward Electronicsin Taiwan around 1999. In
2000, Alps ended up the 30-years long joint venture with Forward Electronic.
From this point onward, this series has no relationship with Alps. This also
led to the switches refereed to “Fukka” or “Fuhua Alps” that are misreading Taiwanese
name.
Alps clone




This series refers
to a keyboard switch not made by Alps but interchangeable with
SKCL/SKCM series and SKCL/SKCM
series switches. Because many
switches are very similar to Alps SKCL/SKCM and SKBL/SKBM series switches, and
because earlier SKCL/SKCM switches were not visibly brand mark, it became
common to mistake a wide variety of switches for being ""Alps""
switches. 
Because of historic background and reasons,
we would like to highlight the following factors.
1. 
Since Alps is out of switches
business for years, a lot of keyboard players are very familiar with ALPS switches
but consider ALPS switches entry level products. This opinion is somewhat
correct because the current Alps switches are not Alps original design. The
different design leads the typing feeling changed and this feeling is hard to
describe by words. 
2. 
Before the membrane keyboard
debuted, mechanical keyboard was the primary choice of input equipment. Alps
also dominated the switches market many years. At that time, Cherry focused on
niche market and became current market dominator in switch market.3. The
purpose of Alps switches categories is to sort out different types of Alps
switches. It doesn’t mean that one type is definitely better than another. 




Development
and reproduce the feeling of Alps

Switches are the soul of a keyboard. Good switches should have a bright, crisp feeling, with a slightly tactile feedback that
tells you when the press has registered just half way through the key travel.
That’s totally different from a membrane keyboard, where you have to press the
key down to the bottom. When typing
on a keyboard you actually felt good respond and feedback. You'd press a key
and you could feel a nice, satisfying, mechanical click. When talking about the
feeling, it’s very subjective. We usually use following criteria to describe
the feeling.
1. Tactile
Some switches have clearly
tactile feedback while some are not. A strong tactile feedback makes the pressing
process have two phases. Comparing the linear switches, tactile switches make
typist clearly and definitely feel the whole process of typing. 
2. Clicky
Yes. It’s the noise that
made from typing. Due to the mechanical design, some mechanical keyboards have
noisy reputation. The typing sound may be a problem if you work in an office. But
some typist love these rhythmic clatters cause it helps typist in a good typing
pace. 
3. Force
The force means actuation
force. Some switches need more actuation force than other switches. That gives
typists totally different feeling. 
4. Travel Distance
Travel distance means the
typing distance that actually detonates by contact. Mechanical keyboards
usually have longer travel distance than that on membrane keyboards. 
We
visited many enthusiastic keyboard experts and borrowed several legendary
keyboards that used Alps switches. It takes almost 2 years and countless modifications to meet our criteria.
Since mechanical keyboards use separate complete switches underneath every key,
each switch is composed of a base, a spring, and a stem. Depending on the shape
of the stem, such keyboards have varying actuation and travel distance. Switches
also come in three variants, linear with consistent resistance, and tactile
with a non-audible bump or with an audible click. Meanwhile, depending on the
resistance of the spring, the key requires different amounts of pressure to
actuate. Mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps.
Finally, we have made four different keyswitches.

i-Rocks Private Alps Switches







The switch accepts Cherry
MX and other keycaps. However, you can’t hand-wiring this switch on cherry
keyboard cause the pin layout couldn’t be kept identically.Spec：



Interface: USB ( Full Speed )
Key number: 104 Keys ( By Language )
Switch type : i-Rocks Mechanical Switch
Key stroke: 4.0 mm to the bottom 
N-Key rollover 
LED Backlighting function
Multimedia shortcut keys
Cable Length:200cm
Dimensions: 459 (L)*158.5 (W)*39.5(H) mm
Weight : About 1.45 Kg

System Requirement


Microsoft  Windows® XP,  Windows Vista ®  , Windows® 7 ，Windows® 8 and Windows® 10 operating system.
Available USB Port


Comparing the different
clicky and tactile feel, we created four types of switches: Clicky(blue), Tactile(brown), Linear(red),and Geek (white). 





The blue switch provides
clear tactile and clicky feedback. The tactile force is 60g and the operating
force is 35g. The design of blue switch is for a typical mechanical keyboard.
If you like clicky and click reckless abandon, this is the right choice to you.





The brown switch also provides
clear tactile and clicky feedback. But the tactile force is 50g and the
operating force is 33g. Comparing to blue switch, brown switch has smaller
sound and less contact. If you like tactile typing and work in an office, the
brown switch keyboard is fitting your requirements.





The
red switch is virtually identical to the blue switch except for the absence of the
“tactile peak.” There is a consistent force throughout the full stroke of the
key so there is no tactile feedback unless the switch bottoms out. That is the
reason why we called it linear feeling. Some people prefer the switches with linear
feeling due to their “smoother” feel. Since there is no peak or tactile force,
the total effort required to reach the activation force of 40 g is slightly
less than with the tactile (blue and brown) switch.




We take geek switch as
an advanced linear switch. While the total effort required to reach the activation force on
red switch is 40g, the effort on geek switch is 28g. The feedback is so special
and polarizes people into two extremes: love it or not. That’s also the reason
why keyboard fans called light linear switch “geek switch”.

Meet i-Rocks Fun

As we've been building what's become i-Rocks Fun, we also talked to many huge fans of mechinical keyboard. It's been amazing to watch people suddenly ""get it""as
they put their hands on i-Rocks Fun. Although we will have a booth on Computex Taiwan, 2016, we
want to bring that experience to as many people as possible. If you are in media industry and would like to know further information, please contact us for trial working samples.

Now we have designed a concept MotoMod for Motorola Moto Z  phone. This concept has been tried before on other phones. However only Moto Mod provides a platform for second screen to fulfill its potential.  DigiFrameMod will feature:

At a glance e-paper display - always on, ultra low power, high definition e-ink screen will display information you need/

Information dashboard - set up your own widget with information you need to be available 24/7/

Picture wallpaper - express your personality with a retouched photo or display a screenshot from your main screen.

Extra power  - additional battery for your phone.
What is unique?

Works without a phone - DigiFrameMod will work even detached from your phone. Battery will keep clock running. You can magnetically stick it to your fridge with a love note.

Open API for widgets -  DigiFrameMod will have an open web based API for developers to develop their own widgets. 

Selection of widgets - get information widgets from a store or develop your own.
Think of it as smart desk watch with information you want.How we will do it?E-Paper technology is a well established one at this point. We already made partnership and signed required paperwork with core technology providers in this area.Hardware prototyping has already started.DigiFrameMod will be supported by a server software and an app to deliver an information content to your screen. Technical design and development has already started.Simple HTML knowledge will be enough to develop widgets for DigiFrameMod. You will be able to develop them yourselves or ask us to do it for you. Initial technical specs
4.3"", 800 x 480, 216 dpi, e-ink screen (physically limited by Moto Mod design constrains)
152.7 x 73.5 x 5 mm
1500 mAh battery (preliminary, may change)
Your contribution is essentialWe need funds to complete the hardware prototype and develop a software so you will be able to use it.For this we ask you to support DigiFrameMod !We need $ 10 000 to complete DigiFrameMod prototype implementing and developing the functions provided.Any additional funding will be spent to industrialize prototype and prepare for mass production.

src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I designed KUMIKO Laptop Board to use KUMIKO technique beautifully in your daily life.</p><p>When you use Laptop PC on sofa or bed, don't you think you want something like a board to put on Laptop or tablet?<br/>But most ready-made board is heavy, because they are mede of MDF or bamboo plywood, and uninspired.</p><p>I hit upon the idea When I drank a tea with craftsman in his workshop.<br/>That is ... if I make the board included these nature motif KUMIKO , I think it could be beautiful and light.<br/>I noted this idea, I discussed with craftsman many times and then we did it, this prototype was completed.</p><p>The fist problem I met is strongness of KUMIKO.<br/>KUMIKO is not resistant to heat because they are made of nature Hinoki, japanese cypress, with no coating.<br/>We made trial products and talk it over again and again about strongness and how to release the heat from PC.</p><p>Craftsman is paticular about nature wood that used of KUMIKO so I adopt these Hinoki as other part of KUMIKO Laptop board.</p><p><br/>When you pick it up, you may notice suspicion of the good wood smell.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p>Next we focus on the mousepad.<br/>We select the case leather called Tochigi-leather that made of mimosa from a natural resin without harmful chemicals in Tochigias and are tanned carefully as mousepad.</p><p>We design to use KUMIKO Laptop board not only on your lap but also on your desk in office or study.</p><p><br/>You can release the heat from PC on the desk by attached laptop legs by making incline.<br/>We are currently developing 2 type of board leg and that makes more comfortable to typing and you can charge your smartphone setting on the board.<br/>*We update our development status!</p><p>Natural wood can make the board stunningly light and KUMIKO made of that has a role of heat release.</p><p><br/>KUMIKO laptop board is almost same weight as iPad pro, about 730g, so you can use on your lap, at your favorite cafe, easy to put away and store.<br/>For that, we present you Furoshiki, japanese wrapping cloth.</p><p>You can carry many types of thing by wrapping Furoshiki.<br/>There are a lot of ways to wrapping.<br/>We'll send you mini book telling you how to use the Furoshiki so enjoy to wrap your own style!<br/>(Also will update how to use Furoshiki!)</p><p> </p><p>Craftsman create your board one by one...use natural material...handmade craft...so we cannot mass-produce and reduce labor cost.<br/>That is way our product is expensive but I want you to get this and feel the wonderfulness of craftsman's technique.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy""

What's KUDEN?・Lifestyle brand for the people who want to incorporate japanese culture or spirit into their daily life・Company that create jobs and employment for  handicapped people and also young and old people who have traditional technique that likely to disappear  
 Why we join forces with traditional craftmanMy born place,Tochigi is famous for ""日光東照宮-Nikko TOSHOGU SHRINE"" that built in Edo period,1603-1868.When I was a child, I had many opportunities to meet craftman.In fact, I am an apprentice of knife smith.I'm very attached to craftman because they are kind to me while I was young.As my job, I had experienced design and launch a new business.So I launch new lifestyle brand that do all process from Forest industry to sell, design and produce to use my experience.Works of craftman are very subtle and need patience.It's need time to learn but craftman is continuing to age.Their work has been decreasing year by year and luck of successors is  big problem for all traditional craft.We are going to lose Wonderful tradition and history.(The craftsmans who make this KUMIKO Laptop board are both 74 years old! )Now, that is when we do!It' so difficult that we sell just old style traditional craft because we and you, foreigner for japanese, have different culture and style.As designer, I read a craftsman's thought, context, technique and history and I produce new product that people living all over the world in this time can get japanese culture and spirit into their life style.Not only producing product, I propose how to  adjust them to your life style.There are various craftsman' work in japan.It's the most suitable for people like my son who have own personality.I want to make my company the place handicapped people and aged person work energetically and lively.I have dreams but I cannot complete my project immediately. This year, my son will be 7 years old.My first aim is to work with my son who graduate from junior high school after 9 years.For fist step of my dream, I start this project collaborated with craftsman, produce the new product and job for them.make a profit, create jobs and employment for  handicapped people and let them become craftsman's pupil.Make employment to combine the technique, employment of the handicapped and design.I start a project devoted my life .Please support us.           What's KUMIKOSomeone says craftsman who built Nikko TOSHOGU SHRINE-日光東照宮- in Edo period moved to Kanuma city from Nikko city to keep out to cold.Because of this history, There are many skilled craftsman in Kanuma that is famous for wood craft.Wonderfulness of their sculpture on Dashi, a float that god ride on in festival, is famous here in japan.One of their technique is Kumiko.Kumiko is woodworking technique that make geometrical pattern by combining wood and wood. They use a little adhesive it's almost no adhesive.There are many nature motif pattern, for example leaf, snowflake and shell suit.They have used for household furniture and their decoration. About KUMIKO techniqueThis is one of component of KUMIKO.These parts are made by exclusive tool(also the  craftsman create them!).His own plane, KANNA in japanese, makes them one by one.He adjusts these parts delicately for puttern of KUMIKO.Do you believe that craftsman even make tools!These round wood parts are create one by one to plane with exclusive tools.Also he combines each parts by hand.It's difficult to combine wood parts more than you can imagine.Too big to combine, too small to combine.On this video, craftsman make bigger size KUMIKO for easy to explain than which included in KUMIKO laptop board.Each designs of KUMIKO has own name.The name of plant that japanese are familiar, gods, and so on.These designs are left for posterity and craftsman want to tell to next generation.  What's KUMIKO Laptop BoardI designed KUMIKO Laptop Board to use KUMIKO technique beautifully in your daily life.When you use Laptop PC on sofa or bed, don't you think you want something like a board to put on Laptop or tablet?But most ready-made board is heavy, because they are mede of MDF or bamboo plywood, and uninspired.I hit upon the idea When I drank a tea with craftsman in his workshop.That is ... if I make the board included these nature motif KUMIKO , I think it could be beautiful and light.I noted this idea, I discussed with craftsman many times and then we did it, this prototype was completed.The fist problem I met is strongness of KUMIKO.KUMIKO is not resistant to heat because they are made of nature Hinoki, japanese cypress, with no coating.We made trial products and talk it over again and again about strongness and how to release the heat from PC.Craftsman is paticular about nature wood that used of KUMIKO so I adopt these Hinoki as other part of KUMIKO Laptop board.When you pick it up, you may notice suspicion of the good wood smell. Next we focus on the mousepad.We select the case leather called Tochigi-leather that made of mimosa from a natural resin without harmful chemicals in Tochigias and are tanned carefully as mousepad.We design to use KUMIKO Laptop board not only on your lap but also on your desk in office or study.You can release the heat from PC on the desk by attached laptop legs by making incline.We are currently developing 2 type of board leg and that makes more comfortable to typing and you can charge your smartphone setting on the board.*We update our development status!Natural wood can make the board stunningly light and KUMIKO made of that has a role of heat release.KUMIKO laptop board is almost same weight as iPad pro, about 730g, so you can use on your lap, at your favorite cafe, easy to put away and store.For that, we present you Furoshiki, japanese wrapping cloth.You can carry many types of thing by wrapping Furoshiki.There are a lot of ways to wrapping.We'll send you mini book telling you how to use the Furoshiki so enjoy to wrap your own style!(Also will update how to use Furoshiki!) Craftsman create your board one by one...use natural material...handmade craft...so we cannot mass-produce and reduce labor cost.That is way our product is expensive but I want you to get this and feel the wonderfulness of craftsman's technique. WE COMPLETED ALL DEVELOPMENT!!Looking forward to getting it!    There is a word ""NAJIMU"" in japan.Najimu means that ""getting closer to somewhere or someone or something"" or ""savor or tone unites into one. Harmonize. Go together.""The concept of KUMIKO laptop board that made of natural wood and leather is this ""Najimu"".We remain the natural taste of wood and leather, craftsman make each part of board carefully by their hand for you.That is important and essensial element to express their own feeling by technique of craftsman. KUMIKO is not coated in japan too, we love their natural wood taste and craftsman thinks a great deal of it.We don't coat outer flame as we can, it's minimum semi-gloss finish.So both part of wood and leather, it will be damaged or discolored by sun but these damage or discolor make your KUMIKO laptop board ""Najimu"" on your hand and room.Please use your KUMIKO laptop board for a long time like your favorite jeans or leather shoes and ""Najimu"" it as yours.  From KUDEN, we deliver you some OMOTENASHI accessory that you can incorporate japanese culture into your life style. OMOTENASI 1・Furoshiki-Japanese wrapping cloth-Do you know Furoshiki?For japanese, a square cloth called Furoshiki is known for a long time.We love to use as bag or to wrap and carry something by various way to fold.We give you this Furoshiki as a present with KUMIKO laptop board.You can prefer KON -navy blue- or ENJI -dark red-.Both are traditional japanese color.You can choose one which you like better.Please cover your KUMIKO laptop board and carry it to office or cafe with japanese traditional culture. OMOTENASI 2・KIMONO-box-ItemBox-We also deliver you KUMIKO laptop board in ""Tatoushi"" in KIMONO-box, both of them are for keeping japanese traditional cloth ""Kimono"" with great care.After you receive the KUMIKO laptop board, you can use this KIMONO-box and Tatoushi for KUMIKO laptop board or your cloth or favorite items. UNDER DEVELOPMENTWe can update if you support us→→ALL COMPLETE!! ・Board legWe design to use KUMIKO Laptop board not only on your lap but also on your desk in office or study.You can release the heat from PC on the desk by attached laptop legs by making incline.We are currently developing 2 type of board leg and that makes more comfortable to typing and you can charge your smartphone setting on the board.2017.05.19!COMPLETED!Add function to use KUMIKO Laptop board more comfortable & useful on the desk・Adjust the angle of KUMIKO laptop board・Release heat more on the destPattern AFlat Pattern BWith a slant Road to complete the board legsRough sketchPrototype of air dry clay to verify the angletry many types of legs...pick the best oneHow to use ~feature~

<p>The Tier3D watch uses Mind* cloud to understand the information from your interactions. The AI on the Mind* cloud transforms this understanding into a structured form of learning &amp; desired actions. The composer on the Mind* cloud uses the human-like AI to generate content like presentations, documents, notes, essays, summaries etc., doing things for you without you needed to specify them.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#003b6d;""><strong>Edit and compose like a Pro</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.tier3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/MindStudioEdit.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Tier3D gadgets capture 3D videos with light field and True Texture<sup>©</sup> information, which allows AI to do better segmentation and have better understanding of the content captured. Tier3D MindStudio app uses the video segmentation and composition features of the Mind* cloud to automatically segment different objects from the video based on simple queries like ""find all objects in the scene"" or more complex like ""find all dancing people in a batch of videos"". The objects thus extracted can be edited, added or enhanced and re-composed in a way that is consistent with the lightfield as well as the geometry of the scene.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#003b6d;""><strong>Anyone can create, connect, share, and monetize with AI</strong></h3>

<p>The Tier3D software suite and AI allows everyone to capture &amp; create high-quality content, with no software development or 3D modeling training, by simply interacting with the AI chatbot. The creations of a user can be in form of AI inferences, AI models, documents, video compositions, games, and algorithms, which can be shared and published using the MindNet social media platform.</p>
<p>Traditional large subscriber platforms have the problem of ""more exposure to those who are already on the top"", which puts the newcomer with a small marketing budget at a big disadvantage. The MindNet social AI algorithms consider deep content meaning and context for targeting, which allows people who create content to reach the right audience without a huge marketing spend. The MindNet platform is not just a monetization platform for the <i>influencers</i> but for everyone who can create content.</p>

<strong>3D Light Field Sensor &amp; True Texture</strong><sup>©</sup>
</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.tier3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/LightfieldPic.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Unlike with 2D pixels, each point in the real 3D world space has multiple light rays going in different directions. To accurately show a virtual object immersed in a real-world 3D scene, the software therefore needs to know the ambient light field and re-compose the blended scene by ray tracing.</p>
<p>In a traditional 2D camera picture the only thing we know about a point on an object is a single color. On the other hand, to edit, enhance &amp; re-compose a very high quality 3D scene we need to know the material of every point on an object and its color response to different kinds of lighting. <strong>True Texture</strong><sup>© </sup>is the response function of every point to the incident light.</p>
<p>Tier3D Light Field Sensor uses special electronics and Artificial Intelligence to estimate ambient lightfield and <strong>True Texture</strong><sup>© </sup> of the objects in the scene, thus capturing, and re-composing, extremely high-quality 3D pictures.</p>
<h3 style=""color:#003b6d;""><strong>Locality Focus<sup>©</sup> &amp; Clearer Rendering</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.tier3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Tier3DDisplayDemo.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In normal augmented reality/mixed reality glasses virtual objects look like translucent holograms and the fidelity of the virtual objects is highly dependent on the ambient lighting conditions. If the ambient lighting is bright, the object rendering has high noise.</p>
<p>In the case of parallax based 3D rendering the eyes are focused on the virtual object, which is rendered at a fixed distance, which is normally infinity. The brain reconstructs the 3D information based on the disparity between the left eye and the right eye. If the intended distance of a virtual object is similar to a real object and the eyes are focused on the virtual object then the real object looks blurred. This is because the eyes are focused on the virtual object project at infinity but the real object is much closer.</p>
<p>Tier3D uses special optical design along with the AI algorithms to make bring the real objects near to the virtual objects in-focus (Locality Focus<sup>©</sup>). The optical design also generates much clearer rendering in the case of brighter ambiance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""color:#003b6d;""><strong>AI Crowdsourcing</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.tier3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CrowdSourceIcon2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>One of the core features enabling Tier3D's AI is the ability to do crowdsourcing in a highly intuitive way. Tier3D AI engine converts complex inference based tagging tasks into easy human readable surveys that take only a moment to answer. The users of the system are incentivized by giving them credits for responses, which are monetizable.</p>
<p>The raw and crowdsourced captured data is given to the Tier3D Mind* cloud, which has an auto-scaling learning design that dynamically scales to the complexity of the problem. The auto-scaling design also allows distribution of large scale AI prediction modules into multiple machines in the cloud without being constrained by the performance of single monolithic GPU based prediction engine.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""color:#003b6d;""><strong>AI Privacy Management</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.tier3d.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/PrivacyPic.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The amount and complexity of data generated by the users is growing rapidly and it is projected to only increase. One of the problems with the existing privacy agreements is that they give little control to the user to decide which data form is private to them and which is not. The privacy controls for the user are generally at the level of data blobs (like images, videos). Another problem with the existing privacy management systems is that they apply privacy rules to a certain fixed set of features like pixelation of number plates and thus lack an automatic ability to adapt to newer feature forms like runner identification on the bib of a runner. Current privacy management systems thus do not automatically adapt to more complex data sets and need a human programmer to identify correspondingly more complex privacy forms, which consequently can only be updated manually.</p>
<p>Tier3D AI driven privacy management system passes the data through an artificial intelligence system, which marks various parts of the input data with a privacy level tag with continuously updating rules. It also allows users to do more meaningful transformations of the privacy-controlled data parts and not just redaction or pixelation.</p>

<h2 style=""color:#003b6d;""><strong>Tier3D's Mission</strong></h2>
<p>Tier3D mission is to enable massive Artificial Intelligence and amazing Mixed Reality, which naturally combine together as Artificial Human Intelligence (AHI) to simulate human intelligence and consciousness in a machine.</p>
<p>A human mind is not limited to just the physical mind inside the cranium but is a continuum between what’s inside the human and extends to the physical world. A human mind externalizes information, intelligence, tools and uses the physical world to think and do actions. A model of the human mind (with all its creative and abstraction capabilities) is thus incomplete without a detailed model of the perceived universe. For creating Artificial Human Intelligence we need to create a model of the whole universe, which means we need to observe, record and model everything perceptible. The modeling of the perceived universe cannot be done in isolation with small samples of data but needs crowdsourcing of the data and “human interpretation of it”. Tier3D crowdsources information from millions of connected humans and also learns “interpretations” based on human interactions.</p>
<p>Tier3D gadgets are specifically designed to facilitate such AI crowdsourcing and, in combination with the Tier3D software platform, enables users to write AI apps and present them to users on the Tier3D gadgets. One of the fundamental and symbiotic applications of the ‘AI and visual model of everything’ is Augmented &amp; Mixed Reality. Tier3D's contribution to the next advancement in Augmented &amp; Mixed Reality is the ability to add visually realistic as well as behaviorally realistic content to the real world. The Augmented &amp; Mixed Reality apps complement AI by generating high-quality rich data of natural interaction of humans with the virtual models.</p>
<p>Tier3D gadgets with the AI cloud is a cohesive and complete ecosystem for creating Artificial Human Intelligence. We have re-imagined wearable gadgets to enable Artificial Human Intelligence and we have created a novel set of applications and UI to enable its expression in software. The gadgets and software cannot be done in isolation of each other, that is, one cannot create a self-learning AI cloud and hope that someone will create gadgets with sensors to enable AHI, or conversely one cannot just create novel gadgets and hope that someday, someone will create an AI backend to use the data.</p>

The composer on the Mind* cloud uses the human-like AI to generate content like presentations, documents, notes, essays, summaries etc., doing things for you without you needed to specify them.
Edit and compose like a Pro

The Tier3D gadgets capture 3D videos with light field and True Texture© information, which allows AI to do better segmentation and have better understanding of the content captured. Tier3D MindStudio app uses the video segmentation and composition features of the Mind* cloud to automatically segment different objects from the video based on simple queries like ""find all objects in the scene"" or more complex like ""find all dancing people in a batch of videos"". The objects thus extracted can be edited, added or enhanced and re-composed in a way that is consistent with the lightfield as well as the geometry of the scene.
Anyone can create, connect, share, and monetize with AI

The Tier3D software suite and AI allows everyone to capture & create high-quality content, with no software development or 3D modeling training, by simply interacting with the AI chatbot. The creations of a user can be in form of AI inferences, AI models, documents, video compositions, games, and algorithms, which can be shared and published using the MindNet social media platform.
Traditional large subscriber platforms have the problem of ""more exposure to those who are already on the top"", which puts the newcomer with a small marketing budget at a big disadvantage. The MindNet social AI algorithms consider deep content meaning and context for targeting, which allows people who create content to reach the right audience without a huge marketing spend. The MindNet platform is not just a monetization platform for the influencers but for everyone who can create content.
You don't need to be a marketing guru or tie up with a marketing firm to be popular on MindNet.
Why Tier3D is better?
 

3D Light Field Sensor & True Texture©


Unlike with 2D pixels, each point in the real 3D world space has multiple light rays going in different directions. To accurately show a virtual object immersed in a real-world 3D scene, the software therefore needs to know the ambient light field and re-compose the blended scene by ray tracing.
In a traditional 2D camera picture the only thing we know about a point on an object is a single color. On the other hand, to edit, enhance & re-compose a very high quality 3D scene we need to know the material of every point on an object and its color response to different kinds of lighting. True Texture© is the response function of every point to the incident light.
Tier3D Light Field Sensor uses special electronics and Artificial Intelligence to estimate ambient lightfield and True Texture©  of the objects in the scene, thus capturing, and re-composing, extremely high-quality 3D pictures.
Locality Focus© & Clearer Rendering

In normal augmented reality/mixed reality glasses virtual objects look like translucent holograms and the fidelity of the virtual objects is highly dependent on the ambient lighting conditions. If the ambient lighting is bright, the object rendering has high noise.
In the case of parallax based 3D rendering the eyes are focused on the virtual object, which is rendered at a fixed distance, which is normally infinity. The brain reconstructs the 3D information based on the disparity between the left eye and the right eye. If the intended distance of a virtual object is similar to a real object and the eyes are focused on the virtual object then the real object looks blurred. This is because the eyes are focused on the virtual object project at infinity but the real object is much closer.
Tier3D uses special optical design along with the AI algorithms to make bring the real objects near to the virtual objects in-focus (Locality Focus©). The optical design also generates much clearer rendering in the case of brighter ambiance.
 
AI Crowdsourcing

One of the core features enabling Tier3D's AI is the ability to do crowdsourcing in a highly intuitive way. Tier3D AI engine converts complex inference based tagging tasks into easy human readable surveys that take only a moment to answer. The users of the system are incentivized by giving them credits for responses, which are monetizable.
The raw and crowdsourced captured data is given to the Tier3D Mind* cloud, which has an auto-scaling learning design that dynamically scales to the complexity of the problem. The auto-scaling design also allows distribution of large scale AI prediction modules into multiple machines in the cloud without being constrained by the performance of single monolithic GPU based prediction engine.
 
AI Privacy Management

The amount and complexity of data generated by the users is growing rapidly and it is projected to only increase. One of the problems with the existing privacy agreements is that they give little control to the user to decide which data form is private to them and which is not. The privacy controls for the user are generally at the level of data blobs (like images, videos). Another problem with the existing privacy management systems is that they apply privacy rules to a certain fixed set of features like pixelation of number plates and thus lack an automatic ability to adapt to newer feature forms like runner identification on the bib of a runner. Current privacy management systems thus do not automatically adapt to more complex data sets and need a human programmer to identify correspondingly more complex privacy forms, which consequently can only be updated manually.
Tier3D AI driven privacy management system passes the data through an artificial intelligence system, which marks various parts of the input data with a privacy level tag with continuously updating rules. It also allows users to do more meaningful transformations of the privacy-controlled data parts and not just redaction or pixelation.

Tier3D's Mission
Tier3D mission is to enable massive Artificial Intelligence and amazing Mixed Reality, which naturally combine together as Artificial Human Intelligence (AHI) to simulate human intelligence and consciousness in a machine.
A human mind is not limited to just the physical mind inside the cranium but is a continuum between what’s inside the human and extends to the physical world. A human mind externalizes information, intelligence, tools and uses the physical world to think and do actions. A model of the human mind (with all its creative and abstraction capabilities) is thus incomplete without a detailed model of the perceived universe. For creating Artificial Human Intelligence we need to create a model of the whole universe, which means we need to observe, record and model everything perceptible. The modeling of the perceived universe cannot be done in isolation with small samples of data but needs crowdsourcing of the data and “human interpretation of it”. Tier3D crowdsources information from millions of connected humans and also learns “interpretations” based on human interactions.
Tier3D gadgets are specifically designed to facilitate such AI crowdsourcing and, in combination with the Tier3D software platform, enables users to write AI apps and present them to users on the Tier3D gadgets. One of the fundamental and symbiotic applications of the ‘AI and visual model of everything’ is Augmented & Mixed Reality. Tier3D's contribution to the next advancement in Augmented & Mixed Reality is the ability to add visually realistic as well as behaviorally realistic content to the real world. The Augmented & Mixed Reality apps complement AI by generating high-quality rich data of natural interaction of humans with the virtual models.
Tier3D gadgets with the AI cloud is a cohesive and complete ecosystem for creating Artificial Human Intelligence. We have re-imagined wearable gadgets to enable Artificial Human Intelligence and we have created a novel set of applications and UI to enable its expression in software. The gadgets and software cannot be done in isolation of each other, that is, one cannot create a self-learning AI cloud and hope that someone will create gadgets with sensors to enable AHI, or conversely one cannot just create novel gadgets and hope that someday, someone will create an AI backend to use the data.

 Future WorkWe have created a 3D physical processor design (patent pending), which can simulate physical systems in the form of real physics. We plan to realize this in the next 5-10 years. This architecture will solve the following problems:
Current ray tracing systems take a very long time to render. This architecture will enable real-time raytracing.
Current deep learning networks take a very long time for training. This architecture will enable real-time training of AI systems.
This architecture will enable real-time time evolution of any scene with intelligent participants.
This architecture will allow generation of the real light field instead of parallax based 3D.
One variation of this architecture is a dynamic optoelectrical processor, which can run AI algorithms directly on the 3D light field instead of first sampling it as images.
Another variation of this architecture will allow much more efficient quantum computing.

<p>A: Your vocal cords are hardwired to the brain. The brain has been determined scientifically to be a holographic biological frequency modulator. The recurrent laryngeal nerve is a branch of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagus_nerve"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">vagus nerve</a> that supplies all the intrinsic muscles of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larynx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">larynx</a>. The Vagus nerve also connects to the heart and all the other organs, the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems. The sound waves coming from the vocal cords are therefore directly connected to frequency data of the entire nervous system.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><em>Q: What is the science behind KIJINI</em></strong></p>
<p>A: Importantly, KIJINI has been in development for more than 25 years. KIJINI is based on the science of bio-acoustics (the relationship between the body and frequency),  and quantum physics. All of the matter in the known universe resonates at different frequencies. All of the material that makes up the body is also vibrating at certain known frequencies. These resonant vibrations are processed by the nervous system and the brain holds a holographic representation of all of them at all times. This information is expressed within the frequencies of the voice. Databases of the Frequency Equivalents FE’s(™) of tens of thousands of compounds, substances, and body parts have been created over the past 25 years, and proven over and over again to be accurate.</p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong><em>Q: Can KIJINI tell me what is wrong with me?</em></strong></p>
<p>A: KIJINI does not diagnose illness, but can identify the frequencies in your voice that are out of coherence (imbalanced, stressed, or weak) that represent the frequencies within your entire system. These frequency equivalents can be related to many common issues you might be experiencing, including nutrient deficiencies, muscle stress, toxic overload, pathogens, neurotransmitter and hormone imbalances, and more! </p></em></span></em></span></em></span></div>

<p><span><b>Q: How does KIJINI analyze the voice?</b></span></p>
<p>A: KIJINI uses an algorithm that has been developed over the last 25 years to unearth the frequencies in the voice that tell a story. When looking at these tones from a mathematical perspective, the voice offers a whole catalog of information that can be analyzed. KIJINI'S technology and extensive, proprietary database development allows us to decipher and make sense of this information. This complex algorithm is at the heart of the KIJINI technology.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is KIJINI safe?</b></p>
<p>A: Yes, it only records your voice, analyzes it, and produces a report on the frequencies and their equivalents represented in your voice.  </p>

</div></div>","David Scharps, documentary film-maker of ""The Cure Is..."" with leading experts in the health field, calls KIJINI an ""invaluable"" tool. 







The frequencies and patterns in your voice, no matter what you're saying, reveal more than you ever imagined about your health, personality and much more. Using the science of bio-acoustics (the study of the vibrational interactions within the body) KIJINI will ‘read’ the story in your voice and instantly reports its findings to you. 
KIJINI will be easy to use and very entertaining, but don’t be fooled--KIJINI’s reports are data-driven and sophisticated, based on 25 years of research in a clinical setting. 
Very simply: the coherence and harmony in the voice is directly correlated with the health and vitality of the body! 
 We know this sounds too good to be true. We were skeptical of the abilities of this technology in the beginning too! But the science is well-researched, and more and more, bio-acoustics is making headlines, revealing the potential applications and implications of this ground-breaking technology! 
The software already exists. Now we want to make it mobile! 






Physicists from Cornell learned how to measure the vibrational frequency of resonant atoms nearly 20 years ago. 
World renowned physicist Nassim Haramein of the Resonance project has proved that all matter in the known universe resonates and vibrates at certain frequencies, including all of the biochemical interactions in the body. These biochemical interactions are designed to give you optimal energy and health. 
In addition, bioacoustics research has discovered the frequency algorithms that accompany dozens of common complaints and conditions. In the language of bioacoustics, people with similar conditions/symptoms have similar if not identical vocal patterns. 


Resonance + Bioacoustics + Cloud Database = KIJINI!
Our website, www.KIJINI.com, contains
much more detail, but in simple terms, each wave of the voice has information
in it and the KIJINI technology deciphers that information, converts it from
sound to data,  matches it to our
proprietary database, and provides instant reports revealing what is happening in
your body bioacoustically.






The KIJINI app will be free to
download.  Basic reports will also be
free. Detailed reports, where you will discover all the relationships between
your voice frequencies and your body, and be able to monitor your progress
toward your optimal potential, will be
in-app purchases.
These first
apps are nearly half-way there, and with your help on this campaign we
anticipate they will be in the app store by September, 2015.  





 Here is the KIJINI app structure and what 2015 holds in store:




KIJINI will be easy to use, and fun!
Using a
microphone on your mobile device, you’ll record your voice for about 30 seconds.
 We run the recording through our
software and KIJINI generates an instant report with specific, actionable data
on muscles and vertebra, nutrition, energy, detox, emotions and personality, and
more!
KIJINI can be used before and after
meals, workouts, stressful events, before making health decisions, or anything
that will affect your wellness.



With your help, we can bring this technology to your mobile
device.
KIJINI does not diagnose or treat
illness, but is a powerful tool for personal research and understanding. While
the technology behind KIJINI has been used and developed for decades, on
thousands of people, the advancements in the microphones on mobile devices are
now allowing us to bring the KIJINI technology to your phone and tablet, to
start a revolution in human wellness. And that’s where you come in!
KIJINI will launch the Nutrition, and
Muscle apps in September, 2015.  Depending on your contribution, you may also
have access to other apps as well. Each KIJINI app will provide a detailed
report, giving you instant access to a wealth of actionable information about
you and your body.


Talk into your phone, choose a report, and view the frequency equivalents of your voice! Imagine checking in with our inner wellbeing every morning, and seeing what your body needs. Imagine checking KIJINI after a run, or workout, and seeing what areas were most affected when the body gets depleted. The uses are endless!
KIJINI will have the
ability to determine your percentage of overall wellness--how close you are to your optimal potential.  KIJINI will also focus on the frequency relationships seen
in many metabolic, immune, and degenerative issues. 
OVER 50 DATABASES CURRENTLY
DEVELOPED, READY TO TURN INTO MOBILE APPS

KIJINI represents the opportunity to
begin a needed shift in health and wellness. The ability to gain accurate,
non-biased, data-driven insight into what is happening within your body is
critical to transforming your health.  Moving the technology onto mobile
devices will revolutionize how you access and use information about your body
in your own personal pursuit of wellness.






Watch this video for the entire animation of how the KIJINI technology is possible


The funds received from this campaign
will help convert the bioacoustic databases into the the first two KIJINI apps.
Further, we will be updating our
databases and creating more databases that evaluate predominant
health issues and conditions from a bioacoustic perspective. Examples include frequency biomarkers related to symptoms of:  Diabetes, Thyroid,  and Blood sugar, Adrenal
Exhaustion, Allergies, Digestion, Arthritis, Cancer, Inflammation, Immunity,
and more.
Time is running out on our campaign. The sooner we reach our
goal, the closer we get to bringing these apps to you, so please help us by contributing
today.











Full Interview with Dr. Clyde Porter








Everyone! Professional athletes and weekend warriors; chiropractors and physicians, parents, children, teachers, trainers, and wellness practitioners, and anyone who wants more understanding of their own body and well its performing. We ALL need what KIJINI has to offer, because it is a direct analysis of YOU, in the moment you are speaking. KIJINI tells you where you are on the scale of your Optimal Potential, and then allows you to look deeper into the frequencies that are not harmonic within your system. See which frequency equivalents are high or low, and what you can do to support your body's ability to maintain coherence and harmony. 













KIJINI is a group of passionate people that are dedicated to bringing the extraordinary science of bioacoustics to the public. We are health professionals, researchers / scientists, and entrepreneurs, committed to bringing forth technologies and information that can empower people on their path to health.
The KIJINI group has dedicated many years to researching, developing and introducing information and technology - technology that can change our understanding of what is possible.

The weather changes constantly, of course, I don't need to tell you that.  But not everyone wants to gear up in snow proof clothes in order to stay warm during the winter months, and some people don't want to be close to naked to stay cool during the summer. So we have created the Climate Control Smart Hoodie:

Stylish hoodies (with more styles added constantly!) 
Ability to change temperature through our IOS app.
Rechargeable!


These hoodies are created through top of the line materials to ensure the most comfortable and natural feel for any hoodie/jacket. We will be adding new styles constantly so just be sure to check up on Indiegogo.

The Impact
 Everyone's contribution matters. Even $1 will help us reach our goal. We are truly thankful for everything that everyone gives.  Our product provides the ability to save energy throughout your home. Instead of changing your thermostat, change the temperature of your hoodie instead. Effective way of staying warm!    Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge we face  is creating the technology to cool the hoodie and have it perform the way we want it to, Another challenge is figuring out which is the safest way to wash the hoodies . We are confident we can overcome these challenges as we learn more about the technology. They will be finished by the delivery date!   Other Ways You Can Help Some people can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you  can't help:  Ask people to get the word out about this awesome product! Share it everywhere and remember to stay up to date and contact us with any questions or comments!   Thank you all for taking the time to read our story about  our product.

Our Mission
This is what moves us.



We believe that the way we buy things has a very powerful influence in the World. Unfortunately, most of the time, that influence is not a good one. We want to impact the World in a positive way. We want do things on a different angle. That is the driving force behind this project.

A Bit About The Author
Who and Why.

Natanael is a 27-year-old type designer who has the virtue (or the vice, yet to be decided) of always creating new stuff. Natanael has the dream of creating high quality products that are 100% ethical. Sled is the first of these products and, with your help, his dream might come true.
A few years ago, Natanael built with his father, Luís, the first prototype of Sled. After unsuccessfully searching for a solution for a dual-screen working setup, he decided to design his own. This prototype became famous among his friends and he was encouraged to make it available to more people.

Finally he partnered with the Portuguese non-profit “Plantar uma Árvore” (Plant a Tree) in order to be able to fulfill the promise of planting a tree for every Sled™ sold.



The Perks
Oh yeah! Here they come.





Challenges
It wouldn’t be as fun without them.

Our funding goal will be used mainly for the production of Sled™, but a bit will also be used for the development of the online shop.

Our funding goal is flexible because we are able to deliver every Sled™ even if the total amount produced is small, only with a more humble packaging.

</div>","It was a comment from my daughter Jennifer that got me thinking.  She mentioned she was having trouble plugging the charger cable into her phone.  She handed her phone to me and I took a closer look – the connector was damaged!I thought about it for some time. I was also having problems inserting the cable into my tablet each night. Then it dawned on me! Why not make a cable that was color coded so it’s easy to know which way is the right way? Then I wouldn’t be guessing, getting frustrated and possibly damaging my tablet.
I called a few friends and asked “How many times do you turn a micro-USB cable around in your hand, trying to get it inserted? They answered, “couple of times a day, and sometimes both ends!”

 
Do you also have this problem?  
 
If so, keep reading.  
The answer was simple!  Make a color-coded cable with a tactile arrow so we know the correct orientation even in low light!
It was important to color code the cable on both ends because the connector that goes into the computer/charger is also “one way only”.
This is where we started the industrial design to make a friendly, ergonomic, and beautiful connector.  We did all the drawings,

 
 
 


made some 3D printed parts,

 
 
 


And here are our final cables.




Since connectors on some of your devices (tablets, headphones, etc.) may be upside-down from your phone, we decided to supply small colored adhesive dots to remind you of the orientation on each device and voila, the problem is solved!

Since we were designing a better cable, we decided to take care of another major complaint – charging speed. Our cables can handle up to 3 amps, which supports Quick Charge 2.0 technology and is the maximum allowed by USB standards for charging current.
Getting cables made wasn’t easy, but we persevered with the idea and the Aviva cable was born. We think it offers a time-saving improvement to everyone’s life — simple and quick for everyone from 9 to 90.   Aviva cables will get the whole family connecting in one easy step with a cable for each device:  headphones, tablets, cameras, speakers, phones, everything with a USB port that needs charging or data transfer.
We built and tested samples and received extremely positive responses from everyone we approached about the Aviva cable.  Because of our high quality, we confidently offer a lifetime warranty!

In summary, the Aviva cable provides help in 3 ways.
·  Ease of use – dual-color connector with tactile feature. Connect easily every time.
·  Capable of charging up to 3A – highest allowed by USB standards. Shorten your charging time, depending on your charger.
·  Lifetime warranty – no more trips to buy new cables.

We need your help to get production going.  Please help us reach our goal of launching the world’s most convenient micro-USB cable!
Thank you!

<h3>What is Immediate Mode(IM) Gui?</h3>
<p>Immediate mode rendering is a style for application programming interfaces of graphics libraries, in which client calls directly cause rendering of graphics objects to the display. It does not preclude the use of double-buffering. In contrast to retained mode, lists of objects to be rendered are not saved by the API library. Instead, the application must re-issue all drawing commands required to describe the entire scene each time a new frame is required, regardless of actual changes. This method provides the maximum amount of control and flexibility to the application program.</p>

<h2>&gt;The story</h2>
<p>The phone you’re holding is the best and most convenient photography tool. It is more portable than professional cameras but produces better image quality and provides better operational experience than action cameras. Simply decide the composition of your photo through the screen of your phone and press the shooting bottom. It is especially ideal for IOS considering its extraordinary shooting quality which is as impressive as SLR cameras. At this moment you just need our underwater phone case, then your diving journey will definitely be a life-long unforgettable experience! That is really cool!</p>

<h2>&gt;Why we design Submacam phone case</h2>
<p>Because most of the products on the market are not satisfactory! The main products on sale are plastic waterproof bags, plastic waterproof case and Waterproof Case For Deep diving.But when you see the feedback by the buyer on the Amazon, Do you think they are really reliable?Do you still put your phone in them?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504638652/rcutbwzbnyzavtvlkpvr.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504638679/sjdife5hknphxskfeaxc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>&gt;What their problems are</h2>
<p>Plastic Waterproof Bags and Plastic Waterproof Case’s material and structure are not strong enough, It has been hard to keep waterproof when you use several times, and You really trust to use them?</p>
<p>By comparison, the waterproof case for deep diving would be more secure. Before you use it, you need to put silicone oil on the O-ring. Some models can offers protection up to 40 meters if you use them properly. But please don't forget that those cellphone waterproof cases are controlled by controlling buttons directly, there are mechanical button and much risk. In most cases, the first leak is the button. The more times you use, the higher the risk of leakage. But the serious problem is that you do not know when it starts leaking, it was too late when you knew it. <strong>Like a time bomb！</strong></p>

<h2>&gt;Karl said（PADI MASTER INSTRUCTOR）</h2>
<p>Hello, I am Karl, PADI MASTER INSTRUCTOR. I have ten years scuba diving experience. Underwater is a magical world, that is unparalleled if you are in the water. I very much hope to share the beautiful scene and my diving experience, and my smart phone can help me do that. I need a waterproof phone case. Although I bought a lot of different brands of phone case, but they can not meet my needs, they are not really waterproof, And even let my phone scrapped! Until I know Submacam that is different from most other brands on the market, they design a more efficient structural to achieve the best waterproof. Because Submacam phone case is 40 meters waterproof, easy to operation, rich in scalability, and has the reliable vacuum detection system. When i scuba diving, I shoot by Submacam phone case, I very enjoy and I do not need to worry about my phone.</p>
<p>This is really a amazing product! Whether you are snorkeling, free-diving, or scuba diving, that is the best phone case. Trust me! when you see the underwater images that you shoot, you would more love the underwater exercise!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504644088/hyoxcnzqr0dqtxcy3c7n.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504864601/tgeznho2pi7q6mw6lhi1.png"" src=""""/></p>

>Why we design Submacam phone case
Because most of the products on the market are not satisfactory! The main products on sale are plastic waterproof bags, plastic waterproof case and Waterproof Case For Deep diving.But when you see the feedback by the buyer on the Amazon, Do you think they are really reliable?Do you still put your phone in them?

 
>What their problems are
Plastic Waterproof Bags and Plastic Waterproof Case’s material and structure are not strong enough, It has been hard to keep waterproof when you use several times, and You really trust to use them?
By comparison, the waterproof case for deep diving would be more secure. Before you use it, you need to put silicone oil on the O-ring. Some models can offers protection up to 40 meters if you use them properly. But please don't forget that those cellphone waterproof cases are controlled by controlling buttons directly, there are mechanical button and much risk. In most cases, the first leak is the button. The more times you use, the higher the risk of leakage. But the serious problem is that you do not know when it starts leaking, it was too late when you knew it. Like a time bomb！

 
>Now let's take a look at how Submacam solves these problems!
Waterproof 40 meters / Special control APP / Vacuum-sensing System / Built-in charging treasure /  1000 lumens multi-function video Lamp /  Extended Lens Connector / Buoyancy Arm / Quick installation hood / Equipped with 1/4 expansion screw /double Optical glasses / 3-stages O-ring
The new design of the waterproof structure
Submacam phone case using a dedicated App control, there is no direct button, so that the phone is completely sealed, and safe. Depth Rating up to 40 meters.

We redesigned the waterproof structure, using a unique three-stage O-ring that is the best waterproof structure, and you no longer need to repeatedly apply silicone oil.

 
Special control APP 

Traditional waterproof phone case’s function is single, you need control the phone by touching Screen button, so operation function is little.


With the most intuitive control operation, Submacam phone case can operate the camera to shoot photo/video, zoom, camera switch, picture view and other functions, you just need to press a button.
​

You can also install close lenses and switch it quickly. Macro shooting is very handy.


 
Back Battery
Special accessories: dedicated external backup battery. Increase double the shooting time twice.

 
The lens have double optical glass
The structure of the traditional single-lens glass easily lead to glass fog at high temperatures.

</div></div>","NEW INVENTION  
Olympic Race Sport Car (ORSC)
ENTERTAINMENT
Hello Winter, Hello Ice
I have invented and designed a new form of year round entertainment and muscle development. It is a car operated by hand and assists in building arm  muscles. This project  has been patented. 
This car is the first in the world. It can run on the following:

The car can run on ice.
Its name is: Olympic Ice Racing Sport  Car (OIRSC)
Second car: can run on ordinary streets, its name is: Olympic Street Racing  Sport Car (OSRSC).
Third car can run on water, its name is: Olympic Water Racing Sport Car (OW RSC).

All these cars are for individual exercise and use:

To strengthen chest, neck and hand muscles.
Very enjoyable entertainment to enhance long winter, spring and summer hours.

Action plan
I seek to make a workshop to produce these cars but I need more than one hundred thousand dollars to accomplish this workshop and the necessary licenses.
After six months I will start to produce the cars.


After production and sales:

I will work to produce and improve these cars. 

I will work to use the unemployed as much as I can.

It is my intention to allocate a portion of my profits:


To cancer patients 7%.
To dialysis patients7%.
To handicapped people 7%.

<p>People get smarter so technology has to keep up as well!</p>
<p>Do you call your friends still using this phone?</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://myteletouch.azurewebsites.net/content/images/indiegogo/OldPhone.png"" src="""" style=""""/><p>Of course not, because you have this:</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://myteletouch.azurewebsites.net/content/images/indiegogo/NewPhone.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><p>And it is more than a phone. It is a smartphone not only because it can turn into your personal assistant but most importantly it changes over time so it meets your needs!</p>
<p>MyTeletouch knows the power of changing for the sake of comfort. For a second let’s just imagine that you have friends or family over for the evening and you want to brag about your new Smart TV – you saved in your YouTube account a funny video just for them yesterday and you want to show it on this big shiny screen when…</p>
<p><b>Option 1:</b> you have to type in the browser the YouTube URL using the remote control… yes this small piece of plastic with no buttons for the letters so you have to endlessly click left and right or up and down to type a single word, then you have to type the password of your account to get in, then you have to navigate through the videos and try not to miss the one… you got the idea…everybody will be bored to death.</p>
<p><b>Option 2:</b> you would have been wise enough to get your mouse and keyboard installed so you can use them; however, would you hold them in your lap for the rest of the evening and make plans how to get rid of the big chunky blocks in your hands… and what will happen if one of these devices is broken or runs out of batteries, would you go back to option 1?</p>
<p><b>Option 3:</b> using MyTeletouch USB Dongle you can hold in your hand a wireless keyboard, mouse and gamepad altogether comfortably resting on the sofa having the ball with your friends and family. You will effortlessly type and navigate on your Smart TV and find this funny video for a short while. Everyone will be asking what this cool device is as it is so easy to use and really saves time.</p>
<p>MyTeletouch is a user-friendly device that eases the remote access to your Smart TV, computer or any media device. All you need to do is plug in MyTeletouch dongle, install the application on your phone and start using your phone the smart way! You can blog, search, update your Facebook status, find a YouTube video, play a game or post a tweet from the big screen of your smart TV because typing and navigating has never been so easy and comfy. You can also create a home cinema: use your beamer to project the movie on the wall and control your PC remotely when you don’t want to get up every time you have to adjust the volume or pause for a second. In addition, MyTeletouch will never and has never intended to kill the joystick by introducing the gamepad because all gamers know the feel and the experience is quite different. We wanted you to always have a plan B – a spare joystick when you need it that functions exactly the same way, especially when you have the Raspberry Pi that can turn it into a retro-gaming machine. Everything is as easy as this!</p>

<h3 style=""color:white;background:#2196f3;padding:5px;"">Why MyTeletouch is unique?</h3>
<p>In a nutshell, we are not lazy but we like things simple and easy. MyTeletouch is the simple to use keyboard, mouse and gamepad that will never get old because we upgrade it on regular basis. We will also add new features for all tastes: movie lovers, business people, presenters and speakers, internet surfers or gamers – because we listen to the needs of every kind of user. That is why we are the only product of this kind available for Windows phones.</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""color:white;background:#2196f3;padding:5px;"">Why we need your support?</h3>
<p>Last year we managed to ship a couple of MyTeletouch pieces to people all over the world. But to make it sustainable we need to reduce the product costs, improve the production cycle and start keeping quantities in stock, as well as work on the user experience and futures of the phone application – we have a future vision for adding voice commands, new skins, air mouse and what not. We want to constantly add value to each aspect of our customers’ daily life and make things easier when using their smart devices.</p>
<p>Together we can move MyTeletouch to the next level. Get your own MyTeletouch dongle and, help us fund this project.</p>

It has a water sealed optical window and an adjacent IR illumination LED with a second window - geared to be illuminated while imaging the face or palm of the authenticated user. The secure camera is totally separated from the smartphone integrated cameras in order to ensure the secure generation of totally isolated imaging within the POMM<sup>TM</sup> required to authenticated user as well as for supporting the secured app of generated secure images done through the secure camera that are stored in a separate secure photographs partition in the POMM<sup>TM</sup> secured encrypted memory not related to the secure media memory content derived from external imaging resources.</p><p><strong>Does POMM</strong><strong><sup>TM</sup></strong> <strong>connect to the internet?</strong></p><p>POMM<sup>TM</sup> is totally isolated from the Internet to comply with leading hardware based security management solutions and restrictions. The POMM<sup>TM</sup> has no IP address so hackers cannot get direct access to its content. The smartphone attached to it is isolated from the POMM<sup>TM</sup> through a double-door isolation mechanism that is part of the secured android set of applications to be installed on the smartphone through the POMM<sup>TM</sup> installation procedure that is geared to lock any new incoming file and checks it for malware, viruses and any suspicious data content and rejects this data from entering the POMM<sup>TM</sup> secure isolated content.</p><p>OTHER QUESTIONS</p><p><strong>What are the challenges?</strong></p><p>We are doing something that has never been done before: a completely revolutionary solution like nothing else in the market. While there may be manufacturing and production delays outside of our control, we promise timely and transparent communication throughout the process.

For POMMTM Pro users we offer a second free phone number for calling, text messaging, and voicemail. It works on your same smartphone, it also syncs across your devices, so you can use it while on the go, or at home. Use your smartphone registered number for your work/business calling number while forwarding private calls, text messages, and voicemail to your other free service phone number.
It also enables you to block numbers you don’t want to hear from. All these private calls, text messages, and voicemails are stored and backed up to make it easy for you to search your history.Your incoming private voicemail are also transcribed to have voicemail transcriptions so you can read in the app or have sent to your email. Cheap international calling – the user can make international calls from the second number at competitive rates without using his mobile data.

NOTE:   this second call number service is currently available only in the US. All calls made using the free phone number service for Android use the standard minutes from your current cell phone plan. The free number calls are placed through a US-based access number, which may incur extra costs (e.g. when traveling internationally)HOW DOES IT WORK WITHWhen I charge battery wireless, will it charge my mobile phone?The POMMTM first released generation is not equipped with a wireless charging option.

It has a water sealed optical window and an adjacent IR illumination LED with a second window - geared to be illuminated while imaging the face or palm of the authenticated user. The secure camera is totally separated from the smartphone integrated cameras in order to ensure the secure generation of totally isolated imaging within the POMMTM required to authenticated user as well as for supporting the secured app of generated secure images done through the secure camera that are stored in a separate secure photographs partition in the POMMTM secured encrypted memory not related to the secure media memory content derived from external imaging resources.Does POMMTM connect to the internet?POMMTM is totally isolated from the Internet to comply with leading hardware based security management solutions and restrictions. The POMMTM has no IP address so hackers cannot get direct access to its content. The smartphone attached to it is isolated from the POMMTM through a double-door isolation mechanism that is part of the secured android set of applications to be installed on the smartphone through the POMMTM installation procedure that is geared to lock any new incoming file and checks it for malware, viruses and any suspicious data content and rejects this data from entering the POMMTM secure isolated content.OTHER QUESTIONSWhat are the challenges?We are doing something that has never been done before: a completely revolutionary solution like nothing else in the market. While there may be manufacturing and production delays outside of our control, we promise timely and transparent communication throughout the process. Soon, POMM devices will be securing mobile data and allowing people to get back control over their data like never before.Any more questions? Ask away!We hope you join us.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are building the first and only bicycling dedicated television network!<br/></p><p>Bicycling has changed by leaps and bounds since the development of the
BMX and the mountain bike. It’s evolved today into such a wide-angled sport
that various competitions and events have been developed just to accommodate
innovations constantly taking place. </p>
<p>But that’s just the tip of the two-wheeled iceberg. Riding alongside its
sporting aspect is bicycling’s intensely increasing popularity around the world
as a chosen form of transportation. Fossil fuel-free, easy on maintenance, and
healthy, the bicycle is the ride of the present and the future. <br/></p><p>
</p><p>Unlike other sports, however, bicycling has not been given the exposure
it deserves even though it has become a part of everyday living. High time it
was given a spotlight of its own.</p>

</p><p>The Bicycle Broadcasting Network (<b><i>BBN</i></b>) is on a mission to bring both the

<br/></div>","WHAT IS BBN?
We are building the first and only bicycling dedicated television network!Bicycling has changed by leaps and bounds since the development of the
BMX and the mountain bike. It’s evolved today into such a wide-angled sport
that various competitions and events have been developed just to accommodate
innovations constantly taking place. 
But that’s just the tip of the two-wheeled iceberg. Riding alongside its
sporting aspect is bicycling’s intensely increasing popularity around the world
as a chosen form of transportation. Fossil fuel-free, easy on maintenance, and
healthy, the bicycle is the ride of the present and the future. 
Unlike other sports, however, bicycling has not been given the exposure
it deserves even though it has become a part of everyday living. High time it
was given a spotlight of its own.



The Bicycle Broadcasting Network (BBN) is on a mission to bring both the
sport and the vehicle to the living room. We envision creating and operating a
single-sport TV network dedicated to the world of cycling and its three big
aspects: leisure, competition, and commuting. 

People, events, innovations, products, destinations. BBN aims to deliver
all the news, updates, and information on the bicycling world, increasing media
coverage of cycling by broadcasting 24/7 on bicycles and bicycling through cable TV, satellite, broadband mobile, and Internet streaming.
With this vision, BBN aims to promote bicycling and invite everyone to ""Pedal Where
the Road Leads”  


WHAT OUR CUSTOMERS WANT

been doing independent research, consulting cyclists and members of the bicycle
industry about what they would like to see on TV. Their viewing wishes

 Just when we needed the most, that our smartphone's battery has gone dead! 
Our idea is generated from a common need: bring a ""charging"" solution inside restaurants, beaches, hotels, buses, meeting places...bars. 







How it works part one: recharge 




How it works part two: improve your quality service and customer's satisfaction



How it works part three: NFC technology to promote your business

What is special about <b>ProDock</b> is that it was born out of necessity. Making regular presentations, leading company meetings, or even just surfing the internet with friends - we always had the chore of constantly turning or spinning the iPod Pro around the table. And we have all had those meetings where everyone gathers uncomfortably around behind one person clicking away. We envisioned a product to avoid the extra steps of toggling between the iPad Pro and other monitors or computers. We designed ProDock to help make its user be more efficient with their time.
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.mgkeyboard.com/Images/Upload/image/20151121/20151121230657_7076.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
</div><div>We found that<strong> ProDock</strong> not only allowed us to be faster collecting notes and brainstorming ideas, but it has helped our bottom line. Clients pay more attention to the presentations and don't get sidetracked watching someone type or passing around the iPad Pro.
</div><p>It's sharp edge design measures 6.8mm, but still has a<strong> 1000mAh</strong> rechargeable battery working inside to provide 30 days of working time and 3 months of standby time! By connecting ProDock, you can type, flip and use the featured Page Up/Page Down controls with the iPad for your customers, and turn it back toward you just as quickly and easily. It's like having a lighter and more versatile MacBook!</p><div>

</div></div>","ProDock is the first bluetooth keyboard that features a two-way docking and magnetic stand made specifically for the iPad Pro user.

 
What is special about ProDock is that it was born out of necessity. Making regular presentations, leading company meetings, or even just surfing the internet with friends - we always had the chore of constantly turning or spinning the iPod Pro around the table. And we have all had those meetings where everyone gathers uncomfortably around behind one person clicking away. We envisioned a product to avoid the extra steps of toggling between the iPad Pro and other monitors or computers. We designed ProDock to help make its user be more efficient with their time.
 
We found that ProDock not only allowed us to be faster collecting notes and brainstorming ideas, but it has helped our bottom line. Clients pay more attention to the presentations and don't get sidetracked watching someone type or passing around the iPad Pro.
It's sharp edge design measures 6.8mm, but still has a 1000mAh rechargeable battery working inside to provide 30 days of working time and 3 months of standby time! By connecting ProDock, you can type, flip and use the featured Page Up/Page Down controls with the iPad for your customers, and turn it back toward you just as quickly and easily. It's like having a lighter and more versatile MacBook!

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;""><b>To develop a new market for cell phone accessories</b></span></p>
<p>MO-I is currently the most convenient product, as it makes it possible for the users to control their phone with one hand.</p>
<p>The phone will not fall in any circumstances; therefore, MO-I prevents the screen from breaking.</p>
<p>Also, it is designed so that there would be less stress to the user’s hand even after he or she uses it for a long time.</p>
<p>The MO-I can be left anywhere on the phone and used.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448430943/ayirkgrhvjs4iwegq1yp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p> <ul> <li>The first of the objectives was to develop a product that gives less stress to the user’s hand and for the user to be able to control the application with one hand.</li> <li>The second objective was to prevent the breakage of the screen by not letting the cell phone drop.<br/>
</li>
<li><p>The third goal was to let the user use the phone with either the left or right hand – without any differences.</p></li>
<li><p>The fourth idea was to make it strong.</p></li>
<li><p>The fifth point was to make it possible to be applied to phones with filp cases or curved phones<br/></p></li> </ul> <p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> You don't have to worry any more! </span></p>
<p>The MO-I team has solved all these problems and come to the point where they could release the product.<br/></p>
<p>In the beginning of the development, the goal was to come up with solutions for the product’s functions, sizes and designs.</p>
<p>During the development of the product, we emphasized the functionality that makes it possible for the product to be controlled with one hand, mounted at any locations and thereby raises the value of the customers.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<ul>
<li>We have applied a strong and smooth holder that uses a combination of metal and silicon.</li>
<li>We have made it possible for the users to use either left or right hands through 360 degree rotation.</li>
<li>We have it made it possible for the users to conveniently control the videos and the phone without any limits to locations by applying the mounting function.</li>
<li>We have made it possible to control the phone in the most convenient and effective way by applying the side GRIP.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>MO-I has been designed to have safety and convenience together.</p>
<p>When you use your phone with one hand or use the phone in the mounted mode, people around you will think “How is that possible?” and fix their eyes on you.</p>

<h3>Designing MO-I</h3>
<p>MO-I team has been working on this project for over two years.</p>
<p>Our objective was to create a product that makes it possible for everyone to use their phones safely and conveniently.</p>
<p>With MO-I, you can not only use your phones and handheld devices conveniently while moving, but also use them conveniently in the office, coffee shops many other places by applying the mounting function.</p>
<p>Therefore, by combining metal and silicon, we have produced a holder that is strong and smooth at the same time.</p>
<p>For the 360 degree rotation functionality and for safety, we have applied metal to the disk.</p>
<p>This will provide you with a function that is safe and convenient.<br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","About MO-I
To develop a new market for cell phone accessories
MO-I is currently the most convenient product, as it makes it possible for the users to control their phone with one hand.
The phone will not fall in any circumstances; therefore, MO-I prevents the screen from breaking.
Also, it is designed so that there would be less stress to the user’s hand even after he or she uses it for a long time.
The MO-I can be left anywhere on the phone and used.


  The first of the objectives was to develop a product that gives less stress to the user’s hand and for the user to be able to control the application with one hand. The second objective was to prevent the breakage of the screen by not letting the cell phone drop.

The third goal was to let the user use the phone with either the left or right hand – without any differences.
The fourth idea was to make it strong.
The fifth point was to make it possible to be applied to phones with filp cases or curved phones  
 You don't have to worry any more! 
The MO-I team has solved all these problems and come to the point where they could release the product.
In the beginning of the development, the goal was to come up with solutions for the product’s functions, sizes and designs.
During the development of the product, we emphasized the functionality that makes it possible for the product to be controlled with one hand, mounted at any locations and thereby raises the value of the customers.


We have applied a strong and smooth holder that uses a combination of metal and silicon.
We have made it possible for the users to use either left or right hands through 360 degree rotation.
We have it made it possible for the users to conveniently control the videos and the phone without any limits to locations by applying the mounting function.
We have made it possible to control the phone in the most convenient and effective way by applying the side GRIP.


MO-I has been designed to have safety and convenience together.
When you use your phone with one hand or use the phone in the mounted mode, people around you will think “How is that possible?” and fix their eyes on you.

Introducing MO-I





MO-I reduces stress of the user’s hand ; therefore, it is more convenient when watching long videos or games.


With MO-I, the smartphone will never be dropped.




The phone can be mounted anywhere, such as coffee shops, and restaurants.



Are you worried that your child might drop your phone?
You don’t have to worry about that any more!

It is possible to use MO-I in the subway, bus, etc. safely with only one hand.

With MO-I, it is also possible to conveniently take a selfie while riding a bicycle or a boat, or when you are moving without worries of dropping the phone.




You can use it by attaching the MO-I to your cell phone or to the case.
Also, you can attach it to the flip cover. It is a convenient product that makes it possible to control the phone and watch videos with one hand.


You would not have to worry about dropping MO-I even when you’re using it outdoors or in your bed. 


MO-I will protect your children’s eyesight, because when they hold it too close to their face, it will create stress on their wrists, forcing them to hold the phone at a distance.



iPhone 6, Galaxy 6 Edge, etc.
You can attach it to all types of phones and handheld devices that are 4.7 inches or above.







MO-I being used while the battery is being charged.
Even while using a portable battery, it is possible to use it with one hand.
The MO-I Package

 


We ship additional 3M TAPE 1EA. In the case where we reach our goal of $100,000, we will change the wrapping papers into gift-wrapping and ship it.
(The design for the wrapping paper can be changed)


In the case where we reach our goal of $150,000, we will include the REMOVER and ship it.

Testing MO-I
Test for the holder

Ultrasonic Welding Test

Test for the disk

Designing MO-I
MO-I team has been working on this project for over two years.
Our objective was to create a product that makes it possible for everyone to use their phones safely and conveniently.
With MO-I, you can not only use your phones and handheld devices conveniently while moving, but also use them conveniently in the office, coffee shops many other places by applying the mounting function.
Therefore, by combining metal and silicon, we have produced a holder that is strong and smooth at the same time.
For the 360 degree rotation functionality and for safety, we have applied metal to the disk.
This will provide you with a function that is safe and convenient.
MO-I Specifications



These are initial test products, so tThere may be changes in the design when the products are actually produced.

Timeline








 Perks 



Teams



It took a long time to develop the product.
At one point, we even thought that we would not be able to commercialize MO-I.
However, we did not give up and we have now successfully completed this project.
In order to let everyone use our product - created from our persistent efforts – we need your advice and support.

Risk and Challenges

MO-I is preparing for the production of MO-I through prototype testing.
Currently, we have finished all preparations for production.

When we are sufficiently funded, we will start production immediately. For  smooth production, we need your support.
We have completed a production contract with a company that has been manufacturing cell phone parts for over 20 years, and are now preparing to produce.
The production and wrapping will take place in Korea, but the production of the wrapping papers will be undertaken in China.
In return of your support, we will improve our work to wrap it with gift-wrapping papers.
There may be some delay in shipping on account of this process, but we will do our best to take prior action to avoid any problems.


FAQ

When would it be shipped?
The production of the accessory  will start from November, 2015. You will be able to receive your product by the end of December, 2015. Delivery to less than 10 countries may be delayed.

Ils sont partis d'un simple constat : en mode apprentissage, les étudiants perçoivent les études comme laborieuses, une “corvée” nécessaire, mais une corvée tout de même. En revanche, dès qu’une notion de jeu ou de challenge est introduite, ils se montrent plus réactifs, plus engagés et s’impliquent dans le processus d’apprentissage. Dès lors, le concept de Smart Me Up a commencé à germer.</p><p>Notre solution ? Une plate-forme où l'étudiant peut accéder à des quizz sur les matières qui le concernent. Il peut ainsi s'entraîner, s'auto-évaluer, voir sa progression et son niveau par rapport aux autres, et même les défier. Tout ça sans avoir à attendre la sanction des examens, une fois qu'il est trop tard pour réagir. Smart Me Up s'adresse également aux enseignants qui peuvent créer des quizz auto-corrigés : un réel gain de temps pour évaluer leurs étudiants sans passer des heures corriger les copies ! </p><p>Ce concept, imaginé pour les étudiants à l’université peut être adapté à tout type de classe, d'établissement ou de niveau, qu'ils s'agisse de petites classes, d'établissements d’enseignement supérieur ou dans le cadre de la formation en entreprise. Un système de gamification (jeu)a été mis en place pour encourager les étudiants à répondre aux quizz. Ainsi, ils gagnent des points, améliorent leur classement, remportent des badges et se positionnent comme experts dans certaines matières. En effet, de nombreuses études ont démontré l’impact positif du jeu dans l’apprentissage, et ce à tout âge. Le challenge représente finalement un moteur plus puissant que la simple note finale.</p><h2>Un besoin réel et chiffré </h2><div>En France, le nombre d’inscrits à la fac à la rentrée universitaire de 2014 était d’1,5 million. Sur l’ensemble de ces étudiants,  27%  sortiront du système universitaire en première année, 19% finiront sans diplômes et 29% redoubleront leur première année. Ces statistiques sont affolantes et ont un impact économique majeur. <p>Les 140 000 jeunes qui décrochent des études chaque année en France auraient un impact financier estimé à 30 milliards d’euros (<a href=""http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/11/21/qui-sont-les-jeunes-en-decrochage-scolaire_4527096_4355770.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/11/21/qui-sont-les-jeunes-en-decrochage-scolaire_4527096_4355770.html</a>).</p>

<p>What if we created a new solution to help
students all the way to their graduation? What if we reinvented teaching? What
if we found a solution to prevent dropout and isolation during studies? What if
studying was made fun? Smart Me Up is a brand new platform aiming to get
students more engaged and more proactive during their studies. An original
concept built up around actual needs and creating a link between students and
teachers. </p>
<p>French university numbers are appalling
and representative of a general behavior among students who don’t get engaged
in their studies and tend to wait for “brain feeding”:</p>
<p></p>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">27% of students entering

</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Smart Me Up has been imagined as a
side-tool aiming to engage the students, accompany them and lead them on their
path to success. This unique platform has been built on two observations:
students feel more involved if there is a challenge including the
characteristics of gamification (points, badges, leader boards…) and
collaboration between the students leads to better results for the whole group.
</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>Smart Me Up allows students to test their
level by answering various quizzes created either by professors or by other
students. They can see their own progression in a subject as well as their
level compared to the other students. A chat system is implemented so that
students can get in touch with the ones identified as “experts” in a subject.
Helping another student grants you points, as well as submitting new questions
which will go through a validation process. Finally, in order to earn more
points and badges, students can challenge each other into one-to-one battles,
reinforcing the game effect. </p>
<p>Talking with the students, studying their
reactions and habits, we found out that they were passive if there wasn’t
something to earn, given that knowledge and skills are seemingly not enough.
Their attention grows, their involvement in the learning process increases and
their participation multiplies as soon as they can visualize their own
progression and their level compared to the others’. Collaborating on the same
project also motivates them to support each other and helps them understand the
subjects better as they explain them to someone else.</p>
<p>The solution is also directed toward the
professors who benefit from a system that allows them to create quizzes using
either their own questions or the ones from the platform. The quizzes are
auto-corrected and the results are published as soon as the final answer to the
quiz has been submitted. It saves time and offers an efficient support as well
as analytics. </p>
<p>This concept has emerged at the heart of Creative
Slashers, a digital agency. The founders, Audrey Rochas – CEO – and Virak Mey –
artistic director – both give talks and teach classes for students from age 18
to 25 on various subjects (digital strategy, product management, marketing,
design, project and team management…). They built Smart Me Up over a year and a
half, testing the idea, adapting it to the students’ reactions and to their own
needs; an efficient solution that is meant to evolve rapidly when implemented
in universities and schools.</p>
<h2>What will we do with the money raised?</h2>
<p>The crowdfunding will give us a chance to develop a first version of our solution that we will be able to implement in the first schools and colleges. This implies:</p>

Smart Me Up, c'est bon pour :Les étudiants : qui peuvent tester leurs connaissances tout au long de l'année grâce à des QCM et à des battles face d'autres étudiants => augmentation de l'engagementLes enseignants : qui peuvent créer des quizz qui seront automatiquement corrigés => gain de tempsLes écoles : qui ont accès à des statistiques leur permettant d'adapter leurs plannings de cours en fonction des besoins des étudiants => optimisation de la formationSmart Me Up : ça sert quoi ?Les Creative Slashers, spécialisés dans le digital et assurant des formations dans diverses écoles supérieures, ont imaginé une solution destinée aux étudiants qui intègre les principes de la gamification. Ils sont partis d'un simple constat : en mode apprentissage, les étudiants perçoivent les études comme laborieuses, une “corvée” nécessaire, mais une corvée tout de même. En revanche, dès qu’une notion de jeu ou de challenge est introduite, ils se montrent plus réactifs, plus engagés et s’impliquent dans le processus d’apprentissage. Dès lors, le concept de Smart Me Up a commencé à germer.Notre solution ? Une plate-forme où l'étudiant peut accéder à des quizz sur les matières qui le concernent. Il peut ainsi s'entraîner, s'auto-évaluer, voir sa progression et son niveau par rapport aux autres, et même les défier. Tout ça sans avoir à attendre la sanction des examens, une fois qu'il est trop tard pour réagir. Smart Me Up s'adresse également aux enseignants qui peuvent créer des quizz auto-corrigés : un réel gain de temps pour évaluer leurs étudiants sans passer des heures corriger les copies ! Ce concept, imaginé pour les étudiants à l’université peut être adapté à tout type de classe, d'établissement ou de niveau, qu'ils s'agisse de petites classes, d'établissements d’enseignement supérieur ou dans le cadre de la formation en entreprise. Un système de gamification (jeu)a été mis en place pour encourager les étudiants à répondre aux quizz. Ainsi, ils gagnent des points, améliorent leur classement, remportent des badges et se positionnent comme experts dans certaines matières. En effet, de nombreuses études ont démontré l’impact positif du jeu dans l’apprentissage, et ce à tout âge. Le challenge représente finalement un moteur plus puissant que la simple note finale.Un besoin réel et chiffré En France, le nombre d’inscrits à la fac à la rentrée universitaire de 2014 était d’1,5 million. Sur l’ensemble de ces étudiants,  27%  sortiront du système universitaire en première année, 19% finiront sans diplômes et 29% redoubleront leur première année. Ces statistiques sont affolantes et ont un impact économique majeur. Les 140 000 jeunes qui décrochent des études chaque année en France auraient un impact financier estimé à 30 milliards d’euros (http://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2014/11/21/qui-sont-les-jeunes-en-decrochage-scolaire_4527096_4355770.html).
Deux causes majeures à ce décrochage au cours d’un cursus universitaire : 



l’isolement auquel ne sont pas préparés les bacheliers qui sortent du lycée, 


le manque de suivi au cours de l’année. 


Les étudiants se retrouvent livrés à eux-mêmes, perdus au milieu de dizaines d’autres étudiants, sans soutien, sans suivi personnalisé, sans rendus intermédiaires leur permettant d’estimer leur niveau. Au final, un sur 10 déclare souffrir d’isolement et la plupart attend l’échec du partiel semestriel pour découvrir que le niveau n’est pas au rendez-vous.
A quoi servira le crowdfunding ?
Le financement nous servira à développer une première version fonctionnelle de l'application afin de la proposer à des établissements. Cela implique :

marketing et communication

Boosting students' success



What if we created a new solution to help
students all the way to their graduation? What if we reinvented teaching? What
if we found a solution to prevent dropout and isolation during studies? What if
studying was made fun? Smart Me Up is a brand new platform aiming to get
students more engaged and more proactive during their studies. An original
concept built up around actual needs and creating a link between students and
teachers. 
French university numbers are appalling
and representative of a general behavior among students who don’t get engaged
in their studies and tend to wait for “brain feeding”:



27% of students entering
university drop out of the educational system,


29% will repeat their first
year,


19% will never graduate,


10% feel isolated.



Smart Me Up has been imagined as a
side-tool aiming to engage the students, accompany them and lead them on their
path to success. This unique platform has been built on two observations:
students feel more involved if there is a challenge including the
characteristics of gamification (points, badges, leader boards…) and
collaboration between the students leads to better results for the whole group.

How does it work?
Smart Me Up allows students to test their
level by answering various quizzes created either by professors or by other
students. They can see their own progression in a subject as well as their
level compared to the other students. A chat system is implemented so that
students can get in touch with the ones identified as “experts” in a subject.
Helping another student grants you points, as well as submitting new questions
which will go through a validation process. Finally, in order to earn more
points and badges, students can challenge each other into one-to-one battles,
reinforcing the game effect. 
Talking with the students, studying their
reactions and habits, we found out that they were passive if there wasn’t
something to earn, given that knowledge and skills are seemingly not enough.
Their attention grows, their involvement in the learning process increases and
their participation multiplies as soon as they can visualize their own
progression and their level compared to the others’. Collaborating on the same
project also motivates them to support each other and helps them understand the
subjects better as they explain them to someone else.
The solution is also directed toward the
professors who benefit from a system that allows them to create quizzes using
either their own questions or the ones from the platform. The quizzes are
auto-corrected and the results are published as soon as the final answer to the
quiz has been submitted. It saves time and offers an efficient support as well
as analytics. 
This concept has emerged at the heart of Creative
Slashers, a digital agency. The founders, Audrey Rochas – CEO – and Virak Mey –
artistic director – both give talks and teach classes for students from age 18
to 25 on various subjects (digital strategy, product management, marketing,
design, project and team management…). They built Smart Me Up over a year and a
half, testing the idea, adapting it to the students’ reactions and to their own
needs; an efficient solution that is meant to evolve rapidly when implemented
in universities and schools.
What will we do with the money raised?
The crowdfunding will give us a chance to develop a first version of our solution that we will be able to implement in the first schools and colleges. This implies:

Connections


Fig. 2.IES-EDU-ARD components




Table 1. IES-EDU-ARD
connections
The board is powered from 5VDC power source
provided by the Arduino board and the different components are enabled with
active high logic. 
· 
5V and GND pins
The power supply pins for
the IES-EDU-ARD shield.  
· 
A0 pin (Temperature sensor)
The output of the LM335Z
temperature sensor is connected to the A0 (Analogue 0) pin. LM335 operates from
-40ºC to 100ºC, has accuracy ±2ºC and gain of 10mV/K. The figure bellow
provides the schematic of the sensor circuit.






· 
A1 pin (Potentiometer)
The wiper terminal of a
10KOhm potentiometer is connected to A1 (Analogue 1) pin making thus a voltage
divider circuit with output voltage 0V to 5V (ideally). The potentiometer has 20% tolerance and 50mW
power rating.





· 
A2 pin (Photosensor)
An LDR (Light Dependent
Resistor) is connected as a voltage divider circuit to detect the light
intensity. The resistor of the LDR decreases with the increasing light
intensity. We used the GL5528 LDR which has 1ΜOhm dark (at 0 Lux) resistance and 8 ~ 20 KOhm
light resistance (at 10 Lux). The diagram bellow is taken from GL5528 datasheet
giving the LDR resistance vs. illuminance.





Taking into account the values
from the above diagram, the dark and the light voltage can be calculated
(calculated for 1 Lux and 100 Lux).







The schematic diagram is
given in the following figure: 






· 
Pin 2 (Relay)
This pin is connected to
the relay and should be configured as output in order to turn ON/OFF the relay.
We used the LEG-5 miniature relay which is able to drive load of 10A/120VAC or
10A/24VDC (resistive load). The figure bellow depicts the schematic diagram of
the circuit and the terminal connections of the shield.









The
following table describes the how to drive the relay and its state. Normally,
while the pin is set to logic LOW (0V), the relay is turned OFF which means
that the COM terminal is connected to the NC terminal. Applying a logic HIGH
(5V) at pin 2, the relay is turned ON and connects the COM terminal to the NO
terminal.




· 
Pin 3 (Servo motor)
Pin 3 is connected to the
servo motor connector to drive miniature servo motors. The schematic circuit
and the connections of the motor are given bellow.

    




· 
Pin 4 (Switch)
Pin 4 of the Arduino is
connected to the ON/OFF switch and must be configured as input. The following
figure gives the schematic of the switch circuit and the table the Arduino pin
4 values corresponding to the switch state. 








· 
Pin 5 (Buzzer)
Pin 5 is connected to the buzzer
and should be configured as output or PWM to drive the buzzer CEM-1205C.






· 
Pin 6, 9 and 10 (LED pins)
Arduino pins 6, 9 and 10
are connected to a red LED, green LED and blue LED respectively. To turn ON the
LED logic HIGH (5V) should be applied to the corresponding pin. 







· 
Pin 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13 (Buttons)
Pins 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13
are connected to pushbuttons and they should be configured as inputs to the Arduino.






2. 
Configuration
There is no any specific
configuration required to operate the shield but there are some jumpers
attached to the SPI signals of the Arduino (pins 10, 11, 12 and 13) which can
be placed or unplaced in order to connect and disconnect the BLUE LED, the DOWN
button, the UP button and the CENTER button. This might be required when
another shield is attached to the Arduino system which uses the SPI pins as
communication port. In this case, the four jumpers of the IES-EDU-ARD should be
disconnected in order to allow the additional shield to function correctly.

Additional pinouts
The shield provides some additional pinouts for prototyping to
connect external components. Pinout P11 provides the buttons CENTER, UP, DOWN
and the BLUE Led connections as shown in Fig 4.

Software tools
   
The shield can be programmed using the
Arduino IDE or any other development environment for AVR microcontrollers like
Atmel Studio.

cables play an important role in modern everyday life. They are used
to charge up our phones and cameras and to transfer data from one
device to another. There is, however, one flaw with most of the USB
cables currently available - they can only be connected to a device
one way. Think about how many times you have fumbled around trying to
connect your USB cable to your phone, risking damage to the
connectors as you try to force it in the wrong way up.</p>

<p>This
is a problem for many people. The solution is LedFlip. This
revolutionary new cable has a reversible end so can be inserted in
any direction, giving users fast, reliable charging.  LedFlip fits
any micro USB portal without the hassle of an adapter, conveniently
offering unrivalled functionality, ease of use, and maximum charge
time. The reversible end means that the pins on the connector will
fit either way up, so you no longer have to worry about turning the
cable over and over to insert it into your device. LedFlip also
eliminates the problem of having the incorrect fitting on the end of
your USB cable - quite literally, one cable fits all. This is
particularly useful when charging your smartphone, as Windows and
Android users currently require a different type of USB cable to
those compatible with other smartphones. LedFlip is therefore a
cost-effective and environmentally aware product, as just one USB
cable can be used to power multiple devices. This saves you money and
hassle, preventing you from having to buy a new cable for each
different device you own.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Pegg Electronics are a UK and US based team who are passionate about providing innovative and creative electronic touchscreen devices.</p>
<p>Our devices and accessories are based on enhancing touch screen App experiences generally.</p>
<p>To date, our products have not just improved  mobile gaming experiences, but have also provided greater success with business apps/contract procurement.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<p>We are looking to raise a further $420000 (on top of what we already have banked!). This will cover final research and development costs, prototype production, tooling, product manufacture and the global marketing campaign. Our team have been working hard to get to this point and are confident that the cost outlined will allow this exciting product to become available for release 1Q 2019.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In our three year existence we have grown to successfully dispatch our products to over 50 countries around the world.</p>
<p>All of our products have (since 2015) had patent pending status, with grants imminent.</p>
<p>We absolutely pride ourselves on product quality and innovation, but more importantly on customer service, and customer care.</p>
<p>Since our seven speed ‘Turbo 7’ was released in 2017 we have continued to listen to our customers and fans, and this has led us to the move from a single point tapper product, to a multi-point, multi-speed, multiuse tap or swipe device.</p>
<p>Pegg Hubb will add an entirely new dimension to stand alone (re-chargeable) automated touchscreen tapping. It will provide complete control with up to 4 tap pod placement positions, each with completely independent adjustment of position and speed/tap rate. Not only will it incorporate our unique super quiet operation technology, but as with all previous products, there’ll be no need to be tied down or restricted to plugged-in mains – we’ll be incorporating our very successful long life re-chargeable batteries for continued freedom to roam.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We recognise that we will have challenges as we move from design to prototype, and to production, but our team has a proven track record – successfully delivering all existing Pegg products, while continuing to provide customers with a reliable and trustworthy after sales service.</p>

maker of any and all things awesome. A number of years ago I became
fascinated with working metal which has landed me here in front of
you here today on Indiegogo. I bring to the table a new brand of
product I call Aux Vape ™. Aux Vape ™, short for Auxiliary Vape,
is a USB powered mechanical personal vaping device. I'm launching
this campaign on Indiegogo because I need your pledges to help pay
for tooling and equipment to ramp up into full fledged production.
Each and every one of your donations will put us one step closer in
the quest to create a truly American made product with as many
materials locally forged here as possible.
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1269264/files/20150304155924-Copyright_Gold.jpg?1425513564"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>
</p><p>By hitting our funding goal will be in a position to fund the tooling and machinery to get this product up and running. Your pledges will go to funding the tooling and equipment in order for this product to hit the marketplace. In return you, the people of Indiegogo, will receive high quality American made products at a discounted rate. The funding will
also go to some new machinery that I will need to purchase in order
to go into a production style environment. Every donation pledge
makes a difference and will get us one step closer to where we need
to be! If we do not hit our goal we will still do our best to make
Aux Vape ™ happen.

<p>
</p><p><b>Perks!</b></p>

</p><p>Literally, a 10 dollar bag o' metal
chips. I'll mail you some metal chips from our production once we are
up and running in a production format. If you'd rather not have the
metal chips mailed to you and would much rather contribute to the
campaign I'll graciously thank you for your donation! The materials will be brass or copper depending on what we are machining that day. Otherwise,
you'll get some metal chips as a novel thank you for helping to
establish a truly American made product! We're really doing it here!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1268950/files/20150304142036-metal_chips.jpg?1425507636"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

your juices for customers to come in and test out to find out their
favorite flavor? Are you tired of constantly having to leave behind

plugs connecting Aux Vape ™ with a proprietary junction box that
only will function with that box. If the device is stolen, it is

top cap. Coupled with a side-firing mechanical switch, copper main
tube, as well as brass end caps.  Aux Vape ™ by Steampunk Vaping is
composed of the highest quality materials, which are all locally
forged in the United States. The device performance is dependent on

outputs on a laptop or desktop computer provide 5 volts and 2 amps of
output current, or 10 watts, which is plenty of power for the device
to function properly. The device will also work with herbal
atomizers, as long as the resistance of the coils on the atomizer are
at or above 1.2 ohms. We do not suggest running the device below
1.2ohms on a computer based power source.</p><b>Our goals - Where we need to be!

</div>","Hey everybody! My name is Nick Morgan,
maker of any and all things awesome. A number of years ago I became
fascinated with working metal which has landed me here in front of
you here today on Indiegogo. I bring to the table a new brand of
product I call Aux Vape ™. Aux Vape ™, short for Auxiliary Vape,
is a USB powered mechanical personal vaping device. I'm launching
this campaign on Indiegogo because I need your pledges to help pay
for tooling and equipment to ramp up into full fledged production.
Each and every one of your donations will put us one step closer in
the quest to create a truly American made product with as many
materials locally forged here as possible.

By hitting our funding goal will be in a position to fund the tooling and machinery to get this product up and running. Your pledges will go to funding the tooling and equipment in order for this product to hit the marketplace. In return you, the people of Indiegogo, will receive high quality American made products at a discounted rate. The funding will
also go to some new machinery that I will need to purchase in order
to go into a production style environment. Every donation pledge
makes a difference and will get us one step closer to where we need
to be! If we do not hit our goal we will still do our best to make
Aux Vape ™ happen. 


Perks!

Literally, a 10 dollar bag o' metal
chips. I'll mail you some metal chips from our production once we are
up and running in a production format. If you'd rather not have the
metal chips mailed to you and would much rather contribute to the
campaign I'll graciously thank you for your donation! The materials will be brass or copper depending on what we are machining that day. Otherwise,
you'll get some metal chips as a novel thank you for helping to
establish a truly American made product! We're really doing it here!

The Aux Vape ™ Belt! ($25)

This pledge gets you (1) Aux Vape belt
branded product from us that is completely functional and is
something that you can use every single day. By selecting this perk
you get classic style in a true Aux Vape form and helps us out
getting us one step closer to our goal! The Belt is 54"" Standard
and is adjustable to fit anyone. I've wore one every day for 6 years
and is still going strong! Thanks for the support!

The Aux Vape ™ Shirt! ($25)

By pledging this perk you will get an
Aux Vape ™  Tee featuring our Copyrighted logo on the front of the
shirt! We will need your details on the size shirt
that you would like! Logo pictured above, when we have renders of the shirt on hand
we will post them up. 


The Aux Vape ™ USB Vape  Early Bird
Special! ($79) MSRP $139

By selecting this perk you will get (1)
Aux Vape USB powered mechanical Vape at a very special Early Bird
rate! Please note that this device needs to be ran with a 1.2ohm coil
as noted in our campaign. We will only be offering 500 of these
devices at this deeply discounted rate.The Aux Vape ™ USB
Vape – Indiegogo Campaign price

By selecting this perk you will get (1)
Aux Vape USB powered mechanical Vape. Please note that this device
needs to be ran with a 1.2ohm coil as noted in our campaign. If you
missed the early bird rate, sorry. There will be another opportunity
to catch another worm!

Aux Vape USB powered mechanical Vape. (1) Aux Vape Belt, and (1) Aux
Vape Tee. Please note that this device needs to be ran with a 1.2ohm
coil as noted in our campaign. Bundle it up, wear and use our brand
of products every day! *Image of the shirt will be posted with our logo when we get our rendering in.

For the shops! The Aux Vape ™ Vape
Bar! ($700) Indiegogo Intro Price!Are you a shop owner? Check
this out! While traveling across the country to different vape shops,
we noted that there appears to be something that could be incredibly
useful in your shop to free up your time to spend with your
customers. Are you a shop that uses battery powered mods for all of
your juices for customers to come in and test out to find out their
favorite flavor? Are you tired of constantly having to leave behind
the counter to go change a battery out for a customer to try a new
flavor of juice? Are you tired of batteries being stolen out of the
mods? We've got a solution for you! 

This is the Aux Vape ™ Vape Bar. The
Vape Bar gives you six fused powered auxiliary jacks, plus two courtesy USB
ports on the front of the box which serve as a charging station for
your customers' phones while they hang out at the shop finding their
perfect juice. The Aux Vape ™ Vape Bar features 1/4” Phone jack
plugs connecting Aux Vape ™ with a proprietary junction box that
only will function with that box. If the device is stolen, it is
rendered useless without the power supply being attached to it. This
gives you peace of mind, as theft happens everywhere and is an
unfortunate part of business.

For the shop, that wants some Steampunk
style and Flair:

The Aux Vape ™ Bar and Table setup.
($1100) Indiegogo Intro Price!

By selecting this perk you will receive
(6) Aux Vape mechanical vaporizers with one our Aux Vape power
distribution boxes, featuring (2) USB courtesy power output jacks for
charging a mobile device. You also get a hand crafted vape bar table
styled in true Steampunk style with burned gears, gold leafing of the
Aux Vape logo, along with the mod stands and all of the hardware to
assemble it yourself. This is the pinnacle of true functional art,
designed and intended to last a life time.

Take note as to how this device
functions! 


This device is specifically designed to
run at 1.2ohms, which is a common coil for the Kanger Subtank! Aux
Vape ™ will also work with an herbal atomizer, so long as the coil
is between 1.2-1.8ohms.

We specifically designed Aux Vape ™ 
around the Kanger Sub-tank, which is a socially accepted norm within
the industry that functions flawlessly. Aux Vape ™ features all
copper contacts with a self-adjusting industry standard 510 threaded
top cap. Coupled with a side-firing mechanical switch, copper main
tube, as well as brass end caps.  Aux Vape ™ by Steampunk Vaping is
composed of the highest quality materials, which are all locally

The project is being developed as a first experience in Canary Island, Spain. Last December 2014 we have received a recognition on behalf of Madrid´s Hall http://www.compromisoempresarial.com/carrusel/2015/05/startup-madrid-10-cooperacion-publico-privada-para-impulsar-diez-emprendimientos/ 

Our vision is to be able to grow adding info to our directory and reach many people around the world. We are convinced that this social initiative, that bets on social economies, will get a lot of people envolved in the 00Limits community.Supporting 00Limits you are going to help a lot of people surrounding you. The segment of people on wheelchairs is growing bigger. Social and demographic changes and our way of life are showing a continuous growth (car and working accidents, population aging, wars and diseases). 

We want to get far, do you want to come along? 


This is why we are asking for your help. We need to make this dream real and show there are no real limits in accessibility. The money we raise will be used to integrate persons, technology and knowledge. We are building a very usefull instrument; a platform that will serve on a daily bases to reach anywhere without obstacles. 

We need 40.000€.
10.692€ will be destined to hire a specialist in this environment to manage all the info of the accessible directory. This is one of the main elements, because offering a complete useful and up to date information, we will be able to truly help the community. The person to be hired will be someone using a wheelchair, we could not think of somebody better.25.184€  is the budget destined to technology for our mobile app. Right now what we are in the need of developing the app in a intuitive and easy to use way. All this development will make real our target in time and effort saving when we decide to plan our journey. 4.124€  is the sum we have destined to promotion in associations of people with this kind of problems. We will use this amount to print out flyers, journeys and events (such as meetings, events and congresses) to introduce our tool.We feel it is very important to spread out this campaign. We are aware of the economic situation, but it is not going to stop us in making an inclusive society. Spread out the word about this initiative and so we will prove that if everyone gets involved we will be unstopable. You can also help us just by acting as our ambassador. No need to give out any money. 


We need to increase our information flow, to make our data base bigger and so we wil become a reference in accesibility. You just need to tell us which places are accesible in your neighborhood, town or city. We will do the rest. You can do it using our web site www.00limits.com and in the landing page you will find ""Add your favourite place"". As rewards for your effort we have thought about some presents.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Following a successfully funded IndieGOGO campaign we anticipate that we will face many risks and challenges in the months to come.</div>
<div>The dual-charging facility of the Libero Phone Jacket is a key design criteria that maintains the integrity of the safety elements of the device. This is one design element in which we must include in our final design of the product. A poorly developed dual-charging technology may hinder the charging or sync ability  of the iPhone when connected through the Libero Phone Jacket. As such, we must endeavor for a  design that has no affect on this, but allows for dual charging through one wall charger.</div>

Features and Specifications

- Lock it and leave it

The Libero Phone Jacket is designed to be locked with the phone inside, so the phone or configuration settings can not be touched without damaging the case. Rest assured the phone will be getting used the way you configured it.
- Dual Charging
The Libero battery charges whenever the phone is charging, so it will never run out of batteries before your mobile phone. The Libero battery is rather small so the overall charge time will remain more or less unaffected.
- Walking Smartphone Protection
The Libero Phone Jacket is equipped with motion sensing technology that will distinguish when you are walking and can be configure to switch your phone to sleep when detected it is being used while walking.
- Music playback and Phone calls are Uninterrupted

Since the Libero functionality is achieved by pushing the phone's power button, music playback and phone calls will be unaffected.
The Libero Phone Jacket can be configured to allow the user to make or take phone calls at any time.















Risks & Challenges
The Libero Phone Jacket has been developed up to a second-prototype. This has given us confidence to prove the concept works and can be completed.
Following a successfully funded IndieGOGO campaign we anticipate that we will face many risks and challenges in the months to come.
The dual-charging facility of the Libero Phone Jacket is a key design criteria that maintains the integrity of the safety elements of the device. This is one design element in which we must include in our final design of the product. A poorly developed dual-charging technology may hinder the charging or sync ability  of the iPhone when connected through the Libero Phone Jacket. As such, we must endeavor for a  design that has no affect on this, but allows for dual charging through one wall charger.

energy -efficient . The battery life of up to 4 hours of continuous play time
blockbuster movies , or up to 6 hours for continuous playback.
The length of projection is from 20 to 200 cm, and its LED light can last 20000 hours thanks to the power save mode, and because of the LED technology it doesn’t heat up. Sharpness can be changed manually and automatically too. On the back it has a jack connect, or where you can attach even speakers, but if you didn’t have any, it can use your phone’s or tablet’s speaker. There is an USB spot on the bottom. At the same time it’s a docking station and the connection to the stand. For the safer pitching the two surfaces have magnet. You don’t want to use WiFi? With the help of the stand and a microUSB wire, you can connect your phone. The package contains a microUSB - HDMI inverter, so you can use HDMI, too.Because of its small size, you can take it anywhere, you don’t need cord, or socket. It hides perfectly  in a briefcase or even in a belt bag.As soon as the campaign started, I’ll keep you updated about our process.

damping intensity is also
adjustable.It has a unique dust-proof design, This dual adjustable 360-degrees friction hinge may be the smallest in the world, which takes me a lot of time to design and test it.

<p></p><p>DEVO-4DAC+ is an
Arduino shield based on MCP4728 12-bit, quad channel DAC from Microchip and
provides four analogue buffered or un-buffered outputs. Each output is capable
of providing 15mΑ in operation without the output buffer or 40mA when operating with
the buffer circuit. Each output can be separately configured to operate in
buffered or un-buffered state while the voltage gain is set-up using the
corresponding potentiometer from 1 to 11. The output buffer is a voltage
amplifier with external power source up to 26V. The maximum achievable amplifier
output voltage is External power supply – 1.5V. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1452078265/qbnxtg1elronjfugpdu7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>For
a single channel, the output voltage (Vdac) is given to the DAC in steps of ≈1.22mV
(maximum DAC output voltage of 5.0V). Vdac can be amplified using the onboard
voltage amplifier by selecting the desired voltage gain (Gain) and applying the
required external power source. Note that amplifier output (Vamp) can reach the
Vext voltage minus 1.5V (Vext – 1.5V). For example, if the desired output voltage
is in the range of 0V to 12V, Vext should be set at 13.5V (12V + 1.5V) and the
Gain must be set to 2.4 using the onboard potentiometer. In this particular
example, the output voltage steps are ≈2.93mV.
The user can select which voltage output (Vdac or Vamp) is routed to the actual
board output terminals by using the onboard jumpers. Some useful equations for
the voltage outputs are given below.<br/></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><p></p>

<p></p>
<p>The on-board voltage amplifier can be used
in case amplification is required to the voltage outputs from MCP4728. External
power supply should be connected to the VEXT and GND terminal pins. The
amplifier gain can be set separately for each channel using the on-board
potentiometers while the corresponding channel’s jumper should be placed at the
AMP position. The gain is decreased by turning the potentiometer clockwise and
is increased by turning it counterclockwise (Fig. 6) and could be set at any
value between 1 and 11.  </p>

Overview
DEVO-4DAC+ is an
Arduino shield based on MCP4728 12-bit, quad channel DAC from Microchip and
provides four analogue buffered or un-buffered outputs. Each output is capable
of providing 15mΑ in operation without the output buffer or 40mA when operating with
the buffer circuit. Each output can be separately configured to operate in
buffered or un-buffered state while the voltage gain is set-up using the
corresponding potentiometer from 1 to 11. The output buffer is a voltage
amplifier with external power source up to 26V. The maximum achievable amplifier
output voltage is External power supply – 1.5V. For
a single channel, the output voltage (Vdac) is given to the DAC in steps of ≈1.22mV
(maximum DAC output voltage of 5.0V). Vdac can be amplified using the onboard
voltage amplifier by selecting the desired voltage gain (Gain) and applying the
required external power source. Note that amplifier output (Vamp) can reach the
Vext voltage minus 1.5V (Vext – 1.5V). For example, if the desired output voltage
is in the range of 0V to 12V, Vext should be set at 13.5V (12V + 1.5V) and the
Gain must be set to 2.4 using the onboard potentiometer. In this particular
example, the output voltage steps are ≈2.93mV.
The user can select which voltage output (Vdac or Vamp) is routed to the actual
board output terminals by using the onboard jumpers. Some useful equations for
the voltage outputs are given below.

Board description
Connections
DEVO-4DAC+ is controlled by the I2C bus
according to the commands of MCP4728 DAC which hare sent from the default SCL
and SDA pins of the Arduino board. The output voltages are routed to standard
3.81mm terminal blocks along with the amplifier power supply. It provides additional
configuration pins for setting the board parameters as will be described in
next section.

DEVO-4DAC+ requires the power supply
signals and I2C bus signals in order to be operational. The rest pins are
optional in terms that they are used depending on end application requirements.
· 
5V and GND (Header) pins
The power supply pins for
the DEVO-4DAC+ shield. The 5V pin is directly connected to the MCP4728, so care
should be taken when applying the power source in order to not exceed the
maximum supply voltage (5V) of the MCP4728. 

· 
SCL and SDA pins
I2C bus signals which are
directly connected to the MCP4728 IC.
· 
PB0 and PB1 pins
PB0, PB1 pins can be used
for testing purposes and are connected to an on-board LED through 3-pin jumper.
· 
PB2 pin (LDAC)
PB2
pin is connected to the LDAC signal of MCP4728. LDAC is used to transfer the to
transfer the contents of the input registers to their corresponding DAC output
registers and to select a device of interest when reading or writing I2C
address bits.  When the logic status of
the LDAC pin changes from “High” to “Low”, the contents of all input registers
(Channels 1 - 4) are transferred to their corresponding outputs and all analog
voltage outputs are updated simultaneously. If this pin is permanently tied to
“Low”, the content of the input register is transferred to its output (OUTx)
immediately at the last input data byte’s acknowledge pulse. For more
information regarding LDAC pin and updating the output voltages please refer to
MCP4728 datasheet.
· 
PB3 pin (RDY)
PB3 pin is connected to
the RDY signal of MCP4728.This pin is
a status indicator of EEPROM programming activity. This pin is “High” when the
EEPROM has no programming activity and “Low” when the EEPROM is in programming
mode. It goes “High” when the EEPROM program is completed.
· 
A0 to A3 pins
These pins can be used for
debugging purposes when they are configured as analog inputs on the Arduino
board. The pins are connected via jumpers to the MCP4728 output channels.
· 
OUT1 terminal pin
Channel 1 output voltage
terminal pin. It is routed either to the amplifier output or directly to the
MCP4728 channel 1 output by a 3-pin jumper.
· 
OUT2 terminal pin
Channel 2 output voltage
terminal pin. It is routed either to the amplifier output or directly to the
MCP4728 channel 2 output by a 3-pin jumper.
· 
OUT3 terminal pin
Channel 3 output voltage
terminal pin. It is routed either to the amplifier output or directly to the
MCP4728 channel 3 output by a 3-pin jumper.
· 
OUT4 terminal pin
Channel 4 output voltage
terminal pin. It is routed either to the amplifier output or directly to the
MCP4728 channel 4 output by a 3-pin jumper.
· 
VEXT terminal pin
The (external) power
supply for the voltage amplifier when an amplification of MCP4528 output(s) is
desired. This pin should be connected to voltage source of 3V to 26V. NOTE that the maximum amplifier output
voltage is Vext – 1.5V.
· 
GND terminal pin
Ground connection for the
voltage amplifier.  
Configuration
DEVO-4DAC+ provides different configuration
options that could be set depending the application requirements. There are
configurations for the output terminals, the on-board LED and the DAC output
loop-back connections. The only required configuration in the connection of the
output terminals. The rest configurations are optional.
· 
Output terminal configurations

There is a single
configuration for each output channel which is done using a jumper. The
configuration sets the output connection of a single channel to the amplified
voltage output or to the DAC output. Fig 3 describes the configurations for the
four channels in the amplified and non-amplified versions. For the amplified
version, jumper should be placed at
the AMP position while for the non-amplified configuration the jumper should be
placed at the NAMP position.

· 
Digital output configuration (PB0 & PB1)
Using a single jumper (P5),
the user can use the on-board LED for testing purposes by connecting it either
on pin PB0 or PB1 of the Arduino board.

Using a single jumper for each
channel, the user can route the outputs from MCP4728 to the analogue inputs A0
to A3 of the Arduino board. The table below describes the connections for each
channel. Note that outputs from the DAC are connected to these pins, not the
amplified versions. Fig. 5 shows the jumper placement for connecting channel 1
output (DAC output) to the A0 Arduino analogue input.

Voltage amplifier settings

The on-board voltage amplifier can be used
in case amplification is required to the voltage outputs from MCP4728. External
power supply should be connected to the VEXT and GND terminal pins. The
amplifier gain can be set separately for each channel using the on-board
potentiometers while the corresponding channel’s jumper should be placed at the
AMP position. The gain is decreased by turning the potentiometer clockwise and
is increased by turning it counterclockwise (Fig. 6) and could be set at any
value between 1 and 11.

Numerous trips abroad enabled Avi to notice several times how essential some accessories are to daily life. After losing a dozen earphones and after repeatedly forgetting them when leaving for work, Avi decided to go see his friend Ari, a fashion specialist, to find a solution to this problem. During their meeting on this topic Ari told Avi he was having the same problem, but with his phone battery. Together they got to work and created after 6 months the first ultralight and fashionable down jacket in the world with integrated Bluetooth/jack earphones that are impossible to tangle up or lose, and with an integrated solar power bank. There you are, you know everything! With this Avi and Ari really hope to make your life easier.Our team is made up of fashion designers and entrepreneurs with over 20 years of experience.

What is it?
cradl cases are iPhone cases that both inspire and protect. They are ultra-slim and lightweight while also providing drop-tested, rugged protection. Our carefully designed cases allow for edge-to-edge swiping, great for access to your notification center along with any “landscape” apps, maximizing your device’s versatility and design.


Who created it?
cradl was started by a mother and daughter in Boulder, Colorado.


Where are the cases manufactured?
cradl cases (and packaging materials) are manufactured entirely in the United States.


How much does it cost?
The MSRP for the cradl iPhone 6s/6 case is $32 and the iPhone 7 case is $34. See the perks above to get great savings on a case for the iPhone 6s/6 and 7!


Do you have a website?
Please visit us at www.cradlcase.com. 



Why are you on Indiegogo?
We've had an outpouring of requests for a cradl design that fits the iPhone 7 and also other devices. This campaign's success helps us to finish the iPhone 7 molds that are underway and due to be finished later this month and begin manufacturing them right away. Reaching our stretch goal allows us to begin the molds for the Samsung Galaxy S8 in April and deliver those pre-orders during the summer.

 about the case…

Will it fit on my phone?
cradl cases currently are manufactured for the iPhone 6s/6. We will have cases to ready to ship for the iPhone 7 pre-orders in April.


Do you have more than one design?

Yes, our iPhone 6s/6 cradl cases are offered in a bubbles, blocks and tree design. Each design has multiple color combinations. Please visit our website at www.cradlcase.com to see the available options for each design.
Note: the iPhone 7 cases will be available in the bubbles and tree designs, only. The Samsung Galaxy S8 case will allow us to introduce a brand-new classic cradl design for the back of your device that provides awesome, artful protection.



What colors are available?
There are SO many choices! Visit our website at www.cradlcase.com to see them all. After all, a picture is worth a thousand words...


Will a cradl. case protect my phone?
Yes. We had a series of certified drop tests performed by D.L.S. Conformity Assessment in Illinois. They dropped a working phone with our case on it 25 different times from all different angles from at least 4 feet onto all different angles of the device. Afterward, there was no damage to the screen and the phone functioned perfectly. The materials being used for the landing area, per drop-test requirements, were a thin layer of plywood backed by a cement base. 25 is a lot of drops...


Is the case slim?
Very. At it's thickest, a cradl case adds just slightly over 3mm of thickness to your phone and weighs just 14 grams.


What comes with my order?
Each pre-order of the iPhone 7/6s/6 in the perk above will include a tempered glass screen protector.


Will I have to take the case off to access ports?
No! All ports are easily accessible without removing your case for most after-market charging cords and headphones. (In fact, we didn't test one that didn't fit.)

 shipping information…

When will my case ship?
In-stock iPhone 6s/6 cases will ship immediately. We expect to begin shipping the iPhone 7 cases in April and Samsung Galaxy S8 cases in the summer.


Do you offer worldwide shipping?
Yes!


How much is shipping?
Shipping charges will be available at checkout.


Would I be able to be a reseller or distributor for cradl?
Hell, yes. Please contact Elizabeth Dining at elizabeth@cradlcase.com for more information about this. 


 customer support…

Is there a warranty?
Yes, all of our cradl iPhone cases come with a Lifetime Warranty. This warranty covers manufacturing defects in the case. It does not cover gradual wear and tear throughout it's lifetime that is to be expected from normal use. We do not 100% guarantee the protection of your iPhone, no phone is unbreakable!

<h3>PRO-mounts</h3>
<p>PRO-mounts is a small GoPro / Action Camera accessories brand which found it roots 3 years ago in Amsterdam. Build from frustrations about the current (expensive &amp; poor serviced) GoPro accessories we decided to launch our own, highly serviced, accessories range in where we now see as our ultimate goals te create new innovative 'needs'  for serial GoPro / Action Cam users.</p>
<p>Based out of liberal Amsterdam we slowly spread our message in the market and raise good reviews. </p>
<p>With a personal background in International Sales &amp; Marketing we see Customer support one of our most important foundation to build our Company on.</p>
<p>With a GoPro reseller experience of over 6 years we learned what the serial GoPro user is looking for and how we kan keep them happy. Customer support, large assortment and instantly availability is what people praise us for (customer feedback still stands on 9.2/10). With this new PRO-mounts Scuba Filter Kit we know we are offering THE Diving Filter solution for many Pro-sumers &amp; frequent divers. We offer the solution to only need to buy 1 Filter Kit with 3 Filters and compatible with ALL GoPro camera's. By backing this Campaign you not only secure this great product for your personal use but at the same time you contribute to make our Story bigger.</p>We can tell you words, we can show you video's, but only by using it yourself you can convince others it is THE solution for Divers, especially if you plan to purchase a new GoPro (Hero5?) shortly. <p>With this campaign we aim for 5000$, why $5000? the answer is simple, we don't know!</p>
<p>But the one thing we do know, this PRO-mount Filter Kit is coming this summer, whatever happens. With the funds raised we can finance the tooling and keep improving our product.</p>
<p>Do you owe 1 or more GoPro's and did you invest is various Filters already? what happens when you buy the new Hero5, or the smaller Session =&gt; will you buy new $30 each filters again? or will you consider to buy the PRO-mounts Filter Kit with 3 Filters and Mounts for all mentioned GoPro cameras + on request we post you FREE of CHARGE the new Hero5 mount .

<p>Most of the equipment needed to start this business of printing your computer cases is already readily available. Except the most important part, the industrial scale 3D printer. This isn’t your simple desktop 3D printer that you can buy online for a few hundred bucks, we’re talking about something that would cost $30000 to buy from the market. Good news though, we already have a solution lined up for this problem, and the parts list for the designs total out to about $1500 at most. That's actually a very low number considering the market. Getting to that $1500 for the printer is the interesting question. If we get 165 people to reserve a print job for $10 each we have a printer, meaning we start printing. </p>

<p>As of November 11, 2016 we currently have a sample printer, and will soon have the capability to print test samples and then products for our customers.  This isn't the end goal, we need to go bigger, we need to go better.  Just like Steve Jobs and Bill Gates we are starting in a garage, but potential is vast.  Join our adventure!</p>

<p>Once we reach our goal we will keep you posted on the build and test process of our first printer.  From there is it a matter of getting through all of your orders.  With 3D printers, each print job goes a little differently, each design asks for different levels of finesse to cater to your request. Thus we will maintain a steady means of communication with every customer on their order via email newsletters on their build order, about the design, about the print process, about the finishing, and about the shipping. Newsletters isn’t enough though, we want to go further, make something that makes your heart jolt with excitement about your order just as much as we are excited about it. Each print job will have its own video log available for public viewing for current and future customers to see how print jobs progress and the different caveats of each computer case. This is your computer case we are talking about, why not know how it was made?</p>
