</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Quiet Night intelligently learns which music the child likes and automatically changes the music as the baby's brain grows.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Because the child is engaged and learning, they cry less, allowing you more sleep!</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most important realizations of Tom's research was that rather than the on and off mentality of adult humans, babies work differently. It takes a while for a baby to learn to pull on the handle and for them to learn that as long as they pull on the handle the music continues playing. But once they learn this and gain control over their environment they really do interact with the device extensively. 
</p>
<p>It is best not to give Quiet Night to your baby until his coordination is sufficiently developed - usually at about 4 months. If your young baby does not quickly learn to enjoy pulling the handle, take it away for a week or two and then try again.</p>
<p>Professor Tom tried the prototypes on many many children over twenty years and found that crying could be reduced by up to fifty percent.<br/></p>
<p>He additionally found that very young children like 'elevator music' and as children grow up they prefer more sophisticated music such as classical. Quiet Night will always automatically find the best music for your child's development.</p>

<h3>Questions and Answers</h3> <p></p>
<p><i><i><b>Q: What age children can use it?</b></i><br/>A: A child as young as 4 months to 3 years old can use the device, however every child develops at a different rate some children can't pull the handle until month 6, so don't give up easily!<br/></i></p>
<p><i><i><i><b>Q: How does it stop crying?</b></i><br/>A:  By keeping the little one engaged and giving them control over their environment professor Tom discovered  that your baby will cry less because it is engaged and is not looking for attention.</i><br/></i></p>
<p><i><i><i><i><i><b>Q: You say it stops crying by up to 50% is that guaranteed?</b></i><br/>A:  Obviously every baby is different and your baby will still cry(especially when hungry!) the late and great professor Tom found that on average a night with Quiet Night will reduce typical crying by 30% in most babies and up to 50% in some, he calculated that on average that was an extra hour of sleep for the parents.  </i></i><br/></i></i></p>
<p><i><i><i><i><i><b>Q: How does it develop my children's brain?</b></i><br/>A: Professor Tom discovered that children that used the device had a quicker preference for complex music which he believed is an indicator in brain development. Many studies have shown that music can improve a child's development some are listed here: </i></i><br/></i></i></p>
<p><i><i><i><i><a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2996392/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2936934/Piano-lessons-pay-Musical-training-child-boost-brainpower-20-later-life-researchers-find.html</a><br/><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Mozart-Effect-Children-Creativity/dp/0380807440"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Mozart-Effect-Children-Creativity/dp/0380807440</a><br/></i></i></i></i></p>
<p><i><i><i><i>Though question of the Mozart effect still needs further research and we hope that we will be able to input into these results once we start building long term data.</i></i></i></i></p>
<p><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><b>Q: Can you detect child development problems?</b></i><br/>A: At this point we don't know, it makes sense that we should be able to detect behavior anomalies across large data sets, we hope to work with the leading doctors in the field to find out....if you are a leading professional in child development and you are interested in working with us get in touch. We will never disclose any results unless you specifically ask and of course all data is confidential  and anonymized.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></p>
<p><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><b>Q: How much music does it come with?</b></i><br/>A: At least 125 tracks covering most clasical and soothing music music genres, including some white noise and other noise patters. Sorry rappers and hard rock we left you out....though you can add your own tracks so your little one can become a rock god!</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br/></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></p>
<p><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><b>Q: Can I add my own music?</b></i><br/>A: Yes, MP3 in the app....we may add support for a music store at a later date.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i><br/></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></p>

<p><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><b>Q: What type of phone do I need?</b></i><br/>A: If you don't purchase the base station you need an Apple iPhone or Android Phone or Tablet that is less than a year old. It may work on older phones and we may release for other OS systems but we can't promise it.</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></p>
<p><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><b>Q: Do I need a separate phone or tablet?</b></i><br/>A: If you don't purchase an optional base station then yes you will need to use a bluetooth compatible phone or tablet.</i></i></i></i><br/></i></i></i></i></p>

<p><i><b>Q: Does Tom's family still benefit from his legacy?</b></i><br/>A: Yes we have made sure that Tom's family has been part of the process and benefits from his legacy.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><i><b>Q: How many babies has it been tested on?</b></i><br/>A: We believe Professor Tom tested it on up to 100 babies over twenty years, including, we believe Princess Beatrice!</i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></i></p>
<p><i><i><b>Q: What??!??! How did Princess Beatrice have it as a kid?</b></i><br/>A: So the story goes that there was some connection between professor Tom and  Fergie, and when Beatrice was born Tom lent her one of the first devices. Apparently it worked very well and somewhere there is a letter from the palace thanking Tom for his wonderful device...trust us, we are trying to find the letter! </i></p>
<p><i><i><b>Q: Can you download extra music on the app?</b></i><br/>A: We plan to have both free and premium music options available on top of the 125+ handpicked songs available by default.<br/></i></p>
<p><i><i><i><b>Q: Who else helped Tom with the research?</b></i><br/>A: Tom's wife Sue Blackmore helped Tom with the concept and research and writes for several magazines and newspapers, blogs for the Guardian newspaper and Psychology Today, and is a frequent contributor and presenter on <a href=""http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/media.htm#Radio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">radio</a> and <a href=""http://www.susanblackmore.co.uk/media.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">television</a>. She is author of over sixty academic articles, about eighty book contributions, and many book reviews.<br/>Other people helped in his research as well, but many of these contacts were lost over the years, if you helped in the research and want a mention please do reach out.</i></i></p>

</div></div>","The revolutionary interactive music device that reduces night-time crying and helps develop your baby's brain in one simple product.





















The miracle of sleep Being a parent is never easy, we always want to give our child the best start in life, but the demands of parenting sometimes become overwhelming, especially on those sleepless nights of endless crying.
Quiet Night combines an interactive handle that a baby can pull, combined with an intelligent application that learns your child's musical tastes and then develops with your child.




The app and basestation come packed with over a hundred handpicked(by a child psychologist) songs. We will also add more to download as our research continues.




The solution is here and over twenty years of research and development have produced Quiet Night's unique and patented technology.  
The Science Over twenty years of Professor Tom's life revolved around research for Quiet Night, luckily we still have a video of Tom doing what he loved best, talking passionately about how and why Quiet Night works.

How Quiet Night works:



 Child pulls on the Quiet Night handle.


 When pulled the Quiet Night plays a song from its library of hundreds of child friendly melodies.


 The longer the child pulls the handle the more they like that piece of music.


 Quiet Night intelligently learns which music the child likes and automatically changes the music as the baby's brain grows.


 Because the child is engaged and learning, they cry less, allowing you more sleep!


One of the most important realizations of Tom's research was that rather than the on and off mentality of adult humans, babies work differently. It takes a while for a baby to learn to pull on the handle and for them to learn that as long as they pull on the handle the music continues playing. But once they learn this and gain control over their environment they really do interact with the device extensively. 

It is best not to give Quiet Night to your baby until his coordination is sufficiently developed - usually at about 4 months. If your young baby does not quickly learn to enjoy pulling the handle, take it away for a week or two and then try again.
Professor Tom tried the prototypes on many many children over twenty years and found that crying could be reduced by up to fifty percent.
He additionally found that very young children like 'elevator music' and as children grow up they prefer more sophisticated music such as classical. Quiet Night will always automatically find the best music for your child's development.

The Quiet Night
It contains everything you need to make Quiet night work including 125+ hand picked songs and the learning algorithms. Contains everything you need to use Quiet Night out of the box including the handle and wireless base station.

The basestation comes with pre loaded songs so you don't even need a wifi connection to use it, just plug it in and the rest is easy.
The basestation is mains powered and can be up to 10m (30feet) from the Quiet Night handle.
   The App This completely free app works with the Quiet Night and contains over 125+ hand picked songs with the option to download more.
Quiet Night does not just learn about your baby's musical preferences it allows you to see your child's development in real time. 
The app will be available for iOS and Android (see Q&A) for specific requirements. If you do not have a compatible phone or do not want to use your own you can always add the optional base station.




The app uses wireless bluetooth to detect if the handle is being pulled and should work within 10m (30feet).

With 802.11n, 1Gbps Ethernet, USB port, and OpenWRT based operating system, BeFree brings you the mobility, flexibility, and power of business-class routers. Because of the USB port, you do not need to take a power adapter with you anymore, you can just draw power from any USB equipped device like your notebook or powerbank. And that is not all! The BeFree is preconfigured to work with TOR and/or VPN services, so you take anonymity with you. You do not have to worry about censure in your area or spying government at all, your network traffic will get encrypted and anonymized with no inconvenience. With its easy to use graphical user interface, it is simple to setup and manage it, even for beginners, and for professionals, there is an advanced interface that provides you all the power of OpenWRT and similiar router firmwares.<p></p><p></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Main advantages of the BeFree:</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439062525/qzayulkgdk9yitcrukuk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>The main advantage of the BeFree router is its power in the body the size of a credit card. Literally no other router can give to you such abilities in measurement and price range of the BeFree, bringing you business-class routers possibilities for the price of an average home router. And as a bonus, all of the software running in the BeFree will be Open Source. Also, with support of OpenWRT package management, you can write your own extensions and applications, so you can use all of the performance the BeFree offers. With its quad-core CPU and 1GB RAM, you can operationalize almost any ARM software you could like. From the start, there will be BitTorrent client transmission available. </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What does the BeFree offer you?</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438966084/nbeylw5fz4pv0i0itqss.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>Access to every great feature is made in two ways. First, a simple and effortless elegant graphical user interface and second, more advanced with all the configuring left to the user. The BeFree router offers to you every feature you could possibly want from your router and even more. With an available USB port, the BeFree can be used as ethernet-to-USB or wifi adapter for your ultrabook such as ZenBook, MacBook Air, or others to provide stable and reliable online access anywhere on your travels. Simply connect a network cable to your ultrabook via USB and enjoy the Internet connection. With all of this, securing your Internet connection is easy as connecting a cable. It doesn’t matter if you are using the BeFree as a Access point, hotspot, adapter, or in any other mode, every connection flowing through the device can be torrified and/or VPNed.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getbefree.com/igg/anim4_2.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Three simple steps..</h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438966150/d4nxsp4hgssmgmjwb67n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Using the BeFree is meant to be simple and fail-proof with its default plug &amp; surf design.

With integrated OpenVPN solutions, you can use almost any VPN provider. It does not matter how many connected devices your VPN provider allows, with this, you can create your own home anonymous wifi and connect all of them. With our advanced software solution, there are practically no limitations. Just assign a static IP address for every device and choose which will get encrypted through TOR, VPN, or use a “chain“ mode and encrypt via both of them. With physical isolation, there is no need for worries about unwanted leaks any long. Even if your machine becomes compromised with malware capable of root/admin actions, there is almost no way they will be able to successfully attack our device via network, thanks to SELinux and our double firewall.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Full technical specifications</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438966230/phwzqp6vhi76bmjxnkos.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Timeline and prototyping</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438967583/wr5oa5lpre98e16pcxjz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>After leaks of classified informations from the NSA about spying on people in 2013, we became really worried about our privacy. So we wanted to do something about it, because all of the technology needed to protect everyone’s privacy was already here, but just was not good enough. A mini computer Raspberry Pi with wifi adapter as an onion router was a very good start, but available software was far from satisfying us. So we took source code of OpenWRT and started modifying it to fullfill our vision. In 2014, Alpha version of our OS running on the RPi was completed and running without any bigger problems. But because of hardware limitations of such devices, while we were designing PCB of BeFree, we had several main priorities, including pocket size, fast built-in wifi, 1Gbps ethernet, and a USB port. The latest version offers all of it in a credit card sized body. You can now stay connected wherever you go, but at the same time, stay anonymous and hackproof. After sucessful Indiegogo campaigning, production of devices will start at middle of October and first units will be shipped in November. Final source codes will be released at the end of September via Github.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Size of a Credit Card</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.getbefree.com/igg/bp_1.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Because our whole idea and original prototypes were based on the miniature computer, Raspberry Pi, we wanted to preserve the idea of credit card sized computers. Because of that, the BeFree measures exactly 8.5 x 5.4 cm and 1.35cm in its highest part, which makes it  your ideal partner on the road when you want to stay connected, and anonymous at the same time.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Power it from anywhere</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438967774/wnqsrydwhdztjweccle3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The BeFree can be powered from any USB port. You do not have to worry about carrying a special, big, and uncomfortable power source anymore. All you need is your notebook or powerbank. Just plug it in and enjoy the world of uncensured Internet!

With 802.11n, 1Gbps Ethernet, USB port, and OpenWRT based operating system, BeFree brings you the mobility, flexibility, and power of business-class routers. Because of the USB port, you do not need to take a power adapter with you anymore, you can just draw power from any USB equipped device like your notebook or powerbank. And that is not all! The BeFree is preconfigured to work with TOR and/or VPN services, so you take anonymity with you. You do not have to worry about censure in your area or spying government at all, your network traffic will get encrypted and anonymized with no inconvenience. With its easy to use graphical user interface, it is simple to setup and manage it, even for beginners, and for professionals, there is an advanced interface that provides you all the power of OpenWRT and similiar router firmwares.Main advantages of the BeFree:The main advantage of the BeFree router is its power in the body the size of a credit card. Literally no other router can give to you such abilities in measurement and price range of the BeFree, bringing you business-class routers possibilities for the price of an average home router. And as a bonus, all of the software running in the BeFree will be Open Source. Also, with support of OpenWRT package management, you can write your own extensions and applications, so you can use all of the performance the BeFree offers. With its quad-core CPU and 1GB RAM, you can operationalize almost any ARM software you could like. From the start, there will be BitTorrent client transmission available. What does the BeFree offer you?Access to every great feature is made in two ways. First, a simple and effortless elegant graphical user interface and second, more advanced with all the configuring left to the user. The BeFree router offers to you every feature you could possibly want from your router and even more. With an available USB port, the BeFree can be used as ethernet-to-USB or wifi adapter for your ultrabook such as ZenBook, MacBook Air, or others to provide stable and reliable online access anywhere on your travels. Simply connect a network cable to your ultrabook via USB and enjoy the Internet connection. With all of this, securing your Internet connection is easy as connecting a cable. It doesn’t matter if you are using the BeFree as a Access point, hotspot, adapter, or in any other mode, every connection flowing through the device can be torrified and/or VPNed.Three simple steps..Using the BeFree is meant to be simple and fail-proof with its default plug & surf design. After connecting ethernet cable to the device and USB cable to the PC, adapter mode will be automatically detected and all traffic will be by default torrified, providing to you security by physical isolation and no undesirable leaks that could lead to revealing your identity online. If only the USB cable is plugged in, the web interface will automatically bring up for next configuring.How it Works?By default, every connection made through the BeFree is encrypted via TOR network, but it is not limited only to it. With integrated OpenVPN solutions, you can use almost any VPN provider. It does not matter how many connected devices your VPN provider allows, with this, you can create your own home anonymous wifi and connect all of them. With our advanced software solution, there are practically no limitations. Just assign a static IP address for every device and choose which will get encrypted through TOR, VPN, or use a “chain“ mode and encrypt via both of them. With physical isolation, there is no need for worries about unwanted leaks any long. Even if your machine becomes compromised with malware capable of root/admin actions, there is almost no way they will be able to successfully attack our device via network, thanks to SELinux and our double firewall.Full technical specificationsTimeline and prototypingAfter leaks of classified informations from the NSA about spying on people in 2013, we became really worried about our privacy. So we wanted to do something about it, because all of the technology needed to protect everyone’s privacy was already here, but just was not good enough. A mini computer Raspberry Pi with wifi adapter as an onion router was a very good start, but available software was far from satisfying us. So we took source code of OpenWRT and started modifying it to fullfill our vision. In 2014, Alpha version of our OS running on the RPi was completed and running without any bigger problems. But because of hardware limitations of such devices, while we were designing PCB of BeFree, we had several main priorities, including pocket size, fast built-in wifi, 1Gbps ethernet, and a USB port. The latest version offers all of it in a credit card sized body. You can now stay connected wherever you go, but at the same time, stay anonymous and hackproof. After sucessful Indiegogo campaigning, production of devices will start at middle of October and first units will be shipped in November. Final source codes will be released at the end of September via Github.The Size of a Credit CardBecause our whole idea and original prototypes were based on the miniature computer, Raspberry Pi, we wanted to preserve the idea of credit card sized computers. Because of that, the BeFree measures exactly 8.5 x 5.4 cm and 1.35cm in its highest part, which makes it  your ideal partner on the road when you want to stay connected, and anonymous at the same time.Power it from anywhereThe BeFree can be powered from any USB port. You do not have to worry about carrying a special, big, and uncomfortable power source anymore. All you need is your notebook or powerbank. Just plug it in and enjoy the world of uncensured Internet! But remember that minimal power demand is 5V ~ 0.5A and recommended is 5V ~ 2A. Performace limitations and unstable systems can occur on under dimensioned power source.Contributor perks only for IndiegogoSpecial product boxIt does not matter which perk you buy.

<p>Following the same idea of help users in the mess of today Internet, we imagined George as a virtual butler which improves the way we will:</p>
<ul>
<li><i><b>CONTACT </b>people working on topics we're interested in the exact moment we need them (on-demand jobs, real-time appointments, location-based and topic-based chats or messages).</i></li>

<p>How can we do that?</p>
<p>Let’s start from social networks and blogs you use everyday but <b>we give you also the opportunity to manually add your hobbies</b>.</p>
<p>Bringing into our platform your posts, images, videos, links, texts you’re passionate to we have a start environment of your passions.</p>
<p>WE’RE NOT IMPORTING ANYTHING FROM THESE SOURCES!!!</p><p>We just read infos from these sources, fill your <b>Sonar map</b> and your <b>Profile Tags</b> and that’s it.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079555/files/20141208004731-2radar__1_-2.jpg?1418028451"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Next time you’ll use George, these informations will be retrieved from scratch.</p><p>Let's talk about a real application of George Butler.</p>
<p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">For instance, I would need a Florence-to-Milan trains timetable or Milan weather forecasts JUST tomorrow ‘cause tomorrow i’ve got a business trip to Milan.</span><br/></p><p>I mean… JUST tomorrow.</p><p>Such informations could be destroyed after my trip because when i then come back home i no longer need them.</p><p>How can i know i've a scheduled business trip to Milan? From my Facebook wall maybe, more frequently from my iPhone/iPad calendar or from my business mailbox.</p><p>This example also applies to people: because i’ll be at Milan tomorrow, it’ll be great to know if my favorite fashion blogger will be available for a shopping-assisted tour somehow during the day.</p><p>Also, it would be great to know if there are open photography exhibitions tomorrow in Milan….</p><p>Fashion or photography are some of my favorite hobbies.</p><p><i>…BUT JUST TOMORROW!!!</i></p><p>I really do not need a daily mail newsletter talking about photography events in Milan or fashion blogger tours if i know i can’t be physically there.</p><p><br/></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079564/files/20141208005100-Keywords-wordlecropped1.jpg?1418028660"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
<p><b>HOW IMPORTANT ARE KEYWORDS FOR OUR PROJECT</b></p>
<p>Inside George Butler one important role is being played by KEYWORDS.</p><p>""Fashion blogger"" or ""Photography events"" of the above example can be also called ""Keywords"".</p>
<p><b>Every information or person analyzed by our system is basically a sum of keywords.</b></p>
<p>For instance, if i like Apple smartphones, i can sum it with <b>“apple”</b> and <b>“i-something”</b> or <b>“apple” and “mac”</b>.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This is equivalent to do a Google search of these keywords.</span><br/></p>
<p>If 3 of my Facebook friends are fashion bloggers who love Prada or Armani, it’s 100% sure that “shoes” or “bag” are keywords that can be found inside their posts.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079669/files/20141208014839-3Newspapermagazine1.jpg?1418032119"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>Following this approach, <b>we can design your OWN MAGAZINE</b>.</p><p>A magazine is a collection of Keywords placed in a fantastic layout you can easily read or interact with.</p>
<p>George Butler will start with just one magazine which will contain only keywords you love more.</p><p>Keywords have the function to retrieve entire articles, images, videos or web pages.</p>
<p>In the future, it would be possible to create and share more than one magazine: that is useful when magazines become a collection of specific interests like “apple”+”mac” and “rim”+”blackberry” together in a “Smartphones” magazine or “prada”+”shoes” and “ferragamo”+”bags” in another ""Fashion and Luxury"" magazine.</p><p>Create more than one magazine is also useful when you want to publish more than one Job inside George Butler.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>BECOME A MICRO-JOBS WORKER WITH FEEDBACK</b></p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079570/files/20141208005348-20112242111212477801-1.jpg?1418028828"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>What about become an expert of Keywords we get updated every day?</p><p>That would be now possible with George Butler!</p><p>Some websites are becoming more and more popular offering micro-jobs like ""create a logo for 5$"" or ""promote your website for 5$"".</p>
<p>Nowadays workflow for this kind of jobs is, again, ""off-line"":</p>
<ol>
<li>someone offer a service</li>
<li>some other looks for this</li>
<li>...then buys it</li>
<li>the other party works on it (maybe his home or company computer)</li>
<li>at the end, the final result is sent over the web to the requester</li>
</ol>
<p>George Butler works in a different way.</p>
<p>Once checked out which expert is available NOW specifically for our favorite keywords and which are his/her skills, you have the possibility to:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>see his/her rating/feedback for his/her specific topics/fields (i.e. “fashion blogger” or “guitar player”)</b></li>
<li><b>check his/her previous works (Magazines or other layouts)</b></li>
<li><b>send him/her a REALTIME chat request</b></li>
<li><b>see his/her geo-location and availability to perform a specific job</b></li>
<li><b>buy a service from him/her (specific for job type)</b></li>
<li><b>leave a feedback/rating on how this expert made his/her job</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Today scenario works quite well for ""off-line"" jobs, it doesn't work for ""on-line"" requests.</p>
<p>Small jobs are becoming popular everywhere expect in the the place people would really need them (such as in developing countries).</p>
<p>Small jobs could be something like offer our time to someone else because we're considered ""expert"" in such field or help someone with a professional service offered in real-time such as a painter or electrician on Christmas or during public holidays.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1079573/files/20141208005742-2radar__1_-icon.jpg?1418029062"" src="""" style=""width: 151px; height: 151px;""/></p>
<p>This is very hard to achieve today within the combination of Google / Social Network / Mobile Apps.</p>
<p><i>It's hard to achieve because basically we don't know if THAT people which we strongly need in THAT particular circumnstance is available or not.</i></p>
<p>If we have a specific need in real time, we have to Google search or make a post on Facebook/Twitter or Linkedin.</p>
<p>That means a big effort to us: IT IS not in real time.</p>
<p><b>The same can apply for companies</b>: feedbacks and ratings are very important in a new world which is more connected than in the past and where each company product or service will benefit from comments and reviews from buyers or experts.</p>
<p><b>A great issue with nowadays technologies is that they are economic centric.</b></p>
<p><b>Informations or people come to us mostly ADVERTISED, not for a real interest from our side.</b></p>
<p>Google brings us <b>informations or people </b>by using an alghorythm which no one of us can control (ADWords for instance).</p>
<p>Social networks allows companies or individuals to create market campaigns based on our profiles, preferences so that informations we find on our surfing <b>are not the ones we're interested in but most probably the ones advertised</b>.</p>
<p>Social Networks like Facebook or Twitter normal user experience consists of viewing a maximum of 5 seconds per post and usually postst created by the same 5 people..</p><p>That said, we would like to improve the way you get benefits from the whole world around you... Please , support our project since the beginning! Thanks again :)</p>

<p>Finding the right person for the right service IN REAL TIME is also a problem George Butler wants to reduce.</p>
<p>You need a smartphone for that, you basically don’t have time / opportunity to find a computer while travelling in a city or out for holidays.</p><p>Maybe you can , but how difficult could be in a metro or walking down the street?</p>

George is a virtual butler which learns from our common activities such as reading informations and/or finding people available on Internet.Imagine a new Facebook or a smart Google which we can use as a butler every time we need.
George Butler is an Internet platform consisting of:

Web site portal
App for different platforms (iOS, Android, Nokia Symbian, BlackBerry)
In-app or in-web services to customize each user experience


In the anglo-saxons countries ""George"" is a common name to indicate british ""butlers"" or majordomos which help people somehow.
Following the same idea of help users in the mess of today Internet, we imagined George as a virtual butler which improves the way we will:

CONTACT people working on topics we're interested in the exact moment we need them (on-demand jobs, real-time appointments, location-based and topic-based chats or messages).
ALERT whether we’re close to a useful information or a person
SEE updated event infos we love most
BECOME popular workers on a specific field and offer our time and services to others.
IMPROVE our overall internet surfing activity by reducing time spent finding useful people and informations
IMPROVE the way we surf informations (text, image, video) by using better tools such as magazines or specific-to-field layouts
ALLOW companies or individuals from contacting us for promoting a service or a product: no more advertising, no more generic Linkedin/Facebook offerings, only smart PUSH for specific keywords we’re really interested in.


The real issue to become aware nowadays is that 100% of us are surrounded mostly by a lot of people and informations NOT USEFUL for our purposes.So we make Google searches, read digital too-much-generic magazines, contact people on social networks or chat-based services but, basically… often WE WASTE A LOT OF TIME on Internet finding really USEFUL things or people.Our social network walls are full of posts or images we will never read because even if it’s true they come from close friends it's also true we’re not often interested to friend topics.Our mailboxes are full of spam or promo messages we will never read.Maybe important messages are hidden in this chaos or they don’t have the right priority in our reading list.In fact, timing is a very important concept while talking about USEFUL informations/people.
HOW WE WANT TO REALIZE OUR IDEA
Basically, George Butler is an app which analyzes our behaviour in real time to show us just useful things.
Login is not just a login, it's an import process.No more spam, no more ads, dramatically reducing the total amount of time surfing the Internet.
How can we do that?
Let’s start from social networks and blogs you use everyday but we give you also the opportunity to manually add your hobbies.
Bringing into our platform your posts, images, videos, links, texts you’re passionate to we have a start environment of your passions.
WE’RE NOT IMPORTING ANYTHING FROM THESE SOURCES!!!We just read infos from these sources, fill your Sonar map and your Profile Tags and that’s it.
Next time you’ll use George, these informations will be retrieved from scratch.Let's talk about a real application of George Butler.
For instance, I would need a Florence-to-Milan trains timetable or Milan weather forecasts JUST tomorrow ‘cause tomorrow i’ve got a business trip to Milan.I mean… JUST tomorrow.Such informations could be destroyed after my trip because when i then come back home i no longer need them.How can i know i've a scheduled business trip to Milan? From my Facebook wall maybe, more frequently from my iPhone/iPad calendar or from my business mailbox.This example also applies to people: because i’ll be at Milan tomorrow, it’ll be great to know if my favorite fashion blogger will be available for a shopping-assisted tour somehow during the day.Also, it would be great to know if there are open photography exhibitions tomorrow in Milan….Fashion or photography are some of my favorite hobbies.…BUT JUST TOMORROW!!!I really do not need a daily mail newsletter talking about photography events in Milan or fashion blogger tours if i know i can’t be physically there.
HOW IMPORTANT ARE KEYWORDS FOR OUR PROJECT
Inside George Butler one important role is being played by KEYWORDS.""Fashion blogger"" or ""Photography events"" of the above example can be also called ""Keywords"".
Every information or person analyzed by our system is basically a sum of keywords.
For instance, if i like Apple smartphones, i can sum it with “apple” and “i-something” or “apple” and “mac”.This is equivalent to do a Google search of these keywords.
If 3 of my Facebook friends are fashion bloggers who love Prada or Armani, it’s 100% sure that “shoes” or “bag” are keywords that can be found inside their posts.
Following this approach, we can design your OWN MAGAZINE.A magazine is a collection of Keywords placed in a fantastic layout you can easily read or interact with.
George Butler will start with just one magazine which will contain only keywords you love more.Keywords have the function to retrieve entire articles, images, videos or web pages.
In the future, it would be possible to create and share more than one magazine: that is useful when magazines become a collection of specific interests like “apple”+”mac” and “rim”+”blackberry” together in a “Smartphones” magazine or “prada”+”shoes” and “ferragamo”+”bags” in another ""Fashion and Luxury"" magazine.Create more than one magazine is also useful when you want to publish more than one Job inside George Butler.
BECOME A MICRO-JOBS WORKER WITH FEEDBACK


What about become an expert of Keywords we get updated every day?That would be now possible with George Butler!Some websites are becoming more and more popular offering micro-jobs like ""create a logo for 5$"" or ""promote your website for 5$"".
Nowadays workflow for this kind of jobs is, again, ""off-line"":

someone offer a service
some other looks for this
...then buys it
the other party works on it (maybe his home or company computer)
at the end, the final result is sent over the web to the requester

George Butler works in a different way.
Once checked out which expert is available NOW specifically for our favorite keywords and which are his/her skills, you have the possibility to:

see his/her rating/feedback for his/her specific topics/fields (i.e. “fashion blogger” or “guitar player”)
check his/her previous works (Magazines or other layouts)
send him/her a REALTIME chat request
see his/her geo-location and availability to perform a specific job
buy a service from him/her (specific for job type)
leave a feedback/rating on how this expert made his/her job

Today scenario works quite well for ""off-line"" jobs, it doesn't work for ""on-line"" requests.
Small jobs are becoming popular everywhere expect in the the place people would really need them (such as in developing countries).
Small jobs could be something like offer our time to someone else because we're considered ""expert"" in such field or help someone with a professional service offered in real-time such as a painter or electrician on Christmas or during public holidays.

This is very hard to achieve today within the combination of Google / Social Network / Mobile Apps.
It's hard to achieve because basically we don't know if THAT people which we strongly need in THAT particular circumnstance is available or not.
If we have a specific need in real time, we have to Google search or make a post on Facebook/Twitter or Linkedin.
That means a big effort to us: IT IS not in real time.
The same can apply for companies: feedbacks and ratings are very important in a new world which is more connected than in the past and where each company product or service will benefit from comments and reviews from buyers or experts.
A great issue with nowadays technologies is that they are economic centric.
Informations or people come to us mostly ADVERTISED, not for a real interest from our side.
Google brings us informations or people by using an alghorythm which no one of us can control (ADWords for instance).
Social networks allows companies or individuals to create market campaigns based on our profiles, preferences so that informations we find on our surfing are not the ones we're interested in but most probably the ones advertised.
Social Networks like Facebook or Twitter normal user experience consists of viewing a maximum of 5 seconds per post and usually postst created by the same 5 people..That said, we would like to improve the way you get benefits from the whole world around you... Please , support our project since the beginning! Thanks again :)

GEORGE BUTLER IS A NEW WAY TO BE SOCIALInternet has changed our lives forever, more and more we can take notice of the following evidences:
growing number of people which are using it
growing number of informations that are available on it
growing number of small jobs complementary or not to our main activity
A very interesting point of view is that while industrialized countries are more than 90% internet-contributors and/or internet-readers, 75% of developing countries people do not have access even to a pc for personal use.That means countries like Africa have NO influence on the net: few people available, few informations provided.Those people have few chances to get real useful informations or to be in contact with ""useful"" people since USEFUL informations/people ARE FAR from them. Not only geographically.While speaking about the George Butler project, we refer to “FAR” like a content or a person WE’RE NOT PASSIONATE with.Living in a country like Africa for i.e. means we cannot easily contact a painter, an electrician or a medic in real time for help, support or ""on-line"" jobs/requests.""Technology is great only if it can help others to better living"".Having this in mind, George Butler goal is to use technology for what it has been invented: help the humans beings.George Butler will allow childrens, teenagers in developing countries to get in contact with professionals they need in real time or just will improve their lives having localized and useful informations.George Butler will allow a farmer to localized weather forecasts, splitted for tomatoes or eggplant fields.George will suggest african teachers which topics are useful for their classes regardless of the official programs.On the other side, George Butler will allow everyone in developed countries to offer a job to the community or just reduce surfing time by having only access to on-demand and localized informations.STAFFWho we are and who we are looking for
Lorenzo Codacci, CEOWorking since 1995 for IT most dynamic and innovative european companies (DADA.net/Buongiorno/TIM), our founder Lorenzo Codacci has a great experience with the web and mobile market.His main skills are enterprise mobile security and mobile device management: he was the first italian who installed a BES (BlackBerry Enterprise Server) in Italy in 2001.
Recently, he worked on two other startups concerning mobile smartphones in either enterprise or consumer markets: WeM and Emerture .
NGO experiences in Mali, Africa with an italian NGO called UnAltroMondo Onlus can be considered very important steps for representing the base of this new project, George Butler.George is a perfect fusion of his technology and social dreams.
---These are some of the skills we are looking to develop our platform:

Graphic Designers
iOS, Android Developers
WebSite backend developers
Beta testers
NGO partners

FUNDING & ROADMAP
This campaign will fund app and web site portal developing and marketing tools to let George be known as much as possible around the globe.
Crowd funding is social based: George is social based.
George Butler base technology and purpose has been imagined the first time on 2012 but the main idea has been improved a lot since 2 years.We started with the idea that each user around the globe would be happier if having a real time useful place to share informations and jobs with others in a great-looking manner.Better than Facebook, smarter than Google, more useful than e-mail.This is why we thought to Magazines, always having in mind an awesome app like ""Flipboard"" from which we grabbed the innovative idea of digital pages.
Our first crowdfunding target will be to let people create their own Magazines.You can import keywords from Social Networks or add them manually by using the top right ""+ button.Texts, images, videos will me temporarily imported for your personal usage, then destroyed, then again updated next time you'll use George Butler app.Magazines --> Personal Job --> AI (Artificial Intelligence) for Informations/People seekingThe above is schematically which platform we want to create with George Butler.Each Magazines should be a background for a hobby that could potentially lead to a new or existing Job.So, in our roadmap after magazines creation, we intend to create the Professional panel with the possibility to share your skills, experiences, magazines and so on.In the next developments, we would like to use A.I.D.A. (Attention|Interest|Desire|Attention) alghorytm to know which contents or people you manifest some interests.So, George Butler will NOT ask you keywords anymore. It will understand by itself.

RISKS & CHALLENGES
Developing a new platform is a risk by definition.
Apps or websites can be easily forgotten or not 100% represent customer needs as in the initial idea.
Also, once launched there is a lot of time needed to maintenance an entire new platform as George.
It is not just an app for us: it is OUR LIFE, meaning George represents the perfect mix of our technology and social desires.
That reason is the one which answers to these hurdles.
George is not something to ""maintain"" for us.
It is something to let grow up because it will help everyone to better living.
George will NOT be sold.
It is NOT a way to make profit.
Then, it will be FREE for everyone, no advertising on it.

Finally, if you don't have fund to contribute or just you can't, please word out about this initiative.
The final result depends on you also this way.
're we a TEAM now? :)

FAQs
Q: Are you working either on a web version?
A: George Butler has been thought to work in live mode.
Smartphones and tablets, mobile devices are becoming more and more popular in the world.
User interfaces are so easy that each every children could use without problems.Developing countries are adopting mobile faster than web, while on the other side mobile developed countries market is growing faster than expected and pc market is experiencing a brutal brake.
We believe mobile is the right target for George Butler, not the web.Finding informations when we're ""out there"", ""somewhere"" far from our homes.That's the potential our app would like to cover.
Finding the right person for the right service IN REAL TIME is also a problem George Butler wants to reduce.
You need a smartphone for that, you basically don’t have time / opportunity to find a computer while travelling in a city or out for holidays.Maybe you can , but how difficult could be in a metro or walking down the street?
Google searches or social networks browsing will continue to have a great rule on our usage of the Internet.
George borns as an alternative in situations while being far from a personal computer, or btw where we prefer to use a tiny device.
That said, we’re planning to release a web version also for improve Magazines complex layouts or future layouts we're planning to realize shortly.
It’s not easy to browse a multi-column or multi-rows digital magazine on a smartphone, that's the reason why George Butler will be available also in a convenient web format.  

Q: Why a Sonar view?
A: On most apps we can find Geo-location based maps.
These kind of maps measure the distance between you and a person or give you a satellite/real territory perception of what is around you geographically.
George Butler considers geo-position to be only one aspect of your proximity to a content or to a person.
Following are some key factors we’re developing in our affinity algorithm, which is called “GX”, George-Index.
The higher a GX is , the closest you’ll see this content/person to you.

Geo.position (if present)
Number of clicks on a specific content/person
Whether a content/person has only been viewed or opened in full details (i.e. a Person profile)
Feedback rating of a content/person
…

GX is a mathematical expression of the above parameters.Therefore, as Sonar maps typically represent the proximity of an object to you we want to immediately give you the perception of how close are informations and people from you regardless of the geographical distance.Q: Is George Butler an improvement of browser cookies?A: George GX alghorytm is somehow similar to browser cookies.Have you ever noticed some web pages prompt you ADs or pop-up of products similar to your last bought items?George works in a similar manner , but NO PERSONAL DATA will be shared with commercial web sites such as it happens in other systems.George Butler app uses your preferences to retrieve contents or similar keywords you can find useful.This process is dynamic, not static.As soon as you bought some product , George knows it's uncommon to buy another one similar next week.You can, of course, decide whatever topics and products you want to check now, maybe similar or not.Profile page inside our app allows you to decide exactly your preferences, timing for your keywords and so on.George is smart, not stupid! ;)Q: Which are the main differences between Flipboard and GeorgeA: Flipboard is static, George is dynamic.Static here is not something related to contents, it refers to the way people and contents are managed.Inside Flipboard you can decide which ""static"" newspapers or magazines you want to read.Inside George you'll find one day you want to read a local magazine, another day you want to read an African newspaper.Today you'd like to follow Chris from Nevada, tomorrow Elise from SouthAfrica.All is based on your behaviours which could change everyday or every month.Also, we're adding a second layer to George; contents you love more can be used as the basement for a new job.If you like your job, we can spread your hobby in a new dimension.You can gain money from your passions!Flipboard is just a read-only app while George allows you to interact with Professionals too.Contents lead you to people which loves the same things you love.Isn't great? ;)Q: Security: “Are my preferences and keywords securely stored?”
A: George Butler is a “one-shot” app.
That means every usage user PERSONAL informations will be completely deleted within the app.
Only PUBLIC informations will remains available on our platform, a web server we're developing which will be available since the second stage planned in our roadmap.
With PUBLIC informations we mean shared Magazines or public Jobs you’re offering to other users.
With PERSONAL informations we’re talking about:
- user data: name and surname, age, sex, city, address, country
- personal magazines: each magazine will be completely re-created next time you’ll use the appKEYWORDS and their occurences, instead, are the core of our app and they'll be stored inside each smartphone.iOS devices are more secure than Android or Windows phones or tablets.That said, we have a strong experience securing local mobile data using nowadays technologies.
This process of using local data is very fast and doesn’t involve any interactions from the users at all when it's in auto-mode.
Also, it’s secure ‘cause we don’t need to store PERSONAL data against federal laws and country legal rules.

<p>Hello! We are here to change the business world! We are 2 small business owners with a huge passion and vision and we are the founders of ENGAGED. I am Natalia, the visionary and my partner Tim is the logical one, but together, we make dreams a reality.</p>
<p><br/>We created ENGAGED because we understand the passion, the struggle, the determination and the reward that comes with owning a business. We have laughed, cried, won and lost and that's why we want to help put the control back in all business owners and managers hands. ENGAGED will help employers prevent and limit the #1 cause for<br/>lost time at work, unwanted cellphone use. It also helps keep your friends and family stay safe on the road by limiting distracted driving!<br/>This campaign will help us launch! After putting all of our money into the project we still need a little more to finish the development and start to change 1,000's<br/>of  small and large business owners.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Have you ever walked into a store or restaurant where the employee was texting and didn't even greet you? If so, let's change the world together!</p>
<p>I know what you may think, my boss would love ENGAGED but would I? That's the awesome part, we made it a WIN-WIN situation!<br/>Your boss cuts out time wasted on non-work activities and you earn rewards for following the rules!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are seeking $200,000 in funding. This money will be used to finish development, beta test, secure the first 2,000 customers, protect the patent by making it stronger, make all legal documents between clients, this will cover some equipment and travel fees, commission payment to our contact to the big companies and a little left over for a rainy day. The $200,000 will be the beginning of a new business culture filled with respect and passion for the jobs, and we love that! If we don't reach the goal, all of the funds will go to the development of the app.</p>
<p>If your friends or family own a business, share this with them, they will get the feels.</p>
<p>After many years of owning and operating our own cookie business Tim and I knew we couldn't be the only ones who felt trapped so we did the research! Polls, surveys, forbes.com, famous people, news channels, even our fellow small business owners all had the same feelings we did, it was there where we knew we could  not only make a difference in our business but in everyone else's as well. Not only will ENGAGED make life better for the employer but it will facilitate other managers and supervisors jobs. For a small business owner things like saving payroll and making customer service awesome could be the difference between feeding your family that night or not. Together we can engage in life and the task in front of us making the world better and safer.<br/> <br/>We will probably face several risks and challenges and we have certainly already faced MANY challenges to get here! That's why I said I'm the dreamer and Tim keeps<br/>us balanced, the perfect dynamic! We have the skills to bring ourselves and the company up when we are feeling down. We always start with the basics! We are positive, realistic and hardworking. We have met so many amazing people along the way from the first friend who believed in us to the investor who took time out of his day to write an email that said ""Your idea is stupid and will never work"", we learn and grow from everyone, we take notes and share our knowledge and we give back to the community. So far we have over 2,000 customers interested in ENGAGED but they will not sign until the product is completed. This has been our biggest hurdle thus far. Luckily, we know that Rome was not built in a day! Tim spent 20+ years working hard before he opened his first business and as a former professional athlete I am a firm believer in getting up after you've been knocked down in order to win! This combined with our insider business knowledge gives us an advantage in our industry.</p>
<p>Plus we give our awesome rewards to the users of ENGAGED so whether you are an awesome employee, a creative business owner, or a tech fan ENGAGED can sound like an appealing business.</p>
<p>We understand that money is not everything so if you can't contribute to the campaign please share our story with a local business or let us know where you have seen<br/>any unwanted cellphone use and help us spread the word with all the Indiegogo Share Tools!</p>

That's why I said I'm the dreamer and Tim keepsus balanced, the perfect dynamic! We have the skills to bring ourselves and the company up when we are feeling down. We always start with the basics! We are positive, realistic and hardworking. We have met so many amazing people along the way from the first friend who believed in us to the investor who took time out of his day to write an email that said ""Your idea is stupid and will never work"", we learn and grow from everyone, we take notes and share our knowledge and we give back to the community. So far we have over 2,000 customers interested in ENGAGED but they will not sign until the product is completed. This has been our biggest hurdle thus far. Luckily, we know that Rome was not built in a day! Tim spent 20+ years working hard before he opened his first business and as a former professional athlete I am a firm believer in getting up after you've been knocked down in order to win! This combined with our insider business knowledge gives us an advantage in our industry.
Plus we give our awesome rewards to the users of ENGAGED so whether you are an awesome employee, a creative business owner, or a tech fan ENGAGED can sound like an appealing business.
We understand that money is not everything so if you can't contribute to the campaign please share our story with a local business or let us know where you have seenany unwanted cellphone use and help us spread the word with all the Indiegogo Share Tools!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>It didn’t take long for the film to become a worldwide sensation.  Quigley 2 continues a new exciting chapter with Quigley and friends...</p>
<h3><strong>Quigley 2 Synopsis (c) 2017</strong></h3>
<p>Bob and his wife Artie run a non-profit toy and animal product company staffed with an epileptic and autistic workforce. Ro, a wealthy woman terrified of getting old, wants to rid the town of the toy company for financial gain and claims her goal is for progress. When Ro hires thugs Mitch, his cat Samson, Vinnie and Moe to destroy the toy factory, a prayer rings the emergency bell in heaven. Thurmond, a wingless angel, has been waiting a thousand years for another chance to earn his wings. Next in line on the heavenly roll call and fresh from teaching heaven’s canine angels dance team, Thurmond is chosen for the mission and given an option to pick an angel to accompany him and save the town. Since his only close friends are canine angels, he chooses two – Quigley and Knuckles. In a heavenly decision, the only human able to see Thurmond is Bob. Everyone else will see the dogs.  Quigley and Knuckles need to encourage the wingless angel and yet allow him to formulate his own plan that will reach beyond his self-imposed limits. Thurmond’s heavenly future will depend on what challenges and decisions he makes. Can the angels outsmart the thugs? Do Quigley and Knuckles posses hidden gifts and capabilities? Can the annual Christmas parade and toy give-away be saved? What can two dogs and an elderly wingless angel like Thurmond do to stop the mayhem? Oh so much to do and so little time to accomplish a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>Breaking news!</strong> As we roll out the IndieGoGo campaign we have the pleasure of announcing that TV's ""Murder She Wrote"" sheriff, <strong>Ron Masak</strong> will be appearing as the grandpa in Quigley 2. Ron will also be our honored spokesperson for our IndieGoGo pitch. Follow our campaign blog for more news.</p>

<h3>We ask your attention to the problem that is already on the threshold of our world. Lack of food for humanity in some regions of the globe. As well as the deterioration of the soil on earth. Our technology together with the equipment developed and produced by us will allow to avoid many problems faced by the farmer now. Namely, the lack of nutrition in the soil, lack of moisture, as dry years will become the norm in our time and rain does not fall in the main regions producing grain from April to June in the right amount. Our technology involves minimal work with the soil that would not impoverish it. Since all modern technologies used in agriculture today impoverish the soil and destroy its fertility. imagine if your house was demolished several times a year, and you were forced to constantly restore it, and in the end losing strength and patience, you whether Bo will die or leave it. So it is with living beings in the soil. Our technology also involves sowing without tillage directly into the ground at the level of the moisture horizon, which leads to an increase in yield by 20% and a reduction in the cost of machinery and fuel compared to intensive technology. That is, our technology not only protects the earth, but also causes less damage to the environment, since its application requires 40% less fuel per kilogram of production. we ask you not to remain indifferent to the problems of our time and if you do not even have money for this company , just help to spread this information.</h3>

<h3>REVOLUTIONIZING THE WAY WE EAT TORTILLAS</h3>
<div>
<p>Whether you grew up in a traditional hispanic household heating up tortillas on a comal or have used some other, equally cumbersome method to get hot tortillas on the table, you've likely been faced with the same problem as the rest of mankind throughout history–too few, too slow. The Nuni Toaster changes the game completely, offering a safer, faster, and more delicious method of preparing tortillas than ever before.</p>

<p>Growing up in a Hispanic household, I (Elliot) ate tortillas at every meal. My mom, who is now 59 years old, has prepared tortillas on a pan (or what is traditionally known as a comal) since she was 12. I calculated that over the 20 year period during which I lived at home, she had lost approximately 60 days to this labor intensive task. This revelation convinced me there had to be a better way to prepare hot tortillas at home.</p>

<h3>SIMPLE INNOVATION</h3>
<div>As the world's first tortilla toaster for home kitchens, the NUNI Toaster represents the height of progressive innovation. You'll never need to cook tortillas on a pan or in the microwave again! And yet, it's simple enough that anyone can use it - just drop your tortillas in the toasting slots and select one of five toast settings. In just about a minute, your tortillas will be toasted to perfection. Plus, there's no need to worry about safety - a rotating cover and electric shields are included to keep you safe.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465409318/DSC_1455_REVISED_uzpbfg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h3>SIMPLE INTERACTION</h3>
<div>Use the Nuni like you would an ordinary electric toaster: simply drop your tortillas into the six slots, turn the rotating oven up, and it will lock into place. Once the toasting cycle is complete, the oven will automatically disengage, leaving the now hot and tasty tortillas ready to eat. It's beautifully simple.</div>
</div><div>
<br/>
<h3>A BEAUTIFUL COLLISION OF MODERN + VINTAGE</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The modern, yet retro design of the NUNI Toaster fits even the most discerning kitchen decor. Its parallel heating elements are even fashioned after the grille of the classic 1957 Bel Air. The NUNI Toaster has taste, folks.</span></p>

Whether you grew up in a traditional hispanic household heating up tortillas on a comal or have used some other, equally cumbersome method to get hot tortillas on the table, you've likely been faced with the same problem as the rest of mankind throughout history–too few, too slow. The Nuni Toaster changes the game completely, offering a safer, faster, and more delicious method of preparing tortillas than ever before.

 
 
 


OUR STORY


Growing up in a Hispanic household, I (Elliot) ate tortillas at every meal. My mom, who is now 59 years old, has prepared tortillas on a pan (or what is traditionally known as a comal) since she was 12. I calculated that over the 20 year period during which I lived at home, she had lost approximately 60 days to this labor intensive task. This revelation convinced me there had to be a better way to prepare hot tortillas at home.








OUR TEAM OF ALL STARS

A COLOR FOR EVERY KITCHEN

We get design–and we get kitchens. So we know that there isn't always a ""one size fits all"" when it comes to color. That's why we're thrilled to introduce not just one color Nuni Tortilla Toaster, but five. That's right. Cinco. Functionality, meet design.


Aqua BlueJet Black Maize YellowSangria RedPaloma White













SIMPLE INNOVATION
As the world's first tortilla toaster for home kitchens, the NUNI Toaster represents the height of progressive innovation. You'll never need to cook tortillas on a pan or in the microwave again! And yet, it's simple enough that anyone can use it - just drop your tortillas in the toasting slots and select one of five toast settings. In just about a minute, your tortillas will be toasted to perfection. Plus, there's no need to worry about safety - a rotating cover and electric shields are included to keep you safe.





SIMPLE INTERACTION
Use the Nuni like you would an ordinary electric toaster: simply drop your tortillas into the six slots, turn the rotating oven up, and it will lock into place. Once the toasting cycle is complete, the oven will automatically disengage, leaving the now hot and tasty tortillas ready to eat. It's beautifully simple.


A BEAUTIFUL COLLISION OF MODERN + VINTAGE
The modern, yet retro design of the NUNI Toaster fits even the most discerning kitchen decor. Its parallel heating elements are even fashioned after the grille of the classic 1957 Bel Air. The NUNI Toaster has taste, folks.




THE GREATEST PERKS IN THE WORLD
Because you all have already been so supportive of our journey, we would dream of offering you nothing less than the greatest perks we can think of. Think we're missing something golden? Let our guys know so we can get it on here ASAP. This is a team effort, and we're excited you're on board! #TeamTortilla

WHAT YOU'LL GET
You are the most vital part of the Nuni Toaster project. Without you, we wouldn't be able to do any of this. Therefore, we want to treat you like your deserve.
Some things you'll get:


Some super awesome gear that only the best taco/tortilla fans deserve.
One of the very first Nuni Tortilla Toasters to ever exist. Made specifically for you.
The utmost and sincere gratitude of me, my family, and tortilla enthusiasts everywhere who (whether they know it or not) have been waiting their entire lives for this.







OUR COMMITMENT
The NUNI Toaster isn't just about a better way to prepare the food you love. We see the success of this project as a statement that culture, tradition, and innovation can not only coexist, but thrive together. 

We are committed to family.
We are committed to safety.
We are committed to excellence.
We are committed to you.







RISKS & CHALLENGES

When I began this journey, I had no concept of the magnitude of what I had just signed up for. The patent search, electrical engineering, food thermal engineering, industrial design, and intellectual property protection we walked through still makes my head spin. But we did it. We have overcome tremendous obstacles, and we're ready to take on the next challenge: the multi-billion dollar electric housewares industry. Here's what's challenging about launching a never-before-seen product in this space:

You can't just order a few products to be produced. Our manufacturers need a large quantity in order to begin production.
You have to pay up front. Our manufacturers also need payment for the production run before they can begin making NUNI Toasters.
Spreading the word to the masses is difficult! As a start up launching it's first product, our voice is still young. We need your help to create buzz about how cool the NUNI Toaster is.



HOW YOU CAN HELP

This is where you come in! You have the power to help us reach our minimum order quantity in order to get production off the ground. You have the power to pre-order your NUNI Toaster so that we can afford to pay our manufacturers up front. And most importantly, you are our best way to spread the word. Tell your mom, tell your friends, tell your boss - you are officially a part of our street team. If you want to see the NUNI Toaster become a reality as badly as we do, help us spread the word!




OTHER WAYS TO GET INVOLVED

Don't worry if you can't contribute. We understand. But don't let that prevent you from making an incredibly valuable contribution to our project. It will mean the world to us if you:

Give us a shout out on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or your own website.

Let our team know if there are any other perks you'd like to see!
Tell your friends about the incredible thing we've got going here

Go spend some extra time with your family. This world needs it.


And that's all we've got. We sincerely hope that you will support our dreams of an elegant and convenient tortilla toaster by buying one for yourself, giving one as a gift, or at the very least sharing the news about our launch. We're ecstatic about this opportunity and cannot wait to get a Nuni Tortilla Toaster in every home. In the meantime...

<p><u><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP SPREAD THE NETT</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>DON’T TELL EVERYONE…..JK ;)</li>
<li>Show this video to your upline and ask them about it. Seriously, this is probably the best thing you could do. That’s why I said it twice (continue reading for second mention).</li>
<li>Share this with that person whom ""they just know everybody""</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>WHY SHOULD I CONTRIBUTE?</strong></u></p>
<p>Have you asked yourself this yet? Why should you contribute and pledge your hard earned dollars to this campaign?</p>
<ul><li>Because what matters most in business (especially networking businesses) is relationships</li></ul>
<p>This campaign for Nett is not simply ANOTHER crm (customer relationship management tool). Nett is unique, in that, it takes your current habits of networking and gives you the data needed to make the right decisions about where you should spend your time.</p>
<p>If you’ve read this far, you understand that in our daily lives we meet people that we won’t remember in a year’s time. Yet we come across a new connection or idea that jogs our memory just enough to help us remember the location of where we were when we met someone who could help us. And yet with all of the networking and social tools available in our economy, there isn’t one that can organize our contacts by location. Personally...I think that’s a shame and this problem should be solved with Nett.</p>
<p><br/><u><strong>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</strong></u></p>
<p>The story thus far, entails a dreamer (Andrew) and his friend (John) working with a developer that quit before the product was finished. All businesses have set backs, I just view them as a setup for a better future.</p>
<ul><li>Our goal is $6,000. But honestly friends, my goal is 200 + contributors. This is CROWDfunding and my focus is serving YOU and YOUR NETWORK</li></ul>
<p>I believe that we can crush this. A lot of people contributing a little is the best way to get things done. The $6,000 will be going to the right development team to get the MVP out. I have some bids from different companies. I don’t want to hire the wrong person again so I’m being patient. 5% of this will go to Indiegogo, less than 5% will go to the founding team to have more time to serve YOU.</p>
<p><br/>The Perks you’ll receive are an extremely good deal! The Lifetime Value is literally the CHEAPEST Nett will ever be available. This is not a pop and drop company we’re building. This will last for as long as people use smartphones to manage their contacts. The annual subscription is only going to go up with the new features we will add in V1 and V2.</p>
<p><br/><u><strong>THIS IS BEYOND YOU AND I</strong></u></p>
<p>Hopefully you see my vision for what this can be in the not-so-distant future. By Pledging to Nett you will be apart of the innovators and visionaries who saw where the market was going. 5 years from now, will people still be passing out business cards...no. Nett will have a virtual business card and sync with your social profile. This will connect the internet to real live people.</p>
<ul><li>This can connect people and build healthy AUTHENTIC relationships for business people and networkers alike</li></ul>
<p>Plenty of people “network” and “make contacts”. Not enough people truly connect and remember the meaningful aspect of the conversation when they meet someone.</p>
<p><br/><u><strong>POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES</strong></u></p>
<p>In Chinese the word for “problem” is the same as “opportunity”. As in any business there are risks, the ones associated with this business are not perfectly clear.</p>
<ul><li>I believe that when there is an obstacle in your way it simply means other people quit before you did and there’s a way around it to your dream</li></ul>

<h3>Conceptualization of the Blueprint </h3>
<p>The one thing that I have learned from 2020 is the fragility of time and therefore the importance of developing the skill to manage it. Since middle school I have been trying different techniques for managing my time and energy. I resorted to making my own planners after realizing that the one-size-fit-all solution offered in the market couldn't possible work for every human because we all function differently. I wanted to focus more on efficiency than aesthetic appeal of managing time. </p>
<p>the Blueprint was conceptualized in April 2020, while I was reading the Phil Knight's memoire, Shoe Dog. World of Nike and the story of its product, inspired me to distilled my experiences and research into making a product to share with the world. I like helping people grow through systems thinking and designing. </p>
<p>Alot of thought, research and hours have gone into designing each page of all our 6 stacks. The Blueprint is a premium quality product which is locally sourced and handicrafted supporting a sustainable supply-chain. ​With the blueprint I aimed to disolve the market gap of planners that could work for people with different organization styles. After conducting surveys, beta tests and theoretical research I designed the Blueprint to enable not intimidate. I wanted to make planning interesting for everyone not just people who wanted aesthetically pleasing notebooks. </p>

Then connect your Wi-Fi enabled streaming devices like Apple TV, PS4, Xbox, Phone, Tablet, Computer etc to it and then open up your favorite streaming Apps on those devices to enjoy your favorite shows from anywhere in the world. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Connect devices using AlwaysHome App</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>If you travel light or prefer to do everything from computer/phone/ipad, AlwaysHome App all you need. The App is designed to connect your mobile devices to subscriptions without using the dongle. On your devices, just download, run and click to connect AlwaysHome App and then go ahead to open the streaming Apps to enjoy your favorite shows from anywhere in the world. It is that simple. This App runs on Android, Windows, iOS, Mac and Fire OS. (<i>AlwaysHome App </i><i>can not</i><i> be installed on some devices such as Apple TV, Roku, Xbox etc, for those devices, a dongle is necessary</i>) </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">It's not VPN, it is AlwaysHome</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>For people used or heard about VPN in the past, AlwaysHome runs different software stack and protocols that can connect to a residential place, rather than a data center server that VPNs or Smart DNS connect to. AlwaysHome users actually have a residential IP address when they access any websites. On the other hand, data center based VPNs are normally using IP addresses that allocated to businesses which makes them easier to be identified. You can google around “Why Do Some Websites Block VPNs?“ for more background information on why and how VPNs can get blocked by streaming sites.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Streaming Acceleration</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>When accessing streaming services from far away, AlwaysHome is 3-10 times faster than normal VPN and enables you to watch videos in full HD quality. For curious hearts, the technology we implemented is called WAN optimization, which has been widely used by a large company to connect their global offices and branches. </p>
<p>The technology is good for applications other than streaming as well. Through AlwaysHome, you get a faster email, research, collaboration, and pretty much faster everything, </p>

<br/>Set up my own home proxy</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>As shown in the following diagram, you can set up a home proxy right within your home, for your own use. When at out of the home, you can connect back through this proxy device to access in-home network devices (such as IP camera, printer, computers, etc) or streaming services, just like accessing them from home, even you are physically far away from home.</p>
<p>You can use a dongle as the home proxy or your own devices like Firestick or Android TV box, as long as you can install AlwaysHome App on it.</p>
<p>Because the home proxy is on your home network, your access to the internet will have your home IP address and to any website, the access is right from your home. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How to buy AlwaysHome on Indiegogo</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>You can find the perk(s) that fit your needs and then buy it. If you need multiple perks, just buy and pay for each one of them. Then we will set up the right configuration for you. If you purchase a dongle, we will preconfigure it as well and then ship it out. You will receive an email notification when things are shipped out. When receiving your order, it should take no more than a few minutes to get everything started, most of the time, it should be just plug&amp;play.  If not, please contact our support@homingsystems and describe in detail the symptom. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What AlwaysHome Is Not</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>AlwaysHome is NOT a replacement to your basic Internet service. The AlwaysHome runs on top of the Internet. So you can NOT use AlwaysHome at places that do not have basic Internet services such as home broadband (Fiber, DSL, etc), WiFi or 4G/3G. </p>
<p>AlwaysHome is NOT a replacement to streaming subscriptions such as Netflix membership.</p>

<h3 align=""center"">New Questions During Campaign</h3>
<p><strong>1) Why you have different shipping dates for perks and they are from the past?</strong></p>
<p>The original campaign started in Sept 2017, products were shipped out since Oct 2017. Now we are in the in-demand status and people can still get special deals here on Indiegogo. We have sold out some perks (some for multiple times) and we have put them back. That's why the shipping dates vary. Because the products are in stock, the shipping dates are always in the past when you look at it. </p>
<p><strong>2) I am an expat, I want to access US Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video, but I don't have family or friends that can host the home proxy for me, can you or your company host it for me?</strong></p>
<p>Because the home proxy has to be in a residence which makes it infeasible for us to host it for multiple users. You need to have a residential place to set up the home proxy in your home country. Nowadays, many people already have devices like Amazon Fire Stick at home, so just ask them to install and run the AlwaysHome App for you. There is also a feature coming up this month that will prevent your access to their internal network devices (only websites through their the home network) so they don't need to worry about security issues this may cause.</p>
<p><strong>3) I am not a technical guy and still a bit confused about the user license, could you explain more?</strong></p>
<p>We don't charge the use of the home proxy. We charge a subscription to each remote App account that is used to connect to the home proxy. We also charge a subscription to each remote dongle that is connected to the home proxy.<br/><br/>For example, David travels to Asia from time to time. He wants to keep watching US version of Netflix, Hulu and Xfinity show when he travels. He set up a home dongle at his New York home and then installed AlwaysHome Mobile on his Mac computer. In Asia, he opens Mac computer, starts the App and then watches all the shows he wants just like at home. For David, he needs to buy a dongle hardware and then pay for a subscription license for App account to run on his Mac.<br/><br/>Another example, John lives in Dubai with his family. He set up one home dongle at Florida home and then at Dubai home, he set up a remote dongle for his Apple TV and other devices to connect back to Florida home. His daughter would be able to watch streaming shows just like at Florida home. For this, he pays for the home dongle hardware and the remote dongle hardware and one subscription license for the remote dongle to run. He then purchased another subscription license for his App so he can use it on his iPhone/iPad when he is out of Dubai home. </p>
<h3 align=""center""><strong>Campaign</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1) None of the perks meet my needs, I need a customized configuration. So what should I do?</strong></p>
<p>You can claim multiple perks from our campaign. Order dongle and user license separately from different perks and combine them to meet your need. When adding dongle, use the perk that reads like ""add extra dongle (no shipping cost)"" in together with your other perk. This extra dongle perk has to be ordered when you have other otherwise there is no shipping address in the system so we never know it needs to be shipped.</p>
<p><strong>2) Can you ship on time? I want it as a holiday gift for my family, it’s important for it to get it before the holidays.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The campaign is now in in-demand and we normally ship within 1-2 business days after receiving your order. When you see your order is in ""lock"" state, that means we are processing your order to be shipped out. If you only order subscription license, we will setup things and email you the details so you can start using the service right away.</p>
<p><strong>3) 3-10 times faster internet, multiple device connectivity, space shifting revolution; seems too good to believe! Is this for real?</strong></p>
<p>We have come to the 3<sup>rd</sup> major release of our product and thousands of users have been using it ever since its advent in 2015 for the first time. Along the way, we solved quite some challenging problems so our stuff is not just an idea that just sprouted out of the box.</p>
<p>Although every user is different with the internet infrastructure he is using, 3-10 times faster is a norm and observed by our customers especially those in Asia, Africa, and Mid East.  </p>
<p>We offer the best price with the features untouched yet. That’s why we brought a software update which allows you to use your phone, tablet or streaming box as space shifted streaming device even without the dongle. Yes, it is real. Time to believe. </p>
<p><strong>4) How do you compare your pricing with VPNs?</strong></p>
<p>First of all, no VPN service out there can do what our solution can do. They normally get blocked by streaming service providers (a good search of ""Netflix block VPN"" will reveal the fact). We price the service in the lower end to mid range of all good VPNs. We are able to do so because our software is more efficient and cost less hardware resource to run. Also, our solution can leverage your home network bandwidth that you already have, that will reduce the number of servers we need to set up.</p>
<p><strong>5) I know networking, could you elaborate on how you measured network performance to support your acceleration claim?</strong></p>
<p>Measuring real-time network acceleration is just a piece of cake. We use mainly <a href=""http://beta.speedtest.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">speedtest.net</a> for this task. You can go to the platform and start to measure the download and upload speed of your network connection and compare it after connecting to the network with AlwaysHome.  And the results will look as just as ours. We have proven results from our customers around the world. </p>
<p>Note: the performance is subjected to ISP policy regarding bandwidth shaping, physical network bandwidth limit etc. Those are physical factors that AlwaysHome may not solve. However, almost all the ISP’s networks, we've tested have rendered the 3-10 network acceleration.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Features</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1) If the home proxy is down, can my remote devices fall to a server and access the blocked websites?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. You log in to the web portal with your account and configure your devices or dongle to use our servers deployed in US/UK/Korea/German etc. Or you can email us and let us know the home proxy is down and we will manually switch your App/dongle to connect to our servers within a few hours. Connecting to our server will NOT get Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video who are aggressively blocking access from public servers, including many VPNs and our servers as well. Connecting to our server will get you to Google, Facebook, YouTube etc which are blocked in some countries.</p>
<p><strong>2) How many users can the dongle support simultaneously</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>When using the dongle as the home proxy, we suggest limiting the CONCURRENT remote devices up to 5. When using the dongle as a remote device, technically there is no limit of devices that can be connected to it simultaneously. But we suggest not to surpass the number more than 10.  Please keep in mind that the bandwidth will be shared among all users. If you are using your own devices such as Amazon Fire Stick as the home proxy, we believe it can support more than 100 devices.</p>
<p><strong>3) I have an old phone, can I turn it into a home proxy?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it needs to be Android 4.4 or above, or iOS 10 or above. You need to make sure the AlwaysHome App keeps running all the time. That means you need to open the App and leave the screen saver off that the phone OS won't kill it even it is idling.  </p>
<p><strong>4) Between remote device and home proxy, is the communication going via the Homing cloud or directly between them? If it's the latter, how do communications traverse firewalls without port forwarding being set up? </strong></p>
<p>It is mostly the latter. Remote device and home proxy all connect to Homing Cloud and they will be instructed to start a process called NAT traversal which enables a direct communication without port forwarding. In most of the cases, NAT traversal can work successfully. From then on, user data will be exchanged between these two directly. In some rare cases, NAT traversal does not work and a direct link is not possible. Then a middle server doing the piggyback will be utilized so the communication between the two dongles will go through our mid server. </p>
<p><strong>5) What makes AlwaysHome stand out from the other VPNs in the market?</strong></p>
<p>VPNs are good under certain conditions. But they typically become hard to manage when the user count goes up. VPNs are designed for data encryption. When the user count goes high with its popularity, they become slower &amp; interrupted especially when the user can choose which server to get on. AlwaysHome is a cloud-based distributed server infrastructure that supports fault tolerance and great scalability to handle a large number of concurrent users.</p>
<p>VPNs are using standard protocols like PPTP，L2TP，OpenVPN which can be easily identified by “middleboxes” such as firewall or proxy or routers with DPI (deep packet inspection) capabilities. Those boxes can easily block VPNs once identified. AlwaysHome, however, employs proprietary protocols that are not known to middleboxes. It means AlwaysHome does not suffer the blockage that VPNs are subject to.</p>
<p>VPNs were designed to be a security solution, never meant to accelerate network performance. AlwaysHome, on the other hand, has a technology called WAN optimization. This technology can significantly accelerate network speed over a long distance on the Internet.</p>
<p>So, if you are a VPN user and still think that it’s one of the precious technologies in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, you definitely want to check out AlwaysHome.</p>
<p><strong>6) The dongle seems nicely designed. Can I use it at a coffee shop or hotel where there is no cable around and sometimes the captive authentication is needed?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, dongle support to use public Wi-Fi for the Internet to connect itself to and at the same time provide downlink Wi-Fi to attached devices. You can attach a phone/computer to the dongle and then login dongle’s web management interface and configure the dongle to use a surrounding Wi-Fi hotspot. It also supports those Wi-Fi hotspots using so-called “captive authentication” that requires one to agree on terms, input a code etc. before using the Wi-Fi.</p>
<p><strong>7) Does AlwaysHome support PPTP/L2TP or OpenVPN?</strong></p>
<p>No. The data protocols are proprietary and developed by the AlwaysHome developers.</p>
<p><strong>8) Technically, the dongle acts as VPN or proxy? </strong></p>
<p>Technically speaking, AlwaysHome is not VPN but rather a TCP proxy service, with network acceleration capability. It is not HTTP proxy though.</p>
<p><strong>9) I am worried that someone can access my home network through the home proxy. How can you guarantee security?</strong></p>
<p>That’s a valid concern and we have addressed it deeply. All devices including home proxy are all behind a firewall and do NOT require you to open a port on your home router for port forward function. So your home proxy and home network are still protected just like your other devices at home. Accessing home proxy can only be done through a valid and configured dongle or App that requires valid user login.</p>
<p>Accessing of in-home devices can be disabled if you want to share your home proxy with friends so that they can access streaming websites, but not your home network devices, like your PC or NAS.</p>
<p><strong>10) How stable is your system? Will there be network interruptions as other VPNs?</strong></p>
<p>Our system is based on a cloud-based distributed server infrastructure which has high fault tolerance and scalability. Unlike VPN, which is normally point to point, in our system, the finding and switching to a working server is done automatically against a pool of servers. So the whole system works more reliably than VPN.</p>
<p><strong>11) If I have an Android TV, can I connect it to the dongle and access content from out of my home country?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you need to install the App on your TV. So, as long as the Android TV has access to Google Play TV (AlwaysHome App is in Google Play) or you know how to install an APK manually onto your TV, you can watch your home country shows without geo-restrictions.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Shipping</strong></h3>
<p><strong>1) To which countries do you ship?</strong></p>
<p>We ship globally excluding the following which has been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria &amp; Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any of these countries we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more, however, we cannot guarantee the shipment's arrival.</p>
<p><strong>2) How will my order be shipped?</strong></p>
<p>We have already mass produced the dongle. So once you buy a perk, your order will be processed within 2-3 days and then shipped out. For US backers, it’s expected to be delivered within 3-4 days using USPS First Class (there will be an email from stamps.com with all the tracking number etc).</p>
<p>For Non-US backers, products will be shipped out from China factory directly. We normally employ one of the express companies, DHL/FedEx etc and you normally receive the delivery within a week after shipping. On occasions post service is used for some hard to reach areas or countries, please expect 2-3 weeks or even longer delivery time.</p>
<p><u><strong>It is very important to have your correct address and phone number on file. We had a couple of returns which are very high cost because of the incorrect address info.</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>3) Do I have to pay European VAT / GST?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the amount will depend on your country’s regulations. Only the dongle needs shipping though.</p>

Are you an expat and streaming lover? Do you own a Firestick or Apple TV? Are you a modern cord cutter? AlwaysHome is the right tool for you to take your streaming subscriptions to anywhere you go in the world. It connects your streaming devices like Phone, Computer, Firestick, Apple TV or even Smart TV to streaming subscriptions such as Netflix, Hulu or Amazon from anywhere in the world.
With a home proxy set up at home, you can access the in-home network from anywhere you go and access in-home streamings from Xfinity, Spectrum, Verizon TV, etc. Connect all your Wi-Fi devices with AlwaysHome companion dongle
 
If you have a streaming device like Apple TV or Xbox that need to connect to streaming subscriptions, you can use AlwaysHome companion dongle. The dongle is a customized mini Wi-Fi router that is plug & play and portable. It is super easy to use, just connect it to network and wait for its four lights turned on, then you have a new Wi-Fi hotspot in the room. Then connect your Wi-Fi enabled streaming devices like Apple TV, PS4, Xbox, Phone, Tablet, Computer etc to it and then open up your favorite streaming Apps on those devices to enjoy your favorite shows from anywhere in the world. 

 
Connect devices using AlwaysHome App
 
If you travel light or prefer to do everything from computer/phone/ipad, AlwaysHome App all you need. The App is designed to connect your mobile devices to subscriptions without using the dongle. On your devices, just download, run and click to connect AlwaysHome App and then go ahead to open the streaming Apps to enjoy your favorite shows from anywhere in the world. It is that simple. This App runs on Android, Windows, iOS, Mac and Fire OS. (AlwaysHome App can not be installed on some devices such as Apple TV, Roku, Xbox etc, for those devices, a dongle is necessary) 

 
It's not VPN, it is AlwaysHome
 
For people used or heard about VPN in the past, AlwaysHome runs different software stack and protocols that can connect to a residential place, rather than a data center server that VPNs or Smart DNS connect to. AlwaysHome users actually have a residential IP address when they access any websites. On the other hand, data center based VPNs are normally using IP addresses that allocated to businesses which makes them easier to be identified. You can google around “Why Do Some Websites Block VPNs?“ for more background information on why and how VPNs can get blocked by streaming sites.
AlwaysHome  runs through a home network

VPN normally runs through a data center server

 
Compare with VPN and Smart DNS
 

 
Streaming Acceleration
 
When accessing streaming services from far away, AlwaysHome is 3-10 times faster than normal VPN and enables you to watch videos in full HD quality. For curious hearts, the technology we implemented is called WAN optimization, which has been widely used by a large company to connect their global offices and branches. 
The technology is good for applications other than streaming as well. Through AlwaysHome, you get a faster email, research, collaboration, and pretty much faster everything, 


 
 

Set up my own home proxy
 
As shown in the following diagram, you can set up a home proxy right within your home, for your own use. When at out of the home, you can connect back through this proxy device to access in-home network devices (such as IP camera, printer, computers, etc) or streaming services, just like accessing them from home, even you are physically far away from home.
You can use a dongle as the home proxy or your own devices like Firestick or Android TV box, as long as you can install AlwaysHome App on it.
Because the home proxy is on your home network, your access to the internet will have your home IP address and to any website, the access is right from your home. 

 
How to buy AlwaysHome on Indiegogo
 
You can find the perk(s) that fit your needs and then buy it. If you need multiple perks, just buy and pay for each one of them. Then we will set up the right configuration for you. If you purchase a dongle, we will preconfigure it as well and then ship it out. You will receive an email notification when things are shipped out. When receiving your order, it should take no more than a few minutes to get everything started, most of the time, it should be just plug&play.  If not, please contact our support@homingsystems and describe in detail the symptom.

AlwaysHome Is Easy to Set Up
 
AlwaysHome is designed for average people who don't have much technical background. The system is very easy to set up. When you receive your order, the device(s) and account(s) are already preconfigured and tested working. All you need to do is plug and play. We also put up some instructional videos on our support website at www.homingsystems.com/support for your reference. Apps can also be download from links on the support page. As an example, here is a quick video to set up the Solo pack. There are videos for other perks on our support page.

 
Please note: If you receive the order and can not make it work in 20 minutes, it is likely you have missed some basis, so please contact our support@homingsystems.com to get things sorted out. Please provide as much detail as possible the steps taking and any symptoms you observed (screenshot or short video would be great information for us to quickly troubleshoot).

 
 
AlwaysHome Dongle Design
 

 
Dongle can be used at home or places with Wi-Fi
 

 
 
What AlwaysHome Is Not
 
AlwaysHome is NOT a replacement to your basic Internet service. The AlwaysHome runs on top of the Internet. So you can NOT use AlwaysHome at places that do not have basic Internet services such as home broadband (Fiber, DSL, etc), WiFi or 4G/3G. 
AlwaysHome is NOT a replacement to streaming subscriptions such as Netflix membership.
 
 




 

 

Since 2015 when we first launch the previous version in Kickstarter, AlwaysHome has been used by a few thousands of happy customers in many parts of the world such as US, Germany, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, Turkey, Mexico, Brazil, UAE, Saudi, South Africa, and Egypt.  We are happy to see a small idea turned into a well-designed product and makes an impact on people's normal life. We truly believe the AlwaysHome products have been and will revolutionize the way people experience surfing the internet while traveling. 
 
What Are in The Package

Once you buy our product, a single share on your Facebook profile or Twitter would definitely help this amazing piece of gadget reach another enthusiastic. Please note: in the package, the adapter is US style and optional. You can use your own regular charger if this US style does not fit well in your country. 

 
 
New Questions During Campaign
1) Why you have different shipping dates for perks and they are from the past?
The original campaign started in Sept 2017, products were shipped out since Oct 2017. Now we are in the in-demand status and people can still get special deals here on Indiegogo. We have sold out some perks (some for multiple times) and we have put them back. That's why the shipping dates vary. Because the products are in stock, the shipping dates are always in the past when you look at it. 
2) I am an expat, I want to access US Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video, but I don't have family or friends that can host the home proxy for me, can you or your company host it for me?
Because the home proxy has to be in a residence which makes it infeasible for us to host it for multiple users. You need to have a residential place to set up the home proxy in your home country. Nowadays, many people already have devices like Amazon Fire Stick at home, so just ask them to install and run the AlwaysHome App for you. There is also a feature coming up this month that will prevent your access to their internal network devices (only websites through their the home network) so they don't need to worry about security issues this may cause.
3) I am not a technical guy and still a bit confused about the user license, could you explain more?
We don't charge the use of the home proxy. We charge a subscription to each remote App account that is used to connect to the home proxy. We also charge a subscription to each remote dongle that is connected to the home proxy.For example, David travels to Asia from time to time. He wants to keep watching US version of Netflix, Hulu and Xfinity show when he travels. He set up a home dongle at his New York home and then installed AlwaysHome Mobile on his Mac computer. In Asia, he opens Mac computer, starts the App and then watches all the shows he wants just like at home. For David, he needs to buy a dongle hardware and then pay for a subscription license for App account to run on his Mac.Another example, John lives in Dubai with his family. He set up one home dongle at Florida home and then at Dubai home, he set up a remote dongle for his Apple TV and other devices to connect back to Florida home. His daughter would be able to watch streaming shows just like at Florida home. For this, he pays for the home dongle hardware and the remote dongle hardware and one subscription license for the remote dongle to run. He then purchased another subscription license for his App so he can use it on his iPhone/iPad when he is out of Dubai home. 
Campaign
1) None of the perks meet my needs, I need a customized configuration. So what should I do?
You can claim multiple perks from our campaign. Order dongle and user license separately from different perks and combine them to meet your need. When adding dongle, use the perk that reads like ""add extra dongle (no shipping cost)"" in together with your other perk. This extra dongle perk has to be ordered when you have other otherwise there is no shipping address in the system so we never know it needs to be shipped.
2) Can you ship on time? I want it as a holiday gift for my family, it’s important for it to get it before the holidays.
Yes. The campaign is now in in-demand and we normally ship within 1-2 business days after receiving your order. When you see your order is in ""lock"" state, that means we are processing your order to be shipped out. If you only order subscription license, we will setup things and email you the details so you can start using the service right away.
3) 3-10 times faster internet, multiple device connectivity, space shifting revolution; seems too good to believe! Is this for real?
We have come to the 3rd major release of our product and thousands of users have been using it ever since its advent in 2015 for the first time. Along the way, we solved quite some challenging problems so our stuff is not just an idea that just sprouted out of the box.
Although every user is different with the internet infrastructure he is using, 3-10 times faster is a norm and observed by our customers especially those in Asia, Africa, and Mid East.  
We offer the best price with the features untouched yet. That’s why we brought a software update which allows you to use your phone, tablet or streaming box as space shifted streaming device even without the dongle. Yes, it is real. Time to believe. 
4) How do you compare your pricing with VPNs?
First of all, no VPN service out there can do what our solution can do. They normally get blocked by streaming service providers (a good search of ""Netflix block VPN"" will reveal the fact). We price the service in the lower end to mid range of all good VPNs. We are able to do so because our software is more efficient and cost less hardware resource to run. Also, our solution can leverage your home network bandwidth that you already have, that will reduce the number of servers we need to set up.
5) I know networking, could you elaborate on how you measured network performance to support your acceleration claim?
Measuring real-time network acceleration is just a piece of cake. We use mainly speedtest.net for this task. You can go to the platform and start to measure the download and upload speed of your network connection and compare it after connecting to the network with AlwaysHome.  And the results will look as just as ours. We have proven results from our customers around the world. 
Note: the performance is subjected to ISP policy regarding bandwidth shaping, physical network bandwidth limit etc. Those are physical factors that AlwaysHome may not solve. However, almost all the ISP’s networks, we've tested have rendered the 3-10 network acceleration.
Features
1) If the home proxy is down, can my remote devices fall to a server and access the blocked websites?
Yes. You log in to the web portal with your account and configure your devices or dongle to use our servers deployed in US/UK/Korea/German etc. Or you can email us and let us know the home proxy is down and we will manually switch your App/dongle to connect to our servers within a few hours. Connecting to our server will NOT get Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Instant Video who are aggressively blocking access from public servers, including many VPNs and our servers as well. Connecting to our server will get you to Google, Facebook, YouTube etc which are blocked in some countries.
2) How many users can the dongle support simultaneously?
When using the dongle as the home proxy, we suggest limiting the CONCURRENT remote devices up to 5. When using the dongle as a remote device, technically there is no limit of devices that can be connected to it simultaneously. But we suggest not to surpass the number more than 10.  Please keep in mind that the bandwidth will be shared among all users. If you are using your own devices such as Amazon Fire Stick as the home proxy, we believe it can support more than 100 devices.
3) I have an old phone, can I turn it into a home proxy?
Yes, it needs to be Android 4.4 or above, or iOS 10 or above. You need to make sure the AlwaysHome App keeps running all the time. That means you need to open the App and leave the screen saver off that the phone OS won't kill it even it is idling.  
4) Between remote device and home proxy, is the communication going via the Homing cloud or directly between them? If it's the latter, how do communications traverse firewalls without port forwarding being set up? 
It is mostly the latter. Remote device and home proxy all connect to Homing Cloud and they will be instructed to start a process called NAT traversal which enables a direct communication without port forwarding. In most of the cases, NAT traversal can work successfully. From then on, user data will be exchanged between these two directly. In some rare cases, NAT traversal does not work and a direct link is not possible. Then a middle server doing the piggyback will be utilized so the communication between the two dongles will go through our mid server. 
5) What makes AlwaysHome stand out from the other VPNs in the market?
VPNs are good under certain conditions. But they typically become hard to manage when the user count goes up. VPNs are designed for data encryption. When the user count goes high with its popularity, they become slower & interrupted especially when the user can choose which server to get on. AlwaysHome is a cloud-based distributed server infrastructure that supports fault tolerance and great scalability to handle a large number of concurrent users.
VPNs are using standard protocols like PPTP，L2TP，OpenVPN which can be easily identified by “middleboxes” such as firewall or proxy or routers with DPI (deep packet inspection) capabilities. Those boxes can easily block VPNs once identified. AlwaysHome, however, employs proprietary protocols that are not known to middleboxes. It means AlwaysHome does not suffer the blockage that VPNs are subject to.
VPNs were designed to be a security solution, never meant to accelerate network performance. AlwaysHome, on the other hand, has a technology called WAN optimization. This technology can significantly accelerate network speed over a long distance on the Internet.
So, if you are a VPN user and still think that it’s one of the precious technologies in the 21st century, you definitely want to check out AlwaysHome.
6) The dongle seems nicely designed. Can I use it at a coffee shop or hotel where there is no cable around and sometimes the captive authentication is needed?
Yes, dongle support to use public Wi-Fi for the Internet to connect itself to and at the same time provide downlink Wi-Fi to attached devices. You can attach a phone/computer to the dongle and then login dongle’s web management interface and configure the dongle to use a surrounding Wi-Fi hotspot. It also supports those Wi-Fi hotspots using so-called “captive authentication” that requires one to agree on terms, input a code etc. before using the Wi-Fi.
7) Does AlwaysHome support PPTP/L2TP or OpenVPN?
No. The data protocols are proprietary and developed by the AlwaysHome developers.
8) Technically, the dongle acts as VPN or proxy? 
Technically speaking, AlwaysHome is not VPN but rather a TCP proxy service, with network acceleration capability. It is not HTTP proxy though.
9) I am worried that someone can access my home network through the home proxy. How can you guarantee security?
That’s a valid concern and we have addressed it deeply. All devices including home proxy are all behind a firewall and do NOT require you to open a port on your home router for port forward function. So your home proxy and home network are still protected just like your other devices at home. Accessing home proxy can only be done through a valid and configured dongle or App that requires valid user login.
Accessing of in-home devices can be disabled if you want to share your home proxy with friends so that they can access streaming websites, but not your home network devices, like your PC or NAS.
10) How stable is your system? Will there be network interruptions as other VPNs?
Our system is based on a cloud-based distributed server infrastructure which has high fault tolerance and scalability. Unlike VPN, which is normally point to point, in our system, the finding and switching to a working server is done automatically against a pool of servers. So the whole system works more reliably than VPN.
11) If I have an Android TV, can I connect it to the dongle and access content from out of my home country?
Yes, you need to install the App on your TV. So, as long as the Android TV has access to Google Play TV (AlwaysHome App is in Google Play) or you know how to install an APK manually onto your TV, you can watch your home country shows without geo-restrictions.
Shipping
1) To which countries do you ship?
We ship globally excluding the following which has been flagged by courier services as restricted or high risk: Belarus, Cote d'Ivoire, Cuba, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, North Korea, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Syria & Zimbabwe. If you would like a shipment to any of these countries we will make alternative arrangements that may cost more, however, we cannot guarantee the shipment's arrival.
2) How will my order be shipped?
We have already mass produced the dongle. So once you buy a perk, your order will be processed within 2-3 days and then shipped out. For US backers, it’s expected to be delivered within 3-4 days using USPS First Class (there will be an email from stamps.com with all the tracking number etc).
For Non-US backers, products will be shipped out from China factory directly. We normally employ one of the express companies, DHL/FedEx etc and you normally receive the delivery within a week after shipping. On occasions post service is used for some hard to reach areas or countries, please expect 2-3 weeks or even longer delivery time.
It is very important to have your correct address and phone number on file. We had a couple of returns which are very high cost because of the incorrect address info.
3) Do I have to pay European VAT / GST?
Yes, the amount will depend on your country’s regulations. Only the dongle needs shipping though.
4) How can I be a distribution partner or reseller of AlwaysHome?
We'd love to hear from you! Please contact:  contact@homingsystems.com
We are also open for custom requests for leveraging our technology core and platform for your business goals.
Refund policy
AlwaysHome complies with Indiegogo refund policy. You can cancel the backing before the order is processed (status turned to be LOCKED). In general, there is NO refund after the products have been shipped. 
If you bought the product by mistake, you can contact AlwaysHome customer satisfaction team through support@homingsystems.com. We normally ask you to return the product and then issue the refund. Please bear in mind that we will need to deduct the fees and charges that we already paid from the total refund.

<p><strong>P.S.</strong>: WowTimeKey's logo is full of secrets (some well hidden). We will talk about it later, after showing WTK's many advantages.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511616743/lpvhdej86fwuwro0yttc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>DETAILING</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>42% larger keys</strong></p>
<p>With <strong>7 keys per line</strong>, each key is 42% larger than in QWERTY and its variations (QWERTZ, AZERTY...). It makes all the difference to get exactly what you want to type, and faster. <strong>QWERTY has 10 keys</strong> per line for numbers / letters. You can see in the image below that WTK letter keys are much larger.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511233640/wtckjsgi809quidrnxlb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Vowels in the base line</strong></p>
<p>Almost every syllable has a vowel. Having the 5 vowels centered in the keyboard (third line / base line), syllables will be formed easily.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Typing concentrated in the base line</strong></p>
<p>Today, with QWERTY, the distribution of typing in 4 lines is 5%, 50%, <strong>30%</strong>, and 15% (rounded mean). In WowTimeKey: 5%, 30%, <strong>50%</strong>, and 15%, with typing concentrated in the so called base line of physical keyboards.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Made for English</strong></p>
<p>“H” is the exception in the alphabetical order. Please, believe me, it’s not an ego trip (my name is <strong>H</strong>élio <strong>H</strong>issao S<strong>h</strong>insato...). “Th” is the most used bigram (pair of letters) in English, with 3.2%. Its position make it easier to type ""the"", ""has"", “she”, “he”, “sh”, “wh”, “lh”, and “ch” too.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511233698/coawnj1xudqq6nilnqfw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Made for more than 160 languages</strong></p>
<p>WTK has neighbor keys for very used words. English: as, at, go, he, if, in, me, my, no, of, on, up. Other languages: as, da, de, di, ei, el, em, he, il, in, io, la, le, me, mi, ni, no, nu, oi, ou, un...</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Made to write faster</strong></p>
<p>WTK has neighbor keys for other bigrams very used in several languages: ad, al, ca, ed, fe, fi, fo, ha, id, lh, ly, po, pr, qu, rk, sh, st, th, ts, wh…</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Choose from 2 typing modes</strong></p>
<p>The WTK for smartphones has two modes: <strong>key touch </strong>only, and <strong>border touch</strong>. The typing mode will be selected in “Config” like other configurations in smartphones.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Key touch</strong></p>
<p>Selecting “<strong>key touch </strong>only” mode, WTK will work like any other keyboard, but with the advantage of 42% larger keys, the most efficient distribution of letters ever, and the smart usage of the 1 sec. touch resource.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>All variations of each letter in the same screen</strong></p>
<p>Like in other keyboards for smartphones, touching each letter key for one sec. you will access variations of the letter, but WTK shows, in the same screen, special characters of each letter for more than 160 languages based in the Latin writing system. See below the example for ""a"", the letter with more variations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511622040/affvhar51jgyinptaiab.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>One sec. touch for upper case letters</strong></p>
<p>In the ""<strong>key touch </strong>only"" mode, the default for one sec. touch is the upper case of each letter, making it faster to type names, abbreviations, and start new phrases. Versions personalized for languages that use special characters will have specific defaults (coming next): á, é, í, ó, ú, à, è, ì, ò, ù, ä, ë, ö, ü, ê, ã, ñ, ç, etc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Border touch</strong></p>
<p>With the ""<strong>border touch</strong>""<strong> </strong>mode, we take advantage of the larger keys to introduce functionalities that speed up typing. This mode is recommended for smartphones with reasonably large screens (very common nowadays), and good sensitivity.</p>

<p>Selecting “<strong>border touch</strong>” mode, with a single touch at the borders of 2 or 4 keys, you will be able to type very used: bigrams, special characters, letters with accent, words (personalized for each language), and all the upper case letters.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>One touch for upper case letters</strong></p>
<p>With the ""<strong>border touch</strong>""<strong> </strong>mode, touching the superior border of each letter, you will get the upper case version of the letter.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Not just speed</strong></p>
<p>Even if you think you type fast enough now, you can be benefited reducing the amount of typing, and letting your fingers travel small distances to type commonly used words. WTK can, possibly, cause less stress, and reduce joints' injuries.</p>
<p>My dream (I believe it’s not so crazy): I imagine some years from now researchers finding evidence that people who adopt WowTimeKey get more intelligent, augmenting their IQ. I think it is really possible because people will probably create new synapses in the process of finding the most efficient way to type syllables, words, and signs, and setting their mind to think ahead of just the next letter. People may consider typing this way tiresome for their brain at the beginning, but it gets easier and easier very fast. Kids may even consider instigating this learning process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TIMING</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Free download</b></p>
<p>Programming started as planned (January 8). The virtual keyboard for Android smartphones is now available at Google Play (since May first). </p>
<p>I had to spend my own savings, so the first version do not have predictive text yet. It should be added for English in August. Even without it, I think you will notice that it makes sense migrate to WowTimeKey. Being rational, you will see that it’s time to leave QWERTY.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Installing</strong></p>
<p>Go to Google Play -&gt; Categories -&gt; Tools -&gt; Type <strong>WowTimeKey</strong> to search -&gt; Download it.</p>
<p>In order to activate (example for Samsung devices): Config -&gt; General management -&gt; Language -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Configuring enter methods (a blue link at the bottom of the box) -&gt; Activate <strong>Wow </strong>-&gt; Go back one screen -&gt; Keyboard -&gt; Select <strong>English (US) Wow</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>For 160 languages now</strong></p>
<p>In the first phase (Android), we will make the keyboard available for 160 languages. There are probably more, but I could not confirm other languages in independent realiable sources.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>Latin Writing System</u></p>
<p><strong>Very used internationally</strong>: English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, Italian.</p>
<p><strong>Europe / Middle East</strong>: Albanian, Alemannic, Aragonese, Aromanian, Arpitan, Asturian, Azeri, Basque, Bavarian, Bosnian, Breton, Cassubian, Catalan, Cornish, Corsican, Crimean Tatar, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Dutch Low Saxon, Emilian-Romagnol, Esperanto, Estonian, Extremaduran, Faroese, Finnish, Frisian, Friulian, Gagauz, Galician, Greenlandic, Hungarian, Icelandic, Irish, Karakalpak, Kurdish, Ladino, Latgalian, Latvian, Ligurian, Limburgish, Lithuanian, Lombard, Low Saxon, Lower Sorbian, Luxembourgish, Maltese, Manx, Mirandese, Neapolitan, Norman, North Frisian, Northern Sami, Norwegian, Nynorsk, Occitan, Palatinate, Picard, Piedmontese, Polish, Ripuarian, Romani, Romanian, Romansh, Samogitian, Sardinian, Saterland Frisian, Scots, Scots Gaelic, Serbocroatian, Sicilian, Silesian, Slovak, Slovene, Swedish, Tarantino, Turkish, Turkmen, Upper Sorbian, Uzbek, Venetian, Voro, Walloon, Welsh, West Flemish, Zazaki, Zeelandic.</p>

<p><strong>Americas</strong>: Aymara, Guarani, Haitian, Inupiak, Nahuatl, Navajo, Papiamento, Pennsylvania German, Quechua, Sranan.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>Cyrillic</u></p>
<p>For the next phase, but designed already: Russian, Abkhazian, Avar, Bashkir, Belarusian, Bulgarian, Buryat, Chechen, Chuvash, Eastern Mari, Erzya, Kalmyk, Karachay-Balkar, Karbadian, Kazakh, Kirghiz, Komi, Komi-Permyak, Lak, Macedonian, Moksha, Moldavian, Mongolian, Ossetic, Rusyn, Sakha, Serbian, Tajik, Tatar, Udmurt, Ukrainian, Western Mari.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><u>Greek</u></p>
<p>For the next phase, but designed already: Greek.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Speech recognition and AI included</strong></p>
<p>Android’s resources like speech recognition, AI suggesting next words, will be included.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why to go beyond USD 25,000</strong></p>
<p>If we raise more than we are asking for, we will be able to start the next phases earlier, like the iOS version, and the prototype of the physical keyboard (designed already).</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>60 min. in QWERTY reduced to 36 min. in physical WTK</strong></p>
<p>Just mentioning, the physical WTK has 19 innovations registered in the patent, and will make possible to type in 36 min. (mean) what is now done in 60 min. with QWERTY.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>More to come</strong></p>
<p>Next improvements include an optimized version – completely designed – for languages that use accents to speed up typing even more, based in their specific needs. Keyboards for Cyrillic and Greek are designed too, and will be added in the next steps, so that all countries and official/ local languages of EU, for example, will be benefited soon. The timing for all the other writing systems will depend on the support received.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>TO WOW OR NOT TO WOW</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Not just a logo</strong></p>
<p>Let me tell you about the logo. Every time I found a way to improve the keyboard (19 innovations), I had a “wow” moment. Then, at the end of the process, I decided to celebrate, my way, writing a visual poem. Having the word “wow” in my mind, I created what I later decided to use as the brand name and logo.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511615567/u8l8hu0skoyssprl2hdv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Logo is full of secrets</strong></p>
<p>Maybe you’ve seen a person yelling in the 2 moving images. Good catch if it is the case, but... If you are a geek, or at least curious, I tell you that you can find 30… 60… hidden words, images, secrets. Here is a clue: it is full of references to “wow” moments in science, technology, culture, being human! Now, if you are curious, try to find them, and talk about your discoveries. It can be a good brain power test. I’m trying to say what “wow” means to me, and I hope we can share this connection, a particular way to look at us, humans.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>P.S. 2</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately adults in general did not believe in the keyboard’s advantages I mentioned in the invitation, and most did not even visited the page. You can believe in everything I say. I can, at least, prove right now that it's true my statement that the logo is full of secrets (there are probably other unintentional meanings).</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Time for enchantment</strong></p>
<p>Being a sociologist, I know that some people will criticize me for talking about a “wow” world, instead of world’s problems. In my defense, I say that there are moments for criticism, and moments for joy. We should celebrate the quite few moments of enchantment. And no, I am not endorsing the Brazilian government by using the 4 colors of the flag.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Friends matter</strong></p>
<p>I want to make public my gratitude to my friends, designers Augusto Citrangulo, Léia Emy Yamachi, and Luis Alexandre Lara. They gracefully used their minds and time helping me to decide about shades of color, suggesting ways to personalize letters, and helping me to achieve the proportions I wanted in the visual poem. Other friends contributed with their opinions and suggestions before I had this campaign ready to go: Frederico Catapani (with video too), Jorge Tateishi, Marisa Camargo, Rachel Moreno, Rudah Galli, and Suzel Figueiredo. Thank you all!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">In front of a graffiti at Beco do Batman - Vila Madalena - Sao Paulo (Dec. 14, 2017)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What? Sociologist?</strong></p>
<p>I am a sociologist, with bachelor’s degree from USP – University of Sao Paulo, and master’s degree from UCONN – The University of Connecticut. My professional area is Market and Public Opinion Research – Market Intelligence nowadays. Experienced analyst, projects' manager, director of business areas in renowned companies, and served as director and vice president of the national professional association, as well as president of its council. Uhnnn... Maybe you can have more confidence in me if I tell you that I am also an electricity technician, and frequented 2 semesters of mechanical engineering.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>A nonsense inertia</b></p>
<p>Inventor is my “B” side. When I was about 12 y.o. my mother bought a typewriter to me and my sisters. I was enchanted by the looks! It had a light green – almost blue – rigid plastic exterior. Really beautiful. Then I looked at the keys. It was so… nonsense! Only decades later I read that keys were placed in that way to minimize jamming, type bar clashes. At that time I thought someday somehow someone somewhere would come up with something, a somewhat better solution. Then the electric typewriter appeared, the PC, and many other devices. And QWERTY stayed alive with no more reasons to exist other than… inertia.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>If not now, then when?</strong></p>
<p>When I was about to turn 50, I remembered having this thought about QWERTY. Then: Well, if nobody succeeded in making a better keyboard in all these years, I will take this task.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>99% perspiration</strong></p>
<p>The moments of inspiration (19 innovations) are just part of the story. In order to make the best keyboard for people all around the world, I studied the characteristics and needs of more than 200 languages, and had to make a good use of my analytical experience, taking into account lots of variables. And here we are. You and I.</p>

</div></div>","P.S.: WowTimeKey's logo is full of secrets (some well hidden). We will talk about it later, after showing WTK's many advantages.

DETAILING
42% larger keys
With 7 keys per line, each key is 42% larger than in QWERTY and its variations (QWERTZ, AZERTY...). It makes all the difference to get exactly what you want to type, and faster. QWERTY has 10 keys per line for numbers / letters. You can see in the image below that WTK letter keys are much larger.

Vowels in the base line
Almost every syllable has a vowel. Having the 5 vowels centered in the keyboard (third line / base line), syllables will be formed easily.
Typing concentrated in the base line
Today, with QWERTY, the distribution of typing in 4 lines is 5%, 50%, 30%, and 15% (rounded mean). In WowTimeKey: 5%, 30%, 50%, and 15%, with typing concentrated in the so called base line of physical keyboards.
Made for English
“H” is the exception in the alphabetical order. Please, believe me, it’s not an ego trip (my name is Hélio Hissao Shinsato...). “Th” is the most used bigram (pair of letters) in English, with 3.2%. Its position make it easier to type ""the"", ""has"", “she”, “he”, “sh”, “wh”, “lh”, and “ch” too.

Made for more than 160 languages
WTK has neighbor keys for very used words. English: as, at, go, he, if, in, me, my, no, of, on, up. Other languages: as, da, de, di, ei, el, em, he, il, in, io, la, le, me, mi, ni, no, nu, oi, ou, un...
Made to write faster
WTK has neighbor keys for other bigrams very used in several languages: ad, al, ca, ed, fe, fi, fo, ha, id, lh, ly, po, pr, qu, rk, sh, st, th, ts, wh…
Choose from 2 typing modes
The WTK for smartphones has two modes: key touch only, and border touch. The typing mode will be selected in “Config” like other configurations in smartphones.
Key touch
Selecting “key touch only” mode, WTK will work like any other keyboard, but with the advantage of 42% larger keys, the most efficient distribution of letters ever, and the smart usage of the 1 sec. touch resource.
All variations of each letter in the same screen
Like in other keyboards for smartphones, touching each letter key for one sec. you will access variations of the letter, but WTK shows, in the same screen, special characters of each letter for more than 160 languages based in the Latin writing system. See below the example for ""a"", the letter with more variations.

One sec. touch for upper case letters
In the ""key touch only"" mode, the default for one sec. touch is the upper case of each letter, making it faster to type names, abbreviations, and start new phrases. Versions personalized for languages that use special characters will have specific defaults (coming next): á, é, í, ó, ú, à, è, ì, ò, ù, ä, ë, ö, ü, ê, ã, ñ, ç, etc.
Border touch
With the ""border touch"" mode, we take advantage of the larger keys to introduce functionalities that speed up typing. This mode is recommended for smartphones with reasonably large screens (very common nowadays), and good sensitivity.
New functionalities
Selecting “border touch” mode, with a single touch at the borders of 2 or 4 keys, you will be able to type very used: bigrams, special characters, letters with accent, words (personalized for each language), and all the upper case letters.
One touch for upper case letters
With the ""border touch"" mode, touching the superior border of each letter, you will get the upper case version of the letter.

One touch for very used bigrams
Touching the borders horizontally, you will get very used bigrams / words:
With the bigrams, you will reduce your typing. Just mentioning, in the physical keyboard, with more space, we could use this resource in another level.
One touch for very used words
Touching the borders of 4 keys, you will access very used English words. Each language will have its personalized set of words coming next (French, Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Italian are already designed).

Easy to memorize
Having space for 30 of the most used words, we found a playful way for you to memorize them easily.
Vertically
I’m (ok). What (was) that about with “all will have”, and out there (you) are like (you) don’t want this know-how for you ever. Anyone get something here, right? Just the…
Horizontally
– I’m all (set). (Out) there this (is) ever(y)thing. – What will (happen)? Are (you) know(ing) any(thing) here that (I) have (to)? – Like how one (is) right about (to), and don’t forget? Just without (fear)! (I) want you (to see) some (of) the…
Another mnemonic trick
There is another mnemonic trick. We put various words next to letters that will help you remember where the words are: what (w h t), that (t h a), about (a b), will (w l), have (h a e), and (a d), like (l i e), don’t (d), for (f o), one (o n), get (g), right (r), just (j u).
Smart way to write
Our selection of words and bigrams allows you to write faster: adhere (a+d+here), adjust (a+d+just), alone (a+l+one), another (an+ot+he+r), ant (an+t), anthem (an+the+m), anyhow (any+how), anyone (any+one), anything (any+thing), anywhere (any+w+here), arc (ar+c), ark (ar+k), arm (ar+m), art (ar+t), ashes (as+he+s), ask (as+k), ate (at+e), awesome (a+w+e+some), ball (b+all), ban (b+an), band (b+and), bar (b+ar), bare (b+are), bat (b+at), bathing (b+a+thing), before (b+e+for+e), behave (b+e+have), bet (b+et), bin (b+in), bit (b+it), bone (b+one), boring (b+or+in+g), brand (b+r+and), bright (b+right), bus (b+us), business (b+us+in+es+s), but (b+ut), call (c+all), can (c+an), candy (c+and+y), car (c+ar), care (c+are), cartoon (c+ar+to+on), cat (c+at), clever (c+l+ever), clone (c+l+one), cut (c+ut), dandy (d+and+y), dare (d+are), den (d+en), doctor (do+c+to+r), doer (do+er), does (do+es), dog (do+g), doing (do+in+g), dollar (do+l+l+ar), donation (d+on+at+i+on), done (d+one), door (do+or), dot (do+t), drone (d+r+one), eat (e+at), either (e+i+the+r), end (en+d), errand (er+r+and), everyone (ever+y+one), everything (ever+y+thing), everywhere (ever+y+w+here), fall (f+all), fan (f+an), far (f+ar), fare (f+are), farther (f+ar+the+r), fat (f+at), father (f+a+the+r), fever (f+ever), fit (f+it), forecast (for+e+c+as+t), force (for+c+e), forever (for+ever), forget (for+get), fork (for+k), form (for+m), format (for+m+at), former (for+m+er), fort (for+t), forth (for+th), forum (for+u+m), forward (for+w+ar+d), fright (f+right), fun (f+un), fur (f+ur), further (f+ur+the+r), gas (g+as), gather (g+a+the+r), gone (g+one), got (g+ot), gun (g+un), gut (g+ut), hall (h+all), hand (h+and), handsome (h+and+some), has (h+as), hat (h+at), hater (h+at+er), hear (he+ar), heart (he+ar+t), heat (he+at), heir (he+ir), her (h+er), hen (h+en), his (h+is), hit (h+it), hot (h+ot), however (how+ever), information (in+for+m+at+i+on), ink (in+k), install (in+s+t+all), into (in+to), island (is+l+and), jar (j+ar), jet (j+et), junior (j+un+i+or), justice (just+i+c+e), kit (k+it), land (l+and), later (l+at+er), let (l+et), lit (l+it), lot (l+ot), mall (m+all), man (m+an), many (m+any), master (m+as+t+er), mat (m+at), men (m+en), met (m+et), money (m+one+y), month (m+on+th), mother (m+o+the+r), mouth (m+out+h), net (n+et), never (n+ever), non (n+on), none (n+one), nor (n+or), north (n+or+th), not (n+ot), nothing (n+o+thing), nun (n+un), nut (n+ut), oat (o+at), ore (or+e), other (o+the+r), overall (o+v+er+all), pen (p+en), per (p+er), pet (p+et), phone (p+h+one), pin (p+in), pit (p+it), pot (p+ot), pun (p+un), put (p+ut), rare (r+are), rat (r+at), rather (r+at+he+r), reset (r+es+et), run (r+un), sand (s+and), sat (s+at), scout (s+c+out), senior (s+en+i+or), set (s+et), several (s+ever+a+l), severe (s+ever+e), shall (s+h+all), share (s+h+are), shave (s+have), sheet (s+he+et), shout (s+h+out), show (s+how), sin (s+in), singer (s+in+g+er), sit (s+it), small (s+m+all), someday (some+d+a+y), somehow (some+how), someone (some+one), something (some+thing), somewhat (some+what), somewhere (some+w+here), son (s+on), sooner (s+o+on+er), sphere (s+p+here), stand (s+t+and), sun (s+un), tall (t+all), tan (t+an), tar (t+ar), ten (t+en), than (th+an), theater (the+at+er), their (the+ir), them (the+m), then (the+n), therefore (there+for+e), these (the+s+e), they (the+y), thin (th+in), those (th+os+e), thousand (th+o+us+and), thunder (th+un+d+er), thus (th+us), tin (t+in), toast (to+as+t), toes (to+es), together (to+get+he+r), ton (to+n), tone (t+one), too (to+o), tooth (to+o+th), top (to+p), tour (to+ur), tow (to+w), toy (to+y), under (un+d+er), underdog (un+d+er+do+g), understand (un+d+er+s+t+and), undo (un+do), union (un+i+on), unlike (un+like), unto (un+to), use (us+e), van (v+an), vanity (v+an+it+y), wall (w+all), wand (w+and), war (w+ar), ware (w+are), was (w+as), weather (w+e+a+the+r), wet (w+et), wheat (w+he+at), wit (w+it), whatever (what+ever), whatsoever (what+s+o+ever), where (w+here), wherever (w+here+ever), win (w+in), winner (w+in+n+er), winter (w+in+t+er), within (with+in), without (with+out), won (w+on), worth (w+or+th), yes (y+es), yet (y+et), your (you+r), zone (z+one), and much more.
Not just speed
Even if you think you type fast enough now, you can be benefited reducing the amount of typing, and letting your fingers travel small distances to type commonly used words. WTK can, possibly, cause less stress, and reduce joints' injuries.
My dream (I believe it’s not so crazy): I imagine some years from now researchers finding evidence that people who adopt WowTimeKey get more intelligent, augmenting their IQ. I think it is really possible because people will probably create new synapses in the process of finding the most efficient way to type syllables, words, and signs, and setting their mind to think ahead of just the next letter. People may consider typing this way tiresome for their brain at the beginning, but it gets easier and easier very fast. Kids may even consider instigating this learning process.
 
TIMING
Free download
Programming started as planned (January 8). The virtual keyboard for Android smartphones is now available at Google Play (since May first). 
I had to spend my own savings, so the first version do not have predictive text yet. It should be added for English in August. Even without it, I think you will notice that it makes sense migrate to WowTimeKey. Being rational, you will see that it’s time to leave QWERTY.
Installing
Go to Google Play -> Categories -> Tools -> Type WowTimeKey to search -> Download it.
In order to activate (example for Samsung devices): Config -> General management -> Language -> Keyboard -> Configuring enter methods (a blue link at the bottom of the box) -> Activate Wow -> Go back one screen -> Keyboard -> Select English (US) Wow.
For 160 languages now
In the first phase (Android), we will make the keyboard available for 160 languages. There are probably more, but I could not confirm other languages in independent realiable sources.

Why to go beyond USD 25,000
If we raise more than we are asking for, we will be able to start the next phases earlier, like the iOS version, and the prototype of the physical keyboard (designed already).
60 min. in QWERTY reduced to 36 min. in physical WTK
Just mentioning, the physical WTK has 19 innovations registered in the patent, and will make possible to type in 36 min. (mean) what is now done in 60 min. with QWERTY.
More to come
Next improvements include an optimized version – completely designed – for languages that use accents to speed up typing even more, based in their specific needs. Keyboards for Cyrillic and Greek are designed too, and will be added in the next steps, so that all countries and official/ local languages of EU, for example, will be benefited soon. The timing for all the other writing systems will depend on the support received.
 
TO WOW OR NOT TO WOW
Not just a logo
Let me tell you about the logo. Every time I found a way to improve the keyboard (19 innovations), I had a “wow” moment. Then, at the end of the process, I decided to celebrate, my way, writing a visual poem. Having the word “wow” in my mind, I created what I later decided to use as the brand name and logo.

Logo is full of secrets
Maybe you’ve seen a person yelling in the 2 moving images. Good catch if it is the case, but... If you are a geek, or at least curious, I tell you that you can find 30… 60… hidden words, images, secrets. Here is a clue: it is full of references to “wow” moments in science, technology, culture, being human! Now, if you are curious, try to find them, and talk about your discoveries. It can be a good brain power test. I’m trying to say what “wow” means to me, and I hope we can share this connection, a particular way to look at us, humans.
P.S. 2
Unfortunately adults in general did not believe in the keyboard’s advantages I mentioned in the invitation, and most did not even visited the page. You can believe in everything I say. I can, at least, prove right now that it's true my statement that the logo is full of secrets (there are probably other unintentional meanings).

Of course I’m aware of several words in other languages, but it’s not an easy task to provide a comprehensive list.
Time for enchantment
Being a sociologist, I know that some people will criticize me for talking about a “wow” world, instead of world’s problems. In my defense, I say that there are moments for criticism, and moments for joy. We should celebrate the quite few moments of enchantment. And no, I am not endorsing the Brazilian government by using the 4 colors of the flag.
Friends matter
I want to make public my gratitude to my friends, designers Augusto Citrangulo, Léia Emy Yamachi, and Luis Alexandre Lara. They gracefully used their minds and time helping me to decide about shades of color, suggesting ways to personalize letters, and helping me to achieve the proportions I wanted in the visual poem. Other friends contributed with their opinions and suggestions before I had this campaign ready to go: Frederico Catapani (with video too), Jorge Tateishi, Marisa Camargo, Rachel Moreno, Rudah Galli, and Suzel Figueiredo. Thank you all!
 
ABOUT ME

In front of a graffiti at Beco do Batman - Vila Madalena - Sao Paulo (Dec. 14, 2017)
What? Sociologist?
I am a sociologist, with bachelor’s degree from USP – University of Sao Paulo, and master’s degree from UCONN – The University of Connecticut. My professional area is Market and Public Opinion Research – Market Intelligence nowadays. Experienced analyst, projects' manager, director of business areas in renowned companies, and served as director and vice president of the national professional association, as well as president of its council. Uhnnn... Maybe you can have more confidence in me if I tell you that I am also an electricity technician, and frequented 2 semesters of mechanical engineering.
A nonsense inertia
Inventor is my “B” side. When I was about 12 y.o. my mother bought a typewriter to me and my sisters. I was enchanted by the looks! It had a light green – almost blue – rigid plastic exterior. Really beautiful. Then I looked at the keys. It was so… nonsense! Only decades later I read that keys were placed in that way to minimize jamming, type bar clashes. At that time I thought someday somehow someone somewhere would come up with something, a somewhat better solution. Then the electric typewriter appeared, the PC, and many other devices. And QWERTY stayed alive with no more reasons to exist other than… inertia.
If not now, then when?
When I was about to turn 50, I remembered having this thought about QWERTY. Then: Well, if nobody succeeded in making a better keyboard in all these years, I will take this task.
99% perspiration
The moments of inspiration (19 innovations) are just part of the story. In order to make the best keyboard for people all around the world, I studied the characteristics and needs of more than 200 languages, and had to make a good use of my analytical experience, taking into account lots of variables. And here we are. You and I.
 
WELCOME MESSAGE
Being a ""wow"" person, you are in the team
If you had a “wow” reaction looking at the keyboard, then welcome to the team. You can see farther than most people, your eyes shine looking at something really new and relevant, and you probably enjoy spending some time helping others to understand the advantages of embracing the future.
You can be deeply involved in a historical change
Depending on the contribution level, you can be a beta tester, helping to make the final product reach its full potential, so that people around the world will be willing to get out of the inertia. In the Diamond level, you will be a master beta tester, with certificate, and we will let you know in advance secrets of the physical keyboard that will allow people to reduce from 60 minutes to 36 minutes (rounded mean) the time spent typing, and you'll know about new resources that will be loved (I hope) as productivity tools. QWERTY, the keyboard used nowadays, will turn 145 y.o. in March 1st 2018. Let's put an end to the long lasting inertia. If not now, then when?

<p>Hi, my name is John Mercouris. I am a computer scientist with a passion for changing the world. The instrument for change I employ is software. I've designed Next with the singular goal of making its users more productive, and by extension the world, a better place (hopefully).</p>
<p>Through supporting this campaign, you'll enable a whole new set of users (GNU/Linux) to gain access to Next, as well as contributing to the continued support and development of the project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Funding?</h3>
<p>Most of the funding for the project will be coming out of my own pocket, but additional support would be very helpful, as my resources are limited. The funding you provide will be used for the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying for professional C development time (I've already partnered with a C developer)</li>
<li>Paying for infrastructure, domain names, servers, build automation</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event that the funding goal is not met, we'll take whatever we've amassed, and the rest will come out of my pocket in order to fund the project to its goal. I'm very passionate about Next, and I want to make it of the highest quality, so that its users may be fully empowered.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Next has been a passion project for over two years. It arose out of a need to create a web browser more useful for something beyond merely ""browsing"". Modern browsers have eschewed power in favor of simplicity. Their UI and feature-set is tailored to being as simple as possible to use. This has led to a compromise in their capability.</p>
<p>Next tips the power balance the other way. Next is not designed for the common denominator, but rather for the expert tool user. It is infinitely customizable, and designed to make you more productive, at whatever it is you do.</p>
<h3>Project Status</h3>
<p>Next has gone through 8 releases, each time evolving significantly. On macOS it is fully usable as a main web-browser.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate better cross-platform support, I consulted the Lisp community and heeded the advice of Robert Strandh. Robert Strandh suggested a distributed architecture involving a Lisp core controlling a ""dumb"" GUI frontend.</p>
<p>This distributed Lisp core design has been something I've been working on for over 6 months. The API, design, and its principles have been validated in an Objective-C port, but in order to bring it to GNU/Linux, a GTK and (given enough resources, Qt) port implementing the remote server protocol have to be constructed (the purpose of this campaign).</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>If you haven't already, please star or follow the project on Github (<a href=""https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://github.com/atlas-engineer/next</a>) it means a lot to me, and really increases the visibility of the project.</p>
<p>If you want to visit the official project website, you can do so at <a href=""https://next.atlas.engineer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://next.atlas.engineer</a>.</p>
<p>Other things that you can do involve simply spreading the word to your friends via messages, social media, etc.</p>
<h3>Why Lisp?</h3>
<p>Lisp (<a href=""http://lisp-lang.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://lisp-lang.org/</a>) is a powerful language that allows any part of Next to be modified and reprogrammed. For example, while you are running Next, you may decide that you want youtube videos to automatically download when they contain the word ""programming"" somewhere in the title. Normally you'd write a plugin, stop, and restart the browser and try reloading your plugin. In Next, because it is written in Lisp, you can write changes, and test them immediately.</p>
<p>There is a lot to say about Lisp, many articles have been written as per its suitability, a few of my favorites are provided below:</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>GROW TWC is an Australian-owned start-up ag-tech company that offers an integrated and sustainable agricultural solution for farmers, wholesale buyers, and even backyard veggie patch enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Our goal is to make fresh, nutrient dense, organically grown produce accessible, reliable and affordable.  We are passionate about small-scale farming operations and their ability to tackle the effects of climate change.</p>
<p>Our solution involves farmers, wholesale buyers and even you - climate conscious communities, backyard veggie growers, those dreaming of a more self-sufficient lifestyle and those wanting to teach younger generations where their food comes from, how to grow it and the positive impact that growing your own food has for the self, for the planet and for whole communities.</p>
<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>We currently provide 'farm in a box' services - for suburban household and commercial operations - through the sale of our GROWtunnels. We also offer organic certification services, organic seedlings and seasonal crop planning, as well as a Management Solution for investors lacking the time or drive to operate a GROWtunnel farming business.</p>
<p>Designed as a low-cost introduction to organic farming, the controlled, closed-loop environment of our GROWtunnels reduces crop losses to pests, wind borne diseases, pathogens and spray drift from chemical farmers. GROWtunnels also provide the ideal growing climate, protected from increasingly common extreme weather events where intense sun, rain, hail and wind can harm field farmed crops.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>This campaign is designed to raise the funds required to build our proprietary digital platform, the GROW Marketplace, that connects wholesale produce buyers with local organic produce growers, and facilitating the sale transaction securely and in real time. GROW Marketplace will also connect backyard growers with each other, allowing communities to interact by buying, selling or even swapping their produce with each other.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>The GROW Marketplace Digital Platform and APP</h3>
<p>Our vision for GROW Marketplace is that it will be the leading wholesale marketplace for organic produce, both locally and internationally.</p>
<p>Built on a tiered subscription model, GROW Marketplace digital platform and subsquent APP will offer a <strong>Home Subscription</strong> for backyard GROWers and a <strong>Business Subscription</strong> for business operations.</p>
<p>The <strong>Home Subscription</strong> is designed for suburban backyard veggie growers who wish to sell*, buy, or trade their produce with others in their community. Additionally, the Home Subscription provides access to the GROW Wiki for growing advice and information on pest/disease control.</p>
<p>The <strong>Business Subscription</strong> is designed for business operations, from small-scale to commercial in size and is more than a platform for selling* your produce. The Business Subscription includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>an integrated accounting, inventory and invoicing software package,</li>
<li>along with a crop planning tool</li>
<li>integrated calendar with automated reminders</li>
<li>GROW Wiki - expert advice and guides</li>
<li>access to our 'Food Futures' initiative</li>
</ul>
<p>'<strong>Food Futures</strong>' involves facilitating the 'pre-arrangement' of future crop requirements at a pre-negotiated price, which reduces wastage and allows both parties the ability to better manage operational forecasting and cash flow.</p>
<p>*Sales transactions may incur a Transaction Fee at the point of purchase.</p>

<h3>The GROW Wiki</h3>
<p>Included in every GROW Marketplace subscription is your own personal access to the GROW Wiki. The GROW Wiki is designed for all GROWers regardless of your experience. From novice veggie growers to successful business enterprises, the GROW Wiki is a reference and knowledge centre full of expert advice and guides to help you find solutions to common issues.</p>

<h3>Benefits of GROW Marketplace</h3>
<p>We’ve considered many possibilities and additions for GROW Marketplace. In fact some we’ll implement in a future strategy, but for now our focus is to encourage existing farmers, new farmers, tree-changers, and even households in suburbia to grow organically and build a local ecosystem of buying, selling and trading their produce.</p>
<p>The benefits are broad for households, wholesale buyers, farmers and communities alike.</p>

</div><hr/><div>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>Our aim is to raise $250,000 to fund the development and launch of GROW Marketplace, by mid-2020, along with internal costs associated with management and sales through its growth phase of the first 12 months. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1585624086/rwdawbqj1eus0yi2jq9g.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We aim to raise these funds by offering one time only discounts on our most popular GROWtunnels with added bonuses and early bird subscriptions to GROW Marketplace.</p>
<p>In the event that we don't reach our entire goal, all money raised will still go towards building the platform, albeit a lighter version, however we will require additional funds to be raised in order to launch the complete platform.</p>
<hr/>
<h3>Payment Terms Available</h3>
<p>Split payment terms are available on our Rural and Commercial GROWtunnel perks. For further information please contact us at hello@growtunnels.com</p>

</div><hr/><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>GROW was founded on the core belief that the future of the planet is dependent on the strength of the communities that bind it. Ethical, conscious communities that understand the impact of climate change, and encourage one another to strive for a better way - together.</p>
<p>GROW Marketplace is designed to GROW the organic produce industry by providing an entry point for small scale farmers and communities to access growth opportunity whilst caring for the planet.</p>
<p>We see our success as;</p>
<ul>
<li>contributing to the growth of the global organic produce industry,</li>
<li>eliminating crop and food wastage,</li>
<li>reduction in the Agriculture industry's reliance on poisonous chemicals and synthetic fertilisers,</li>
<li>reducing food miles,</li>
<li>providing opportunity for communities - both thriving and emerging,</li>
<li>improving the reliability of organic produce across seasons and</li>
<li>increasing the volume of organic produce available to the consumer.</li>
</ul>
</div><hr/><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any startup, we face a limited risk of running out of funds to support growing our brand and concept. However with zero business debt and a great finance support team we don't run the risk of insolvency. A reduction of income from current activities will only slow down our growth trajectory and, as a startup, we're flexible in our approach and can 'steer the ship' onto a new course swiftly and without affecting our business model.</p>
<p>We also face the challenge of launching GROW Marketplace on time and as promised. There are any number of factors that can delay the development of a multi-level digital platform like ours, such as illness, lack of funding and unforeseen obstacles. We are confident that our team has the knowledge and capacity to face these challenges and risks head on, see below for a brief overview of our founders, Al, Neil and Robbie.</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
GROW TWC is an Australian-owned start-up ag-tech company that offers an integrated and sustainable agricultural solution for farmers, wholesale buyers, and even backyard veggie patch enthusiasts.
Our goal is to make fresh, nutrient dense, organically grown produce accessible, reliable and affordable.  We are passionate about small-scale farming operations and their ability to tackle the effects of climate change.
Our solution involves farmers, wholesale buyers and even you - climate conscious communities, backyard veggie growers, those dreaming of a more self-sufficient lifestyle and those wanting to teach younger generations where their food comes from, how to grow it and the positive impact that growing your own food has for the self, for the planet and for whole communities.
What We Do
We currently provide 'farm in a box' services - for suburban household and commercial operations - through the sale of our GROWtunnels. We also offer organic certification services, organic seedlings and seasonal crop planning, as well as a Management Solution for investors lacking the time or drive to operate a GROWtunnel farming business.
Designed as a low-cost introduction to organic farming, the controlled, closed-loop environment of our GROWtunnels reduces crop losses to pests, wind borne diseases, pathogens and spray drift from chemical farmers. GROWtunnels also provide the ideal growing climate, protected from increasingly common extreme weather events where intense sun, rain, hail and wind can harm field farmed crops.
What We Need
This campaign is designed to raise the funds required to build our proprietary digital platform, the GROW Marketplace, that connects wholesale produce buyers with local organic produce growers, and facilitating the sale transaction securely and in real time. GROW Marketplace will also connect backyard growers with each other, allowing communities to interact by buying, selling or even swapping their produce with each other.

The GROW Marketplace Digital Platform and APP
Our vision for GROW Marketplace is that it will be the leading wholesale marketplace for organic produce, both locally and internationally.
Built on a tiered subscription model, GROW Marketplace digital platform and subsquent APP will offer a Home Subscription for backyard GROWers and a Business Subscription for business operations.
The Home Subscription is designed for suburban backyard veggie growers who wish to sell*, buy, or trade their produce with others in their community. Additionally, the Home Subscription provides access to the GROW Wiki for growing advice and information on pest/disease control.
The Business Subscription is designed for business operations, from small-scale to commercial in size and is more than a platform for selling* your produce. The Business Subscription includes:

an integrated accounting, inventory and invoicing software package,
along with a crop planning tool
integrated calendar with automated reminders
GROW Wiki - expert advice and guides
access to our 'Food Futures' initiative

'Food Futures' involves facilitating the 'pre-arrangement' of future crop requirements at a pre-negotiated price, which reduces wastage and allows both parties the ability to better manage operational forecasting and cash flow.
*Sales transactions may incur a Transaction Fee at the point of purchase.

The GROW Wiki
Included in every GROW Marketplace subscription is your own personal access to the GROW Wiki. The GROW Wiki is designed for all GROWers regardless of your experience. From novice veggie growers to successful business enterprises, the GROW Wiki is a reference and knowledge centre full of expert advice and guides to help you find solutions to common issues.

Benefits of GROW Marketplace
We’ve considered many possibilities and additions for GROW Marketplace. In fact some we’ll implement in a future strategy, but for now our focus is to encourage existing farmers, new farmers, tree-changers, and even households in suburbia to grow organically and build a local ecosystem of buying, selling and trading their produce.
The benefits are broad for households, wholesale buyers, farmers and communities alike.


The Details
Our aim is to raise $250,000 to fund the development and launch of GROW Marketplace, by mid-2020, along with internal costs associated with management and sales through its growth phase of the first 12 months. 

 
We aim to raise these funds by offering one time only discounts on our most popular GROWtunnels with added bonuses and early bird subscriptions to GROW Marketplace.
In the event that we don't reach our entire goal, all money raised will still go towards building the platform, albeit a lighter version, however we will require additional funds to be raised in order to launch the complete platform.

Payment Terms Available
Split payment terms are available on our Rural and Commercial GROWtunnel perks. For further information please contact us at hello@growtunnels.com



The Impact
GROW was founded on the core belief that the future of the planet is dependent on the strength of the communities that bind it. Ethical, conscious communities that understand the impact of climate change, and encourage one another to strive for a better way - together.
GROW Marketplace is designed to GROW the organic produce industry by providing an entry point for small scale farmers and communities to access growth opportunity whilst caring for the planet.
We see our success as;

contributing to the growth of the global organic produce industry,
eliminating crop and food wastage,
reduction in the Agriculture industry's reliance on poisonous chemicals and synthetic fertilisers,
reducing food miles,
providing opportunity for communities - both thriving and emerging,
improving the reliability of organic produce across seasons and
increasing the volume of organic produce available to the consumer.


Risks & Challenges
As with any startup, we face a limited risk of running out of funds to support growing our brand and concept. However with zero business debt and a great finance support team we don't run the risk of insolvency. A reduction of income from current activities will only slow down our growth trajectory and, as a startup, we're flexible in our approach and can 'steer the ship' onto a new course swiftly and without affecting our business model.
We also face the challenge of launching GROW Marketplace on time and as promised. There are any number of factors that can delay the development of a multi-level digital platform like ours, such as illness, lack of funding and unforeseen obstacles. We are confident that our team has the knowledge and capacity to face these challenges and risks head on, see below for a brief overview of our founders, Al, Neil and Robbie.

<h3>Why cue?</h3>
<p>If you are in the event planning community (DJs, Wedding Planners, Photographers, Venues, etc) you are likely as frustrated as I am with the current crop of tools out there to plan your events. To add to the frustration you are likely using one, two, three, or even more tools to help manage all the aspects of your events, to your financials, your communications. And I understand this because I am a Wedding DJ with a propensity to make things better.</p>
<p>And there is a better way to do this.</p>
<p>cue is the next-generation web-based platform of tools for the event industry, built by someone in the event industry, to help manage not only events but to help manage your business simply and effectively.</p>
<h3>Why Now?</h3>
<p>You may ask why would one start a campaign, now, with everything going on. I would make the argument that now is the best time for a project like this to become available. For event professionals that have the time as we wait for things to open back up to take on a new project like adopting a new platform. </p>
<h3>Phase 1: cue Essentials</h3>
<p>This platform is a huge undertaking and reimagining of how to do things right from the start. With that, cue is being developed as two core offerings, Essentials and Premium. This campaign is to get Essentials fully funded and made available to the public.</p>
<p>The name Essentials is a bit deceiving because it’s really a very feature-rich application from the start. From being able to visually see where you are with your clients and events to being able to get contracts signed, Essentials can help to transform your business. Some of these great tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business Discovery. You no longer need to constantly research and add businesses to the system. </li>
<li>Step Progress. Visually see where you are in every event at a glance.</li>
<li>Adding Leads. Quickly add leads without all the headaches.</li>
<li>Contracts &amp; Invoices. Manage it all under one simplified experience</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase 2: cue Premium</h3>
<p>Incorporating things like automation, payments, a unified timeline, business health dashboard, social media tools, and other key features; cue Premium is going to take things beyond what you'd expect. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Things Are</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I have invested $30K personally to get the essentials version of cue to 80% completion. A walkthrough demo <u><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVmWBrh_T9JjSrsZBnZscbZ_Jo-nL_SRN"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">is available here</a></u> and you can jump to the bottom to see screenshots of what is completed thus far.</p></li>
<li><p>The final 20% requires $18K to get ownership of the code and complete that phase of development</p></li>
<li><p>I have investors that are waiting for Essentials to launch that have pledged to fund once they see a working program with subscriber growth.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although I have already sold a number of lifetime memberships to support funding (thank you!!), it’s going to take more to get this important domino knocked over and keep things moving.</p>
<h3>Contributing To The Campaign</h3>
<p>So I am here to ask if people are interested in helping out. If I can get even enough small pledges, I can get essentials out the door. It's funny what a little money at scale can do to change an industry. You may not be part of the event industry and that is OK. That is why I am offering the Goodwill option for those that want to help push this along.</p>
<p>For the event professionals, I am offering now three levels of subscriptions to cue Premium when released. A 3-month offering at $50, a 9-month offering at $100, a 24-month offering at $200, and I am continuing with my lifetime membership at $450 which is a tremendous bargain. </p>
</div><div>
<p>If you can't contribute I'd sure appreciate you sharing this on any of your social media pages. Getting people in front of this is one of the most important aspects to raising funds.</p>
<h3>For Investors</h3>
<p>There has been a lot of interest in people looking to invest $2500 or more into the project. For those interested I would love to set aside some time to chat with you one-on-one presenting my slide deck, talking over financials, and walking through the live alpha development of Essentials. <a href=""mailto:lou.paris@cueplatform.com?subject=Investment%20opportunity%20with%20cue"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Please contact me</a> so we take these discussions further.</p>
<h3>Current Alpha Development</h3>
<p>The current development for cue Essentials is approximately 80% complete. Here are some screenshots of what has been created thus far.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We started Inkinite early this year in order to reduce the harmful impact created by the overuse of paper. We have established ourselves with a good reputation among a prestigious client base. We follow an optimised approach to manufacture our products because of which we are able to achieve superior quality for minimum cost. Today we are here to introduce a new variation of our reusable notebooks which can replace the traditional planners and organizers. We need to start our production with a minimum quantity in order to achieve superior quality for a minimum cost.</p>

<p>Inkinite Planner comes with a monthly, weekly and daily schedule in a handy reusable notebook. One can effectively plan all the activities and track them based on their preferences. Adding to this, white sheets are provided to make notes and for brainstorming sessions. All the pages are treated with a special UV coating which makes them dry erasable and easy to clean surface. Like a whiteboard, one can reuse the planner any number of times.</p>

With your support, you get to have the reusable planners from the first batch of production. The perks are designed in such a way that you get it for a price less than the intended retail price. Do check out the perks for great deals.

 

Risks & Challenges
We ship our products to a wide range of client base. Our client base vary from individuals to large companies and they come with all kind of requirements and requests. We have catered all their requirements in a satisfactory and a timely manner. This journey has helped us in eliminating almost all the risks and challenges one can face in manufacturing and delivering our products. We are also good to scale up our production to any number. So the estimates and the timelines provided by us are up to the mark to the best of our knowledge and experience. Other than these, we are susceptible to the usual risks and challenges faced by any other business in the industry. There may be a minimal chance of delay in the delivery of the products, in case of any unforeseen and emergency situations.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Please spread the uses of reusable notebooks among your community. Educate the people about reducing the wastage of paper. Help the trees flourish in the nature. Also don't forget to spread the news of our campaign among your friends and family.
Note

In most of the countries, there are no import duties imposed for notebooks. In some cases, there may be a small amount of taxes imposed by your home country. Please check with the rules of your country for the same. 
We ship our products only to the following countries due to restrictions. Please check the list before you place your order.

<p>Welcome to Lloret de Mar, Spain and Welcome to the Klub! Wttklub Hostel!</p>
<p><b>A greener and socially conscious Hostel, and the first hostel in this city!</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>After traveling the world over the last 2-3 years, visiting over 100 different countries, Sebastian realized that he was tired of his old professional life. After graduating from a MBA Masters in Business Administration at a prestigious school in Canada, working for large corporations in the US, Canada, and the EU, Sebastian realized that something was still missing. He wanted to do something more from his heart and something better for the world. During his travels, he stumbled on Lloret de Mar, Spain, and fell in love. For someone with a rational business mind, it was all unexplainable. First, it was city, the culture, and beautiful weather. He took a job working in a bar to meet people. And to top it all off, a customer who walked in, ended up being his future partner, Daria.</p>

<p><b>- Location:</b> The property agreement starts in March 2016.

<h3>The Social and Environmental Impact</h3>

<p>We aren't new to this either... This past season, we also ran a successful small business renting apartments and homes within our network through our various online sales travel platforms.

What We Need 
We were looking at many different locations adequate for a 36 bed hostel, wrote a 50 page business plan to ensure we had our strategy and numbers just right, and  prepared for all of the difficult and complicated Spanish laws.

but also,
- Renovations and FF&E: To cut costs, all renovations and repairs will be done with our own labour as well as friends. However, things like buying the wood to build the bunkbeds, the mattresses, and new linens, require some seed capital. Cost of renovations and FF&E estimated at 6,923 Euros.
all the while,
- We still need enough left over to begin business operations until revenues grow.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The PetCare App was grown from an idea - a dream - from the mind of a true pet lover and pet industry business owner, myself, Dave Farris.

Our main focus is to provide professionals with an avenue to be successful without costing a lot of money, along with giving customers the opportunity to take control of their pets needs, whether it be vets, groomers, boarders, or others.  We would love your help in making our dream come true as well as meeting your needs as pet owners and pet industry business owners.</p>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>While we are super excited about the launch of our app, we know we will experience some challenges along the way. We hope that you will assist us in overcoming these challenges. First, funding is always a challenge in such a huge project. While we have enough to reach our phase 1 goals, we know that continuing with our timeline could be at risk if more funds are not raised.  We hope to overcome this challenge through fundraising and via fees collected as we launch the apps.</p>
<p>The biggest potential challenge is ensuring we experience enough interest in the application suite. We have begun to build our network of interested businesses and will continue to do so through trade events, social media marketing, email campaigns, and word of mouth. We hope you will support us in this.</p>

First, funding is always a challenge in such a huge project. While we have enough to reach our phase 1 goals, we know that continuing with our timeline could be at risk if more funds are not raised.  We hope to overcome this challenge through fundraising and via fees collected as we launch the apps.
The biggest potential challenge is ensuring we experience enough interest in the application suite. We have begun to build our network of interested businesses and will continue to do so through trade events, social media marketing, email campaigns, and word of mouth. We hope you will support us in this.

<p>It's summertime and we all look forward to sharing food and good times with friends. Eating at picnics and BBQ's, hosting gatherings at home and dining out. These are just some of the ways we enjoy ourselves. Wherever we leave food though, THEY seem to appear.  Everyone finds them bothersome - Fruit Flies.<br/><br/>We've worked in the food industry for over a decade and one of the biggest issues to deal with were fruit flies.  After spending countless hours building and replacing our own Do-It-Yourself Fruit Fly traps, we realized the wasteful cost of time and materials without always having the best results.</p>
<p>We decided that the only way to effectively solve this problem was to invent our own solution that focused on our concerns: Time, Money and Waste.  We engineered the washable, reusable Fruit Fly Funnel which can convert most plastic bottles into a highly effective fruit fly trap.</p>
<p>What this means is the cost effective elimination of fruit flies and drastically reducing the dangers of contamination.  It also means creating a cleaner environment while giving yourself more time and money to focus on the things that really matter to you.</p>

<h3>A SYSTEM TO HELP YOU USE SOCIAL MEDIA</h3>
<p>You have spent a lot of time, and perhaps a lot of money, developing your social media profiles.  However, you may not be protecting, or even using it, the way you should be.</p>
<p>This isn't just going to show you how to use your profile to market yourself (or your company), though it will contain that information.  This guide will also walk you through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping Your Account Secure</li>
<li>Maintaining Your Account</li>
<li>Ensuring That Your Information is Accurate</li>
<li>Ensuring That Your Privacy Settings are Set Properly</li>
<li>Automating Publishing</li>
<li>Integrating Social Media Sites</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The bottom line: this will save you from a lot of unnecessary frustration!</strong></p>
<p>What I am launching here is a way to share my knowledge of these powerful platforms - everything I know - every trick, every work around, every protective measure - in one place so that members can get the most out of them.</p>
<p>What I'll be building is a small network of help.  The initial ""front end"" will be a PDF that covers everything in an ""outline"" fashion.  Behind it will be a membership site with videos and other graphic media to further assist everyone in using this platform to its fullest.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is to make this an ongoing, living, breathing system that keeps up with the latest changes on all the major social media sites that have a business focus, both technically and in terms of policy and other aspects.</p>
<p>The funding will pay for ""the team"", which will initially consist of myself and at least a half dozen others.  The initial funds will be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development of the Initial PDF</li>
<li>Development of the Initial Membership Site</li>
<li>Development of API structures that will interface directly with the sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>As time goes one, we'll be updating every aspect of the site so that when you need something fixed on LinkedIn, we'll be able to help you faster and in a much more comprehensive way than even their own internal staff would be able to do.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are literally billions of registered members on the major business sites.  Only a small fraction of those members really use the platforms to their full potential, and only a small fraction of those users really understand everything that goes on behind the scenes</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You may not think this is necessary for you at this point in time.  That's OK!  Ill bet that some of your connections and followers, however, might need this.  If you would be willing to share, we would absolutely appreciate it.</p>
<h3>THE PLAN</h3>
<p><strong>Phase 1: LinkedIn</strong></p>
<p>Launching in September 2018, this phase will focus on providing the initial PDF structure and back-end membership site for use with LinkedIn.  The initial version will be based on what can be done through the ""Free"" version of the LinkedIn account.  This will then be enhanced (available in November 2018) to include other features available to premium subscribers.</p>
<p><strong>Phases 2 - 4: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Pinterest, Instagram, Vimeo</strong></p>
<p>Launching in January 2019, this phase will add other sites, including but not limited to Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram, and Vimeo.  There will be no additional charges or fees for these additional platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Phase 5: Integration</strong></p>
<p>Knowing how to use each platform is important - knowing how to integrate them is the key to productivity.  The system will be enhanced over time to include the integration of these platforms with each other and with 3rd party systems such as IFTTT, Delivr.it, Scoop.it, and so forth.  The system will continue to be enhanced as new platforms and new 3rd party integration services are introduced.</p>
<p><strong>PERKS</strong></p>
<p>The initial perks are very simple - up front discounts for those who jump in early.  Our goal is to keep this as affordable as possible for as many people as possible.  Even if we start to add features like ""live one on one assistance"", I do not expect the fees to rise.  In fact, if we are able to get enough folks on board up front, the ""retail"" prices may end up being lower than we are currently estimating.</p>

As a Professor, I have seen how the use of Jibber Jabber's highly rational application has created efficiencies for those that use it. As a business I have seen the company take on a strategic, technological, and commercial shape that will lend it to creating/satisfying a niche in the academic marketplace as the company continues to evolve, which with continued guidance and financial support it is sure to do.Dr. Patrick McClelland (American University of Sharjah). Our incubator invests in teams first, we seek passionate teams with big ideas. Jibber Jabber - JJ - is a great idea turned into a growing startup by a talented and driven team. Bootstrapping their way into entrepreneurship, the JJ team lead by Monty Adams has demonstrated passion, tenacity, intelligence and coachability. With our continuous support and the team's commitment, JJ has all it takes to become MENA's next success story.Sirine Fadoul (VISA MENA) I am pleased to recommend the Jibber Jabber team, who I have known for almost 3 years. Their calendar / time management app addresses a real problem that students face, and their solution is a simple and scalable one. We look forward to watching them gain traction as they pilot the app at various universities and educational institutions, and wish them the best with their global ambitions. The team has been very engaged with the Sheraa startup community, based at the American University of Sharjah, and has always stepped forward to inspire and support other aspiring young entrepreneurs.Najla Al-Midfa (CEO - Sharjah Entrepreneurship Centre - Sheraa)  Did we miss something?

<p>Finding our way can be difficult.</p>
<p>The need for highly accurate lane guidance is tested in interchanges or complex junctions, where the road ahead has multiple lanes in the same direction.<br/></p>
<h4>Anyone who ever used a GPS navigation app knows how dangerous it can be to make that risky last-minute maneuver just to get into the appropriate lane, or how frustrating it is to make a wrong turn due to map visual limitations.</h4>
<div>Current navigation apps offer a basic 3D map view using simplistic representation of junctions, forcing the driver many times to guess which lane to take next.<br/>

</div></div>","We at Pangea, believe that an enjoyable navigation app is one that makes us feel confident.
To achieve that, we took existing technology and made it better every way- creating the world's first real-time 3D lane level guidance.


Displaying groundbreaking ultra realistic visuals on your smartphone will let you enjoy the safest, most accurate navigation experience possible.



Pangea 3D Navigation is brought to you by the same dedicated and highly professional team who developed AdasWorks Automated Driving running on NVIDIA Tegra K1 processor. 

 



Have you ever come to a highway interchange or a complex junction and found it difficult to tell which lane to take - even with GPS?








Finding our way can be difficult.
The need for highly accurate lane guidance is tested in interchanges or complex junctions, where the road ahead has multiple lanes in the same direction.
Anyone who ever used a GPS navigation app knows how dangerous it can be to make that risky last-minute maneuver just to get into the appropriate lane, or how frustrating it is to make a wrong turn due to map visual limitations.
Current navigation apps offer a basic 3D map view using simplistic representation of junctions, forcing the driver many times to guess which lane to take next.







As you approach complex junctions and split-second decisions are required, the superior graphical display kicks in - putting you at ease in the driver's seat.
Pangea powerful graphic engine was designed to provide fast and secure decision-making as you drive through complex junctions, giving you the advantage of seeing which lane to take next in real-time.

Split second recognition of relevant road info helps you make the right choice and saves time, money and unnecessary risks!

Enjoy the world's first 3D road network with stunning 3D graphics, and drive safely with the world's finest real-time lane guidance.






PLEASE NOTE: All 3D screenshots & videos were taken from ACTUAL MAP DATA provided by HERE (formerly NAVTEQ), representing real roads, buildings and landmarks.










Animated visual display of your progress all the way through the complex junction provides reassurance your'e on the right path.
For added guidance, the system will also show real-time 3D overhead signs with highlighted sign to your designated lane, and any 3D landmarks nearby for improved orientation.


Pangea's powerful 3D engine immerses you into the world around you like never before - using ultra realistic rendering of multiple lanes, bridges, tunnels, landmarks and terrain level.









Know your lane before it's too late.
Using real-time lane level guidance, there's no need anymore to guess which lane to take at an upcoming turn.
Pangea will guide you to the correct lane for an approaching turn or exit, making unfamiliar junctions and interchanges easy to navigate.



As you approach a series of exits or interchanges, the app will smoothly display highly realistic real-time 3D animation, highlighting the correct lane and signs to follow - well in advance of the upcoming maneuver.


Continued 3D animation through the maneuver provides the added reassurance you take the correct exit, contributing to a less stressful and more enjoyable journey.











To achieve the finest, most precise navigation experience, all major cities in the US and W.Euope will be added with the following 3D City features:


- Highly realistic, textured roads, bridges, tunnels and landmarks


- 3D city junctions with lane level guidance (number of lanes, lanes divider marking, lanes forming/ending and lanes height &  width)






The core technology is based on years of development of 3D graphic engines, map data optimization and benchmarking software solutions.

Built from the ground up with the specific goal of bridging the real world with the virtual world, our powerful graphic engine provides the utmost in navigation safety, and a totally new perspective of the way we drive.
Our  graphic engine was created, tested and optimized by veterans of the gaming industry, and It's the only tool today capable of converting large scale digital map data into complex 3D landscape and present it smoothly in real time.


Using the most advanced rendering capabilities of modern smartphones, we could reach the highest level of visual quality on mobile devices, letting you drive with confidence and ease.

This is where technology makes your life easier.





XploreMax® search engine is an endless source of points of interest data, representing an immeasurable amount of information, that when combined brings the world into your hands to let you know what you can find any place and any time.

Looking for local guides? Look no further. XploreMax® got you covered.

fully compliant new app will help healthcare professionals gain instant access
to information they need to provide better patient care and allow patients to
communicate important information with family and friends in times of need.





Effective healthcare needs to be more timely and responsive at the individual level and Mirilian was formed to make that happen.




How we need help from our friends.
As you view our video messages we
hope you will begin to understand why we have such a passion for our mission.
We believe our collective experiences inside the healthcare industry give us a
truly unique vision for designing possible solutions but we are learning just
how expensive this process can be. The greatest gift we could possibly receive
this year is help getting our first mobile app launched. 

What We Need & What You Get




Mirilian has already paid for the wire framing and design of
the mobile app (blueprints to build the house).  What we still need is:
Funding to contract for professional coding of the app
     (actual building of the house)
Additional resources to marketing and launch the app (making
     sure people know about the app and what it can mean to them when they
     might need it most)

We estimate we will need $50,000 to
achieve these goals and support the app for the first 6 months.  Our wish is to be able to use this fundraising
campaign and our own resources to cover the cost of the launch without becoming
an investor-driven company.





Perks


Your contribution to our campaign is a wonderful gift and we want to recognize you and invite you to be part of the Mirilian adventure.  On the right hand side of this page you will find a list of “perks” to thank you for your support.  Having you as part of this exciting and challenging endeavor is actually as important to us as the financial opportunity. 

 Other Ways You Can Help

Hello! My name is Mario Salgado. I am a Marine Corps Veteran & a former college student. I was majoring in a Bachelors in Finance & Accounting until my Post 9/11 MGIB's tuition ran out. I turned to the only thing I knew how to do: Business & Finance. Thus, Salgado's Emporium of Toys was born.
                                     
My small business is ran from my small apartment in New York City. I am a seller on Amazon's Market Place, on other various websites, and self-promote throughout various social media sites (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.).  I have been researching the ins & outs of this business, trying to be more knowledgeable and have an advantage against other small businesses like mine.
This business is important & very meaningful to me. Not only do I get to do what I love, go into business for myself,  & be my own boss but I will get a chance to save money to move to closer to my son, who lives in Florida with his mother. He visits me 2 times a year for Christmas and a month in the Summer. That is not anywhere near the amount of time I would like to spend with him. He is one of the main reason why I would like to profit from this venture.
      In The Beginning...
I really thought it would be easy starting my own company. I sold my first item and was very excited. That was until I had to actually ship the product. I had to pay to print out packing slips & mailing labels, purchase protective insulation to ship the item  (bubble wrap & Styrofoam peanuts), buy the right size box for what I was shipping along with packing tape and finally pay for the shipping (Standard or Expedited). As soon as I finally shipped the item to the buyer, I realized that there was definitely a lot more to a business than I thought!

   The Risks & Challenges

I have spent countless personal time researching places, prices, and shipping details.

<h2>Why we created Employchain</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559915672/dhl8bsbrfcin84tyddij.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>André Teege (left) and </i><i>Jan-Philipp Arps​</i><i> (right)</i></p>
<p>Employchain founders Jan-Philipp Arps and André Teege were both university students who shared a passion for blockchain technology and programming.</p>
<p>While Jan-Philipp was attending Jönköping University, well-known for it’s large international student community, he noticed his friends struggling to get hired after graduation even though they were extremely qualified.</p>
<p>From this grew a mission between the two blockchain enthusiasts to create a mobile app that could help students find jobs in an easier and less stressful way.</p>
<p>The app would use a blockchain system to automatically match students with local companies – no job search required. Furthermore, students would have the option to make anonymous profiles which focused only on their qualifications and not on their nationality, name or appearance.</p>
<p>Jan-Philipp and André pitched their idea at several events for startups and quickly gained support from local organizations and companies who agreed to work with their mobile app - officially named <strong>Employchain</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Finding a job is challenging</h2>
<h3>Meet Zaire</h3>
<p>Zaire is a student from Egypt with a bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of Ain Shams in Cairo. After graduating, he moves to Sweden and completes a master’s degree in AI Engineering at Jönköping University. He decides to search for jobs in Sweden instead of returning to Egypt and sends out as many applications as possible on different platforms.</p>
<p>A year after beginning his search, Zaire is still unable to find a job even though he's talented, has in demand skills and relevant working experience. The process is overwhelming to adapt to the characteristics of a different labour market and CV's, cover letters, hiring practices and common search platforms add even more confusion. He keeps sending out applications but continues to get rejected without understanding the reason for it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559924659/gofb8sut73ovlxwe7vob.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Recruiters have challenges, too</h3>
<p>Problems continue to persist within the job search and hiring industry. Although recruiting companies exist, there is a missing link between their connection with skilled professionals who are a right fit for the job and for candidates who sometimes feel they don't get a fair chance. </p>
<p>Many applicants are overlooked because they don't understand how to properly communicate their skills - even if they are experienced and good at their job. This frustrates applicants who want to get hired and recruiters who aren't being matched with quality candidates. The holes can be filled with the <strong>Employchain</strong> mobile app, which has extensively studied the issues in the labour market and created a perfect solution for everyone.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559926097/hajkziljo71gravvgjtm.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How Employchain changes the game</h2>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.imgur.com/BiWWgyt.gif"" src=""""/><h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p><strong>Employchain</strong> has simplified the process for both job seekers and recruiters.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Applicants only need a profile consisting of keywords with skill levels - </strong><br/><i>no more confusing CV's or cover letters</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The app automatically matches applicants to recruiters - </strong><br/><i>no more endless applying</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Applicants are only alerted when a company is interested in an interview - </strong><br/><i>no more disappointing rejection letters</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Profiles<i> </i>can be listed anonymously without pictures or name - </strong><br/><i>no chance for discrimination</i><strong><i> </i></strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Zaire signs up for Employchain</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559930184/wnzsckl9vkfmysyhpt8b.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul><li><strong>Applicants only need a profile consisting of keywords with skill levels</strong></li></ul>
<p>Zaire fills out a profile consisting of simple keywords in the categories of basic information, skill level and personal interests/hobbies.  The process takes approximately 10 minutes and doesn't require a complicated cover letter because all important information is posted on the profile in concise, easy-to-read sections.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559998440/kg1oxnynzcl1nlxdwtqs.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul><li><strong>The app automatically matches applicants to recruiters </strong></li></ul>
<p>His profile gets shortlisted to companies that created job ads with certain criteria. Our algorithm matches his education, experience, skills, hobbies and more. This feature eliminates the need to spend countless hours browsing through available jobs or applicants because the app is constantly working to do the matching for Zaire and the recruiters.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559998472/dep2fcixjqifazqwjaqm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul><li><strong>Applicants are only alerted when a company is interested in an interview</strong></li></ul>
<p>Only when a company is interested in him, he is notified about a match. Now it is his turn to decide whether he wants to get in contact or not to proceed with an interview. He no longer receives emails in his inbox with rejection letters - all notifications from <strong>Empoychain</strong> contain only positive messages and Zaire starts feeling excited about the job search process.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559999781/anpbekuvurw6izwuubbg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul><li><strong>Profiles<i> </i>can be listed anonymously without pictures or name</strong></li></ul>
<p>The<b> Employchain </b>app offers an option for Zaire to hide personal details such as his name, age and appearance. This offers a fair chance to represent himself based only on his qualifications and experience without worrying about other factors influencing the selection process. Companies will still be automatically matched with his profile based on keywords and therefore,  his skills will be the most important thing presented to the company.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What does this have to do with blockchain?</h2>
<h3>What is a blockchain?</h3>
<p>A blockchain is a series of data or records that are stored online and linked together in digital <i>blocks</i>. Each block contains timestamps and data of the previous block, therefore if there is a break in the chain link of data then it is revealed to all. There is no central authority, so the system cannot be corrupted or biased. This allows for secure exchanges of information on the internet which is neutral for all parties involved. </p>
<h3>How Employchain uses blockchain</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560000765/sej9369lus8yklt0f1qi.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>Employchain</strong> is building up a peer-to-peer blockchain network for universities, students and companies in order to verify and track users' education, work experiences and other information that can be validated with minimal effort. This will be done by working in collaboration with local companies, universities and organizations who can provide certificates that validate the backgrounds of users.</p>
<p>This provides a great benefit: recruiters or companies don't have to double-check qualifications anymore. As a result, information on a CV becomes more trustworthy and it is guaranteed that no one else, not even ourselves, can change or corrupt any of the data. The process is completely secured, unbiased and extremely efficient for both recruiters and applicants.</p>
</div><div>
<h2>What we need &amp; what you get</h2>
<p>You are here because we are asking you for help to fund the alpha version of our product. In order to realise this, there are mainly development costs. This refers to our planned alpha version. The blockchain functionality will not be included in the beginning as we want to validate the user experience and acceptance of the app in the alpha version. As soon as the alpha version has been tested successfully, we will develop the first public beta release with improvements and blockchain network feature. In case we are able to collect more funds than the given goal, it will be used for the implementation of the beta version as well.</p>

The app would use a blockchain system to automatically match students with local companies – no job search required. Furthermore, students would have the option to make anonymous profiles which focused only on their qualifications and not on their nationality, name or appearance.
Jan-Philipp and André pitched their idea at several events for startups and quickly gained support from local organizations and companies who agreed to work with their mobile app - officially named Employchain.
 
Finding a job is challenging
Meet Zaire
Zaire is a student from Egypt with a bachelor’s degree in computer science from the University of Ain Shams in Cairo. After graduating, he moves to Sweden and completes a master’s degree in AI Engineering at Jönköping University. He decides to search for jobs in Sweden instead of returning to Egypt and sends out as many applications as possible on different platforms.
A year after beginning his search, Zaire is still unable to find a job even though he's talented, has in demand skills and relevant working experience. The process is overwhelming to adapt to the characteristics of a different labour market and CV's, cover letters, hiring practices and common search platforms add even more confusion. He keeps sending out applications but continues to get rejected without understanding the reason for it.

 
Recruiters have challenges, too
Problems continue to persist within the job search and hiring industry. Although recruiting companies exist, there is a missing link between their connection with skilled professionals who are a right fit for the job and for candidates who sometimes feel they don't get a fair chance. 
Many applicants are overlooked because they don't understand how to properly communicate their skills - even if they are experienced and good at their job. This frustrates applicants who want to get hired and recruiters who aren't being matched with quality candidates. The holes can be filled with the Employchain mobile app, which has extensively studied the issues in the labour market and created a perfect solution for everyone.

 
 
How Employchain changes the game
How does it work?
Employchain has simplified the process for both job seekers and recruiters.


Applicants only need a profile consisting of keywords with skill levels - no more confusing CV's or cover letters


The app automatically matches applicants to recruiters - no more endless applying


Applicants are only alerted when a company is interested in an interview - no more disappointing rejection letters


Profiles can be listed anonymously without pictures or name - no chance for discrimination 


Zaire signs up for Employchain

Applicants only need a profile consisting of keywords with skill levels
Zaire fills out a profile consisting of simple keywords in the categories of basic information, skill level and personal interests/hobbies.  The process takes approximately 10 minutes and doesn't require a complicated cover letter because all important information is posted on the profile in concise, easy-to-read sections.

The app automatically matches applicants to recruiters 
His profile gets shortlisted to companies that created job ads with certain criteria. Our algorithm matches his education, experience, skills, hobbies and more. This feature eliminates the need to spend countless hours browsing through available jobs or applicants because the app is constantly working to do the matching for Zaire and the recruiters.

Applicants are only alerted when a company is interested in an interview
Only when a company is interested in him, he is notified about a match. Now it is his turn to decide whether he wants to get in contact or not to proceed with an interview. He no longer receives emails in his inbox with rejection letters - all notifications from Empoychain contain only positive messages and Zaire starts feeling excited about the job search process.

Profiles can be listed anonymously without pictures or name
The Employchain app offers an option for Zaire to hide personal details such as his name, age and appearance. This offers a fair chance to represent himself based only on his qualifications and experience without worrying about other factors influencing the selection process. Companies will still be automatically matched with his profile based on keywords and therefore,  his skills will be the most important thing presented to the company.
 
What does this have to do with blockchain?
What is a blockchain?
A blockchain is a series of data or records that are stored online and linked together in digital blocks. Each block contains timestamps and data of the previous block, therefore if there is a break in the chain link of data then it is revealed to all. There is no central authority, so the system cannot be corrupted or biased. This allows for secure exchanges of information on the internet which is neutral for all parties involved. 
How Employchain uses blockchain
 

 
Employchain is building up a peer-to-peer blockchain network for universities, students and companies in order to verify and track users' education, work experiences and other information that can be validated with minimal effort. This will be done by working in collaboration with local companies, universities and organizations who can provide certificates that validate the backgrounds of users.
This provides a great benefit: recruiters or companies don't have to double-check qualifications anymore. As a result, information on a CV becomes more trustworthy and it is guaranteed that no one else, not even ourselves, can change or corrupt any of the data. The process is completely secured, unbiased and extremely efficient for both recruiters and applicants.

What we need & what you get
You are here because we are asking you for help to fund the alpha version of our product. In order to realise this, there are mainly development costs. This refers to our planned alpha version. The blockchain functionality will not be included in the beginning as we want to validate the user experience and acceptance of the app in the alpha version. As soon as the alpha version has been tested successfully, we will develop the first public beta release with improvements and blockchain network feature. In case we are able to collect more funds than the given goal, it will be used for the implementation of the beta version as well.

<p>NatiChat is a free, secure group messaging app for expats working and living far from their home countries. It is also perfect for exchange students who are studying on a foreign university or immigrants who would like to connect with their fellow citizens.</p>
<p>I built this app to let everyone freely communicate in larger groups and to discover new friends in the city. Chat rooms can host up to 500 people who can converse freely, in real-time with others. </p>

<p>When building NatiChat, I had in my his own experience
living more than 20 years in a foreign country. I always had the desire to
connect with people of the same ethnicity but lacked the tools to do so. Other
apps such as Facebook Messenger or Slack didn’t allow to discover new people in
the area and also was closed to a certain group of people, such as your own

<p>I was born in Ha Noi, Vietnam and I'm the 2nd generation of immigrants in Warsaw, Poland. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">My dad finished his studies during the 80's in Gdańsk (<a href=""http://www.am.gdynia.pl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Naval Academy</a>). He majored in Ship Engineering (we used to build a lot of model ships when I was little). After his graduation he decided to come back to Vietnam and took a job in Polish Embassy in Ha Noi. During the 90's we moved as a family here, together with my mom they set up an import / export business and within a few years, it took off thanks to the Polish revolution of 1989 (transformation from Socialism do Democracy) that triggered massive demand of everything from clothing, foods to electronics and imported meat. </span></p>

<p>I grew up in a strong, connected society of Vietnamese here in Warsaw, Poland. During my teenage years we were usually hanging out everyday on <b>mIRC</b> - a desktop messaging client that hosted millions of chatrooms across the globe. One of those channels was called ""Vietnamese in Warsaw"" that allowed us to communicate everyday with our friends. We were logged in 24/7 and had numerous meet-up's in real life. <b>It was a wonderful time when we felt that everyday, there was someone out there that would listen to our stories and experiences. We helped each other a lot.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>With that experience in mind, we at Risen. created NatiChat - a free messaging platform for expats and immigrants that are far away from their native homes. We would like to ask for your <b>contribution to keep this app forever free and without ads</b>. The money will go solely into renting servers and providing new features for the community.</p>

</div> <p>I've been asked a lot about what will <b>encryption mean for governments and terrorist threats</b>. This is a very important issue that we will face once we will implement Encrypted Private Rooms and Private Messaging.</p>
<p>As with every technology that is disrupting every possible industry in the world, it always has a good and a bad side. It's especially prescient against the backdrop of Apple's ongoing fight over encryption with the FBI. Think also about Facebook. Would you ever <b>want your messages, private photos and sensitive information be traceable by every government, especially by the likes of CIA, NSA, FBI?</b></p>
<p>We will not introduce ads that will track you. We will always put your privacy first. So encryption will be one of the key features that we intent to implement. The ones that wage wars in the name of their religion will always find a way to communicate, even if they didn't have the tools such as NatiChat to do so. <b>We strongly believe that entire societies will be better off if we introduced a safer and more private way of exchanging messages.</b></p>

but you can also directly have a 1-on-1 chat with anyone you choose, your
friend from your own contacts list or other group chatter,
- The app will notify you whenever there will be a new
message from the rooms that you are currently sitting in,
- You can send different GIF's and Emoji's - there's a wide
range of that embedded in the chatting bar.
NatiChat is currently funded by Risen. – a software
consultancy which I founded.

The story behind NatiChat
I was previously Founder & CEO of MyBaze.com - a design marketplace for up-and-coming brands. You can check my LinkedIn profile here. I'm now running a software development and consultancy boutique called Risen. 

                                       
I was born in Ha Noi, Vietnam and I'm the 2nd generation of immigrants in Warsaw, Poland. My dad finished his studies during the 80's in Gdańsk (Naval Academy). He majored in Ship Engineering (we used to build a lot of model ships when I was little). After his graduation he decided to come back to Vietnam and took a job in Polish Embassy in Ha Noi. During the 90's we moved as a family here, together with my mom they set up an import / export business and within a few years, it took off thanks to the Polish revolution of 1989 (transformation from Socialism do Democracy) that triggered massive demand of everything from clothing, foods to electronics and imported meat.

With that experience in mind, we at Risen. created NatiChat - a free messaging platform for expats and immigrants that are far away from their native homes. We would like to ask for your contribution to keep this app forever free and without ads. The money will go solely into renting servers and providing new features for the community.
Please visit NatiChat for more information on how the app works.


             





The app was created by myself (idea & mockups) and my wonderful team here at Risen. We are top-notch developers, designers and entrepreneurs from Warsaw, Poland.
Idea- Duke Vu (CEO & Founder of Risen. - which developed NatiChat). LinkedIn

Founded MyBaze.com - a design marketplace for up-and-coming brands across Europe. Currently managing Risen. - a software development and consultancy.
UX / UI Designer - Magdalena

Joined Risen. to develop awesome mobile apps and websites. Previously designed for McDonald's, leading Polish banks and other notable A-list corporate clients.
Back-end architecture - Marcin


A young tech wizard, aged 18. Under the supervision of Piotr & Sebastian we hope him to be the next Mark Zuckerberg! See his code repository here: https://github.com/Nicarim
Android developer -Tomasz

A Software Engineer at Samsung, joined Risen. to develop NatiChat. The main architect of NatiChat and also lead developer in this project.Supervising Engineer I - Piotr (CTO & Co-founder Risen.) LinkedIn

Previously worked for MicroStrategy, Roche and other A-list corporations. Founded multiple startups and joined Risen. as its CTO & Co-founder. The magician behind the curtains.Supervising Engineer II -Sebastian (co-CTO & Co-founder Risen.) LinkedIn

Previously worked for MicroStrategy as a Tech Consultant, Loterity and Syncano. Joined Risen. to be the architect of ultra-scalable software projects.



 The servers and new features will require funding. Here's a breakdown of how we intent to use your contributions:


The rest: $2 400 of funding will be used to promote this app among expats in different countries, mainly through sponsored PR content on blogs and expat news websites / magazines. The amount is also reserved for Indiegogo's and payment processing fees.


The app is now available for Android, but soon (ETA June 2016) wil be available also for iOS.
    Why should you contribute? The app will solve the problem of finding new international friends in your area, you should back this project if you are living overseas and would like to connect with people from your country, meet new expat friends or simply chat for fun, simultaneously with hundreds of people! It will also enable immigrant communities to better communicate with local citizens. Often, lack of communication leads to misunderstandings. 
With the help of NatiChat, we could also help fuel better understanding of how different expat communities live, work and interact. This could be potentially a very interesting social experiment that I hope you, The Contributor, will join me to discover.
Besides, there are awesome perks for the founding members of our community! Please check what they are and hopefully you could be part of a new social phenomenon.










 I've been asked a lot about what will encryption mean for governments and terrorist threats. This is a very important issue that we will face once we will implement Encrypted Private Rooms and Private Messaging.
As with every technology that is disrupting every possible industry in the world, it always has a good and a bad side. It's especially prescient against the backdrop of Apple's ongoing fight over encryption with the FBI. Think also about Facebook. Would you ever want your messages, private photos and sensitive information be traceable by every government, especially by the likes of CIA, NSA, FBI?
We will not introduce ads that will track you. We will always put your privacy first. So encryption will be one of the key features that we intent to implement. The ones that wage wars in the name of their religion will always find a way to communicate, even if they didn't have the tools such as NatiChat to do so. We strongly believe that entire societies will be better off if we introduced a safer and more private way of exchanging messages.




    How can you help us other than funding? If you have friends that were born in your native country, or families that are living overseas, please help us spread the word by sharing this on Social Media! Please download our app to see how easily it is to invite more people into the messenger.

A stream of water flows inside PlantSteps body and/or at Nursery level and waters plant roots. With NFT you can use even constant water flow and optimize growing speed of lettuce etc.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>DWC</b><br/></span></p>
<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_water_culture"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Deep water culture</a> means that plant roots are living in the water tank. Plants live in net pots at the PlantSteps holes (4) on nursery level. This is efficient way to grow big fruit plants like chilies and tomatoes.</p>
<p>With DWC you have to make sure water gets enough oxygen or plant roots will drown. This can be done by pumping the water often, almost constantly, or by adding a air-pump and air-stone to system. </p>
<p><b>COMBINATION OF MANY</b></p>You can also combine these techniques. PlantSteps can be using NFT and nurcery level Ebb&amp;flow and also DWC with big plants on Nurcery level holes.<br/>You just divide water rise pipe from the pump to two pipes.<br/>One going to top of PlantSteps and one going to Nurcery level connection.

<p>In start of 2015 <a href=""http://fi.linkedin.com/in/jounispets"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jouni Spets</a>, an innovative
businessman and a garden and hydroponic hobbyist from Finland, invented a new gardening solution.</p>

for his home. Jouni got stuck <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">with the case and he ended up planning full hydroponic grow system based on new kind of vertical grow channels, PlantSteps.

THE USE OF
SUPRAGARDEN®

Watch what happens in Supragarden prototype in 1000X times speed.
1. Time lapse video is 48 hours of plant Life in 2½ minutes. Just planted chilies and tomatoes are in  middle.  


Same Chilies and Tomatoes 5 weeks later








Supragarden has automated watering system and it is easy to maintain. 
Plants get nutrients from water and no soil is needed in this garden. 
Same NFT grow technique is used globally in commercial green houses for farming herbs, salads, strawberries etc. 
PLANTSTEPS
PlantSteps are made with 3 mm thick, heavy duty PE plastic and they can be attached to each other, so making water tight connections and multi forming grow channel.
Water runs down from top PlantSteps and waters plant roots growing inside the PlantSteps body, 


















STARTING UP SUPRAGARDEN
You just need to assemble SUPRAGARDEN®, add plant seeds to net pots, maintain garden time-to-time and collect harvest. Please watch the concept presentation and great contribution from of local business school students: 







 









PLANTING YOUR GARDEN
You can start growing plants from seeds, cuttings or
you can continue to grow pre-planted grocery store herbs and lettuce at Supragarden. 

We recommend to plant seeds and cuttings to rockwool,and
cover them with  clay pebbles or coco fiber and put them first to Nursery
level for rooting. When roots are showing you can lift them to upper level PlantSteps®.  

You can also grow normal household green plants with same system, growing from cuttings is easy and you can fast grow even a big and flourishing green wall. 









WATER TANK
With big water
tank (> 50 liters) Supragarden is easy to maintain. 
Just add water and
nutrients about one to 4 times in a month, depending what you grow and how much
light plants are getting. 
Automated timer
operates water pump inside the water tank and lifts nutrient rich water to
highest level of garden.
Water flows down
inside PlantSteps feeding the plant roots and returns to water tank. 
Trim overgrown
plants and plant new cuttings taken from them. Collect harvest.
Plant roots get lot of oxygen and typically grow 3 times faster than with soil












NURSERY LEVEL 

Nursery level with water tank is base for PlantSteps but you can also grow small and big plants there. 
It can be used with several hydroponics techniques, even combined at the same time. 
These watering techniques listed below have different benefits and each gardener should select the best method according to plants, size and their growing phase.
NFT
Nutrient film technique is perfect for salads and herbs, but great also for most household plants that like water. A stream of water flows inside PlantSteps body and/or at Nursery level and waters plant roots. With NFT you can use even constant water flow and optimize growing speed of lettuce etc.
EBB & FLOW
Also called Flood and Drain. There water level is raised some 10-45 millimeters, time-to-time, according to timer setup. Typically 5-12 times in a day and none during night. 
Ebb&flow is good for young plants who do not have yet roots reaching outside net pot. 
DWC
Deep water culture means that plant roots are living in the water tank. Plants live in net pots at the PlantSteps holes (4) on nursery level. This is efficient way to grow big fruit plants like chilies and tomatoes.
With DWC you have to make sure water gets enough oxygen or plant roots will drown. This can be done by pumping the water often, almost constantly, or by adding a air-pump and air-stone to system. 
COMBINATION OF MANYYou can also combine these techniques. PlantSteps can be using NFT and nurcery level Ebb&flow and also DWC with big plants on Nurcery level holes.You just divide water rise pipe from the pump to two pipes.One going to top of PlantSteps and one going to Nurcery level connection.


























You can find more information about hydroponic growing techniques from internet. Like Aquaponics,  where aquarium is the water tank and fish waste as nutrient source for plants. That is the real local and organic food.
ERECTING YOUR SUPRAGARDEN



Supragarden system is self-standing up to four PlantSteps going directly up in indoor environment. We recommend always making separate fastening from top of the garden to wall or sealing to avoid garden to fall down on case of someone hitting garden by accident,  wind blowing happenings etc. 



SUPRAGARDEN® packages come with erection support system.








When you have more than four PlantSteps going directly up on SUPRAGARDEN or if you are growing a living green wall with big plants, garden should be supported also with wall, frame or wire attachment from PlantSteps attachment points. 
You can use following tested options for erecting your SUPRAGARDEN® and attaching PlantSteps® to window, wall or as self standing partition wall. Please remember, that plants will anyway mostly cover the system in few months or weeks. 







Hanging rope can be a design solution

You can support PlantSteps® elegantly with hanging rope, string or wire from sealing or other attachment point. 
At this picture PlantSteps® are attached to hemp rope simply with cable ties.


Metal wire, invisible support for glass walls
Metal wire and wire locks are easy and safe way also to support SUPRAGARDEN®. 
With them you can make sturdy but light looking green walls and food gardens. 









Telescopic pillars, easy way to make for green wall in middle of room as space divider 
For big and heavy green wall or garden you can use aluminium, telescopic pillars and pillar fasteners from local IKEA. 
You can raise these telescopic pillars (⌀ 50mm) between floor and sealing with distance 2,1 - 3,4 meter ( 6,9- 11,1 ft). 
Attach PlantSteps® to one or two posts by using high quality IKEA fasteners. Water tank comes between posts. This is perfect solution for balconies and windows where this ""transparent"" but sturdy body structure can hold up really big,  < 75 kg food garden. 
Link and product code for STOLMEN telescopic pillars/posts: 201.799.40
Link and product code for posts fasteners: 501.799.34




 You can also  order them on-line from IKEA. Cost for 2 pillars and fasteners is about $70 or 70 €.




Screw or nail plug attachment The most simple way to attach PlantSteps to wall or frame is to use long screws. This is especially good and simple way with green walls and and permanent garden structures inside and outside. General tube fastenersYou can also use standard pipe fasteners meant for 75 mm pipes and tubes. With these you can make really heavy and long lasting mounting  for you green wall and vertical garden.
PlantSteps have 75 mm pipe diameter on vertical pipe parts. This means that you can connect PlantSteps to normal 75 mm plastic pipes and and connectors and design then wild and free green wall and garden designs.










The Garden design is limited by your imagination.
Here are some potential user cases, drafted in start of project. 
In this Aquaponics concept plants get nutrients from fish aquarium. Such small tree can be done   by combining PlantSteps with some general tube parts from hardware store.


Unique Green Wall design possibilities; A Plant tree, done with PlantSteps and and general plastic tube parts from every hardware store. This is great design idea for big glass wall getting so a  ""living plant curtain"".

The backround story of SUPRAGARDEN® and PlantSteps®
In start of 2015 Jouni Spets, an innovative
businessman and a garden and hydroponic hobbyist from Finland, invented a new gardening solution.
Target, in the start, was to build green wall system
for his home. Jouni got stuck with the case and he ended up planning full hydroponic grow system based on new kind of vertical grow channels, PlantSteps. With them it is easy to make fertile window gardens and fabulous living walls. It is new way to grow food at homes, but also to decorate homes, offices and public places with green plants.

<div>Hacking has been around since the beginning of the digital age.  However, over the last decade it has grown in epidemic proportions from being merely an inconvenience to a major threat to our digital way of life.  Even encryption technology has proven to be not enough to slow the advance of hackers.</div>
<div>  </div>
<div>The Gallup organization reported  that <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">62% of Americans polled in late 2014 consider hacking to be the number one crime threat that directly
affects them.  Consider the fact that major data breaches occur on an almost weekly basis.  Consider further that the targets of these breaches are often large, well-organized companies such as <b>Target, Anthem Medical Care, Home Depot, AOL, Ashley Madison, JP Morgan Chase</b>,<b> </b>and the list goes on and on.  It is still too early to say what the fallout will be from the leak of the so called<b> </b>""<b>Panama Papers</b>,"" where eleven million financial documents were hacked from one of the world's most secretive companies, Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. </span>

<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">To make matters worse, even our most secure government sites are no longer safe, and agencies like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Office of Personnel and Management (OPM), and the U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs have all been victims of hacks.   Another important fact is that all of these breached organizations have spent and continue to spend a sizable amount of money on securing their data ... security that is obviously not being achieved.</span>

<br/><p>Most consumer-oriented digital services operate in a user ID/password environment.  Think about your email, social media, cloud storage and e-Commerce accounts, as well as online banking transactions.  Account providers attempt to implement various digital protection schemes to defeat breached credentials.  But being digital in nature makes them subject to the same attacks that hackers have used to penetrate large websites and collect a profile of digital information about you.  Once that personal information has been harvested, you are fair game for the hackers.</p>
<p>Have you ever experienced the following?</p>
<p></p>

<li>The contents of your email becoming known to unauthorized viewer ... think Sony</li>
<li>Have you ever had social media or Twitter messages attributed to you ...  but hey, you didn't send them</li>

<li>Who hasn't had the experience where we go to use our ATM or credit card and guess what ... no funds available.  This has become even more of a problem, given the rise in online purchasing and the porous nature of existing digital security</li>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;font-weight: normal;"">Have you ever heard the phrase, ""they catch the ants while the elephants walk by?"" There are many companies involved in trying to improve digital security.  However, it has become apparent that many of these elaborate defense schemes ignore the obvious and focus on the corner cases. </span></h3>
</div>
<div>Our Patent-Pending <b>Active Security Key</b> technology  addresses the obvious, and makes the computing device being used for account access an embedded part of the authorization process.  In other words, if anyone tries to access your protected accounts, they can to do so only it they have access to your authorized physical device.  If you have not authorized a device to access your account, that access request will be denied.  <b>USi</b> builds an identity of each computing device registered by collecting specific identifiers of the hardware being used, and creates an <b>Active Security Key</b> that identifies that device. When access to a protected account is requested, <b>USi</b> regenerates this digital identity and compares it to the values stored in the <b>USi</b> validation database.  By adding the hardware to the access authorization process, we can eliminate scale from the use of breached user information.  If a device making the access request is not registered to your account,  it simply does not gain access!</div>

<br/><p>For some years the Credit Card Industry has been moving toward a change in the method used to store card information and personal data on credit cards.  The old magnetic stripe that has been a staple of identification information for many years, had simply outgrown its usefulness and is very vulnerable to being compromised. The new technology implemented was embedding an  radio frequency ID tag (RFID) enabled chip into the card, as a replacement for the mag stripe.</p>
<p>Seemed like a good idea at first.  However the hacking community was able to design devices, some for as little as $8, that allowed a hacker to access and record the information on the chipped card with a very simple scanning device.  This can be accomplished by simply walking up to you, even when your credit cards are in your wallet or purse.</p>
<p>The aluminum wallet we are offering as part of our perk, shields the chipped card and defeats the scanning devices used by the hackers.</p>
<p>To understand more about why we have chosen to offer this simple solution as a perk, simply go to Google Search and type in <b>""RFID hacks of chipped cards""</b> ... you will get about 246,000 results.  A quick link to understand this problem is a three minute YouTube video at<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/tired-of-being-hacked-help-us-help-you/%C2%A0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmajlKJlT3U"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmajlKJlT3U"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmajlKJlT3U"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmajlKJlT3U</a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmajlKJlT3U."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">.</a></p>

<p>Our initial market focus was to work with business and government to offer IT professionals the tools to keep unauthorized hackers from gaining access to their networks and accounts.  However, the continued breaches involving consumers' digital ID information has convinced us that we also must focus our attention on how we can help people regain control over their digital identity.  The frustration and damage inflicted by these breaches has convinced us that we also need to launch our <b>USi</b> service to offer consumers real protection against the use of their breached data.</p>

We are Invysta Technology Group.   We are the developers of the Patent-Pending Active Security Key technology, giving you complete control of those Smartphones, computers and tablets that have authorization to access your important digital accounts. We are integrating our technology into a service to protect you, the consumer, from the damage that can be caused when your digital identity is compromised.  Our goal in this campaign is to raise funding to introduce and launch our UniversalSignin.Com (USi) data security service, targeted at consumers around the world.  


Our team is composed of technology industry veterans who have focused their attention on the growing problem of how to protect our digital identities and important data from cyber hackers.   Many of the Invysta team members have themselves been the victims of identity theft or unauthorized account access, and know first hand the frustration and damage to your good name and financial standing that these events can cause.  What USi offers is the ability to protect your strategic online accounts against unauthorized access, while also offering a bonus of remembering a single password to gain access to those accounts.  


We are serious people on a serious mission and we need your support to make this happen...  You can learn more about us at http://www.invysta.com/.  



So what's the problem???


Hacking has been around since the beginning of the digital age.  However, over the last decade it has grown in epidemic proportions from being merely an inconvenience to a major threat to our digital way of life.  Even encryption technology has proven to be not enough to slow the advance of hackers.
  
The Gallup organization reported  that 62% of Americans polled in late 2014 consider hacking to be the number one crime threat that directly
affects them.  Consider the fact that major data breaches occur on an almost weekly basis.  Consider further that the targets of these breaches are often large, well-organized companies such as Target, Anthem Medical Care, Home Depot, AOL, Ashley Madison, JP Morgan Chase, and the list goes on and on.  It is still too early to say what the fallout will be from the leak of the so called ""Panama Papers,"" where eleven million financial documents were hacked from one of the world's most secretive companies, Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. 



To make matters worse, even our most secure government sites are no longer safe, and agencies like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Office of Personnel and Management (OPM), and the U.S. Dept. of Veterans Affairs have all been victims of hacks.   Another important fact is that all of these breached organizations have spent and continue to spend a sizable amount of money on securing their data ... security that is obviously not being achieved.

  

  How does this affect you - the consumer?




Most consumer-oriented digital services operate in a user ID/password environment.  Think about your email, social media, cloud storage and e-Commerce accounts, as well as online banking transactions.  Account providers attempt to implement various digital protection schemes to defeat breached credentials.  But being digital in nature makes them subject to the same attacks that hackers have used to penetrate large websites and collect a profile of digital information about you.  Once that personal information has been harvested, you are fair game for the hackers.
Have you ever experienced the following?


The contents of your email becoming known to unauthorized viewer ... think Sony
Have you ever had social media or Twitter messages attributed to you ...  but hey, you didn't send them
Ever had someone get into your cloud storage accounts?  It happens, and even celebrities have had their most personal photos and videos spread around the web for all to view
Who hasn't had the experience where we go to use our ATM or credit card and guess what ... no funds available.  This has become even more of a problem, given the rise in online purchasing and the porous nature of existing digital security
Some social media accounts have the potential to create a great deal of embarrassment and consequences ... think Ashley Madison 








Why did we start www.universalsignin.com?
It started with a Good Idea!  We began the process of linking physical devices to authorization of account access in 2010.  Our initial effort revolved around applying encryption technology to data on storage devices like Hard Disk, Solid State and USB Flash drives. That effort has morphed into our current focus on providing a non-digital element in the account authorization process.  Our goal is to move the hacker community out of its digital comfort zone, and to remove scale from the damage they can inflict with breached user credentials.

Our patent-pending technology can be implemented in many market opportunities, and USi is the application of that technology to the consumer market ... a market in dire need of a strong security solution that can protect ordinary people from the clutches of the hacking community. 


How does USi keep your important accounts safe?



With USi we focus on the obvious. That means eliminating the hackers' ability to access your accounts by simply entering user IDs and passwords gained in massive data breaches occurring weekly.  Our goal is to securely  lock-up the ""front door"" to your accounts!  We have accomplished this by developing our Active Security Key technology, which integrates the unique identity of your hardware devices into the account authorization process.  It is likely a given that if you have a healthy online lifestyle, your credentials have become part of a hacker database.  A hacker can use your breached credentials to access your accounts by simply going to a different computing device and using these credentials to access your accounts.  
Some account providers present digital hoops to jump through if the account suspects it is being accessed in an unauthorized manner.  However, the key word here is digital.  If the hacking community is good enough to get the data in the first place, putting a few digital obstacles in the way of experienced hackers, provides little in the way of real security.  With USi, we introduce the identity of the  physical device making the access request into the account authorization process, thus taking hackers out of their digital comfort zone.

USi is also a password manager on Steroids ...


Remembering passwords is something we all struggle with. With our USi service, only a single password is required.
 

When your important accounts are protected by USi, you need only remember a single password to access all of your important accounts that have been assigned to USi for protection.  Think of USi as a password manager on Steroids ...





How our Active Security Key Protects you!

Have you ever heard the phrase, ""they catch the ants while the elephants walk by?"" There are many companies involved in trying to improve digital security.  However, it has become apparent that many of these elaborate defense schemes ignore the obvious and focus on the corner cases. 

Our Patent-Pending Active Security Key technology  addresses the obvious, and makes the computing device being used for account access an embedded part of the authorization process.  In other words, if anyone tries to access your protected accounts, they can to do so only it they have access to your authorized physical device.  If you have not authorized a device to access your account, that access request will be denied.  USi builds an identity of each computing device registered by collecting specific identifiers of the hardware being used, and creates an Active Security Key that identifies that device. When access to a protected account is requested, USi regenerates this digital identity and compares it to the values stored in the USi validation database.  By adding the hardware to the access authorization process, we can eliminate scale from the use of breached user information.  If a device making the access request is not registered to your account,  it simply does not gain access!





Our Patent-Pending Technology!


We have worked hard to develop our technology and believe we have created something special and unique.  The founders of Invysta have filed a number of patent applications covering our basic Active Security Key technology used in your USi account.  The founders of the company are experienced in the pursuit of patents, and are listed inventors on nearly 40 issued utility patents.


What devices can you register to your USi account?



Our goal is to support all the major hardware platforms that consumers use today. That includes Smartphones, Tablets, PCs  and Macs and running  Windows, Apple iOS & OSX, Android, Chrome and Blackberry.  Our plan is to initially launch our service with support for Windows and Android devices, and rapidly expand to support other operating environments.

  What protection plans does USi offer?



USi offers a number of plans for consumers, as well as our Ultimate plan for small business.  We also can work directly with larger businesses or government to meet their needs.  These plans are based on the number of devices you wish to register for access to your strategic accounts, and how many accounts you wish to protect.  

As an added Perk for our loyal Indiegogo followers, each USi protection plan also includes guaranteed annual renewals for your selected plan at the same price paid during this campaign.

As a supporter in our crowdfunding campaign, you can chose the plan that best fits your needs.  The annual pricing in our Perks amounts to approximately 50% off our normal annual pricing.  In addition, you will receive 1-20 metal wallets, depending on the plan you select (see details in Perks).  











How do I setup and use my USi account?


Registering a device to your USi account :


During the account creation process, you will be asked to select a single password that will control access to the USi site, and all of your protected accounts.

Once your USi account has been established,  your first device can be registered to the
account.


USi pushes a client agent to the device
being registered – that agent has a unique number which identifies the account
with USi. 


Once the client agent is installed, USi sends a character key that collects a set of predefined hardware and software identifiers, as specified by the character key.


Once these identifiers are collected, they are submitted to the USi cloud manager which controls the USi Validation Database.


The USi account holders can repeat the process and register as many devices as specified
within the USi plan they purchased.



Adding a Website to your USi account:



Once the first device has been registered to your USi account, you may begin adding strategic website accounts from the list of USi supported sites. 

You may add sites up to the number defined within the plan you purchased.

During this process you will be asked to  provide the current user name and current
password required to access your account on the selected site. 


USi creates a random password of hashed data
corresponding to the password template which matches the selected site.


USi electronically accesses your selected account, and
executes a change password routine, inserting the new hashed password created by USi.

Some websites may require independent validation of the password change from the account holder.
Once the password change procedure is complete, that account can only be accessed by a device that is already registered in the USi validation database.

You no longer need to fear that your selected sites can be accessed, based solely on your username and password which may already have been breached.



Accessing a USi protected website or account:



Go to www.universalsignin.com from a hardware device you have previosly  added to your USi account.


Enter your USi username and password.


The USi system institutes a regeneration of the specified
identifiers from the device initiating the access request.


The regenerated identifiers are then matched against the identifiers that were stored in the USi validation database at registration. 


If the regenerated identifiers do not match the identifiers stored in the database, a match is not confirmed, and the account access request
is denied.


If a match of the identifiers to those stored in the database is confirmed, you are then presented
with a listing of the websites/accounts that you have previously added to your  USi account.


You may now select the account that you wish to access, and USi automatically submits the username and the machine generated hashed password allowing you to access the account.

Just one username and password to remember, while adding the security of knowing that your accounts can only be accessed from a hardware device you have registered, and not from any of the billions of other devices around the world!!!



What kind of accounts should I protect with USi?

There is no need to register all the online accounts you access and use.  Many of them are informational and do not represent a financial or social threat to you, even if they are breached.  We recommend adding strategic accounts to your USi protection plan ... accounts which if breached, could cause financial consequences or damage to your good name and credit score.
Examples of strategic accounts that should be protected include, but are not limited to the following:  





Personal
Email Services


Social
Media/Dating Sites

Financial
Accounts (Banking/Credit Card)

 E-Commerce sites you use


Your Cloud
Storage


The following table reflects the initial target websites we anticipate supporting at product launch.  We will continually be adding additional sites to our support list, based heavily on the input of our customer base.



   10 Things To Know About USi!


   


What will the funds be used for?




Invysta has invested heavily in developing its Active Security Key technology, which has many applications beyond the consumer market. This includes business and government website protection, credit card transactions, and the fast approaching Internet of Things.  
We have launched this campaign because we believe that it is imperative that we also expand our effort to protect consumers, who today are at the mercy of hackers. Consumers have been pummeled with the financial strains of hacked bank accounts and unauthorized purchases, as well as loss of their digital identity and good name. 
The funds from this campaign will be used to create the USi website and to complete the technical integration of our Active Security Key technology into the consumer process. 
  


What is the purpose of the Metal Wallet perk?



For some years the Credit Card Industry has been moving toward a change in the method used to store card information and personal data on credit cards.  The old magnetic stripe that has been a staple of identification information for many years, had simply outgrown its usefulness and is very vulnerable to being compromised. The new technology implemented was embedding an  radio frequency ID tag (RFID) enabled chip into the card, as a replacement for the mag stripe.
Seemed like a good idea at first.  However the hacking community was able to design devices, some for as little as $8, that allowed a hacker to access and record the information on the chipped card with a very simple scanning device.  This can be accomplished by simply walking up to you, even when your credit cards are in your wallet or purse.
The aluminum wallet we are offering as part of our perk, shields the chipped card and defeats the scanning devices used by the hackers.
To understand more about why we have chosen to offer this simple solution as a perk, simply go to Google Search and type in ""RFID hacks of chipped cards"" ... you will get about 246,000 results.  A quick link to understand this problem is a three minute YouTube video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmajlKJlT3U.
(Color may vary based on availability)


    Risks & Challenges 

As with any venture, risks and challenges are always a part of the landscape.  We believe that our experience and dedication to what we are doing helps us to minimize those risks.  Our Active Security Key technology is working in beta form on Windows platforms, and we are in the process of porting it to Android/Chrome platforms, following with Apple OSX and iOS devices and Blackberry.
Our initial market focus was to work with business and government to offer IT professionals the tools to keep unauthorized hackers from gaining access to their networks and accounts.  However, the continued breaches involving consumers' digital ID information has convinced us that we also must focus our attention on how we can help people regain control over their digital identity.  The frustration and damage inflicted by these breaches has convinced us that we also need to launch our USi service to offer consumers real protection against the use of their breached data.
We understand the challenges we face and are dedicated to bringing digital data security to the people who so desperately need it.

When will the perks be fulfilled?


Perks will only be available to contributors from the United States.  We expect to expand to foreign markets in early 2017, and may consider another campaign in those areas when we are ready to expand.The Metal Wallet Perk will be fulfilled no later than 45 days after the end of our campaign.  Color may vary depending on availability.  For those who select one of our account protection plans, we are projecting that the USi site will be operational for Windows and Android devices in Q4/2016.  Apple iOS and OSX support is scheduled to commence in Q1/2017, with Blackberry support beginning in Q2/2017.   Pitch in and let's make the digital world safer!!! 

We realize that some people simply can't afford to contribute to our campaign.  But that doesn't mean you can't be part of the solution to this worldwide problem! Help us promote our campaign through word-of-mouth, and by asking people you know to use the Indiegogo share tools to make others aware of the good we can do in combating digital fraud.
Thanks in advance for your help and support.

work surfaces.  With our snap-in accessory system, modular power and PC options, TouchTop is specially designed to empower students of all abilities.  Our removable USB battery pack charges a student's mobile device,  making it easy to keep their devices charged throughout an entire school day.        Students and schools embrace mobile technology like never before, and there's a lot of room for improvement.  Education has moved to a more hands-on approach, including ""flipped classrooms"", experiential learning and the maker movement.  The cornerstone  of this approach is a belief and understanding that students better retain knowledge and learn more deeply when they collaborate in small groups or get hands-on with their lesson material. TouchTop is designed to address these needs, giving students amazing new capabilities at their desk and on their work surfaces to fully embrace mobile, cloud and accessible technologies.  Designed to fit on existing surfaces, TouchTop brings additional storage, protection, power and computing capabilities and allows those surfaces to be customized to each student's needs and abilities.Join us on journey to create innovative technology for students all over the world.      TouchTop enables mobile devices such as phones and tablets to continuously charge throughout the school day. This ensures student productivity remains uninterrupted while using their devices.  TouchTop also includes accessories designed for additional storage capabilities and device management solutions without impeding on their existing work area.  Getting power to a student's desk is difficult in most classrooms.  So, we spent a lot of time focusing on how teachers and students would like to see this problem solved.  TouchTop provides an easily removable battery module that simply slides into the side of the unit.  Once docked in the module bay, power is delivered to a student's mobile device for charging.  The USB charging port is exposed within our smartphone and tablet stand and easily accessible by a student sitting at the desk. Storing and using a student's mobile device is now possible while not interfering with the materials on the surface of their desk.  Our universal device stand is designed to support small form factor smartphones up to the largest iPads.  All accessories can easily connect to our standard accessory port located on the back and sides of TouchTop.  This allows for perfect positioning of their device for their needs or for collaborative work groups.Our stand also articulates on 3 different axis which allows it to be moved into just the right position.  Rotation from landscape to portrait modes, vertical and horizontal adjustments allow a device to be positioned correctly for a student or to share screen contents in small group collaborations. Our easy to use accessory attachment system allows students and teachers to adapt a student's work space to meet each lesson's or student's unique needs.  Our initial accessory we've designed is the universal smartphone stand to address the storage and protective needs students have while using smart technology during their classes.From storage systems to hold books to storage systems for STEM and robotics kits or art supplies, the expansion capability of TouchTop is nearly limitless.  Testing and privacy partitions along with articulating arms and stands that hold external displays can enhance ease of use and accessiblilty for every student's needs. Schools and students struggle to keep devices charged and in-use throughout an entire school day.  We met this challenge head-on with a simple, removable battery solution that can be easily removed to allow overnight charging to keep our student's up and running.Rugged, durable and safe are the key design goals for our battery system.  The student's charging port is elevated above the surface of TouchTop to avoid spills and not get in the way of student papers and materials while their devices are in use and charging.Like our removable battery, TouchTop has a removable PC module that slides easily into the unit and brings a full PC experience to our students.  Our TouchTop Scholar unit, which includes a built-in touch display, automatically connects to our PC when docked into the PC module bay.We started our journey in education technology teaching coding and apps development to K12 students, so we are working hard to deliver TouchTop as an opportunity to embrace STEM and experiential learning for our students.  Our roadmap includes Windows 10, Windows 10 IoT Core edition, Raspberry Pi and Android modules to expose students to the depths of amazing technology available today.    TouchTop will initially support the popular, traditional 18"" x 24"" student desk.  We will design updated base layers and surface molds for our units to fit many different styles and size desks.  Contact us for more information to build units to meet your specific needs.TouchTop StudentUnit Dimensions: 24""w X  18""d X 0.4""h Unit Weight:  3.88lbsMounting:  Handles mount option -

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Vitalie, Maria, Adrian and Cristina. The Bee-Library project has unite us because we love to make a difference, to prove that we can be the change, because we care about the future and because we want to live in an educated society. Because we like to read! </p>
<p>The public Libraries from Moldova’s villages, are in need of serious investments in order to offer decent study conditions to their visitors, especially kids.  A donation for a set of books would be a good idea, but it is not enough in order to solve the long term problem.</p>
<p><strong><i>Then, what would the solution be?</i></strong><br/><br/>In order to improve the study conditions and the process acquisition of new books we decided to start up a small business, which will <u>permanently support the libraries from Moldova</u>. In other words, we will build <u>a sustainable assistance</u> for this institutions.</p>
<p>Taking into consideration the natural conditions, our work experience and knowledge in the field, we decided to create an apiary on the Cojusna village territory. Each year, half of the obtained profit will be offered as goods or services to the libraries from different villages from Moldova. Thus, starting with Autumn, 2017, we will be able to support the first library, from Cojusna, on its way to development. And this support will become bigger and bigger each year due to the development of our business and the support of other economic entities that we plan to attract as partners for our cause.</p>
<p>Your donations will help us build this apiary and to offer to hundreds of children from Moldova access to new, interesting books, to decent services and conditions for research and study.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our project needs a total of <strong>8300 Euros</strong>. We have collected <u>1800 Euros from local sources</u>, but we still need <u>6500 Euros</u>.  The amount of 8300 Euros will allow us to buy the hives (80 units), bee families (80 families),  the necessary tools and equipment for working with bees (tubes, centrifuge, masks etc.) and to decently organize the apiary. Three young people from Cojusna village will be involved in this project, a professional beekeeper and two seasonal workers. </p>
<p>The business budget will be divided in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>4000 Euros =  hives;</li>
<li>2800 Euros = bee families (biological material);</li>
<li>900 Euros = the centrifuge  (the device for honey extraction);</li>
<li>600 Euros = miscellaneous (buckets, pots, knives, tongs, mask  etc).  </li>
</ul>

<p>Any unforeseen expenses will be covered from the personal account of the Group of Initiative.</p>
<p>Dear Friends, please see on the right field<strong> the perks that you'll receive</strong> for your contribution and please, don't forget to provide an e-mail address. But the most precious perks that you'll get it's gratitude of thousands of kids and certainty that you are the source of their happiness!</p>
<p>As soon as we begin to implement our project, we will work in parallel with people from other places in Moldova in order to expand this business model. Our vision is, that in  few years we will have <u>a network of small businesses which will stimulate and support the communities</u>, to encourage the development process of small villages. And you can contribute NOW to the realization of this dream!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The planned impact</h3>
<p>”Bee-Library” is a project that brings an innovative spirit in the field of small businesses in Republic of Moldova. Our idea is to create a business that is committed to serve the community and to develop itself. Why we have chosen to develop the library when we can invest in any field or we could assign all profit business just for us? Because by investing in education, we invest in our future. We all want to live in an educated society, with intelligent, responsible, active and valuable people.<br/>A child who reads becomes a great personality. A society with people who love reading is a developed and respected society.</p>
<p>Our group had many ideas, but we chose the bees because it is the most eco-friendly activity from the agricultural ones and because we love nature. Beekeeping is profitable in Moldova weather conditions and does not require huge investments, so it can almost exist by itself, accumulating profit. A big advantage is that in the village there are several beekeepers who can offer their services at any time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Some risks </h3>
<p>Risks that may arise in our work are related to the natural hazards more than to the anthropogenic factors. We will also seek the services of a veterinarian if we suspect any occurrence of diseases in bees.</p>
<p>Selling of the honey and bee products will be achieved in direct contact with consumers, both in food markets and shops, and on the Internet. The high quality of our products will reduce the risk of accumulation of big quantities for a very long a period. If necessary, we will consider the possibility of selling those products to companies exporting honey abroad.</p>
<p>Don't forget, YOU can BEE a LIBRARY!</p>

<p><br/><strong>VERSIUNEA ROMÂNĂ  <br/><br/>Scurtă prezentare a proiectului ”Bee-Library”</strong></p>
<p>Vitalie, Maria, Adrian și Cristina. Proiectul Bee-Library ne-a unit pentru că ne place să schimbăm lucrurile în bine, pentru că ne pasă de viitor și pentru că ne dorim parte a unei societăți culte. Pentru că ne place să citim!<br/>Bibliotecile publice din Moldova au nevoie de investiții ca să poată oferi condiții decente utilizatorilor săi, mai ales copiilor.<br/>O donație pentru a procura un set de cărți ar fi un lucru benefic dar asta nu ar rezolva problema pe termen lung. Și atunci care ar fi soluția?<br/>Pentru ca să contribuim la îmbunătățirea condițiilor și procurarea cărților am decis să înființăm o mică afacere, care să susțină financiar bibliotecile, în mod permanent. Cu alte cuvinte, vom construi un fel de asistență durabilă pentru această instituție.<br/>Ținând cont de condițiile naturale, experiența de lucru și cunoștințele din domeniu am decis să înființăm o stupină de albine în teritoriul satului Cojușna. În fiece an, jumătate din profitul obținut din această activitate va fi oferit sub formă de bunuri și servicii către bibliotecă. Astfel, începând cu toamna anului 2017, vom putea sprijini biblioteca în calea ei spre modernizare. Și acest sprijin va fi tot mai mare cu fiece an, datorită dezvoltării afacerii noastre, dar și implicării pe parcurs, a altor agenți economici în această cauză a comunității noastre.</p>
<p>Donațiile Dvs ne vor ajuta să construim această stupină și să oferim sutelor de copii și tineri din Moldova acces la cărți noi, interesante, la servicii și condiții decente de cercetare și lectură.</p>
<p><strong>Care sunt necesitățile proiectului și ce primești în schimbul unei donații?</strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Vitalie, Maria, Adrian and Cristina. The Bee-Library project has unite us because we love to make a difference, to prove that we can be the change, because we care about the future and because we want to live in an educated society. Because we like to read! 
The public Libraries from Moldova’s villages, are in need of serious investments in order to offer decent study conditions to their visitors, especially kids.  A donation for a set of books would be a good idea, but it is not enough in order to solve the long term problem.
Then, what would the solution be?In order to improve the study conditions and the process acquisition of new books we decided to start up a small business, which will permanently support the libraries from Moldova. In other words, we will build a sustainable assistance for this institutions.
Taking into consideration the natural conditions, our work experience and knowledge in the field, we decided to create an apiary on the Cojusna village territory. Each year, half of the obtained profit will be offered as goods or services to the libraries from different villages from Moldova. Thus, starting with Autumn, 2017, we will be able to support the first library, from Cojusna, on its way to development. And this support will become bigger and bigger each year due to the development of our business and the support of other economic entities that we plan to attract as partners for our cause.
Your donations will help us build this apiary and to offer to hundreds of children from Moldova access to new, interesting books, to decent services and conditions for research and study.

What We Need & What You Get
Our project needs a total of 8300 Euros. We have collected 1800 Euros from local sources, but we still need 6500 Euros.  The amount of 8300 Euros will allow us to buy the hives (80 units), bee families (80 families),  the necessary tools and equipment for working with bees (tubes, centrifuge, masks etc.) and to decently organize the apiary. Three young people from Cojusna village will be involved in this project, a professional beekeeper and two seasonal workers. 
The business budget will be divided in the following way:

4000 Euros =  hives;
2800 Euros = bee families (biological material);
900 Euros = the centrifuge  (the device for honey extraction);
600 Euros = miscellaneous (buckets, pots, knives, tongs, mask  etc).  


Any unforeseen expenses will be covered from the personal account of the Group of Initiative.
Dear Friends, please see on the right field the perks that you'll receive for your contribution and please, don't forget to provide an e-mail address. But the most precious perks that you'll get it's gratitude of thousands of kids and certainty that you are the source of their happiness!
As soon as we begin to implement our project, we will work in parallel with people from other places in Moldova in order to expand this business model. Our vision is, that in  few years we will have a network of small businesses which will stimulate and support the communities, to encourage the development process of small villages. And you can contribute NOW to the realization of this dream!

The planned impact
”Bee-Library” is a project that brings an innovative spirit in the field of small businesses in Republic of Moldova. Our idea is to create a business that is committed to serve the community and to develop itself. Why we have chosen to develop the library when we can invest in any field or we could assign all profit business just for us? Because by investing in education, we invest in our future. We all want to live in an educated society, with intelligent, responsible, active and valuable people.A child who reads becomes a great personality. A society with people who love reading is a developed and respected society.
Our group had many ideas, but we chose the bees because it is the most eco-friendly activity from the agricultural ones and because we love nature. Beekeeping is profitable in Moldova weather conditions and does not require huge investments, so it can almost exist by itself, accumulating profit. A big advantage is that in the village there are several beekeepers who can offer their services at any time.

Some risks 
Risks that may arise in our work are related to the natural hazards more than to the anthropogenic factors. We will also seek the services of a veterinarian if we suspect any occurrence of diseases in bees.
Selling of the honey and bee products will be achieved in direct contact with consumers, both in food markets and shops, and on the Internet. The high quality of our products will reduce the risk of accumulation of big quantities for a very long a period. If necessary, we will consider the possibility of selling those products to companies exporting honey abroad.
Don't forget, YOU can BEE a LIBRARY!

VERSIUNEA ROMÂNĂ  Scurtă prezentare a proiectului ”Bee-Library”
Vitalie, Maria, Adrian și Cristina. Proiectul Bee-Library ne-a unit pentru că ne place să schimbăm lucrurile în bine, pentru că ne pasă de viitor și pentru că ne dorim parte a unei societăți culte. Pentru că ne place să citim!Bibliotecile publice din Moldova au nevoie de investiții ca să poată oferi condiții decente utilizatorilor săi, mai ales copiilor.O donație pentru a procura un set de cărți ar fi un lucru benefic dar asta nu ar rezolva problema pe termen lung. Și atunci care ar fi soluția?Pentru ca să contribuim la îmbunătățirea condițiilor și procurarea cărților am decis să înființăm o mică afacere, care să susțină financiar bibliotecile, în mod permanent. Cu alte cuvinte, vom construi un fel de asistență durabilă pentru această instituție.Ținând cont de condițiile naturale, experiența de lucru și cunoștințele din domeniu am decis să înființăm o stupină de albine în teritoriul satului Cojușna. În fiece an, jumătate din profitul obținut din această activitate va fi oferit sub formă de bunuri și servicii către bibliotecă. Astfel, începând cu toamna anului 2017, vom putea sprijini biblioteca în calea ei spre modernizare. Și acest sprijin va fi tot mai mare cu fiece an, datorită dezvoltării afacerii noastre, dar și implicării pe parcurs, a altor agenți economici în această cauză a comunității noastre.
Donațiile Dvs ne vor ajuta să construim această stupină și să oferim sutelor de copii și tineri din Moldova acces la cărți noi, interesante, la servicii și condiții decente de cercetare și lectură.
Care sunt necesitățile proiectului și ce primești în schimbul unei donații?
Proiectul nostru are nevoie de un buget de 8300 euro. Din surse locale am colectat 1800 euro, mai avem nevoie de 6500. Suma de 8300 de euro ne va permite să cumpărăm stupii (80 bucati), familiile de albine (80 familii), ustensilele necesare lucrului cu albinele (unelte, vase, centrifugă, mască etc) și să amenajăm cumsecade această stupină. În afacere vor fi implicați 3 tineri din Cojușna, un specialist apicultor și doi lucrători de sezon.Bugetul afacerii va avea următorul conținut:

4000 euro = stupii cu toată completația;
2800 euro = familiile de albine (materialul biologic);
900 euro = centrifuga (aparatul de scos miere);
600 euro = altele (căldări, vase, cuțite, clește, mască etc).

Eventuale cheltuieli neprevăzute vor fi acoperite din contul Grupului de inițiativă.
Imediat ce vom începe să implementăm proiectul nostru, vom lucra în paralel și cu alți tineri din alte localități din Moldova pentru a extinde acest model antreprenorial. Dorim ca în cațiva ani, în țara noastră să funcționeze o adevărată rețea de mici afaceri care să stimuleze și să susțină comunitatea, să o încurajeze să se dezvolte!

<h3>The FirePi</h3>
<p>I was after a small and robust firewall solution that, out of the box, provided my home and small office networks suitable protection while still being extremely customisable and flexible in deployment.</p>
<p>Simply put, I wanted protection with ease of deployment without the overhead that industry leaders require.</p>
<p>I fell short in my search, unable to find a product that provided stable and effective protection on my network, not only from external hosts, but from internal users doing bad things. Other products claim to provide this functionality, but they're either too expensive for your average Jill or Joe, or the method used to provide a secure connection is ... <s>weird</s> unstable. So I built my own home grown firewall that is small, lightweight, robust, and damn easy to configure.</p>
<p>I'm now running a prototype FirePi device providing some of the functionality described here, but it needs work. The concept is to provide DHCP, DNS, service proxying, VPN connectivity (IPSec, TOR, other VPN provider here), network analytics so you can see who or what is attacking you and intrusion detection and protection capabilities.</p>
<p>For the home user, it must be easy to configure, extremely low powered, and damn easy to install. What I've use currently is pretty simple, so, why can't everyone have one?</p>
<h3>What will it do?</h3>
<p>Stop the bad guys from getting in! You are actively being probed and attacks are attempted against your Internet connection right now, and you are probably relying on your domestic grade home router.</p>
<p>This small firewall provides protection suitable for all homes and small offices that do not want to rely on cloud services or have the money and technical expertise to purchase outlay substantial amounts of money for network protection. FirePi is entirely self contained, providing proxying, DNS, DHCP, and, of course, Internet access.</p>
<p>Scheduled to obtain updates regularly, it will always be up to date with patches, however, even without updates and the restrictive default firewall, it will continue working efficiently and effectively, stopping those bad guys from getting in.</p>
<h3>The Kit</h3>
<p>The prototype I am running has a Cortex A7 quad-core processer, 512mb RAM, two Ethernet (one via USB) running Armbian, housed inside an ugly 3D printed case. I don't want the prototype to be this ugly or limited. The final product will be running a stable Linux or BSD based operating system with various case options, more memory, more power, and more storage capacity! </p>
<p>By using open hardware platforms and entirely open source software allows technical users to fully customise the FirePi and configure complex features such high availability and fail-over between multiple FirePi devices.</p>
<h3>Capability</h3>
<p>Out of the box the FirePi provides fully customisable packet filtering with a secure default to deny policy, malicious host blocking, and web content filtering, only requiring you to configure the basic settings to connect to the Internet, and it provides the rest.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514870306/pigt1o7nzhzt3e3pjsl5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This heat-map shows all of the malicious locations scanning and probing my Internet connection... simply being online attracts scans, probes, and malicious sources.</p>
<p>This means, if you are online, the bad guys (and some good guys) are scanning you for services published to the Internet and vulnerabilities presented by your router to (probably) add to their botnet. FirePi blocks these probes and scans, making it appear as if nothing exists on your IP address, meaning the malicious parties move on to another target (you're safe!).</p>
<p>Further, you can suck out the logs from FirePi and filter through your own analytics platform, such as a Security Information and Event Monitoring solution to analyse and determine the most common attacks and threats posed to your network.</p>
<p>What else could you want? For those tinkerers, you will have access to the full hardware specification of the device and hook directly into the headers, want to attach a screen to show current device statistics? No problems!</p>
<h3>The Funding</h3>
<p>The project is currently a concept and the funding will help establish a solid product to be delivered.</p>
<p>The funding will go towards design, development, and ensuring that when shipped FirePi will not be just another ugly networking device!</p>
<p>I've got a very rudimentary prototype of a prototype running currently providing protection to my own network, and it has significantly reduced latency while maintaining maximum throughput. This device is the bare minimum of what I want to deliver.</p>
<h3>It's a Concept</h3>
<p>$2,000 will progress this project from concept to prototype. This will cover development, hardware, and demonstration of a prototype device.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe the present marketplace for private company valuations is priced too highly, delivers valuations too late, is incapable of comparing many different companies side-by-side and is inaccurate in its output.</p>
<p>Unlisted provides a platform to build real-time prices, with the possibility of comparing many companies against one another at the same time and using artificial intelligence to improve accuracy.</p>
<p>Valuations on our platform are built using real-time market prices. The platform is AI powered - which means the system learns from current market and transaction prices, and allows users to to build algorithms or build/train their own completely new models.  For example, these algorithms can be re-configured by selecting the data in which to build &amp; train the models, by changing parameters such as time-frame, sector and size of previous deals, and we can optimise the model to be used to value a specific private company.</p>
<p>Its cost-effective as our clients can do much of data processing/training on our platform, that normally they would do in-house hiring teams of analysts. Users have access to the platform throughout the year rather than a one-off PDF report as its currently done. Thereby, making our platform a fraction of the cost to what you'd pay today for same privileges.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>The funding will pay for a roadshow to raise public funds on an equity fundraising platform. We are looking for backers to become stakeholders and strategic developers of our Minimum Viable Product to scale up.</li>
<li>Backers can become development partners and/or participate in the public funding round.</li>
</ul>
<p>What makes us worth funding? Patent-pending technology and scalability. We are the first to provide real-time private company valuations in the U.K.. Our solution is faster (taking seconds to execute), cheaper (than running it in house or outsourcing one off valuation) and more accurate (we track the market and train the models to test accuracy).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Unlisted is a game changer for UK business - at present if you're an investor in private companies or an entrepreneur who has put time and effort into building up a business it's not easy to find a valuation. Until now it's been laborious, tedious, relying on multiple sources of information. The result has been a valuation that is out of date by the time it's calculated, often wildly inaccurate and jaw-droppingly expensive to produce. This is a staid and unresponsive industry that charges too much and offers too little, leaving stakeholders, and the economy in general, badly served.</p>
<p>Not any more -- Unlisted is the only utility that provides real-time valuations for private companies as and when they are needed. Our proprietary application allows investors, the source of key funding for many private companies, to measure as many businesses as they want against each other, helping identify those with the most potential. It even allows investors and companies to manipulate inputs so as to forecast a range of different valuations under many different scenarios.</p>
<p>What makes us different is that we are seeking to do this in real-time. Why is this important? Up until now the process of finding the value for a private company has literally taken weeks. Unlisted can turn this process into a job that takes seconds and allows investors to look up a much wider range of potential investments. This focus on increasing efficiency amongst the investment community will ultimately aid our economy in becoming more efficient.</p>
<p>For the entrepreneurs and business owners, Unlisted gives them greater visibility about the success of their efforts, can help them in their relations with financial institutions in terms of financial planning, and can help incentivise staff more productively.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We believe Unlisted is disruptive to a conservative and often captive market, is a force for good, and is progressive in supporting policies and aims which are accepted across the political spectrum, such as the democratisation of financial markets, the liberalisation and diversification of financial services, the encouragement of broader stake and share ownership across the population, and the encouragement of wider participation in the U.K. employment market.</p>
<p>We believe our product allows entrepreneurs easier and faster access to finance with better returns. At the same time our service offers the investment community, including pension funds and individual investors, the chance to diversify their holdings and the opportunity to achieve higher returns in a low yield environment.</p>
<p>Given easier access to finance, we feel that our engine will improve the quality of life for those individuals who seek to go out on their own and start businesses, and will boost social inclusion through rewards for a wider range of skills and labour. There is a risk that some jobs may be lost in larger traditional financial institutions as the efficiencies of our system become entrenched in those companies, however we believe that this will be more than offset by the new jobs created through economic efficiencies of the correct allocation of capital, which Unlisted will encourage.</p>
<p>Valuation Accuracy: We will use sensitivity of the prices to changes with respect to various input parameters, including current asset price, interest rates and volatility. An option-pricing (risk sensitivity) comparable framework will be built around the product to ensure any fluctuations in prices of private company with respect to the underlying basket of stocks are known, documented and explained, and within the parameters.</p>
<p>Data availability: The company obtains data from private and public sources. In the former, contracts will be put in place between Unlisted and data vendors(Bloomberg, Equifax and London Stock Exchange) to ensure uninterrupted access. We will extract private company data from Companies House.</p>
<p>Litigation: The company is not engaged in any litigation. The company will continue engagement with the regulator to ensure all applicable regulations and compliance requirements are understood and met. We will work with FinTech Scotland and it's cohort of members to support the roll-out of our services. We make appropriate legal disclosures regarding liability and the reliance on the valuations. We have sought legal advice about using these datasets to produce private company valuations.</p>

Be one of the first to receive your own TeamSpirit report, enjoy cool Perks, and take advantage of big savings on Teamability products and services! Many of the Perks can be delivered without delay – because they are based in Teamability, and are currently being delivered to TGI clients across the U.S., Canada, and overseas as well. ​Teaming is a Life ForceThe moment two or more people come together in pursuit of a common purpose, their mission becomes infused with an invisible, sustaining force that is ‘the team’ itself. When team members recognize the fundamental needs of the living entity that is their team, and begin to make harmonious team contributions to meet those needs, great things can – and do – happen.Some people call this unifying force ‘team chemistry.’ Others call it ‘team spirit.’ Either way, it has always been considered as somewhat of a mystery that only appears in the presence of a great leader, or a special calling. But not anymore…Teamability® Measures and Magnifies Teaming, With Many Benefits“Teamability is an invaluable resource. The reports are especially helpful as we work to understand individual team members, and teams as a whole. We use Teamability to focus natural talents and Roles to achieve operational goals.”          Jonathan Barnes, CEO, Staffing As A MissionThe founders of The Gabriel Institute devoted a quarter-century of research and tech development to understand and map the underlying dynamics of teaming. The result is Teamability, a completely new way to identify, develop, and guide people who seek to make meaningful team contributions.Launched in 2012, Teamability is a fully functional ‘operating system’ of teaming. It is producing extraordinary results in organizations of all sizes and kinds:
30% new-hire turnover on new hires in a $350M company – completely eliminated
severe collaboration issues resolved in a fast-growth health sciences company
a derailed ‘lean manufacturing’ program put back on track, with huge success
a woman with unrecognized potential, languishing as a low-level manager in a global HBA products company, promoted directly to Sales VP…and 5 years later, to COO
Now, consider what results like this would mean for church communities of all denominations. That’s what TeamSpirit – powered by Teamability – was meant to do!TeamSpirit: Coming to You, and to Families and Ministries, Just Like Yours.“Knowing how each person intrinsically seeks to team with others is invaluable in selecting, developing, managing and motivating people to reach new heights of team and ministry contribution.”            Darryl King, Minister of Education & Discipleship, Lake Norman Baptist ChurchTeamSpirit came into being in 2016, thanks to the inspiration and dedicated work of Pastor Darryl King, of Lake Norman Baptist Church near Charlotte, NC. Pastor King is a longtime friend of TGI’s CEO, Dr. Janice Presser. While still studying at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary, he approached Dr. Presser with the idea of documenting the connections between Teamability’s ten modes of team service, and Ten Gifts of the Spirit.The work began, the connections rapidly became clear, and TeamSpirit is now ready to go – except for one final task. The system that processes Teamability information must be overhauled so that it can produce more than one kind of reporting. This will be costly, and it will require us to meet and exceed our $110,000 crowdfunding goal.Just as Teamability is bringing fragmented business teams together to create high performance, collaborative cultures, TeamSpirit will build upon spiritual gifts to inspire new levels of focus, fellowship, and evangelism, energizing the church’s mission and bringing younger generations back into the fold. Our technical experts are on stand-by, and the minute this crowdfunding campaign hits its target, system work can begin.So please, take advantage of the Perks and Teamability offerings in this campaign. You’ll get the individual and team insights of Teamability now, AND (as soon as the new system is operational) your Teamability results can be regenerated in the form of new TeamSpirit reports.Click here to read about the Origins of Teamability!Physical Perks for Funding…Spiritual Perks for Teaming…All campaign participants will receive email updates, will have a permanent place on TGI’s ‘TeamSpirit Honor Roll,’ and may opt-in for special offers in the future.  “People like best what they do best, and they do best what they like best.”                                                             Dr. Janice Presser, CEO, The Gabriel Institute*Perks valued at $10 to $45 will be fulfilled 2-4 weeks after the conclusion of the campaign.***For all other perks, you will be contacted by email Monday-Friday between 9AM and 5PM with follow-up information. Pilots and bundles of Teamability reports can be delivered while this campaign is still underway. **$10: Thank you! + Crowd funder window clingYou’ll have our sincere thanks, plus a TGI original ‘Crowdfunding is Good for Business’ window cling!$25:  Book/eBookYour choice of a paperback or eBook copy of Dr. Janice Presser’s new book – just released!$35: MugPick and customize a Teamability or TeamSpirit mug from Zazzle.com!

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>CORING is designed for the business meetings among various clients, providing technological interaction with each other or among the employees of a company, in order to enhance their collaboration and productivity. It could be a very useful meeting tool for architects (who want - for their clients - to renovate/design the offices or working spaces of a company, as well), designers, creatives, artists, progressive presentations/evaluations, home appliances or cars industries, universities, hotels, hospitals, etc…!</p>
<p>CORING differs from any other touch-table, as it provides an innovative working space, that can be customized to meet the various needs of its users.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530865502/bsepglyisjhd65pbdg7o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Business and social meeting trends have been continuously changing throughout the recent years and new standards for set-up and interior design aim at making meetings more casual and interactive. Dynamic collaboration spaces and workstations are usually provided by touch-screen tables, which are becoming increasingly popular nowadays. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530865616/znju5ahufbnudrcth12r.jpg"" src=""""/>​</p>
<p>CORING can be characterized as one of these, but it is not just another touch-screen table. It's a technology integrated furniture system with unique characteristics, like it's rotating round table top, a detachable standing support for up to 6 people, fully customizable device connectivity (DIY) and contemporary user-oriented aesthetics.</p>
<p>CORING combines superior elements and incorporates a unique and innovative design, creating a one-of-a-kind piece of furniture necessary in every modern business environment!</p>

<p>Apart from these, there are <strong>4(four) colors</strong> available too!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>DESIGN</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>CORING can accommodate up to 6 people with space for their personal items and/or beverages. Its rotating table system allows any of its users  to customize and use as his/her own personal computer “on-the-fly”. All of these 6 people can use the touch-screen table at a standing position, as long as the other can rest in a semi-standing relaxing position. This resting area can be easily removed in order for the table to be used in a different fashion.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>TECHNOLOGY</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In terms of PC system connectivity, CORING is very versatile, as long as the UI of the touch-screen system is ""plug and play"" and nearly every OS devise can connect and function with this. (only HDMI and USB ports are necessary!)</p>
<p>This characteristic allows many different users to convert their own devises easily into a large 43"" touch-screen computer, even during the same business meeting. It is also very easy for any technician (that usually mid or large sized companies have), to customize the table experience or fix any hardware problem that may occur.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>ABOUT THE TEAM</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>CORING is inspired, designed and produced by the Greek design studio ubisapdesign, a studio established in 2009 by civil engineer(with MSc in interactive products and systems design) Athanasios Kyratzis. The main activities of the office include residential and tourist's accommodation architecture, interior and product design. The holistic approach of design methods combined with the use of new technologies and materials consist follow up the principal philoshophy of the office.​</p>
<p>CORING - a.k.a. Collaboration Ring - is the first mid-sized furniture of ubisapdesign office. The main goal of this attempt was to create an exceptional expierence of business communication, providing functional versatility, technological potential and modern aesthetics in one piece of furniture - one that would enhance communication in every aspect through it's unique characteristics.</p>
<p>The team supporting this project consists of many professionals from different disciplines, such as structural and design engineers, HID and media engineers and last - but not least - experienced craftsmen. Every member of the team that has been involved in this unique product gave his best efforts and performance with accuracy, consistency and enthusiasm, in order to transform the initial design from idea to reality, taking into account every detail. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>By making the prototype of CORING, we faced many difficulties and delays - but through this procedure we also managed to establish strong business relationships with our final suppliers. Thus, we are confident that our production line is set up! So, if nothing goes wrong beyond our responsibility, the production model will be as we expect in every aspect.   </p>
<p>Despite being a quite new and small office, we  at ubisapdesign studio can assure the construction reliability and after-sales support for the CORING - and any other familiar to this - product. The triptych of our studio - reliable functional design - warranty a lifetime relationship with great potential.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>CROWDFUNDING</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We choose crowdfunding firstly as a good way to showcase our product to the whole world and secondly to raise money we need in order to get CORING exhibited at Salone del Mobile Milano/Workplace3.0 2019!</p>
<p>CORING is an office furniture and not a consumer product for everyone, but it is aimed at everyone, who works or has family/friends that work at a company/agency/office! These are the people who have the power to configure the working environment - this is the crowd we aim at for funding! </p>
<p>So, if you want to help us - apart from choosing one of our perks - this is how you can do it: spread the word! CORING is the core of meeting - it is the CO-ring(COmmunication, COllaboration, COnversation RING of meeting space), CORING is the new word for meeting! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is this the final design of the product?</strong></p>
<p>Yes!.. in terms of the external aesthetics, colors, dimensions and ergonomic characteristics. But the internal frame and cable arrangements will be redesigned depending on the feedback from the prototype making of.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you have a website?</strong></p>
<p>You can find further information and contact options in our website <a href=""https://www.coring.gr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.coring.gr</a> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will be any other color options?</strong></p>
<p>Intentionally no! But it depends on your demand...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the warranty of CORING?</strong></p>
<p>Warranty of CORING is ten(10) years limited for the frame(part replacement), 3(three) years for the NEC monitor and 2(two) years for the DISPLAX touch system and GORILLA table-top glass. Nevertheless, 24h-reply technical support is limitless, as the CORING team commits to provide the best possible support, regardless of any warranty limitations. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is it available to be sold with a PC already installed?</strong></p>
<p>CORING is actually a ""barebone"" technology integrated office furniture, as it comes calibrated ready and the only thing you need to do is to connect (HDMI+usb) any device you prefer, almost like plug&amp;play! Nevertheless, we can pre-install any devise you want, but this will not make any major difference for you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What kind of PC can be successfully installed?</strong></p>
<p>The redesigned cable arrangements allow CORING to be connected outside of the furniture with any Desktop tower / mini / HDMI Stick PC, as well as any notebook/laptop/tablet or any other device which supports HDMI connectivity with the monitor and has an import USB for the controller of touch system. This system works with MS Windows 8.1 or 10, Linux, Android, Mac OS X or Chrome OS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will you do if you succeed your funding goal? </strong></p>
<p>If we raise more money from what we need, we will be able to exhibit in Salone del Mobile Milano/Workplace3.0 2019 and we will try to develop some extra features to our novel furniture CORING. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What will you do if you do not succeed your funding goal?</strong></p>
<p>In this case, we will try to find the rest of the necessary funds from other investments. If this does not succeed either, we will RETURN all the funds and obviously CORING will not be presented at Salone del Mobile Milano/Workplace3.0 2019.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What about any other charges?</strong></p>
<p>The prices are (Incoterms 2010) FOB. This means that you will have to pay at least for the transportation, import duties and taxes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the package dimensions of one CORING product?</strong></p>
<p>The dimensions will be 130X130X60 cm approximately and the package will be a wooden wheeled box.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>______________</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to thank all the people who selflessly helped us turn this project into reality: Nikos, Modestos, Pigi, Kostis, Sofia, Liliana, Alekos, Eleanna, Giannis, Dimitris, Aggeliki, Kalia, Viveta, ... and Wesley Krauss for his great music! Truly thank you again...</p>
</div></div>","The purpose of this campaign is to raise money in order to participate in the Wokplace3.0 exhibition of Salone del Mobile Milano 2019 showing to the whole world our novel interactive collaboration furniture CORING, a furniture we believe that leads the evolution of business meetings!

OVERVIEW
 
CORING is designed for the business meetings among various clients, providing technological interaction with each other or among the employees of a company, in order to enhance their collaboration and productivity. It could be a very useful meeting tool for architects (who want - for their clients - to renovate/design the offices or working spaces of a company, as well), designers, creatives, artists, progressive presentations/evaluations, home appliances or cars industries, universities, hotels, hospitals, etc…!
CORING differs from any other touch-table, as it provides an innovative working space, that can be customized to meet the various needs of its users.

Business and social meeting trends have been continuously changing throughout the recent years and new standards for set-up and interior design aim at making meetings more casual and interactive. Dynamic collaboration spaces and workstations are usually provided by touch-screen tables, which are becoming increasingly popular nowadays. 
​
CORING can be characterized as one of these, but it is not just another touch-screen table. It's a technology integrated furniture system with unique characteristics, like it's rotating round table top, a detachable standing support for up to 6 people, fully customizable device connectivity (DIY) and contemporary user-oriented aesthetics.
CORING combines superior elements and incorporates a unique and innovative design, creating a one-of-a-kind piece of furniture necessary in every modern business environment!
 
PRODUCT OPTIONS

CORING family consists of 1(one) rotating touch-screen tabletop and 3(three) different leg variations. So, there are 3(three) product variations of CORING!



Apart from these, there are 4(four) colors available too!
 
RAL 9006_white aluminium or INOX
RAL 5018_turquoise blue
RAL 3016_coral red
RAL 6018_yellow green
 
DESIGN
 
CORING can accommodate up to 6 people with space for their personal items and/or beverages. Its rotating table system allows any of its users  to customize and use as his/her own personal computer “on-the-fly”. All of these 6 people can use the touch-screen table at a standing position, as long as the other can rest in a semi-standing relaxing position. This resting area can be easily removed in order for the table to be used in a different fashion.



 

 
TECHNOLOGY
 
In terms of PC system connectivity, CORING is very versatile, as long as the UI of the touch-screen system is ""plug and play"" and nearly every OS devise can connect and function with this. (only HDMI and USB ports are necessary!)
This characteristic allows many different users to convert their own devises easily into a large 43"" touch-screen computer, even during the same business meeting. It is also very easy for any technician (that usually mid or large sized companies have), to customize the table experience or fix any hardware problem that may occur.

<p>Easy maintenance </p>
<p>Affordable and easy to find spare parts</p>
<p>Easy to be personalized </p>
<p>Online support</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About us</strong></p>
<p>As tech enthusiasts, we love innovating things. Bitmi stands for Break It to Make It, as Ciprian, the founder of the company, was always disassembling all kind of devices with the purpose of rebuilding and making them better when he was younger. </p>
<p>3D printing technology changed many people’s lives and this is what happened to us too. When we began working on Bitmi I we considered the most important elements that define a 3D printer - portability, building area no matter the 3D printer size, mechanics, electronics and expansion.  When we put it all together, the result was something entirely new. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why do we exist?</strong></p>
<p>Because we want to create a prolific playground for actual and new generations in order to help them be better versions of who they are.</p>
<p><strong><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493155885/jegbcaoywzsmfeeti3ck.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Product overview</strong></h2>
<p><strong>The power structure</strong></p>
<p>We thought a lot and we did multiple tests to design the final structure of Bitmi I. In order to create a great product that can also be portable, we decided to adopt the H-Bot system technology. Many of you know this system for its limitations. But we love challenges. So we found ways to transform them into advantages. We decided to assimilate this mechanism with words like Quality, Portability and Strength.</p>
<p>Bitmi I was engineered around a power structure that uses a 4mm thick high quality aluminium for the body. This is the perfect balance we have found between strength and lightness. Because of its final compactness, now you can enjoy 3D printing by taking your personal Bitmi I  at school, at your office or everywhere on your free time so you can express yourself better.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493968896/mslmvzgksblnyvwzk6vz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>QuickZ System</strong></p>
<p>We also had to rethink an entire new system for the Z axes. One that can easily be removed and  assembled  by  everyone with the minimum of effort and amount of time. Our QuickZ System is the key for a portable 3D printer and we hope you'll love it as much as we do.  Let's see how easy the process can be.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/io7yE6zElwo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Only two screws apart from it...</strong></p>
<p>The Hotend is one of the most important part in the process of 3D printing. With Bitmi I, you can achieve fast and qualitative prints with the original E3D V6 Full manufactured by E3D from United Kingdom. Immersed in our design, it's really doing its job. One of the best Hotend in the world is now also one of the most accessible component of our 3D printer. Why is this so important? It will give you a simple way to change different nozzle sizes when it's needed and enables fast access for a possible maintenance.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493977414/dneyf41ppt7zoox1bbmj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rigidity and Portability</strong></p>
<p>How did we solve the portability problem without damaging any part of the printer during transportation? From the beginning our desire was to engineer something that will fit in your backpack without affecting performance. So we created a light and simple system and the only thing you need to do is to lock it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493977642/dhyhwcsjnghrptqibhu5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>For the Z axis we have a simple system in order to secure everything for portability. This one and our design of spool holder are optional. Free files will be found to be downloaded from our website that is currently under construction.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>LCD Interface</strong></p>
<p>Bitmi I wants to communicate with you. And the best way we have found to let it do this is through an integrated LCD and SD card controller. This will help you a lot when you don't have a PC, like when you are on the go but you still want to print. It comes with an 8GB Storage Memory card included so you can have more space for your ideas. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>You're in the Spotlight</strong></p>
<p>Your ideas are everything that matters when you use our 3D printer. The objects you are printing  deserve all the attention, that's why Bitmi I is equipped with smooth back lights for a greater experience.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493974850/dafrtx5xhmx7vanyyayz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Weight</strong></p>
<p>As it is a portable 3D printer, we kept an eye on weight vs quality by choosing the right components. And the most important one is the frame. That's why we choose aluminium for the power structure and aluminium composite for the base. So Bitmi I weights under 5.5 Kg.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493975008/aw7100yxabf0mi2upnnm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>

<h2><strong>PERFORMANCE</strong></h2>
<p>All good until now an we hope you're already excited about this printer's features. BUT, when you want to make something great you know it's not only about design, lights and interaction. Performance is also a very important aspect. We challenged ourselves to create one of the greatest portable 3D printer that you can use as a desktop version without loosing any of the performance.</p>
<p>Whether it's a little project, a simple object or your next revolutionary idea, make it great. Bitmi I was built within this spirit. With amazing ideas. And we can't wait to see what you'll create with it.</p>

<p><strong>From Backpack to printing and reverse...</strong></p>
<p>Every component of Bitmi I is optimized for performance.  We know that time matters the most so let's start with this. Because it's a portable 3D printer that can also act as a desktop one, we had to think a way to pack it. This is where the QuickZ system comes in. In the video below, you'll see how you can go from backpack to a fully prepared 3D printer ready to be used. And all of this takes LESS THAN 5 MINUTES.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What about the reverse process?</strong></p>
<p>We're trying to pull this technology to the point where you can simply turn off the printer and take it outside like you do it with a laptop. The reverse process is not too different than the assembly one. If you don't have a filament inserted in the hotend and your printer is cold, again you're ready to go in LESS THAN 5 MINUTES.</p>

<p><strong>Heat up time</strong></p>
<p>It's known that the most used filaments for 3D printing in our days are PLA and ABS. Our preset values for PLA are 210/45 and for ABS 230/90.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong><i>How was Bitmi I created?</i></strong></p>
<p>We are young and active enthusiasts who love technology. We worked on different projects that involved using 3D printing on the go. So we wanted to design a portable 3D printer with the performance of a desktop one. We looked at the market but we saw only Cubes. That's why we decided to take a different approach and create our own 3D printer. A portable one with the performance of a desktop machine that can be packed in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p><strong><i>What surface for printing does Bitmi I uses?</i></strong></p>
<p>Bitmi I is equipied with an MK3 heat bed that has a BuildTak sheet over it.</p>
<p><strong><i>What materials and filaments can I use for printing?</i></strong></p>
<p>You can use only 1.75mm standard filament. Due to original E3D V6 full you can print with alot of types of filaments like PLA, ABS, PET, Ninjaflex, Nylon, HIPS, Laywood, Flex PP, ASA and so on.</p>
<p><strong><i>Can I print multiple colors?</i></strong></p>
<p>Yes, you always can print with multiple colours using the Change filament function. The only thing you need to do is to insert the filament into the bowden tube up to the sign and press resume. Bitmi I will do the rest.</p>
<p><strong><i>What firmware does Bitmi I uses?</i></strong></p>
<p>It's a modified version of Marlin firmware.</p>
<p><strong><i>What slicers can I use for preparing the STL files?</i></strong></p>
<p>We recommend that you use Cura or Slic3r. You'll find our tested default settings for the machine and also three profile prints on our web page that is currently under construction.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.bitmitechnologies.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bitmitechnologies.com</a></p>
<p>You'll also find some prepared STL files on the SD Card so you can print as soon as you take it out of the box.</p>
<p><strong><i>How can I interact with my 3D printer?</i></strong></p>
<p>You can use the USB cable or upload models on the included 8GB SD Card.</p>
<p><strong><i>What stage of production are we at?</i></strong></p>
<p>Bitmi I is a fully working prototype stage. In order to refine the product, few small things will change  on hardware and also firmware until the shipping date. Hardware modifications will focus on making Bitmi I lighter than it's presented here.</p>
<p><strong><i>Where is Bitmi technologies situated?</i></strong></p>
<p>Bitmi technologies is headquartered in Romania, Europe. Here is the place where your 3D printer will be crafted with a mix of custom and imported parts.</p>
<p><strong><i>How I'm going to receive my perk?</i></strong></p>
<p>We'll going to find the best way to deliver your perk. Shipping cost and other taxes and fees like VAT or federal taxes are not included. We'll going to do our best on packing it  so you will get your product safely at your door with no issues.</p>
<p><strong><i>I'm a journalist and have questions. Who do I contact?</i></strong></p>
<p>We're happy to hear this. It's our pleasure to offer more info about this project. You can contact us at bitmitechnologies@gmail.com.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>You are the one that can help us with this project by backing us today and making it possible to start the production of Bitmi I. You can also help us by spreading and sharing this campaign to your friends via social media.</p>
<p><strong><i>Ok ok...But what do I get from this?</i></strong></p>
<p>,,Promise less, do more"".</p>
<ul>
<li>We're making our best so you can receive what we promise. A portable 3D printer with the performance of a desktop one.</li>
<li>You'll receive our support in order to ensure technical or other types of issues.</li>
<li>You'll receive the freedom of not carrying heavy boxes with you in order to take advantage of your 3D printer.</li>
<li>If you are a maker, you can make changes so it can fit better for your needs. If not, you'll have a printer that you can count on.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're starting from the ground. That's why we're on Indiegogo. The main reason we are focusing on selling the Bitmi I as a perk is that we need a proof that our concept has value. As you saw, we need 50.000$ in order to have a good start. With this funds we'll going to do three main things along with others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build your 3D printer</li>
<li>Hire 2 new young tech enthusiasts ( one programmer and one electronics engineer)</li>
<li>Development </li>
</ul>
<p>If we're not going to reach our fixed goal, don't worry.</p>
<p>You can preorder Bitmi I directly from our website.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>,,People value your transparency''. This is what we've learned from Indiegogo. And this is what we believe in. We are not overpromising. That's why we choose to focus mainly on videos, timelaps and photos. We are new on the market and this Indiegogo campaign is our introduction. As we said before, we don't want to create something temporarily. Our vision as a company is to help people discover their best so they can create value through unicity.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494275327/sye2xilfncpytpkzxxqc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Hardware is hard...</p>
<p>Hardware startups are one of the toughest ones and there are many risks involved. But we are doing our best so you can receive what we have promised in this campaign.</p>
<p>Going from prototyping to series production is a huge difference. Our advantage is that we don't need injection molding fabrication in order to create custom parts. We use 3D printers to do this and we can always scale it up by adding new ones. The main power structure is created in Romania so we constantly can improve the quality of it. And if something goes wrong we can take action fast.  </p>
<p>On the other hand, we import parts like electronics and motors. We're working for over one year with different suppliers abroad and if something goes wrong (shipment delay, bad manufacturing or broken parts during shipment) our production can be affected. During our collaboration we didn't have such problems. And if some are affected this will not be a problem because they are also available in Romania.</p>

About us
As tech enthusiasts, we love innovating things. Bitmi stands for Break It to Make It, as Ciprian, the founder of the company, was always disassembling all kind of devices with the purpose of rebuilding and making them better when he was younger. 
3D printing technology changed many people’s lives and this is what happened to us too. When we began working on Bitmi I we considered the most important elements that define a 3D printer - portability, building area no matter the 3D printer size, mechanics, electronics and expansion.  When we put it all together, the result was something entirely new. 
 
Why do we exist?
Because we want to create a prolific playground for actual and new generations in order to help them be better versions of who they are.

 
Product overview
The power structure
We thought a lot and we did multiple tests to design the final structure of Bitmi I. In order to create a great product that can also be portable, we decided to adopt the H-Bot system technology. Many of you know this system for its limitations. But we love challenges. So we found ways to transform them into advantages. We decided to assimilate this mechanism with words like Quality, Portability and Strength.
Bitmi I was engineered around a power structure that uses a 4mm thick high quality aluminium for the body. This is the perfect balance we have found between strength and lightness. Because of its final compactness, now you can enjoy 3D printing by taking your personal Bitmi I  at school, at your office or everywhere on your free time so you can express yourself better.

 
QuickZ System
We also had to rethink an entire new system for the Z axes. One that can easily be removed and  assembled  by  everyone with the minimum of effort and amount of time. Our QuickZ System is the key for a portable 3D printer and we hope you'll love it as much as we do.  Let's see how easy the process can be.

 
Only two screws apart from it...
The Hotend is one of the most important part in the process of 3D printing. With Bitmi I, you can achieve fast and qualitative prints with the original E3D V6 Full manufactured by E3D from United Kingdom. Immersed in our design, it's really doing its job. One of the best Hotend in the world is now also one of the most accessible component of our 3D printer. Why is this so important? It will give you a simple way to change different nozzle sizes when it's needed and enables fast access for a possible maintenance.

 
Rigidity and Portability
How did we solve the portability problem without damaging any part of the printer during transportation? From the beginning our desire was to engineer something that will fit in your backpack without affecting performance. So we created a light and simple system and the only thing you need to do is to lock it.


For the Z axis we have a simple system in order to secure everything for portability. This one and our design of spool holder are optional. Free files will be found to be downloaded from our website that is currently under construction.
http://www.bitmitechnologies.com

 
LCD Interface
Bitmi I wants to communicate with you. And the best way we have found to let it do this is through an integrated LCD and SD card controller. This will help you a lot when you don't have a PC, like when you are on the go but you still want to print. It comes with an 8GB Storage Memory card included so you can have more space for your ideas. 

 
You're in the Spotlight
Your ideas are everything that matters when you use our 3D printer. The objects you are printing  deserve all the attention, that's why Bitmi I is equipped with smooth back lights for a greater experience.

 
Weight
As it is a portable 3D printer, we kept an eye on weight vs quality by choosing the right components. And the most important one is the frame. That's why we choose aluminium for the power structure and aluminium composite for the base. So Bitmi I weights under 5.5 Kg.

 
Silence...
Bitmi I respects your intimacy. From the beginning we knew that for creating a friendly 3D printer we have to focus on signal rather than noise. Our extruder system is equipped with 2 fans. One is for cooling down the hotend assembly and the other one is taking care that your object looks nice. Our experiments show that our printer voice respects the sound level of an average normal conversation. And this without any shock absorbers or, special anti-vibration feet. You can place it straight on your desk. 


 

PERFORMANCE
All good until now an we hope you're already excited about this printer's features. BUT, when you want to make something great you know it's not only about design, lights and interaction. Performance is also a very important aspect. We challenged ourselves to create one of the greatest portable 3D printer that you can use as a desktop version without loosing any of the performance.
Whether it's a little project, a simple object or your next revolutionary idea, make it great. Bitmi I was built within this spirit. With amazing ideas. And we can't wait to see what you'll create with it.

 
From Backpack to printing and reverse...
Every component of Bitmi I is optimized for performance.  We know that time matters the most so let's start with this. Because it's a portable 3D printer that can also act as a desktop one, we had to think a way to pack it. This is where the QuickZ system comes in. In the video below, you'll see how you can go from backpack to a fully prepared 3D printer ready to be used. And all of this takes LESS THAN 5 MINUTES.

 
What about the reverse process?
We're trying to pull this technology to the point where you can simply turn off the printer and take it outside like you do it with a laptop. The reverse process is not too different than the assembly one. If you don't have a filament inserted in the hotend and your printer is cold, again you're ready to go in LESS THAN 5 MINUTES.

 
Heat up time
It's known that the most used filaments for 3D printing in our days are PLA and ABS. Our preset values for PLA are 210/45 and for ABS 230/90.

ABS heat up time

 
Cooldown time
Because Bitmi I is a portable 3D printer, we thought of a convenient temperature so you can safely place it in your backpack. And this value is 50 degrees Celsius. If you are under, you can safely start packing it.

Hire 2 new young tech enthusiasts ( one programmer and one electronics engineer)
Development 

If we're not going to reach our fixed goal, don't worry.
You can preorder Bitmi I directly from our website.

The Impact

,,People value your transparency''. This is what we've learned from Indiegogo. And this is what we believe in. We are not overpromising. That's why we choose to focus mainly on videos, timelaps and photos. We are new on the market and this Indiegogo campaign is our introduction. As we said before, we don't want to create something temporarily. Our vision as a company is to help people discover their best so they can create value through unicity.

 
Risks & Challenges

Hardware is hard...
Hardware startups are one of the toughest ones and there are many risks involved. But we are doing our best so you can receive what we have promised in this campaign.
Going from prototyping to series production is a huge difference. Our advantage is that we don't need injection molding fabrication in order to create custom parts. We use 3D printers to do this and we can always scale it up by adding new ones. The main power structure is created in Romania so we constantly can improve the quality of it. And if something goes wrong we can take action fast.  
On the other hand, we import parts like electronics and motors. We're working for over one year with different suppliers abroad and if something goes wrong (shipment delay, bad manufacturing or broken parts during shipment) our production can be affected. During our collaboration we didn't have such problems. And if some are affected this will not be a problem because they are also available in Romania.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Welcome To The Stroller/Swing Evolution </strong></u></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Dr. Henry Bell, a Chiropractic Physician for the past 23 years.  My prior work endeavors consisted of teaching, pharmaceutical sales and management. My entire life, I always sought out ways to help other people, always striving to improve peoples lives. So therefore, continuing in that direction, I brought a team together that would help bring to you... to the world... the Roc-A-Vee. The first patented stroller/swing combination that utilizes smart technology. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:600px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526951572/dmfbaixo0efdtlzmwakp.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>Our campaign is designed to make comforting and soothing a new born child up to a 45 pound toddler easier by bringing the stroller and the swing industry into the 21st century. Our goal is to re-invent the industry so that no mother, father, care giver or grandparent has to experience any sort of discomfort in lifting or carrying their precious loved one. It will also no longer be necessary to place your infant carrier on the floor, the ground, bench or in a chair which addresses sanitary issues typically found in most public facilities.</p>
<p>This is ""Big"" because on April 19, 2016 I was awarded the first United States Utility Patent for a ""Baby Carrier Swing  Conversion Support Device"" that operates with Smart Technology and is also equipped with Blue Tooth and Camera capability.</p>
<p>Now, most people build a prototype first and then say they are patent pending.  I conceived the Roc-A-Vee in my mind and saw it working there first.  Here is where you have major input on this evolutionary product.  We need you to join the movement and become part of our community by bringing the Roc-A-Vee to life and to the world. Understand, the Roc-A-Vee is not just another stroller or swing, it is a totally new concept that has the ability to create a totally new category in the baby industry.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<u>What do we Need</u> </h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526953366/tiroknelxdqdkqdxqxm6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We need you to become a part of the Roc-A-Vee movement.  We need to raise $200,000.00 to build a working prototype that will include all the necessary applications to allow the Roc-A-Vee to swing, monitor your child, stream video with two way Audio Playback (Ability to play audio files)  Monitor and Motor control for swinging using Android and Apple App Development with WiFi and or Bluetooth communication of your favorite tunes to your child.  We have partnered with a Global Manufacturing Company which has the ability to produce products in the United States and in China providing the skill sets that allow them to be certified in micro and high precision manufacturing which includes aerospace. We have also partnered with an Engineering and Development Company in Maryland who was also certified in aerospace capabilities. They are the company that produced this 3D CAD design. All you need is a swipe of a finger to control the multiple functions of the Roc-A-Vee.  All of this will be produced within the standards of ASMT International who's strict standards for infant swings and baby carriages and strollers must be adhered to.</p>
<p>After development, the unit will be independently tested again to ensure maximum child safety and performance. Feasibility studies have been performed showing that the Roc-A-Vee can be mass produced once final testing is completed. This will confirm proof of concept. Upon completion of the prototype, the Roc-A-Vee will be presented as a finished product to larger established companies in the stroller and swing industry. This will be performed to see if interests exist in partnering with our company. During that same period of time, our manufacturer, will go into limited production of the Roc-A-Vee. Once produced; direct to the consumer internet sales along with retail distribution will be established. This strategy is designed to introduce our patented technology to the industry as an entry level player with hopes of aggressively grabbing more market share. </p>
<p>  </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">
<u>Contingency Plan</u> </h2>
<p>Contingency plans for proceeding forward should our team not reach our initial financial goal; will consist of reducing the number of initial units produced and focusing on greater internet presence and sales. This will be accomplished with the assistance our Global Marketing partner who already has extensive contacts around the world. This should help substantially lower overhead based upon reducing the profit entity that an outside manufacturer would insist upon leveraging on this venture. The passion behind bringing the Roc-A-Vee to life is so intense it has consumed most waking hours since being awarded the Utility Patent. This Patent now protects how the unit works thus protecting its design for the next 15 years. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Impact</u></h2>
<p><strong>Your</strong> impact, by funding this campaign, will fundamentally transform the baby stroller and swing industry bringing it into the 21st century with the use of smart technology. The Roc-A-Vee will stroll, swing, capture images, musically sooth a fussy child while simplifying how parents and care givers interact with their children. </p>
<p>We know the project is valuable to us and to you including those around the world because it changes the industry as we currently know it. You are no longer bound to a specific manufacturer's accessories.  You maintain control as it should be, defining the preferences that best suits your child's needs.  This gives you the ability to decrease the overall cost while multiplying the ""must have"" features no other stroller or swing manufacturer currently has; that is providing multi functionality, reduced weight, compact design, and portability. The Roc-A-Vee is and will be a universal fit to most households.</p>
<p>Team ""Roc-A-Vee"" already has ideas for next generation units that will allow the Roc-A-Vee to excel in market share for generations to come. This due to its projected appeal in various settings such as malls, restaurants, day care centers, sporting events and or any other outdoor or indoor activity where a light weight, portable stroller/swing device is desired.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h2>
<p>Any time a new product is brought to market there are always inherent risks. No one can truly predict the future, however if you follow the trends, you can agree that a product that is multi purposed and reduces it's foot print should have the ability to establish itself within the market. It will be necessary to stay ahead of the curve and anticipate the next change in the industry.</p>

<p>Needless to say, one trend will never change, the need to transport newborns and children safely.  The innate desire and need for nurturing children has always been accomplished by rocking as noted in famous nursery rhymes and children's fairy tales. This then becomes the working model for not just doing it safely but comfortably and enjoyably for the child and all others involved.

It is also the box, the connectors, and the printed circuit board (PCB) with many useful features. To summarize these:</p><p><br/><span style=""color:#d06;"">■ </span><strong>The box</strong> is IP67 grade, which means, that is has complete protection against contact with solid particles (dust-tight), and ingress of water in harmful quantity is not possible when enclosure is immersed in water up to 1m.</p><p><br/><span style=""color:#d06;"">■ </span>A <strong>full connector set</strong> contains 4 pieces of 12-pole connectors, 50 pieces of contacts, 50 pieces of sealing plugs, a standard 5.5/2.1 mm power supply connector, cable for providing supply voltage.</p><p><br/><span style=""color:#d06;"">■ </span><strong>The PCB</strong> has 4 layers and appropriate ground planes, which facilitate excellent EMC behaviour. We have also paid close attention to ESD protection while designing the product, therefore components dedicated for this purpose can be found at all the right places.</p><p><br/><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> One of its main comfort functions is that the RB generates the <strong>5V supply voltage</strong> for the RPI, and <strong>3.3V</strong> for other electronics which makes the integration of the components very easy.</p><p><br/><span style=""color:#d06;"">■ </span>The standard 40-pin Raspberry connector is <strong>compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Raspberry Pi 2</strong> devices. (Their main features are the easy-to-use operating systems, handling of an SD-card and any computer-peripherals.)</p><p><br/><span style=""color:#d06;"">■</span> One major advantage of the <strong>RB</strong> is that it can be <strong>modularly expanded</strong> with the help of the extension boards as the used sensor inputs and output actuators require.

The main profiles of the company are electrical engineering design and consulting. We have been involved in dozens of development projects in the past years.

It is also the box, the connectors, and the printed circuit board (PCB) with many useful features. To summarize these:■ The box is IP67 grade, which means, that is has complete protection against contact with solid particles (dust-tight), and ingress of water in harmful quantity is not possible when enclosure is immersed in water up to 1m.■ A full connector set contains 4 pieces of 12-pole connectors, 50 pieces of contacts, 50 pieces of sealing plugs, a standard 5.5/2.1 mm power supply connector, cable for providing supply voltage.■ The PCB has 4 layers and appropriate ground planes, which facilitate excellent EMC behaviour. We have also paid close attention to ESD protection while designing the product, therefore components dedicated for this purpose can be found at all the right places.■ One of its main comfort functions is that the RB generates the 5V supply voltage for the RPI, and 3.3V for other electronics which makes the integration of the components very easy.■ The standard 40-pin Raspberry connector is compatible with the Raspberry Pi 3 and the Raspberry Pi 2 devices. (Their main features are the easy-to-use operating systems, handling of an SD-card and any computer-peripherals.)■ One major advantage of the RB is that it can be modularly expanded with the help of the extension boards as the used sensor inputs and output actuators require. By using either the existing extension boards or developing your own, you will be able to create a unique product in a faster and cheaper way. This is ideal for hobby-users and Sw-developer companies.■ A built-in U-Blox GPS module enables the RB to be used in positioning and in anti-theft applications.■ Six current-limited (protected) outputs are controlled by an I2C (TWI) interface port expander IC, and their hardware switches off automatically if the load exceeds 2.2 Amps. This protects the hardware in any unwanted situation.■ A built-in I2C light sensor detects box-opening or sabotage, which can be logged or used to generate an alarm signal. Ratherboard’s block diagramJust assemble your well-known Raspberry or a brand-new RB Embedded module with a Ratherboard, connect a 12V (7-17V) power supply, and you will be capable to achieve everything your processor enables.Ratherboard's Top side:Ratherboard's Bottom side:Extension boardsE1EXTENSION BOARD 1The E1 extension board is an interconnection card, which contains built-in series input resistors, and ESD diodes.

<h3>Pinnacle Deal Engine for Buying/Selling Businesses</h3>
<p>Build your business through good acquisitions, or sell your business for what it is really worth. Our Deal Engine is the toolkit you need.</p>
<p><strong>The Prototype</strong></p>
<p>At first, with a wave of company owners approaching retirement age, we thought we'd buy some businesses. We wanted deals fair to both sides so we could grow those businesses. Sometimes we stumbled upon owners who weren't ready to sell yet, but needed advisory services to start positioning for their exit.</p>
<p>We built a proprietary toolkit for this. Gurus and brokers often use just one or two methods to decide how much a business is worth, and that won't always fit. <i>Our Deal Engine crunches the numbers through 8 valuation methods and makes it obvious where the genuine value is.</i></p>
<p><i>We also analyze different deal structures, check for affordability, calculate growth projections, and consider how extra cash could be generated quickly.</i></p>
<p><strong>Why Are We Making It Available to the Market?</strong></p>
<p>Then the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>We shouldn't keep this to ourselves. We should make Pinnacle Deal Engine available for people the pandemic has pushed toward an earlier exit than planned, and for people who have the ability and desire to keep businesses going after the founders step out.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Want &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To open up our Deal Engine to you, it needs to become software hosted online, accessed through a web browser, with login security so each account can only see information about the businesses it is analyzing. We've written the detailed software specification, put out Requests for Proposals, and received bids.</p>
<p>Up to now we have funded everything ourselves. We are only asking you to help us fund software coding for Version 1.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because we can see what you're likely to need next and we don't want you to have to wait any longer than necessary. We've worked with funding sources to prototype the ability to generate projections that funding sources like to see when you ask them to fund a deal. If you help us with coding of Version 1 now, while Version 1 is being built we'll pour our resources into specifications to add that feature ASAP.</p>
<p>What will you get in return for helping us accelerate development this way?</p>
<ul>
<li>You'll get our deepest discounting.</li>
<li>You will remain entitled to that pricing as long as you want to continue with our Deal Engine, until you cancel or let your subscription expire.</li>
<li>If you choose a professional subscription, when we roll out Version 2, at no extra charge you will get access to the new feature that helps you approach funding sources to fund deals.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't achieve our fundraising goal here, the funder-satisfying projections will simply take longer to specify, design, develop and release.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Example of Deal Engine Impact</h3>
<p><i>The impact of our Deal Engine goes beyond the sale price of a business. It can provide key insights that enable a deal to go ahead.</i></p>
<p>As an example, one of us was selling a business in the USA.  A prospective buyer had been found and negotiations were close to final.</p>
<p>As a sanity check, we hired an expert with a good reputation and local market knowledge to value the business. He charged $2500. He ran just two valuation methods. His two figures understated the value of the company, overlooking significant elements of value. Our Deal Engine produced far more accurate valuation, close to what the buyer was really considering (which means our valuation, not the consultant's, was what the market thought of the company).</p>
<p><i>Going with the expert's figures would have left a third to half of the company's value unrealized.</i></p>
<p>On top of that, Pinnacle Deal Engine's analysis revealed that the deal structure the buyer proposed would collapse after about two years.</p>
<ul>
<li>For us, this meant if we seller-financed any of the deal, we wouldn't be fully paid.</li>
<li>For her, with plans to integrate our business into her holdings, that collapse would endanger everything she owned.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using our what-if tools, we were able to suggest safer ways to structure the deal so all of us would thrive.</p>
<div><h3>How You Can Use the Deal Engine</h3></div>
<p>If you are building up your business holdings by acquiring companies, Pinnacle Deal Engine provides the tools you need to assess and act upon opportunities better, faster and with less personal effort. It shows which opportunities are worth pursuing, shows you what they are worth and helps you devise the right deal structure to offer.</p>
<p>If you are examining multiple opportunities, you can fill in summary values from the financials to get quick valuations and only bother to fill in more detailed data for the opportunities that are in the valuation range you are targeting. This boosts your productivity and effectiveness.</p>
<p>If you are a business owner preparing to exit, Pinnacle Deal Engine shows how potential buyers will value your business. It lets you evaluate offers you receive so you know whether the deal will be sustainable (and able to pay you any deferred portions of the purchase price) or unsustainable (and likely to leave you not completely paid or even having to take over the business again in a damaged condition). At any level of service above the lowest, it shows where cash can be generated quickly, either to boost the business for you right now or for a buyer later. Subscriptions include growth generation projections, and lower levels of service can get that as an add-on.</p>
<p>What is this worth? More than just money. We can't guarantee deals will be successful, but our Deal Engine tilts the odds toward success while reducing the effort needed to make deals turn out as well as possible.</p>
<p><strong>What Skills Do You Need to Use This?</strong></p>
<p>You don't need to be an accountant or financial services professional to use our Deal Engine. You only need an understanding of how to use standard financial reports such as Profit &amp; Loss and Balance Sheet in order to fill in the data that drives Deal Engine. As a business person, you know that information.</p>

</div></div>","Pinnacle Deal Engine for Buying/Selling Businesses
Build your business through good acquisitions, or sell your business for what it is really worth. Our Deal Engine is the toolkit you need.
The Prototype
At first, with a wave of company owners approaching retirement age, we thought we'd buy some businesses. We wanted deals fair to both sides so we could grow those businesses. Sometimes we stumbled upon owners who weren't ready to sell yet, but needed advisory services to start positioning for their exit.
We built a proprietary toolkit for this. Gurus and brokers often use just one or two methods to decide how much a business is worth, and that won't always fit. Our Deal Engine crunches the numbers through 8 valuation methods and makes it obvious where the genuine value is.
We also analyze different deal structures, check for affordability, calculate growth projections, and consider how extra cash could be generated quickly.
Why Are We Making It Available to the Market?
Then the pandemic hit.
We shouldn't keep this to ourselves. We should make Pinnacle Deal Engine available for people the pandemic has pushed toward an earlier exit than planned, and for people who have the ability and desire to keep businesses going after the founders step out.

What We Want & What You Get
To open up our Deal Engine to you, it needs to become software hosted online, accessed through a web browser, with login security so each account can only see information about the businesses it is analyzing. We've written the detailed software specification, put out Requests for Proposals, and received bids.
Up to now we have funded everything ourselves. We are only asking you to help us fund software coding for Version 1.
Why?
Because we can see what you're likely to need next and we don't want you to have to wait any longer than necessary. We've worked with funding sources to prototype the ability to generate projections that funding sources like to see when you ask them to fund a deal. If you help us with coding of Version 1 now, while Version 1 is being built we'll pour our resources into specifications to add that feature ASAP.
What will you get in return for helping us accelerate development this way?

You'll get our deepest discounting.
You will remain entitled to that pricing as long as you want to continue with our Deal Engine, until you cancel or let your subscription expire.
If you choose a professional subscription, when we roll out Version 2, at no extra charge you will get access to the new feature that helps you approach funding sources to fund deals.

If we don't achieve our fundraising goal here, the funder-satisfying projections will simply take longer to specify, design, develop and release.

Example of Deal Engine Impact
The impact of our Deal Engine goes beyond the sale price of a business. It can provide key insights that enable a deal to go ahead.
As an example, one of us was selling a business in the USA.  A prospective buyer had been found and negotiations were close to final.
As a sanity check, we hired an expert with a good reputation and local market knowledge to value the business. He charged $2500. He ran just two valuation methods. His two figures understated the value of the company, overlooking significant elements of value. Our Deal Engine produced far more accurate valuation, close to what the buyer was really considering (which means our valuation, not the consultant's, was what the market thought of the company).
Going with the expert's figures would have left a third to half of the company's value unrealized.
On top of that, Pinnacle Deal Engine's analysis revealed that the deal structure the buyer proposed would collapse after about two years.

For us, this meant if we seller-financed any of the deal, we wouldn't be fully paid.
For her, with plans to integrate our business into her holdings, that collapse would endanger everything she owned.

Using our what-if tools, we were able to suggest safer ways to structure the deal so all of us would thrive.
How You Can Use the Deal Engine
If you are building up your business holdings by acquiring companies, Pinnacle Deal Engine provides the tools you need to assess and act upon opportunities better, faster and with less personal effort. It shows which opportunities are worth pursuing, shows you what they are worth and helps you devise the right deal structure to offer.
If you are examining multiple opportunities, you can fill in summary values from the financials to get quick valuations and only bother to fill in more detailed data for the opportunities that are in the valuation range you are targeting. This boosts your productivity and effectiveness.
If you are a business owner preparing to exit, Pinnacle Deal Engine shows how potential buyers will value your business. It lets you evaluate offers you receive so you know whether the deal will be sustainable (and able to pay you any deferred portions of the purchase price) or unsustainable (and likely to leave you not completely paid or even having to take over the business again in a damaged condition). At any level of service above the lowest, it shows where cash can be generated quickly, either to boost the business for you right now or for a buyer later. Subscriptions include growth generation projections, and lower levels of service can get that as an add-on.
What is this worth? More than just money. We can't guarantee deals will be successful, but our Deal Engine tilts the odds toward success while reducing the effort needed to make deals turn out as well as possible.
What Skills Do You Need to Use This?
You don't need to be an accountant or financial services professional to use our Deal Engine. You only need an understanding of how to use standard financial reports such as Profit & Loss and Balance Sheet in order to fill in the data that drives Deal Engine. As a business person, you know that information.

Risks & Challenges
We have chosen our development vendor. We have worked alongside them on a mission critical project for another company, so we know how they operate. They meet our quality standards, which are based on our deep IT experience (including NASA and complex mission critical systems). We have no concern about the caliber of the software.
The main risk in our implementation is possible schedule slippage. The implementation company has adapted for the pandemic, which reduces the chance of slippage, and their delivery record is strong.
Timelines
We anticipate making valuation capabilities available about 4 months into implementation and the complete feature set within two months after that. We will do all we can to move those dates forward.
If you choose a funding level that entitles you to a one year professional subscription, the clock on your subscription will start when we release the full feature set.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><a href=""https://tecbasics.com/nixpod"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nixpod</a> is a product from <a href=""https://tecbasics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tecbasics Inc</a>., a tech startup based in Toronto, Canada, founded by <a href=""https://tecbasics.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sonny Bombhore</a>. Nixpod is the first unit of the series that we call Linux Unit of Computing. Our goal is to build Linux powered Nixpod devices in various form factors and for specific applications. We embarked on this project in response to growing needs of smaller, but powerful computing devices for fast growing needs of Internet of Things (IoT.) </p>
<p>Nixpod, in it's maiden release is a versatile and a portable Linux PC that can be used not just as a  productivity workstation, but also to serve other functionalities such as home networking, gaming, media and file sharing. Nixpod also serves as a Linux Server for developers to build and test their application locally. The device delivers a rich 4K display for viewing or building rich media applications. We built Nixpod in such a way that there simply isn't another ready and ""out of the box"" Linux PC that will readily plug-in and be operational upon startup!</p>
<h3>What's under the hood?</h3>
<p><a href=""https://tecbasics.com/nixpod/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nixpod</a> is built with a powerful Single Board Computer (SBC) hardware with ARM Cortex A53 high efficiency 64 bit processor, 2GB RAM with 4K UHD video support along with an expansion board to accommodate an mSATA SSD drive for space and speed. Nixpod can be configured with your choice of supported Linux Operating System.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where are we with this project? </h3>
<p>We have <strong>successfully prototyped a fully functional device</strong> (see image gallery below) and tested with the hardware, software and other networking parameters. We are currently using it as a in-house development server for our application development and a secondary linux desktop using Debian 9 distribution of Linux. The device does everything that is supposed to do flawlessly.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding in the amount of USD 105,000 to build the initial set of production devices and launch it commercially. This estimate includes production, initial launching and marketing costs. We are offering you a fully functional commercially packed device upon launch at various levels of rewards depending upon your pledge. </p>
<h3>The Impact and Value</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The Internet of Things is growing fast fueling the growth of Digital Smart Homes, and there is a greater demand for smaller and powerful devices to design and build applications as well as manage networking and other devices.  Our aim is to build a series of Nixpod devices that will power these IoT gadgets and manage them on the network. Your contribution helps us produce this device, followed by other devices and make them available for the users in a very cost effective way.  </p>
<h3>What's in the box?</h3>
<p>All models are shipped with full list of accessories that includes cables, connectors and an expanded USB hub with SD card connectors just so you don’t have to run to the nearest store looking for a missing cable or connector! Our aim is to deliver a powerful and versatile linux computing device with everything that you will need to get started with your next Home Networking or Development project.</p>
<h3>Rollout Plan</h3>
<p>Nixpods are built and tested right here in Toronto. Once we receive the funding we will immediately go ahead and get started with the case manufacturing and importing the materials for final assembly. We will also order the packaging for the product rollout. We plan to host a launch event in June 2018 and invite various groups of people including home users, college students specializing in IT and Computers, DIY enthusiasts and some businesses. Shortly after the launch we will start to ship the final product to all those that subscribed and paid for this product on Kickstarter. </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risks and challenges associated with this project are no more than those with any startup project. Specifically, our major challenge is the quality and pricing of the components that we use. Fortunately, for us, we found suppliers from China, whose products have been very well received and reviewed in the United States and Canada. As regards the main hardware board we use the well known Raspberry Pi board that has been well received and tested. The other challenge is the protection of the case design from being stolen and duplicated. To mitigate this risk we decided to keep the case manufacturing locally within Canada under a legally binding NDA. We will also be completing a Trade Mark application with Canada and the United States to protect the design of the case and the device in the next few months.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We realize that not everyone is able to pledge support financially at reward levels. You can contribute as little as $1, and it will make a difference. And, if you are unable to make any financial contribution that's OK too. We would very much appreciate it if you will spread the word or tell your friends and family about this campaign by using the Indigogo share tools.</p>

<h3>Any farmer or manufacturer can sell on Megafresh!</h3>
<p>Megafresh provides another avenue for farmers and manufacturers to sell their products all over the country with no restrictions. To sell post your product just like you would post on instagram or twitter and send your product to our fulfillment centers and we do the rest. Your post is immediately live. A status symbol on the post tells shoppers if the product has arrived at our warehouse and is available for delivery. If the product has not yet arrived at our fulfillment center buyers can ""pre-order"" the product and wait till it arrives, however to protect the buyer no money is sent to the seller until the product is received at the warehouse. If the product is not received at our warehouse by the date indicated by the seller on the listing the sale is automatically cancelled and money refunded to the buyer.</p>

<p>Farmers and manufacturers can now sell direct to consumers with ease and without the need to handle fulfillment. We do that for you!</p>
<p>Each fulfillment center will service a given area. For example the Los Angeles fulfillment center will service the southern half of California from Bakersfield to San Diego and the San Francisco center will service the northern half of California from Fresno to the northern border. If a seller wants to sell only to southern California they will send their product only to the Los Angeles fulfillment center. If they want to sell to the whole state they must send their products to both warehouses. Fulfillment centers will be rolled out to all major cities across the country.</p>

<p>About 40% of the food grown is wasted, this is due to large retailers not being willing to purchase the produce for a variety of reasons including specifications not being met. This does NOT mean that the produce is bad, it simply means that the orange may not be orange enough or the grape is a bit too small and the banana not curved at the right angle etc. In these cases farmers simply leave the produce on the tree to rot because it costs money to harvest it. And there is no point is paying harvesters if they don't have anywhere else to sell it. On the other hand produce is often left to rot because retailers offer to pay them less than it cost to grow and harvest. And if they did harvest it for the retailers they would be losing money.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short history of Grid Beam</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Early version of this construction system was developed by Ken Isaac in the late 1940s. He used 2x2 lumber and three dimentional joints to create living structures. He called this construction system - Matrix and later publish a book <a href=""http://letsremake.info/PDFs/k_isaacs.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">How to Build Your Own Living Structures</a>. After this book a group of artists, designers and builders continued to work on developing this construction system. They upgraded and standardized it, made it fully modular. Three of them later summarized their work in a book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005V5TFFA/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">How to Build with Grid Beam: A Fast, Easy and Affordable System for Constructing Almost Anything</a>.

</div></div>","Short history of Grid Beam
Early version of this construction system was developed by Ken Isaac in the late 1940s. He used 2x2 lumber and three dimentional joints to create living structures. He called this construction system - Matrix and later publish a book How to Build Your Own Living Structures. After this book a group of artists, designers and builders continued to work on developing this construction system. They upgraded and standardized it, made it fully modular. Three of them later summarized their work in a book How to Build with Grid Beam: A Fast, Easy and Affordable System for Constructing Almost Anything. And I`ve learned about Grid Beam from Kevin Kelly Cool Tools blog (which is also awesome, you should check it out).
 
Gallery of examples

 
BeamCNC features
(this is a prototype. backers will receive v1.0 with more features listed below)
  

works with lumber or aluminum square tube
X form factor compensates material size variations and small curvature that off the shelf lumber often has
suitable for beams from 20mm up to 50mm (from 3/4 to 2 inches) of any length
drilling pattern set by gcode file (you can generate your own patterns)
portable (manufacture construstion system onsite)
almost dustless operation (home friendly)

 
Things I will upgrade in v1.0 before shipping it to backers:

wire management
sturdier frame
whole length (drilling near the ends of the lumber)
better dust collecton (it is almost dustless with current dust collection design, but I want to make usability a bit easier)
smaller footprint
optimized working speed
perpendicular hole alignment
beam leveling

Timeline

Web service
You will be able to mockup designs from grid beam. Share your designs and explore what other people have designed. Get best spliting setup for a project to minimize leftovers. Generate custom gcode files. Find or become a local manufacturer. Every backer who has bought an original BeamCNC will automatically get an autorisation code for becoming a local manufacturer. It`s up to you to decide whether to use BeamCNC for yourself or introduce yourself as a local manufacturer.


While web is under development I`m starting a Facebook page for people to share thier ideas. And you can download a template file for mockups in Fusion 360 (copy-paste beams of needed length for your design. By default they are hidden, so you can`t see them on preview)
 
Ideas
3d printed tile with foam.

Quick camera mount on any grid beam surface. Or even whole camera arm.

Linear actuators and CNC are one of the interesting cases. You can set hole sizes to fit linear rails and with a couple of brackets make low-precision CNC setups. Also, if you glue up grid beams at bottom and cover holes on one side you can get a nice vacuum table.

Workbench, clamping table, sanding/vacuum table (as described in previous example).

BeamCNC Plasma (with plasma torch and horizontal axis instead of router). On the photo below is LifeTrac project by OpenSourceEcology and rough sketch of the design. If you are particularly interested in this version, please fill up this form. Coming soon.

Fastbeam variation. You can drill one side with a smaller drill bit and then thread it. I guess it will be one of the fastest construction systems that way. Video about how strong are threads in wood. And DIY wooden thread taps from Matthias Wandel.

You can use BeamCNC with forstner bit or use a template for forstner bit afterwards.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><font>Help us to do our best for your best!!</font></strong></p>
<h3>Amount(s) We Need To Make Things Happen And Done</h3>
<p>All that depends on the amount raised during and after the campaign. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Actually we could keep on making even with <strong>$5,700</strong></span> <br/><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">This would let us to launch the SelfieElate app with its basic elements and functions. (But just as so called Cross-platform Mobile App)</span>. </p>
<p>While with <strong>$57,000</strong> USD we would be able to do that on another level - with so called Native Mobile App. (For both operating systems: Android and Apple iOS). </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where The Funds Go (After Succeeding With This Campaign)</h3>
<p>We prefer to add more value and to do so faster.</p>
<p>With <strong>5,700</strong> USD (or more) we <strong>will finalise &amp; launch it as a cross-platform mobile app</strong>.</p>
<p>With <strong>15,700</strong> USD (or more) we <strong>will also undergo its testing [Alpha and Beta testing] and will improve its stability</strong>.</p>
<p>With <strong>25,700</strong> USD (or more) we <strong>will also implement the next extra features and will get going with the SelfieElate community growth</strong>.</p>
<p>With <strong>35,700</strong> USD (or more) we <strong>will also move on with UI [User Interface] and UX [User Experience]</strong>.</p>
<p>With <strong>45,700</strong> USD (or more) we <strong>will also go with generating the SelfieElate user base growth</strong>.</p>
<p>With <strong>57,000</strong> USD (or more) we <strong>will accomplish all that but already having it as a native mobile app [exclusively for Android and iOS]</strong>. </p>

#SELFIE
In 2013 ""Selfie"" was selected by Oxford Dictionaries as the Word of the Year.
In 2017 a study by Now Sourcing and Frames Direct revealed the average millennial is expected to take more than 25,000 selfies in their lifetime.
""But First, Let Me Take A Selfie!""
No surprise that we see selfies almost all around and as the best way to show or to be seen.
So to say that selfies changed the way we see, capture, and share our living moments is to say the true. Actually most are even living for those moments.
Elate With Your Selfie
We know - behind 1 successful selfie there may be 99 failed and deleted ones. That is why we are here to care about your every selfie. That is why ""Elate With Your Selfie"" is the SelfieElate slogan.
SelfieElate = Selfie Spreading Space

(At least here - at SelfieElate.)
Help us to do our best for your best!!
Amount(s) We Need To Make Things Happen And Done
All that depends on the amount raised during and after the campaign. 
Actually we could keep on making even with $5,700 This would let us to launch the SelfieElate app with its basic elements and functions. (But just as so called Cross-platform Mobile App). 
While with $57,000 USD we would be able to do that on another level - with so called Native Mobile App. (For both operating systems: Android and Apple iOS). 
 
Where The Funds Go (After Succeeding With This Campaign)
We prefer to add more value and to do so faster.
With 5,700 USD (or more) we will finalise & launch it as a cross-platform mobile app.
With 15,700 USD (or more) we will also undergo its testing [Alpha and Beta testing] and will improve its stability.
With 25,700 USD (or more) we will also implement the next extra features and will get going with the SelfieElate community growth.
With 35,700 USD (or more) we will also move on with UI [User Interface] and UX [User Experience].
With 45,700 USD (or more) we will also go with generating the SelfieElate user base growth.
With 57,000 USD (or more) we will accomplish all that but already having it as a native mobile app [exclusively for Android and iOS]. 
 
The Impact (Yours and Our)
You see clearly the impact your contribution could make. And you feel the potential of this project. 
That some kind of community SelfieElate has at Instagram.com/SelfieElate_repost already helped to gain in popularity. (Yes, we do repost there some selected selfies and do so twice a day. People just love it!) At the same time it shows how important and useful is to have extra spots to spread selfies. 
How Much Are You Ready To Contribute?

<p>Squidget is a small, handheld device that currently contains seven options that replicate the most common fidgeting habits, designed to enable almost noiseless fidgeting.</p>
</div></div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496179365/dxgslz8ompuhfwncmcbz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>          </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 36px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">How does it work?</span></p>
<p><strong>Squidget offers many options in just one solution.</strong></p>
<p>Each option on Squidget fulfills a specific fidget need, all in one patented device:</p>
<p>1. <b>Pen Clicker</b></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/219101064?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<p>Provides an exact replica of the top of a pen to allow the Squidgeter to enjoy all of the tactile satisfaction of <strong>pressing a pen-top repeatedly without making the annoying clicking noise.</strong></p>
<p>2. <strong>Button Twirler</strong></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/219100837?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Allows Squidgeters to twirl Squidget's button with greater twirling movement than a regular button for a more substantial tactile satisfaction and<strong> this button won't ever fall off!</strong></p>
<p>3. <b>Hair-Twirler</b></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/219100904?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Provides a safe and satisfying alternative for those who twirl their hair, <strong>most times unconsciously but can lead to serious health issues such as Trichotillomania</strong>. </p>
<p>4. <b>Pencil Roller</b></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/219101152?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Allows Squidgeters to roll a pencil surface without distracting other students around them. These children need the tactile satisfaction, namely vibration, from rolling their pencil on a desk. Our option <strong>gives them even more satisfaction while both allowing them to work with their pencil and not distract or disrupt others in their class</strong>.  <strong>Teachers LOVE this option both for the child and their 'connection' with the child - meaning more collaborative rather than adversarial. </strong></p>
<p>5. <b>Edge rubbing surface</b></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/219101230?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Presents a smooth, curved interrupted surface of five 'bubbles' that  <strong>allows individuals to rub their fingers across it without creating callouses.</strong></p>
<p>6. <b>Deep Nail Pressure Satisfaction</b></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/219100970?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Users can dig their nails into the deep grooves on the periphery of the surface, rather than their own skin, <strong>thus gaining the necessary tactile satisfaction without the risk of harming themselves from other forms of 'deep nail pressure satisfaction'.</strong></p>
<p>7. <b>Spinner Tab</b></p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/219101304?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Presents a lightweight tab Squidgeters can flick, spin or grasp to spin the entire Squidget to help calm, center, and focus to complete tasks. Numerous adults have told us they never get on a conference call without picking up their Squidget so they can pay closer attention to the call.</p>
<p><strong>With seven unique options, Squidget promotes greater focus, unleashes immense creativity all the while enhancing calmness.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It also allows children to reclaim their self-dignity and confidence that might have been lost due to constant reprimands for doing exactly what they MUST do to succeed. </strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">At the end of the campaign you can pick whichever Squidget you wish to receive:</p>

</div></div>","Fidgeting is great! Focusing is even better!Team Squidget thinks it is not how you fidget, rather how you focus that matters.Just asks the head of the Neuro-Surgical Residency program at one of the most prestigious research universities in the world.​""Brilliant"" was how described our design. He is an invaluable member of our research and product development team and is Chairman of our Board of Advisers.  He sees very clear benefits to the Squidget..That's why we are asking for your support to go into full production.  We are not a ""KPNAC""....we are a real company with sixteen professional partners with over  400 years of professional experience. We have an experienced manufacturing partner and will employ individuals at a sheltered workshop, all dedicated to our Vision - namely helping millions of individuals improve their lives with Squidget.Everyone fidgets - hair twirling, pencil rolling or pen clicking - we all do something to stay focused, but sometimes fidgeting can draw negative attention. We waited to introduce the Squidget because we had to get it right, the first time!Our nine years of research shows that each year 2 million student learning years are irrecoverably lost to disruptive and potentially self-harming fidgeting.Years before the 'bros' claimed to have invented something, we had already filed our patent for this 'brilliant design' that was tested worldwide and proven to work!They just felt they could get away with this but they were very WRONG!  Ask the Better Business Bureau where they already have massive numbers of unresolved complaints for not delivering at all and product breaking.We have helped dozens of their customers who either paid and sadly never even got their product, or exposed their children to great risk because the copycat cube broke almost immediately.Who loves Squidget and Why?Current medical and therapeutic clinical research concludes that fidgeting is a beneficial and effective way for individuals to self-calm, stay centered and Focus to  begin and complete tasks.Squidget uniquely transforms normal fidgeting into exceptional productivity.  Principals, Teachers, Special Education Experts, Autism & ADHD Advocates, Parents worldwide have participated in our research and more than validated value and benefits their students experience with their Squidget.Meet Squidget                                          
 
Squidget is a small, handheld device that currently contains seven options that replicate the most common fidgeting habits, designed to enable almost noiseless fidgeting.

          
How does it work?
Squidget offers many options in just one solution.
Each option on Squidget fulfills a specific fidget need, all in one patented device:
1. Pen Clicker

 
Provides an exact replica of the top of a pen to allow the Squidgeter to enjoy all of the tactile satisfaction of pressing a pen-top repeatedly without making the annoying clicking noise.
2. Button Twirler

Allows Squidgeters to twirl Squidget's button with greater twirling movement than a regular button for a more substantial tactile satisfaction and this button won't ever fall off!
3. Hair-Twirler

Provides a safe and satisfying alternative for those who twirl their hair, most times unconsciously but can lead to serious health issues such as Trichotillomania. 
4. Pencil Roller

Allows Squidgeters to roll a pencil surface without distracting other students around them. These children need the tactile satisfaction, namely vibration, from rolling their pencil on a desk. Our option gives them even more satisfaction while both allowing them to work with their pencil and not distract or disrupt others in their class.  Teachers LOVE this option both for the child and their 'connection' with the child - meaning more collaborative rather than adversarial. 
5. Edge rubbing surface

Presents a smooth, curved interrupted surface of five 'bubbles' that  allows individuals to rub their fingers across it without creating callouses.
6. Deep Nail Pressure Satisfaction

Users can dig their nails into the deep grooves on the periphery of the surface, rather than their own skin, thus gaining the necessary tactile satisfaction without the risk of harming themselves from other forms of 'deep nail pressure satisfaction'.
7. Spinner Tab

Presents a lightweight tab Squidgeters can flick, spin or grasp to spin the entire Squidget to help calm, center, and focus to complete tasks. Numerous adults have told us they never get on a conference call without picking up their Squidget so they can pay closer attention to the call.
With seven unique options, Squidget promotes greater focus, unleashes immense creativity all the while enhancing calmness.
It also allows children to reclaim their self-dignity and confidence that might have been lost due to constant reprimands for doing exactly what they MUST do to succeed. 
At the end of the campaign you can pick whichever Squidget you wish to receive:

How did we get here and what's next?
A quick timeline of our amazing journey to this important milestone
2009 - Jerry and Naomi meet while building a tutoring company dedicated to helping                                                      students with ADHD and ADD.
2009 - 2014   Jerry and Naomi focus on building Team Squidget and creating the                      final design that would be safe, affordable, durable, discrete and fun!
2014 - 2017

Please note, these are 'worst case scenario' dates.  We have built our Team and business on the 'under commit and over deliver' philosophy.  There could be as much as 3-4 weeks of improvement but we don't want to promise and let down those who pledge to us.

                  Who Needs Squidget?
Squidget is for everyone and anyone:

Students
Business Professionals
People waiting in line 
People trying to quit smoking

Additionally, Squidget is ideal for individuals diagnosed with:


Autism
ADD/ADHD/Executive Functioning 
Down Syndrome
Dyslexia
Traumatic Brain Injury Patients 



Why is Squidget so invaluable? 
Because we spent 9 years working on a design that would guarantee that Squidget is:




Safe - Created with an innovative design, ABS plastic as the material of choice, and injection molding. Our goal is to have Squidget exceed the Consumer Product Safety Standards for use by children ages 5+


Affordable - Produced from the most cost effective injection molding

Compact - Fits in the palm of the hand to focus discretely without creating a noisy distraction

Aesthetically Pleasing - Features a bright multi-color design with each option featuring a different color for clear fidgeting differentiation

Portable - Comes in a convenient carrying case

Squidget can help Millions of Individuals improve their lives


By reaching our goal of $15,000, Squidget can order the molds necessary to begin to give everyone the opportunity to immediately, predictably and consistently improve their own lives.

By exceeding our goal, Team Squidget can continue to finally both bring this Squidget to market and to develop new options with the goal of addressing an ever increasing number of fidgeting needs.
Our mantra has and will continue to be:
 ""Send us a video of how you fidget, let us build the very next Squidget”
 

How far we've come...  
Here are some of our earlier versions as seen against the NYC skyline....pretty cool

<h3>A Short Summary</h3>
<p>Bridge is an application which will be available on iOS and android. Bridge App gets you connected with your new friends across all social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram and snapchat etc. using just a single tap of your mobile phones.</p>

<h2>My Story</h2>
<h3>How Bridge and I evolved together?</h3>
<p>Hi there! welcome to the Bridge campaign I am Harsh Mudgil. I am a college student who happens to be in second year of Electronics Engineering. When I was in high-school I wanted to make a social networking site which would be most intuitive and easy to use. I figured out pretty soon that if I wanted to succeed in a race among social media giants like Facebook and Snapchat I had to do something unique. I started looking for a real life aspect of our social life, which was not captured by any of these mega giants. I figured out that the most important component of our social life which happens to be a handshake wasn't captured by any one before. A social media profile is a digital representative of a person. If I wanted to implement Handshake in the digital world I had to do it, so that it enables two social media profiles to be friends together. So I  realized that, in order to succeed, I did not have to make a social media platform, but I had to build something which would help people to connect on existing social networks in a more intuitive way. As I moved to my college in first year, I got to know hundreds of new people who eventually became my friends. I wanted to add all these people to my different social networks. Back then I used 5 different social networks. I realized that the process of adding all these new friends to 5 different social networks is a tedious process.To add one single friend on 1 social network you need to do the following steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the social network app</li>
<li>Search the name of your friend</li>
<li>Search the right profile amongst so many similar looking profiles</li>
<li>Finally tap the ""Add as a Friend"" button </li>
<li>Wait for your friend to accept the request</li>
</ol>
<p>Now just imagine doing all of this for so many friends on 5 different social networks. Feels tiring and time consuming, doesn't it?</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>By now it was the beginning of my second year and I had realized what I had to do for success. I wanted a software which could get me connected with one single friend across all social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp by using just one step just like a handshake for all our digital profiles. That's when I came up with Bridge App.</p>

<h3>How Bridge works?</h3>
<p>When you make a new friend in real life,</p>
<p>1) You and your friend need to open the Bridge app.</p>
<p>2 &amp; 3) Then you have to tap the back of your mobile phone with the back of your friend's phone</p>
<p>4)  Within seconds you and your friend are connected to each others profile across all different social media platforms  like Facebook and Instagram using your phone's NFC, just like a digital handshake.</p>

<h3>Current Stage</h3>
<p>The stage of our product is not conceptual. We are one stage ahead of conceptual stage and one stage below prototyping. We have completed all the necessary documentations regarding User Control Flow and functionality. We are working  very hard on the code day and night, to make this thing a reality . Your support is more than essential to help us realize our goal. It will help us to establish our digital and physical infrastructure which would enhance our capability to make it a little sooner. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This application changes how we connect with people around us. It does not only have an impact on digital world, but it also effects how we socialize in our society. Your contribution will help us to make this world a little more faster, smarter and better. Our app helps people to connect with each other faster in a more intuitive way. When we can socialize in real life with just a handshake, why should socializing on digital medium be so tedious? A handshake for our digital profiles, that's how intuitive it is and that's what it is. So, help us to help the world to save time and to do digital handshake.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Tony and I am a single father living in Athens, Greece. When the 2nd Covid lockdown wave hit Athens my daughter Elena (9 years old) had to start wearing a mask to school and that was the trigger! Elena was losing 4 out of 5 masks every week so I asked her ""hey, what's going on with you and the masks? How come you never lose your phone?"" </p>
<p>She was like ""eh, daddy, the phone is important..."" So I thought ""Ok then, I'll make an app on your phone to alert you not to forget your stuff!"" </p>
<p>That is how the idea was born in Sep 2020 thanks to my baby girl! Elena and I hope to help millions of people that are doing the best they can but still forget...  </p>

<p>Well there was no team. Only me, unemployed in Lockdown with a bunch of great ideas and all the time in the world. So many really good ideas that I could not NOT make them a reality! So I decided I needed help and started searching for people that would be an asset to the App. While playing Fortnite (?!?) I met a young software developer who introduced me to a few more developers... after some talks, Paul was the most keen and willing to learn out of the group and immediately stood out from the rest.

Maintaining a bond with close ones is becoming increasingly difficult due to extremely busy lives or inability to communicate their feelings.

It left us miserable and empty because we didn’t get to communicate everything with him. He was a very introverted person and didn’t share a lot, not even with his family. Even though he didn’t communicate with us a lot, we missed him terribly and on some days we were trying to look for notes or his diary to find out more about his life that he didn’t tell us. We wish that we knew more about his life, our childhood memories, perspectives, feelings; something that would have given us closure. </p><p>Sometimes expressing emotions doesn’t always mean speaking, it means expressing in any way you’re comfortable with. I realised that people may go but memories last forever.</p><p>That is how we decided to come up with a platform for people to vent, rant, talk, write about their feelings, memories and record beautiful moments of their life to preserve and share their legacy with loved ones.""</p><p><i>- Rushabh Shah, Co-founder</i></p><p>While researching we found that journaling is one of the keystone habits that can transform your life. But we wanted to give journaling a twist.

How are you preserving your legacy?People are now more distant than ever. Maintaining a bond with close ones is becoming increasingly difficult due to extremely busy lives or inability to communicate their feelings. In this age, moments spent with loved ones are assets. How we came up with this idea""A few years ago, I lost my father. It left us miserable and empty because we didn’t get to communicate everything with him. He was a very introverted person and didn’t share a lot, not even with his family. Even though he didn’t communicate with us a lot, we missed him terribly and on some days we were trying to look for notes or his diary to find out more about his life that he didn’t tell us. We wish that we knew more about his life, our childhood memories, perspectives, feelings; something that would have given us closure. Sometimes expressing emotions doesn’t always mean speaking, it means expressing in any way you’re comfortable with. I realised that people may go but memories last forever.That is how we decided to come up with a platform for people to vent, rant, talk, write about their feelings, memories and record beautiful moments of their life to preserve and share their legacy with loved ones.""- Rushabh Shah, Co-founderWhile researching we found that journaling is one of the keystone habits that can transform your life. But we wanted to give journaling a twist. Mease is a one-of-a-kind app, where you can express thoughts, feelings, record your life journey, preserve your legacy, keep memories alive and share with loved ones. Understand yourself and your life better and preserve all those valuable memories and stories for yourself and others and it also aides you in writing.We believe that moments spent with loved ones are assets and should be remembered and cherished forever, so we have added the nominee feature. We aim to create a digital legacy of memories that can be accessed by generations” Aaryan Shah, co-founder. Introducing MeaseMease is a digital will of your memories. From recollecting little things about your day to ruminating about special moments. You can easily rely on Mease to store key moments of your life. Moreover, you can share these with your friends and family or keep them personal to you.Among other features, below are some of our main features:Schedule posts for futureSchedule a post for your future self to remind that you made it! (through difficult times) or a message for your son’s 18th birthday or any occasion by setting a date and time. You can also write a confession that you might want to share with someone at a later date and tag them.Gift your memories in a Memory ScrapbookAt Mease, we understand the need of having a personal connection with your friends and family beyond the virtual world, therefore we worked on a new feature where you can export certain entries, choose from six themes and we will transform it into a physical scrapbook which will be delivered to your loved one.Appoint a NomineeOur distinctive feature is to appoint a nominee, who will receive your memories, after 6 months of your inactivity on Mease, on an email request. They can only see posts they are nominated in. You can add upto 2 nominees. Our aim is to help remember loved ones, cherish their memories and bring families and relationships closer.  Why Mease?The day he proposed, that first house, the birth of a child, a graduation, or a family reunion, it can be hard to remember the nuanced details of your life. Forgetfulness can be vexing after all. Writing down your memories will help you recall past experiences in greater and accurate detail, reference aspects of your daily lives, reflect by looking back at a situation to understand it better to gain insights and lastly, relive special days of your life.Unlike a conventional will, where your assets get passed on to your nominated kins. Mease stores and shares your memories and feelings and your life’s legacy to your loved ones. It’s a place to record your life journey and to preserve and share your legacy. From recollecting little things about your day to ruminating about special moments. You can easily rely on Mease to store key moments of your life.

Our dream came true when we published our first planner in Iceland for the year 2016. Our planner got sold out in only a few weeks and we received very positive feedback from our customers. In 2017 our planner was the most sold in Iceland in years. Since we always dream big - our current goal is to be able to publish an English version of the MUNUM planner. MUNUM means <i>remember</i> in Icelandic and we really like the brand and the meaning of it and therefore decided to keep the original name.</p><p>The MUNUM planner is designed with the aim of facilitating goal setting, time management and positive thinking. Studies show that precise goal setting leads to more achievement and overall success. You are about ten times more likely to succeed only by setting goals for yourself and by writing them down you can increase the likelihood of success up to 40%. By setting specific goals, with a precise time frame and braking them down into smaller steps you can increase your likelihood for success even further. For this reason, this planner is designed in a way that facilitates this process. In the beginning of the planner there is a good summary of goal setting and what aspects you need to keep in mind when setting your goals.  You are encouraged to set a few bigger goals for the year of 2017. In the beginning of each month you are encouraged to write down your monthly goals and in the beginning of each week you have a motivational quote and a space to write down goals/tasks for the week. In each week there is a small section for your ""10 minutes tasks"". These are simple tasks that take short time to finish but somehow you always postpone them. This can be things such as making an appointment with the dentist,  unsubscribe your gym membership, pay some bills, book a summerhouse for your upcoming vacation and etc.</p><p>We also put great emphasis on positive thinking in our planner. It is very important to take a moment each day and remind yourself of all the positive things around you and be thankful of what you have. In order to promote this, we have a special section in each week where you are encouraged to write down things that you are thankful for that week. These do not have to be big things because more often the beauty lies in the small moments around us. Positive and thankful thinking provides us with more happiness.</p><p>We really hope you will enjoy writing in this planner and that the year 2018 will bring you motivation, increased power, success and overall happiness.</p></div>","We are two friends from Iceland who shared the dream of publishing our own personal planner with special features that are highly important in our lives.

<h3>Purpose and Intent</h3>
<p>Here's who we are, what we are doing and what we are up to:</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Emuobosa and I'm working with Adewuyi on this project. We are software developers. I'm focused on managing solutions architecture for integrations and communication services while Adewuyi is focused on developing software and services for security and scaling of company software. We do this through Cronalia (<a href=""http://www.cronalia.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.cronalia.com</a>)  </li>
<li>We are passionate about building affordable storefronts and landing pages hence we find it important to build a community of software developers who would help small businesses work on their concepts at a cheaper cost before they go about seeking funding - most importantly, we don't want them spending too much on turning concepts to prototype. To achieve this, we've developed the App Factory 360 System at <a href=""http://www.appfactory360.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.appfactory360.com</a>.</li>
<li>For contributing to this project, we are ready to give you access to the community we are building and always have you featured on a roll basis as our sponsors. Well, if you're giving us at least $10,000, we can discuss equity.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need $20,000 (equivalent to NGN7.8 million).</li>
<li>We would need to lease training halls with $5,000 (about NGN2 million) in stages for 3 months at Co-working Hubs in Abuja, Lagos and Port Harcourt, Nigeria; another $5,000 (still around NGN2 million) for getting an office space with an Incubator in Abuja, Nigeria and the rest as cash for on-site campaigns and travels.</li>
<li>You get access to leverage on partnerships that help us grow. If you give us good integral partners e.g. Incubator Hubs, Co-working spaces, etc., you are sure to get a commission across board.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goals, we would settle in Ventures Platform, Abuja, Nigeria and make use of the free space benefits to train a few people as much as we can. At the least, what we get can be used for operational expenses.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The Mobile App Development System would reduce the time it takes to bring ideas to life. Collecting feedback and connecting with end users has proven to keep customers better than transaction notifications.</li>
<li>We have developed a Bulk SMS Mobile Service at <a href=""http://www.mobi2sms.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mobi2sms.com</a> and maintained it for 6 years. So far, we have a client branding the solution at <a href=""http://www.fortemobilesms.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fortemobilesms.com</a>
</li>
<li>We are real and we have been solving problems. However, we want to move a step further from simply automating messaging to build customer retention initiatives to help startups getting ready for the future.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We would face risks and challenges but we are sure to win and here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have struggled to keep and manage Mobi2SMS, even when other businesses were falling. We survived by providing a lot of other intuitive value added services for clients.</li>
<li>We have a rock solid plan. We intend to minimize operational costs as much as possible. We would just be introducing our products to incubators at first - hence using our first savings for travels and brief meetings aimed at closing deals with channel partners.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You might not have the funds but you can help. Here's what we are asking for in two simple ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help us get places to go and people to train; even for free. We know that if people are well trained, they would use our software. That's key!</li>
<li>Don't forget to give it a shot in this trial period. However, we can't wait to launch out in July. We just can't wait!</li>

Windward reduces the heat that you feel, making you more efficient and directing air flow from the front to the back of your body. It stays stable as you move around, so you can climb, jog, or run without ever worrying about knocking it out of place. You simply place Windward on your neck, and the our system will adjust the direction of the air for your comfort.

If you want to stay comfortable and stay effective at everything you do, then you need to stay cool. Of course, staying cool is much easier said than done, especially during the dog days of summer. How do you do it? How do you do it conveniently? How do you do it easily? Bad sweat odor bothers peopleOccasionally adjusting fan is not only tiring, but it also decreases work efficiencyLet’s admit it, we know the struggles like ones above. Working in scorching heat drains stamina, disturbs attention and produces a drenched smell. An outside environment without AC, and frequently adjusting fans is physically and mentally disturbing task.Our solution is Windward, a hands-free wearable fan that you can take with you everywhere you go. Windward reduces the heat that you feel, making you more efficient and directing air flow from the front to the back of your body. It stays stable as you move around, so you can climb, jog, or run without ever worrying about knocking it out of place. You simply place Windward on your neck, and the our system will adjust the direction of the air for your comfort. It’s all based on the Coanda effect, and as you will see very quickly after you put it on, it works impressively well! What Windward can provide?Windward stays around your neck,and it will prevent sweating through lowering body temperature Wind of Windward breezes along with the neck 

Wind speed is 1.8 m/s on top and bottom at the wind level 3The air does not flow in a fixed direction, but it surrounds the entire neck, which allows cooling the heat in the back area. Even with sweat, Windward will quickly dry it off before germs can grow. Through equally distributing weight around the neck, we minimized possible discomfort. Ergonomic design provides stability during movementPliable material allows easy wearingSeparable design allows you to carry it around in your bagYou can charge and use windward at the same time  How it is designed?  How Windward operates?We initially tried to make Dyson’s bladeless fan wearable on the neck. However, portable battery lacked efficiency to operate a fan with high-pressure wind.Accordingly, instead of increasing the wind pressure, we found ways to increase speed and adjust the direction of the wind.  Coanda effect suggests that fluid jet tends to stay attached to a convex surface. Based on this observation, we developed an open duct and designed a suitable propeller to maximize the effect.Air from Windward flows on the surface of the open duct, even towards the back of the body without the high-pressure fluid flow.  When do you need Windward?When cookingWorking outside, using both hands for workHikingRecommended for those working outside/ environment without AC and those highly susceptible to heat. Anyone can use it depending on a situation.  Specification of Windward  Timeline  What We need & What You GetCurrently, we are looking to put together $50,000 in start-up capital, which will cover the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and distributing Windward on a global scale. This is where we need your help, friends. The more funds that we raise through this campaign, the better we can position ourselves for the future, to continue to improve on the Windward model and even develop other innovations with your comfort in mind. To say thanks for your support, we are offering major discounts exclusively through this campaign.  Team StoryHi. I am Taewoo. I had to spend substantial effort to develop Windward.For nearly a year, I repeated designing the body and the duct of Windward and destroying them and tested tens and hundreds of propellers. I also faced unexpected difficulties while preparing for mass production. The whole process was full of challenges, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Without generous help from many people, the birth of Windward would not have been possible. Really thanks to my friends, partnership company, South Korea government and my parentsI still have a long way to go, but I also believe in my potential. I will continue to grow as I have no matter what obstacles are ahead of me.Your support will definitely be of great help.  Risk & ChallengeThere are two key areas in which we would like to improve Windward in future iterations: its sound level and its battery life. We believe that our prototype is ready for market, but the biggest challenges that we face are in research as we address these problems and come up with solutions that work.As it is now, the device runs for about 8 hours. That is around the length of an average work day, but we know that we can do better given the proper time and resources. Likewise, the decibel level for the motors is acceptable, but it can be a nuisance in environments that are supposed to be quiet. The ImpactPicture yourself going through each day of your life in total comfort, never worrying about sweat, never worrying about over-heating. We want to bring this picture to life, and we know that we can through the technology we have developed in Windward. Your contributions will bring this modern innovation to consumers worldwide. Our Vision  We aim to make the world full of joy and happiness In order to achieve this goal to create the world a better place, the first thing was for ourselves to enjoy our work.This is why we created WINDWARD to solve one of the biggest problems at work that many people have suffered from, which is “easily feeling the heat and sweating excessively while working in heat.”If you are one of them who are suffered from sweating, we hope our windward, a great invention of the project we enjoyed, can refine the inconvenience of sweating.Besides WINDWARD, as long as we continue to move forward step by step, we believe our inventions will contribute to create the world with full of joy and happiness that we dream of.  Other Ways You Can HelpBeyond making a monetary contribution, you can show your support for what we are doing by sharing a link to this campaign on any social media platforms you use.

As those roll out, we'll deploy store pages, so that your readers can first connect to your books on other platforms, and then even purchase them direct from Scribi to shorten the distance between discovery and clicking 'buy'. As we move into these stages, we'll eliminate subscriptions entirely for author-level users, and focus on supporting the platform through on-site sales and enterprise activity. </li>

<b>
</b><p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Antonis, as a freelance accountant, had been facing a
very usual problem in his work: the difficulty of managing many different
clients. Imagine a hundred unique clients with a hundred unique stamps on
Antonis’ working desk. It is a total mess! Then, one day, an idea came up to his
mind. A stamp that would be able to be used for all his clients, an electronic
stamp that could save all the data of his clients and use it respectively.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Once
he thought of this electronic stamp, Antonis immediately called his friend
Dimitris, a software engineer, to inform him about his idea and ask him if it
would be achievable. That was it! Dimitris found the idea great and started
developing the project right away. He called his team! Aitzan, an embedded systems
engineer, and Eleftheria, a marketing specialist, to settle the foundations of
what later be called <b>selfpree</b>.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Selfpree can

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">At the heart of the selfpree resides a robust and reliable <b>printing head</b> providing high-quality

quality, cost) since the ink tank can be easily <b>refiled</b>. The printing head is
driven by high-performance, power-optimized microcontroller which
responsibility include also driving the motor of the printing head and
controlling the miscellaneous functions of the device. Selfpree facilitates an

can be triggered easily by a dual-purpose button which is also used as ON/OFF
switch. The following figure provides an abstract view of system architecture

what later be called selfpree.



How it works?


Selfpree can
be described as an innovative inkjet printing utility targeting primary the business
sector and secondly the personal printing needs. Its ergonomical design, size
and cutting-edge technology make selfpree ideal replacement for business
stamps, labeling systems and in general, its applicability in printing
applications could be unlimited. 


At the heart of the selfpree resides a robust and reliable printing head providing high-quality
with reasonable printing resolution. Moreover, the ink is user-selected (color,
quality, cost) since the ink tank can be easily refiled. The printing head is
driven by high-performance, power-optimized microcontroller which
responsibility include also driving the motor of the printing head and
controlling the miscellaneous functions of the device. Selfpree facilitates an
E-Paper monitor displaying messages, its status and of course, the printing
screen (what will be printed). Up to 20 print-screens can be saved locally to
accommodate the multi-functional applications reducing the printing
responsiveness in such scenarios (multiple stamps). The power requirements are
managed by a durable Li-ion battery, rechargeable from a mini-USB connector. Printing
can be triggered easily by a dual-purpose button which is also used as ON/OFF
switch. The following figure provides an abstract view of system architecture
depicting the main components of selfpree.




Selfpree is
accompanied by a user-friendly application running on Android, iOS and
Windows.  The application can be used to
create, delete, edit and send the printing-screens to selfpree as well as to
monitor and control the functions of the device. It could be connected using
BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) or the mini-USB connector with selfpree.
