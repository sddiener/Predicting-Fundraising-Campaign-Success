Stand Up Paddle is one the fastest growing sport in the world.  Currently only a few specialized media exist, but there is not a single one that offers a worldwide coverage of the SUP scene in more than one language. 

My goal through TotalSUP is to dig up local SUP stories from every corner of the globe and share the SUP love  between paddling communities without the language barrier.
In order to achieve this, I need to move from the bloggy feel of the current website to a solid new platform which will allow TotalSUP to grow as a multilingual website and build new features that will be useful to the entire worlwide SUP family.


What we need 
The funds we need will be allocated by order of priority to the following:
1. Hire a freelance developer / web agency to build a professional website and move all the current content to the new platform.
2. Build exclusive features by paddlers, for paddlers. The more money we receive, the more features we will be able to develop! 
3. Get a team of contributors and ambassadors together in various parts of the world - and start paying them for their work!
4. Start financing a small production of TotalSUP rewards and merchandise (T-shirts, lycras, mugs, etc...)
5. Build an advertisting program for brands and businesses to be more visible and finance TotalSUP.
How important is your help?

Very!

My name is John Kearns of Kearns International Limited;  Challenged by a local municipality to find a solution to their ancient yet nagging dilemma of garbage disposal, I went about designing and constructing  a pilot unit capable of ""being affordable"", environmentally superior and accepting every known carcinogen bearing waste type (excluding radio active matter.) 

 


Designed along natural phenomena's; Gravity, Angle of Repose and near Stoichiometric conditions (Total Combustion), the Disintegrator renders all waste types inert and broken down to their basic elements. 

                

 


 NO CARBON !   



The end result is a system, now known as the Disintegrator which has demonstrated its ability to achieve the following criteria, which has never been heard of before, in the annals of thermal destruction.  



A  NEW  PARADIGM 


In the area of carbon, Regulators ask for 10 000 PPM we deliver a continuous 0.04 PPM, which is 250,000 times better then the EPA standard. 



In the area of ... Off gas THC's (total Hydrocarbons) from the stack, we are allowed 300 PPM but deliver 0.00 PPM.




 The Stack of the Disintegrator  with 0.00 THC's 




The Disintegrator is the worlds only purpose designed system to process all types of waste, with  total combustion, and totally autothermic, (not requiring the need for any supplementary fuel).   According to the British Thermal Institute, 4520 BTU's can be derived from one pound of North American  ""run of the dump"" garbage.  The Disintegrator extracts 7446 BTU'S.      



THE DISINTEGRATOR ....THE MOST EFFICIENT FIRE NEXT TO THE SUN 

A FEW FACTS : 

The Kearns Disintegration System (KDS) is the only technology in the World: 
To have closed an existing landfill without having it reopen at another location.


The client Six nations landfill, was the first landfill to be closed and not reopened an another location. 

To have 0.00   THC's ( total hydro carbons) at the stack.
 
To have a carbon-less ash of 0.04 PPM, without the use of any supplementary fuel.

To be able to exhume existing land fills.

That can accept all types of waste excluding radio active. 
   
To hold a Patent for burning water , thereby separating the hydrogen and oxygen molecule. 


What we need now is $5 million dollars to construct a brand new Pre-commercial unit  which we already have sale for , with the best Pollution Control Equipment to match our world class Thermal Destructor.



Any claims written or spoken of are supported by academic testimony from leading stack testers, universities  and laboratories .  We are also pleased to say that several university professor  engineer PhD's , leaders in their field, originally involved in the AMEC Report, back in 1990  on behalf of the Canadian Federal Government's ,  testing of the technology,  will  be joining us. They will be accompanied by qualified engineers  in each of the associated protocols covering the combustion , mechanical, and chemical engineering associated with each aspect of the entire machine. 



We also have, an  Astro Physicists from M. I .T who has studied our ash samples and  has compared the  ash sample  to that of a nuclear fusion inside the core of stars. How we do that with our fire, intrigues him and he looks forward to working with us further.  


Additionally  please find links to videos of the live operation of the pilot machine as well as testimonials from respectable sources  posted on our Facebook page , including a foreign  Government Ambassador a prospective client   who was present while the machine was in operation.  As well as documentation  of where we had a personal audience with that country's   Prime Minister to discuss the location and installation of the technology.   As well, we will  provide test reports done by AMEC, one of the leading Engineering testing companies in the world and  their corresponding data  as well as any other supporting material to any serious contributors.                                   
To date we have got to where we are now  more or less on our own .   What we now require is your  help to get us to that next stage .  We are on the verge of a significant opportunity to assist in making the world a cleaner and  better place. And with your help we will succeed. 



The above photo was taken a few days before we displayed the operation of our machine at our factory to some of the local public who had an interest in the technology.  Most could not believe that we actually made all of this 120 tonne machine ourselves, at our factory.  During the time of operation , approximately 30 people stood less then 80 feet from the machine while it operated and had lunch, tea or coffee and sandwiches.  At no time did anyone either complain amount the noise level or smell.  In fact on one occasion when asked about the smell, one person replied that they only smell they could sense was that of McDonald's, from across the street.

THE  BIRTH OF THE DISINTEGRATOR  1982






The first 20 ton per day machine under construction in the inventors back yard 1982-83. While primitive, it worked and to date there have been no changes with regard to the science.  In some respects the design based on natural phenomena, the machine performed even better than anticipated by "" going over the top"" in terms of its degree of destruction and has proven itself as a "" Disintegrator"".  In the process, it even disintegrated the water in the waste stream, breaking it down to its two basic elements, Hydrogen and Oxygen, thus becoming the fuel and providing an operational ""Autothermic"" condition ( No supplementary fuel required to operate ). 





The machine was essentially built by hand but standard engineering and welding practices were strictly adhered to 



The work crew, with a somewhat younger looking inventor on the extreme left. 

 

The INVENTORS BACK YARD UNLOADING THE FEED STOCK FOR THE BURN..
IN KEEPING WITH THE "" PARTICULAR""  CLIMATE OF THE DAY , IT WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT SOMEONE, IN THIS CASE THE INVENTOR, WAS ARRESTED FOR PICKING UP GARBAGE.  AS WE AVAILED OURSELVES TO SOME AT THE CURBSIDE , RATHER THAN HAVE IT GO TO A LANDFILL .   


ITS  EVOLUTION 


Fast forward ten years to 1994. Our upgraded machine at the city landfill, where it ran non stop, fall, winter, spring and summer, it never cooled down and at a total cost of $326.00 for maintenance ad repairs. A bearing had to be replaced, so the inventor made one out of wood, until the new one arrived in. 

2000 AND A MORE ADVANCED MACHINE 






Spring of 2000 and the assembly of the inner ring of the 5 ton per day mobile unit.  The reason we built the less sophisticated 20 ton per day unit, was to eliminate the concerns of scale up, so often associated with such projects. 




5 ton mobile under construction 





The mobile unit allowed the user to travel to the client in such cases as farm and agricultural waste as well as that of boutique and hospitals waste.



ONE OF THE AMEC TEAM TAKING TEST READINGS  DURING OPERATION 





THE ABOVE PHOTO SHOWS ONE OF THE AMEC STAFF BLOWING INTO A DEVICE WHEN  THE FIRST READING FOR THC'S FROM THE STACK CAME BACK IT WAS 0.00 ...THE YOUNG ENGINEER THOUGHT THAT THE PIECE OF EQUIPMENT WAS FAULTY.  SINCE HE KNEW WHAT HIS OWN BREATH WOULD READ HE IS CHECKING TO SEE IF THE MACHINE WAS WORKING.  IT WAS DECIDED THAT HE SHOULD SPEAK TO HIS SUPERVISOR AND A FEW WEEKS LATER HE AND HIS SUPERVISOR  WHO HAD A PhD. IN ENGINEERING ARRIVED WITH A NEW MACHINE, AND WHEN THE SECOND TEST WAS DONE THE READING REMAINED UNCHANGED AT 0.00.   THE SCIENTIST LOOKED AT THE INVENTOR AND SAID... "" DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE HERE""...? TO WHICH THE INVENTOR REPLIED..."" WITH A SHEEPISH GRIN....A VERY GOOD FIRE I THINK ""...?  



THE AMEC TEAM  WHO TESTED THE MACHINE, OVER A 4 DAY PERIOD AND WITH A SLIGHTLY OLDER  BUT WISER INVENTOR ON THE RIGHT, FROM WHAT HE HAD LEARNED WITH THIS MORE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY.  

 


SUMMER 2000 AND THE TON PER DAY MOBILE MACHINE GETTING SET UP FOR OPERATION.   IT WAS SHOWN TO HUNDREDS OF VISITORS THAT SUMMER.






Summer  2000 and the inventor with the mobile 5 ton unit at our factory. 



Summer 2013,  The 20 ton per day unit at our factory, prior to being shipped to the clients.  Due to the clients 3 foot water table, the delivery of the fuel source had to be elevated to accommodate their specific geological situation. 


Now with pilot and prototype models built and tested, we are ready to set up mass production assembly methods, making it completely flexible and capable of meeting the required waste throughput of any global community large and small at a price they can afford.  To do this we have a two pronged plan for expansion. (1). being  upgrading our manufacturing facility ( Currently a 120 year old foundry in much need of serious upgrade) and  (2) the introduction of State of the art ( SOTA) manufacturing equipment as in manipulation and processing metal by modern CNC methods.  We would like to point out that every piece that went into making machine was either fabricated at our plant, or purchased  from a supplier and simply  bolted on.

                              YOUR   LAND   FILL  OF  THE  FUTURE 





Given what, you have just read, and what we have been able to achieve you might be asking yourself,  why we have not as yet achieved commercial success?   And that is a fair question. 
We are not ashamed to say that over the years everything we have of a financial nature has already been put into this project.   On our first project with a local municipality  the inventor offered to fund  half of the project  at well over one million dollars  and the  municipality  the other half.   Had that first client  honored the  terms of the contract we would not find ourselves in the position we presently do, namely seeking outside funding help.  However, due to  a change in the political power structure and the installation  of a new Warden for the County, that was not to be the case.  Upon taking over the reigns of the county, the new Warden had  the contract cancelled, despite that fact that we had already cashed the initial down payment. 

On two separate occasions with  signed letters of acceptance from clients, including down payments,  only to have the process sabotaged by political interference, greed and corruption.   We knew the tremendous significance on the technology and so did "" they"".    And "" they"" wanted it....badly.   


The so called "" they""  and the  Government  they represented  had power and influence within the community, so much so that  following our initial success back in 1983,  the inventor  had a visit from two Minister's in the Government along with two  lawyers at which time he was told by them that whatever he needed they would supply.   All they wanted was half the company. They were ordered off the property.  That was on a Friday.


On the following Monday morning the bank contacted the owner and called in the mortgage on his home.  It was their way of doing business.  ""If you don't play the game with us,  you don't get to play it with anyone"". 

This same government representative, who several weeks earlier had  asked for technical documentation on the technology so he could run it through his department.  The information he requested was given  to  him , thinking he would try and assist us, as well as a list of our clients,  which he has asked for several of whom we were in negotiations with at the time.  And with that information,  a representative from his department  later contacted each and every prospective client, using his position of power and authority and told them that the inventor was a fraud and that he had no such technology.

Having fought off literally dozens of hostile take-overs and plain theft, we have gone through unbelievable harassment from government and private sector bodies who were interest only in buying or exploiting the technology for their own personal gain as well  that of their political friends, rather than for the benefit to the environment. 

In 2009, we were approached by an ""International Merchant Banking Group"" who did not have the best interests of the company in mind, and through a number of illegal activities, including fraud and forgery, tried unsuccessfully to steal the company.  And over the next four years, we fought them off successfully through the Supreme Court of Ontario.  Given our financial constraints at that time,  it was the first time, according to the judge, that an individual, other than a lawyer had represented a corporation in the Ontario Supreme Court. 
Over the years we have experienced blackmail, extortion, break and enter, theft, explosions, gunfire, poisoned water, political misbehavior and sheer illegal activities, all with the same purpose in mind, to make it as difficult as possible for us to succeed.  ""On more then one occasion, we have come across a retired employee from one of these agencies, ( after all, 32 years has been a long time )...  only to hear him say...,"" I was told to do a hatchet job on you. We understood and express no animosity or anger toward him... He said "" I'm just doing what I was  told to do""...., just like the bank manager.    
On the second and most recent occasion,  A letter of acceptance in our possession as well as down payments,  we were forced off the work site at the reported threat of rifles being pointed at us. The previous day, notification of the acceptance of the technology was printed in the clients local newspaper advising the community that they would be going ahead with the implementation of the technology and that we would be moving on to price negations.

<h3>Why A Skoolie?</h3>
<span>When we decided to grow our own company into a business that could support us after college, we aimed to do the most epic thing we possibly could. As we built our new venture we borrowed inspiration from the most epic organizations we could think of. To us, the most amazing adventures ever were NASA’s first missions into space. That’s why our job titles are inspired by NASA’s original ranks. </span><br/>

<div>
<p><b>CAPCOM</b> refers to the spacecraft (or capsule) communicator. At NASA, their job is to link the astronauts to flight control. At OTPros, our CAPCOM (Erin) coordinates every mission. She ensures everyone does their job on a project, and helps connect our team to the small business we’re helping.</p>
<p>NASA’s <b>FLIGHT</b> (or Flight Director) is responsible for the mission as a whole, and everything loaded onto the space shuttle. For us, FLIGHT (Johnny) manages the everything pertaining to the videos we create. We depend on our FLIGHT to make sure every part of a video gets filmed, and to edit all the scenes together to create our final product.</p>
<p>Our <b>GC</b>, or Ground Controller is the final piece of the Out There puzzle. The real GC is responsible for telemetry and commands NASA’s mission control center. They also direct maintenance and the overall operation of the space shuttles. Our GC (Losa) is responsible for all of our equipment. She makes sure we get the best scenes on every shoot. Her experience in the film industry guarantees us the quality footage we need to make the most compelling videos possible.</p>

Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University in Advertising (with an emphasis in Emerging Businesses and Technologies), and a minor in Information Technology, Web Design and Startups.</p>
<p>During the first three years of her college career, she worked on the Innovation and Disruptive Entrepreneurship Accelerator as a student ambassador to advise and start up over 100 student companies. This past summer, she worked with a strong staff of four at the number one accelerator in Central New York, the StartFast Venture Accelerator, where she facilitated a program that grew 5 businesses (selected from an application group of 2,000 worldwide) over the course of 13 weeks.

<h3>About Persephone's Folly </h3>
<p>   Persephone's Folly provides beautiful authentic ritual and magical products to the Pagan community. From Hand-bound Italian Leather Books of Shadows, authentic New Orleans Voodoo Dolls, Magical Goat Milk Soaps and wild-crafted Herbs ,our products are crafted and designed for the experienced practitioner as well as the mage just starting out along The Path. </p>
<p>  With our move to a physical space we will also be in a unique position here in Lower Northern Michigan to make community gathering, work shops and hands on purchases of supplies and art available to Pagans and Pagan-friendly clients a reality. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Campaign? </h3>
<p> There are a couple of reasons that we have begun this campaign.</p>
<p>  Of course there is the monetary aspect- paying for the start up of a physical space is expensive and the more help we can get get in funding the more items and resources we can offer to our Community. </p>
<p>  Community is key! Persephone's Folly will be a community space and as such we want your involvement - both energetically and physically - in this conjuration. Because that is what this is! A wonderful Conjure for the creation of something physical from the internet-ether! Please come along with us on this magical journey!</p>
<p>  We are asking for a Year and Day's worth of  space overhead- appropriate symbolism, isn't it? This money will go to mundane business aspects such as rent and utilities. The help we receive will free us to offer workshops, classes, and community events. If we do not reach our target goal the donations we do receive will still go directly to those overhead costs detailed above. </p>
<p>  In exchange for your physical donation we have set up an amazing array of 'Thank You Gifts' that are unique to our company. From authentic New Orleans Voodoo Dolls, to one of a kind jewelry, and personalized Readings. We've even included our exclusive Coven-sized Books of Shadows and House Cleansings and Blessings! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p> By becoming a direct part of this momentous event you are making yourself a part of a larger community of people, allowing for a freedom of expression not currently found in Lower North West Michigan, as well as supporting a valuable resource for those who currently feel alone in their beliefs and practices. Your support will also help to bring about a greater community Outreach in that our presence will allow for a more honest and welcoming exchange of ideas and education within our geographical area. </p>
<p> Obviously there are risks to our venture. We are open to these challenges, fully believing that our Gods often provide these as opportunities in order to grow and learn along the way to success.  Some of these challenges may show up in the following scenarios-</p>
<p>1. We may not be immediately accepted as a physical presence within the Northern Michigan community.  Our response to this is to be ever welcoming and available for others to learn about different paths and ways of worship. We will not invite nor incite controversy for controversies sake but we will offer compassion and education for those who are willing to understand and learn.</p>
<p>2. We may encounter retail 'down time' due to the seasonal aspect of our location.  Our response to this will be sound and responsible business practices as this is first and foremost a business. We cannot be a community resource if there is no place for the community to come to. Seasonal hours may differ, number of staff may vary and outreach may be scheduled differently as the seasons dictate. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Help That Costs You Nothing ~</h3>
<p> While we absolutely LOVE physical donations we realize that not everyone can do that and that's OK- really! So what can you do that won't cost you a single cent?</p>
<p>  Share! share! share! Please share this campaign far and wide! Share on social media, with your Circle or gathering, in an email or call someone and tell them about it. The positive energy that your provide to this project is invaluable. </p>

<p>My name is Rashad Armstead and I am a chef from the bay area with a passion for culinary art and serving communities. The purpose behind me starting this campaign is to open a door for those who don't get exposed to opportunities that will propel them in this world. This is something that has always been close to my heart and God has been building the foundation I need in order to accomplish these goals. Contributors to my campaign will allow me to further pursue my mission and help to elevate it. </p>
<p>   For my campaign, I am looking to get 10,000 people to donate $100 in order to meet our $1M goal, that will fund our mission. With that money, I will be able to first and foremost keep both Crave BBQ and Grammies fully functional. In turn, I will be able to employ underserved people in the community and give them opportunities that will teach them leadership, teamwork, entrepreneurial skills, and culinary skills. I want to be able to provide a space for those who are looking to further there interest in the food industry and offer a place for them to water that seed. If I was unable to meet my goal, anything that I gain through this will still aid me in pursuing our mission. </p>
<p>   I feel as though what makes my campaign important is that it's bigger than just me or you, this is something that is geared toward shedding light on making it so everyone has a voice and a purpose. Thus far with faith and hard work I have been able to achieve the successful opening of multiple restaurants. With the help of you all, I will be able to take these restaurants to the next level and make it so they are not only a catalyst for great food but also a source of hope within the community. </p>
<p>   With doing something that carries so much significance I have already prepared myself for some hardship and challenges. Just as I have overcome many adversities and trials in life, I will continue to step out on faith and put my all into everything I do. When a problem arises I have been tested enough times to know that somethings are out of my control, but what I can control is the mindset I adopt when facing problems. With that being said I am determined to see this succeed and will push through any and all things in order to reach my end goal. </p>
<p>   If you are not able to donate, that's ok, you can also help us by sharing this campaign. Spreading our message and mission would greatly help us and allow for us to reach more people. Thank you so much for even taking the time to become familiar with what we are trying to do. The sky is the limit and with faith and perseverance anything is possible.</p>

<h2>Hello! We're the Courtney's and we're opening Hillsboro's first Parkour facility.</h2>

As our family grew we found it even harder to find time to exercise or manage our schedules to get away.</p>
<p>Even though we replaced our living room furniture with a spring floor a year ago, working out at home was also challenging with our to-do list (and kids) calling our attention.</p>
<p>We found ourselves gravitating towards outdoor activities and playing on the playground with our kids as our preferred choice for movement.</p>

</div></div>","Hello! We're the Courtney's and we're opening Hillsboro's first Parkour facility.
We grew up with a love for moving playfully and as adults, we never enjoyed going to a traditional gym. As our family grew we found it even harder to find time to exercise or manage our schedules to get away.
Even though we replaced our living room furniture with a spring floor a year ago, working out at home was also challenging with our to-do list (and kids) calling our attention.
We found ourselves gravitating towards outdoor activities and playing on the playground with our kids as our preferred choice for movement.
We wanted to create a space that moved as our family did and gave permission for adults and children to learn, play and move together with joy.
When we were introduced to Parkour we knew we'd found the perfect movement form to bring our dream to our community of Hillsboro, Oregon.    
We are excited about our location and it's huge potential for both movement and community events. The space we found fits our long-term vision for The Movement Park perfectly, however, it is almost 2,000 sq ft larger than our original plan and budget.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction / Business Background (The Magic Mugs)</strong></p>
<p>The sale of customized mugs both plain and ""magic"" (i.e. thermal color-changing mugs) have caught on very well over the years. My name is William Plange and I am the founder of Mr. Plange Services, a service aimed at easing the burden on individuals with heavy schedules by running time-consuming errands for them.  These include assisting in documentation, customization of products, liaison, sales &amp; marketing of goods and services, as well as providing business consultation to budding local businesses. </p>
<p>I present to you, my most recent business expansion, <strong>'The Magic Mug'</strong>.</p>
<p>The magic mug has very amazing features which attract individuals and groups. There is transformation when hot liquid is poured into them revealing their own pictures, corporate logos, etc. Magic mugs are mostly used to surprise people on their special occasions such as birthdays, corporate events, weddings, and personal gifts to loved ones. There are also plain mugs where personalized photos are placed to serve as memories for special events and occasions.</p>
<p>Starting with only one heat press mug machine, I got my money back from the cost of the machine in just 2 months of sales. The subsequent months up until now have been profits.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><u>How Magic Mugs are Made</u></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">When orders are placed, pictures and inscription details are taken from clients through WhatsApp or mail, and exported and designed on Adobe Illustrator. After the design, I send it to the client to confirm the preview. After confirmation, I go out to print the design on a sublimation printer, as I do not own one, then I go back to my home office to wrap the printed design on the specially coated mugs and set them in my mug heat press machine for a few minutes, and the magic mug is ready!</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><u>Who am I targeting?</u></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am targeting the following:</span></p>
<p>Families, hotels, restaurants, all corporate bodies and companies, individuals, churches, youth clubs, event organizers, wedding planners, government workers, politicians, and more! </p>
<p>A magic mug is for all.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b><u>Why I Need Funding</u></b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">A magic mug is very profitable in Ghana. Only a few people are aware of such a product with the amazing feature of seeing their images appear surprisingly by just pouring hot liquid in the mugs. </span></p>
<p>In December 2020 I had a deal to design and make 100 mugs for Silas Cash Company, which was a mobile money vendor that wanted to give out customized mugs as gifts to its cherished customers, thanking them for their business. In the same month, I had 2 other deals from 2 families who each ordered 50 customized mugs for a funeral and a wedding which would be used as souvenirs for guests.</p>
<p>These deals were quite challenging for me as I had only 1 heat press mug machine that could only take 1 mug at a time, and had to visit the sublimation print shop several times as well. Despite these challenges, I managed to meet the deadline by staying up throughout the night and dawn and executing the job within 5 days. </p>
<p>I need funding because I want to expand my territories, enter 3 larger regions in Ghana, hire people to assist me, acquire extra heat press mug machines, and visit more companies to introduce magic mugs to them as they usually give out souvenirs to their customers. Moreover, I need to hire individuals to assist me with this expansion, and other types of equipment which are listed below.</p>
<ol><li>
<strong>Purchase of Two (2) Heat Press Machines to Increase Production – </strong>I would like to purchase 2 machines for the magic mug production. I have only one machine currently and I have been using it for a year now. I wish to expand the business by hitting other regions in Ghana and I need 2 more machines, $380 each. The new machine I want to buy is a 5-in-1, which would greatly increase production as I am entering 3 large regions. Therefore, I need <strong>$760</strong> to purchase 2 mug machines.</li></ol>

<strong>Purchase of a Sublimation Printer - </strong>Getting my own sublimation printer would help me save some cost by doing this myself than always going to another shop to print out designs for clients. Therefore, I need <strong>$400</strong> to purchase a sublimation printer to enhance my business and save on the cost in the production of mugs.</li></ol>

<strong>Branding of Customized Package Boxes - </strong>After the magic mug is done, the packaging is quite a problem because I hand-make paper boxes and sometimes I have to wrap mugs in envelopes that are not safe. I want to have a safer customized box as clients are keen on good packaging. I need <strong>$500 –</strong> This money will be used to customize and make quality packing boxes to secure mug safety. Customers appreciate neat packaging with our brand name on them when delivering.</li></ol>

<p>                                                               <strong>Delivery Motorbikes</strong></p>
<p>I intend to maintain our existing customers and also expand our services to nationwide coverage. To tap into the potential of the market and increase the existing market share, customer base, as well as profitability, funds are needed to acquire motorcycles, recruit dispatch persons, and engage in active marketing campaigns. Order and Delivery schedules will be made known and available to customers outside Tema at a fee. The satisfaction of customers is paramount to business success. We know expanding our publicity reach and delivery to cover more areas will take in more income and even open up other opportunities.</p>
<p> </p>
<ol><li value=""6"">
<strong>Expansion of Business (Ads, marketing, official website, labor) -</strong> I want to expand the business as I am only limited to my city (Tema, Ghana). There are 16 regions in Ghana and I am vibrant only in Tema and some parts of Accra, which makes only 1 out of 16 regions. My research has resulted in discovering people who send some of my mug work outside the Accra region as people in other regions have never seen it before. I believe entering into such markets will earn me more profits. This expansion will need more advertisement campaigns, traveling to these regions, hiring and training unemployed individuals to assist me, visiting potential clients, etc. Therefore, I would need <strong>$3400 – </strong>This money will be used to expand into these 3 larger regions: Cape Coast, Takoradi, and Kumasi. This includes transportation to each region, making marketing and advertisement materials such as printed posters and sample magic mugs, and accommodation purposes. I will also have my official website as a marketing tool and will hire a helping hand to support the mug production.</li></ol>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Employment Opportunities </b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I see much potential and willingness in Silas Osei, a senior in high school who lost his father and was left with 9 younger siblings and a single mother. He has much love for graphic design, and I have assured him of getting a professional to train him in graphic designing software and I will later employ him as an assistant graphic designer. He will take care of all the design works for the mug production while I handle the marketing and sales aspects. This will help ease the burden on his mother and other siblings as I will be paying him a monthly salary as well as commission while I work with him. </span></p>
<p>I will also employ a rider to use my motorbike for delivery services to customers who purchase mugs from us. I am currently being assisted by some unemployed friends for free in my daily activities, which I believe if I get funded, I can expand and officially hire them to assist me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>My biggest challenge has been getting orders for about 100 pieces of customized mugs while having only 1 mug machine where I can only make 1 at a time which makes my work quite tedious and time-consuming. This challenge could be solved by acquiring the 5-in-1 (or more) mug machines to make production faster and meeting deadlines right on time.</p>
<p>Another challenge is difficulties in delivering mugs to customers who are not closer to me, and also experiencing mug breakages due to lacking the right package boxes to contain finished mugs on their way to be delivered to customers. This could also be solved by acquiring a motorbike and good package boxes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I currently run my business from my own small room and it is quite challenging as I have my bed, my belongings, and machine all packed in this room. I will be much more comfortable in a bigger space as I wish to expand my business.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
How Magic Mugs are Made
When orders are placed, pictures and inscription details are taken from clients through WhatsApp or mail, and exported and designed on Adobe Illustrator. After the design, I send it to the client to confirm the preview. After confirmation, I go out to print the design on a sublimation printer, as I do not own one, then I go back to my home office to wrap the printed design on the specially coated mugs and set them in my mug heat press machine for a few minutes, and the magic mug is ready!
Who am I targeting?
I am targeting the following:
Families, hotels, restaurants, all corporate bodies and companies, individuals, churches, youth clubs, event organizers, wedding planners, government workers, politicians, and more! 
A magic mug is for all.
Why I Need Funding

                                                               Delivery Motorbikes
I intend to maintain our existing customers and also expand our services to nationwide coverage. To tap into the potential of the market and increase the existing market share, customer base, as well as profitability, funds are needed to acquire motorcycles, recruit dispatch persons, and engage in active marketing campaigns. Order and Delivery schedules will be made known and available to customers outside Tema at a fee. The satisfaction of customers is paramount to business success. We know expanding our publicity reach and delivery to cover more areas will take in more income and even open up other opportunities.
 

Expansion of Business (Ads, marketing, official website, labor) - I want to expand the business as I am only limited to my city (Tema, Ghana). There are 16 regions in Ghana and I am vibrant only in Tema and some parts of Accra, which makes only 1 out of 16 regions. My research has resulted in discovering people who send some of my mug work outside the Accra region as people in other regions have never seen it before. I believe entering into such markets will earn me more profits. This expansion will need more advertisement campaigns, traveling to these regions, hiring and training unemployed individuals to assist me, visiting potential clients, etc. Therefore, I would need $3400 – This money will be used to expand into these 3 larger regions: Cape Coast, Takoradi, and Kumasi. This includes transportation to each region, making marketing and advertisement materials such as printed posters and sample magic mugs, and accommodation purposes. I will also have my official website as a marketing tool and will hire a helping hand to support the mug production.

Working Space Expansion
I am currently working from my small single room with a desk, a mug machine, and other materials I use in production. Looking forward to expanding my production by acquiring extra mug machines, printers, laptops, motorbikes, etc., I need a bigger working space so I could be comfortable working. Therefore, I need $3500 to rent a spacious room for my operations for 2 years. This amount will also include furnishing.

The Impact
Employment Opportunities 
I see much potential and willingness in Silas Osei, a senior in high school who lost his father and was left with 9 younger siblings and a single mother. He has much love for graphic design, and I have assured him of getting a professional to train him in graphic designing software and I will later employ him as an assistant graphic designer. He will take care of all the design works for the mug production while I handle the marketing and sales aspects. This will help ease the burden on his mother and other siblings as I will be paying him a monthly salary as well as commission while I work with him. 
I will also employ a rider to use my motorbike for delivery services to customers who purchase mugs from us. I am currently being assisted by some unemployed friends for free in my daily activities, which I believe if I get funded, I can expand and officially hire them to assist me.

Risks & Challenges
My biggest challenge has been getting orders for about 100 pieces of customized mugs while having only 1 mug machine where I can only make 1 at a time which makes my work quite tedious and time-consuming. This challenge could be solved by acquiring the 5-in-1 (or more) mug machines to make production faster and meeting deadlines right on time.
Another challenge is difficulties in delivering mugs to customers who are not closer to me, and also experiencing mug breakages due to lacking the right package boxes to contain finished mugs on their way to be delivered to customers. This could also be solved by acquiring a motorbike and good package boxes.
Furthermore, I currently run my business from my own small room and it is quite challenging as I have my bed, my belongings, and machine all packed in this room. I will be much more comfortable in a bigger space as I wish to expand my business.

<h2>Food Safety Additions:</h2>
<h3><i>Beef Processing Room</i></h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;'>​Our facility operates as a beef slaughterhouse 2 days a month. It's during this window that we render all of the beef we need for 4 weeks. If you've ever seen a 1-ton bull, you can understand how challenging it is to quarter and debone an animal of that size. A </span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;letter-spacing: 0px;'>beef-specific processing room would let us increase the production of <strong>IDAHOUND's </strong><a href=""https://idahound.com/collections/raw-dog-foods"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">beef products</a>.</span></p>
<h3><i>Green Tripe Processing Room</i></h3>
<p>When we first started <strong>IDAHOUND</strong>, Chris Cey made a prophetic statement: ""Tripe will eventually be our most popular product."" It took a few years, but he was right. As a result, we want to make more tripe! <a href=""https://idahound.com/blogs/news/green-tripe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A true super-food</a>, we want to make beef and lamb tripe a staple in every raw-fed dog's diet.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Storage and Pasture Additions:</h2>
<h3><i>Walk-in Cooler and Freezer</i></h3>
<p>A lot of <strong>IDAHOUND's </strong>capacity issues come down to storage. Whether we are working with beef, sheep or rabbit, adequate cold storage space is an essential element. A walk-in freezer, as well as an expansion to the walk-in cooler will be essential to growing our operation.</p>
<h3><i>More Room for Grazing</i></h3>
<p>We buy small flocks of sheep from nearby ranchers each month. We currently use only one half of the total usable acreage we have for pasture. Building predator-proof fencing on the east side of <strong>IDAHOUND's </strong>property will allow for even more happy grazing, plus longer rotations between corrals for better regrowth.</p>

<h2>What Makes IDAHOUND Different?</h2>
<h3><u>Reason #1: Quality</u></h3>
<p>When <strong>IDAHOUND </strong>butchers an animal, we use 100% of the meat, organ, and stomachs for dog food.  We add the best cuts of whole muscle and organ, not just the ""trim,"" to all of our blends.  There's no question about where this meat came from, how it was processed, or what part of the animal it is. When you buy <strong>IDAHOUND </strong>you will know exactly what went into your dog's foods, from start to finish.</p>
<p>Freshness is a big deal at <strong>IDAHOUND</strong>. Much of our meat is never frozen until its packaged and stored. We do as little processing as possible to keep ingredients and their nutrients intact. These details contribute a final product that is undeniably fresher than anything else on the market.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548449036/ghmbb0xmcw1odxyoelxn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>Reason #2: Community</u></h3>
<p>Carey, Idaho, (pop. 604) lies at the mouth of the Little Wood River, just south of the majestic Pioneer Mountains. Despite Carey's natural beauty and small town charm, jobs are scarce and most residents have to commute up to an hour for work. The number of business headquartered in Carey is less than ten. However, as housing prices near Sun Valley soar, Carey will be an affordable oasis for families.</p>

<p><strong>IDAHOUND </strong>currently employees three full-time individuals in Carey, and in the next five years we expect to hire at least seven more locals.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>Reason #3: Sustainability</u></h3>
<p>What we feed our pets, who need meat-based diets, matters environmentally. Enormous amount of energy, water, and food are devoted to raising and caring for all types of livestock. In fact, the United Nations estimates that animal agriculture generates almost 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Another study concluded that total production related to pet food in the U.S. has the emissions equivalent of 13 million cars!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>IDAHOUND </strong>exclusively buys grass-fed Idaho cattle, sheep and rabbits. Making these purchases from environmentally-conscious producers is the first piece to a sustainable product. The next step is reducing the length of our supply chain. By keeping all of the butchering, processing, packaging, in-house <strong>IDAHOUND </strong>reduces the extra transportation, refrigeration, and manufacturing emissions that would have resulted from a longer production process.</p>
<p>As <strong>IDAHOUND </strong>continues to grow, we are also committed to reducing production waste, adding on-site renewable energy, and creating value out of every acre on our property.</p>

<h2>The Basics of Raw Feeding</h2>
<h3><i>Idahound uses premium, local ingredients to create an “evolutionary” and farm-driven diet, while pursuing minimal environmental impacts.</i></h3>
<p>When determining what to feed ourselves, it's clear that humans reap more nutritional benefits from whole, fresh foods than processed ones. The same logic applies to our pets! Studies have shown that raw meat-based diets have greater digestibility than that of their processed counterparts. Additional research has shown that raw animal products contain more essential amino acids than dried pet foods. Fresh foods also have more fatty acids, helpful bacteria and enzymes than diets that are cooked. Kibble may be the norm, but it's hardly natural. Fortified or not, dried foods can't stand up nutritionally to raw foods.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1542416519/kjwiayj1rkynupgn0udv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although “feeding raw” seems like a new idea, it is far from radical. Like<i> Canis lupus</i>, which hunts live prey and feeds on raw meat, your beloved hound demands a carnivorous diet similar to that of its ancestor. For thousands of years, wild canines achieved superior health from diets that didn't include dried cereal! Mimicking these raw meat-based diets, with slight modifications to fit the demands of today’s domesticated pets, is possible through the raw style of feeding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548451533/bgwmt0lt61o84muy58ei.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite what you may think, dog owners shouldn't be afraid to feed raw meat to their dog. A canine's stomach is extremely acidic, allowing for raw meat and bones to be broken down safely and effectively. In fact, raw meat is precisely what your dog is programmed to eat.</p>
<p>A diet high in fresh raw protein and fat is the most biologically-appropriate way to feed your dog. By weight, <strong>IDAHOUND's </strong>recipes are 71% meat, 9% organ (liver, kidney, and spleen), and 20% produce. We include the latter to keep things nutritionally balanced. It's our preference to add whole foods instead of synthetic vitamins. Finally, none of our recipes contain additives or preservatives. Our philosophy is too keep all of our foods simple yet nutritionally dense, an assortment of only necessary ingredients.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Shay Port and I am a C.P.A., financial coach, financial counselor and educator. </p>
<p>I often think about the fact that money impacts every area of our lives yet we often don't know the most useful ways to spend it, save it or even in some cases, earn it.</p>
<p><strong>I’m so fortunate because my job is to help people with something so fundamental to their overall wellbeing - financial wellbeing. When people feel empowered in this area, it expands out into every area of their lives.</strong></p>
<h3>Why am I so passionate about this work?</h3>
<p>Well - because I have been there!  When I was in my 30’s I got myself into $27,000 of credit card debt and had recently been laid off from a job. I didn't even realize that I was living paycheck to paycheck until this happened, and I had no idea how I was going to get out of this situation. Luckily, I found Suze Orman’s book “9 Steps to Financial Freedom” and it truly changed my life. Over the next 4 years, I not only paid off the entire $27,000 debt, but I also saved $15,000 in my 401k, all on a salary of $36,000 a year. </p>
<p><strong>This proved to me, it really doesn’t matter how much you earn, but rather where your focus is and how you apply the money you are earning.</strong></p>
<p>After this experience, I knew I wanted to be able to help people in this way.</p>
<p>I started my financial wellness business in Los Angeles in 2010, and after helping hundreds of individuals move from envisioning a more abundant life to actually living one, I am now ready to expand this work in my hometown of Pittsburgh by bringing these services to businesses who want to offer this work as a valuable benefit to their employees.</p>
<h3>Why Bring Financial Wellness to the Workplace?</h3>
<p><strong>More than half of all employees in the United States report that they are financially stressed, and nearly one in three employees reports being distracted by personal financial issues while at work</strong>.* Employees' productivity, health and relationships all can suffer from these stressors.</p>
<p>These statistics lead to the only conclusion possible - workers in our country, at every level, <strong>desperately need</strong> financial capabilities training and financial education. </p>
<p>The workplace is an ideal location to offer both for the following reasons :</p>
<ul>
<li>Employees don't have to hurdle barriers such as childcare, transportation or buy-in from a spouse/partner because they can receive these services at the company itself.</li>
<li>Confidentiality is assured by the company, a trusted source, and guaranteed by the third-party provider.</li>
<li>The workplace is a natural location for offering services that promote financial well-being and deal directly with issues and questions surrounding personal finances.</li>
</ul>
<p>The one-on-one approach is so helpful because the focus is on identifying, setting and achieving the financial goals that are important to <strong>each employee individually</strong>. This is no cookie-cutter approach, but rather an approach that allows the employee to set their own goals as well as their own timeline. </p>
<p><strong>By supporting this campaign, you will be helping to increase the health, happiness and financial wellbeing of all workers, regardless of income, position or title. </strong></p>

<li>Pay for legal and other business costs that will cover contracts, tax and business compliance, insurance and general administrative costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>After establishing this business model here in Pittsburgh, I plan on expanding to other cities across the U.S.</p>
<p>Creating a separate non-profit segment of the business is also in the works, the focus of which will be on offering these services to local community service organizations who serve people currently living in poverty who are working very hard to get out.</p>

<h3>Personal Note</h3>
<p>I didn't grow up in the era of online funding campaigns. I grew up to believe that if people needed money to implement their creative or business ventures then they should save up and pay for it themselves! To be totally honest, I haven't even felt comfortable asking people for help on a personal level. I'm accustomed to being the one that offers the help, not the one receiving it. That's probably why I'm drawn to this work in the first place - I love to help people.</p>
</div><div>
<p>It's definitely challenging to change the paradigms we live in, but over the years, I have seen how valuable crowdfunding has been in helping people realize goals and dreams that would most likely be out of reach otherwise. I have contributed to many campaigns in the past and it always felt good to be able to help out in some small way. </p>
<p>I believe in the work that I do, I believe in its transformative power, and I also believe that allowing people to participate in helping me to get this work out there will be transformative for us personally. It will connect us as friends and family, as a community, and as people who have shared values, like wanting other people to prosper in their financial lives.</p>
<h3>Final Thanks</h3>
</div><div>
<p>To all who are able to offer your financial support at this time, you are truly an angel and it's not an exaggeration when I say that you have my undying gratitude.</p>
<p>If you are not able to contribute at this time, I honor that as well. After all, I'm a financial coach - I always want people to prioritize their own financial commitments first!</p>
<p>There are other, non-monetary ways of supporting my efforts, whether by sharing my campaign with your friends and family or by spreading the word to a local business or community service provider who might want to offer financial wellness services to their employees. Even an email or text offering moral support would be welcome!</p>
<p>Either way - a profound thank-you for any support you can offer and a hope that all people, everywhere, can eventually have access to this kind of financial assistance whenever they need it.</p>
<p>With love,</p>
<p>Shay</p>

</div></div>","About Me
My name is Shay Port and I am a C.P.A., financial coach, financial counselor and educator. 
I often think about the fact that money impacts every area of our lives yet we often don't know the most useful ways to spend it, save it or even in some cases, earn it.
I’m so fortunate because my job is to help people with something so fundamental to their overall wellbeing - financial wellbeing. When people feel empowered in this area, it expands out into every area of their lives.
Why am I so passionate about this work?
Well - because I have been there!  When I was in my 30’s I got myself into $27,000 of credit card debt and had recently been laid off from a job. I didn't even realize that I was living paycheck to paycheck until this happened, and I had no idea how I was going to get out of this situation. Luckily, I found Suze Orman’s book “9 Steps to Financial Freedom” and it truly changed my life. Over the next 4 years, I not only paid off the entire $27,000 debt, but I also saved $15,000 in my 401k, all on a salary of $36,000 a year. 
This proved to me, it really doesn’t matter how much you earn, but rather where your focus is and how you apply the money you are earning.
After this experience, I knew I wanted to be able to help people in this way.
I started my financial wellness business in Los Angeles in 2010, and after helping hundreds of individuals move from envisioning a more abundant life to actually living one, I am now ready to expand this work in my hometown of Pittsburgh by bringing these services to businesses who want to offer this work as a valuable benefit to their employees.
Why Bring Financial Wellness to the Workplace?
More than half of all employees in the United States report that they are financially stressed, and nearly one in three employees reports being distracted by personal financial issues while at work.* Employees' productivity, health and relationships all can suffer from these stressors.
These statistics lead to the only conclusion possible - workers in our country, at every level, desperately need financial capabilities training and financial education. 
The workplace is an ideal location to offer both for the following reasons :

Employees don't have to hurdle barriers such as childcare, transportation or buy-in from a spouse/partner because they can receive these services at the company itself.
Confidentiality is assured by the company, a trusted source, and guaranteed by the third-party provider.
The workplace is a natural location for offering services that promote financial well-being and deal directly with issues and questions surrounding personal finances.

The one-on-one approach is so helpful because the focus is on identifying, setting and achieving the financial goals that are important to each employee individually. This is no cookie-cutter approach, but rather an approach that allows the employee to set their own goals as well as their own timeline. 
By supporting this campaign, you will be helping to increase the health, happiness and financial wellbeing of all workers, regardless of income, position or title. 
Where Your Funds Will Go
I'll be using the campaign funds to:

Train and hire additional financial coaches in order to expand our reach and work on larger commissions.
Increase marketing efforts through creating professional videos, brochures and branding that will generate more awareness of this work and its benefits to interested companies.
Pay for legal and other business costs that will cover contracts, tax and business compliance, insurance and general administrative costs.

After establishing this business model here in Pittsburgh, I plan on expanding to other cities across the U.S.
Creating a separate non-profit segment of the business is also in the works, the focus of which will be on offering these services to local community service organizations who serve people currently living in poverty who are working very hard to get out.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>When Goshen lost its bookstore, the six of us, Brad Weirich, Jenny Frech, Kristin Saner, Veronica Berkey, Jeremy Friesen, and Mark Saner, sprang into action to secure the vibrancy of Goshen. Since March 2019, we have been working on securing a location, taking out loans, gathering and sorting book, and talking with our community about how we can build a new and improved bookshop.</p>
<p>Fables Books will open late summer 2019 in Goshen, Indiana. We believe that bookstores are the heart and soul of a city. Bookstores cultivate stories while reflecting the interests, passions, and desires of their community. Our mission is to connect Goshen through our shared stories. We will be a place where people can find books they love and find a welcoming community with events, readings, and story times.</p>
<p>Our shared gifts can make this new bookshop thrive. Brad Weirich brought the previous bookstore to Goshen. Veronica helped run and manage that bookstore for several years. Kristin Saner also helped manage for a few years. All three of them bring not only retail but bookstore experience to Fables. Jenny Frech started and manages Soapy Gnome. She brings startup and small business experience to our group. Jeremy Friesen, having helped Jenny start Soapy Gnome, brings his project management, technical, and writing skills. Mark Saner provides technical support, a sounding board, and overall moral support.</p>
<p>You can find out more about us at<a href=""http://fablesbookshop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> fablesbooks.com</a></p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>We need $90,000 to open our doors. So far we have secured $50,000. We are asking you to help us raise the remaining $40,000. These funds will go towards our start-up costs including, signage,  marketing (materials and online), renovations, supplies, events, and most of all, inventory and merchandise. Some of the new inventory we are excited to offer includes IndieBound Best Sellers, new children’s books, stationery, literary gifts and accessories, and a larger Spanish Language section for both children and adults.</p>
<p>Even if we don’t reach our goal, any funds raised will still go towards our start-up costs. We may have a smaller inventory than originally planned, or need to take on a larger debt, but either way, we’re opening. Plan on enjoying Goshen’s truly independent bookshop late summer 2019! Whether you support at the $10 level or the $10,000 level, each pledge helps ensure the success of this venture. We appreciate each and every person who helps to make Fables a reality.</p>
<p><strong>We are offering 13 different perk levels. Here are 3 examples. To see all the perks be sure to scroll through the sidebar on the right on pc or above on your phone. For a description and list of items included, click on the picture of the perk. </strong></p>

Our Story
When Goshen lost its bookstore, the six of us, Brad Weirich, Jenny Frech, Kristin Saner, Veronica Berkey, Jeremy Friesen, and Mark Saner, sprang into action to secure the vibrancy of Goshen. Since March 2019, we have been working on securing a location, taking out loans, gathering and sorting book, and talking with our community about how we can build a new and improved bookshop.
Fables Books will open late summer 2019 in Goshen, Indiana. We believe that bookstores are the heart and soul of a city. Bookstores cultivate stories while reflecting the interests, passions, and desires of their community. Our mission is to connect Goshen through our shared stories. We will be a place where people can find books they love and find a welcoming community with events, readings, and story times.
Our shared gifts can make this new bookshop thrive. Brad Weirich brought the previous bookstore to Goshen. Veronica helped run and manage that bookstore for several years. Kristin Saner also helped manage for a few years. All three of them bring not only retail but bookstore experience to Fables. Jenny Frech started and manages Soapy Gnome. She brings startup and small business experience to our group. Jeremy Friesen, having helped Jenny start Soapy Gnome, brings his project management, technical, and writing skills. Mark Saner provides technical support, a sounding board, and overall moral support.
You can find out more about us at fablesbooks.com
What We Need & What You Get
We need $90,000 to open our doors. So far we have secured $50,000. We are asking you to help us raise the remaining $40,000. These funds will go towards our start-up costs including, signage,  marketing (materials and online), renovations, supplies, events, and most of all, inventory and merchandise. Some of the new inventory we are excited to offer includes IndieBound Best Sellers, new children’s books, stationery, literary gifts and accessories, and a larger Spanish Language section for both children and adults.
Even if we don’t reach our goal, any funds raised will still go towards our start-up costs. We may have a smaller inventory than originally planned, or need to take on a larger debt, but either way, we’re opening. Plan on enjoying Goshen’s truly independent bookshop late summer 2019! Whether you support at the $10 level or the $10,000 level, each pledge helps ensure the success of this venture. We appreciate each and every person who helps to make Fables a reality.
We are offering 13 different perk levels. Here are 3 examples. To see all the perks be sure to scroll through the sidebar on the right on pc or above on your phone. For a description and list of items included, click on the picture of the perk.

<h3>The Lansing Made Story</h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Lansing Made has connected with individuals, consumers, and businesses. It has been a meandering journey. Our wings have spread. We are ready to soar. It is time for us to flourish! #LoveLansing #2019Dare2<br/><br/>Hello World. I'm Metro Melik. I'm a long-time resident by way of being an Air Force brat. Or as much of a brat as an Eagle Scout can be raised by a retired Air Force officer and a school teacher.</span></p>

<p>I've lived in the Lansing area long enough to have possibly pour your drinks as part of my extensive service industry career. I've performed on stage, in Lansing movies, on local / regional television and host / produce a live 'call-in' talk show for ten years.  It's safe to say, I'm ""FROM"" Lansing.<br/>At some point we've all heard the constant murmur that there was ""nothing to do in Lansing"". Born from my desire and continued effort to change the dialogue, Lansing Made was born. I wanted to create a hub where people can see the places and faces of Metro Lansing. Oh and offer a cool set of homegrown logos to wear as well. Ben Graham, who is outstanding in his field, created the Lansing Made designs.    <a href=""http://www.outstandinginhisfield.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.outstandinginhisfield.com</a><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548123075/ydvhxq5slrdkjpec5phm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Why Metro Lansing. </i></p>
<p>What sets Lansing Made apart from other #LoveLansing entities is that we actively engage in promoting the positive about Metro Lansing. We showcase a cross section quality events, businesses, activities and people that make up our great region.  With your help we can build on that notion.</p>
<p>Let's get a little bit crazy about our region. Think about all the good you've experienced here. I've had countless positive experiences in the Lansing area because of the great things that are in and around Lansing. From community theater, to making music. From exploring cool classic Lansing haunts, to new hot spots. The fact that one can be right downtown and get lost in the woods in a short drive is a fantastic Lansing attribute. I want people inside the tri-county area, as well as the rest of world, to know that <i>Metro Lansing is as cool as I.C.E.</i> being that Lansing touches Ingham, Clinton, and Eaton counties. Lansing is diverse in it's natural resources, business and industry, as well as its people. We are the Capitol region surrounded by award winning schools, colleges, and universities. That is something to be celebrated. Metro Lansing has a great history and we have an even greater future. You can see it happening right now, because <i>Lansing Has Grit</i>. How many places are there that you can have a great dinner, enjoy beautiful scenery, watch a Broadway show, and be home in time for the  11:00 PM news? The world needs to know!<br/><i>Money raised from this campaign will help building bridges between businesses and our community. When you see the Lansing Made logo connected to a Metro Lansing business, you'll know that they are some cool people involved.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548123331/knp3epclixc3ceoffjvq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are a region where people stay, work, and play in different parts yet connected to the middle of it all, Lansing. Our tri-county area is linked in many ways. Simple put, Lansing Made promotes the people and places from Williamston to Grand Ledge, from Saint Johns to Mason and points in between. But Williamston Grand Ledge Saint Johns Mason Lansing &amp; Lansing Township is difficult to get on a sticker. Besides there's Charlotte, Eaton Rapids, Wacousta, Waverly, Delta, East Lansing, Westphalia, Stockbridge, Dansville, Onondaga, Leslie... I digress.<br/><i>Money raised from this campaign will go toward our continued promotional efforts about What's the Haps in Metro Lansing.</i> Check out the Lansing Made YouTube channel to catch the latest videos.

<p><i>Why this campaign is important to me.</i></p>
<p>Metro Lansing has a multitude of positive attributes. We want to share those attributes with you by building a more robust video blog as a resource for information about Metro Lansing. With your continued effort we can show the world just how bad ass Metro Lansing is. I'd like to help push the positive message of what's good around town. From chicken wings at Gregory's Ice &amp; Smoke, to chicken tenders and olive burgers at Olympic Broil, to Old Nation Brewing Co. in Williamston, to more than mint in Saint Johns, to the movie magic ledges in Grand Ledge [and that yummy popcorn at the Sun Theater], to the historic picturesque Mason. <br/><i>Money raised from this campaign will go toward travel expenses in order to connect to new places and create new content to share online.</i></p>

<p>Giving back to our community is important. That's why we are partnering with the Women's Center of Greater Lansing. Working closely with Cindie Alwood, executive director of the Women's Center of Greater Lansing together we raise close to $20,000 through the efforts of Lansing Made. I'm honored to be in the mix of great company.</p>
<p><i>Money raised from this campaign will go toward the promotion of Lansing Made as an entity so that more people will see those that we are helping to uplift.</i></p>

<p>We hope that you feel that this is a wonderful way to show your Metro Lansing pride by supporting an organization that supports you! Lansing Made is going into its fifth year of supporting and promoting events, business and the people of Metro Lansing. We've grown and we need your help to LETEMKNOW!</p>
<p><i>What your contribution will help Lansing Made achieve.</i></p>
<p>My goal for Lansing Made was to start combating the notion that there is nothing to do in Metro Lansing. Charlotte's Frontier Days have been going on for almost fifty years. Mason's Sundried Music Festival is young and it will celebrate its tenth year in 2019. The St. Johns Mint Festival will be celebrating its 35th year. The OhMi Organics Eat Health Eat Local Festival in St. Johns went from 0 to 100 m.p.h. its first year, 2017. Festivals are just the beginning. Food truck rallies, galas supporting area nonprofits, music at different venues dotted throughout the area, museums, parks, and numerous year around recreation activities are abundant.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i>How much funding Lansing Made needs and where it's going.</i> </p>
<p>Thank you for your continued interest / reading.<br/>It's cliche, but every dollar does count. If you help Lansing Made raise $100 on this campaign, that's another month worth of rent. If you raise $400 on this campaign that would mostly cover a year's worth of software expenses. If you put up $1600 in this campaign Lansing Made can get its own editing computer and won't be limited to not only time of use, but it would increase the variety of videos that Lansing Made could produce to promote Metro Lansing. If you support the campaign enough to raise $10,000 Lansing Made could expand our services and outreach.  Lansing Made will be able to build more bridges with businesses as well as promote more activities and entities in the area. Throw another ten grand on top of that and we there would be a Lansing Made website that would rival others in the area. Working together we can percolate <strong>Metro Lansing Mania</strong> in the most positive of ways. Go ahead and visit <a href=""http://www.lansingmade.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.lansingmade.com</a>, then check out <a href=""http://www.discoverkalamazoo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.discoverkalamazoo.com</a>. WOW! Website want indeed.</p>

<p><br/><i>Lansing Made perks. Get excited!</i></p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to hang out with a few superheroes at your own party? The League of Enchantment can fulfill that fantasy. Or maybe you just want to show your love every where you go. You could do that with a Lansing Made window cling or t-shirt. There are perks for the individual, for business person or for a company. If you got five on it I have a perk for you!</p>
<p><i>What happens with the funds if Lansing Made does not reach the entire goal?</i></p>
<p>I stated it before, Every Dollar Counts. That is the reason why I chose flex funding. Every dollar counts is also the reason why I chose the Indiegogo platform. I wanted YOU to have something for your generous contribution to the cause. Other crowd sourcing sites did not offer a give back for your contribution. I didn't feel comfortable with that. The pricing is pretty much the same as if there was a Lansing Made store.<br/> </p>

<p><i>What happens with the funds if Lansing Made DOES reach the entire goal?</i></p>
<p>LANSING MADE WILL THROW A GIANT PARTY or two or three and we can celebrate together. 5/17/2019 is coming up quickly and it will be a weekend celebration of the Lansing Made 517 Day. We have plans to do more community wide celebrations highlighting cool places and faces of Metro Lansing.<br/>The future of Metro Lansing is important to me. It is important to my family. I had love for Lansing before I had a Twitter handle. Way back when # meant number or pound[s].</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Know the difference your contribution will make:</p>
<ul><li>Why this is valuable to the me and to the world.</li></ul>
<p>Lansing Made is about community and collaboration. We have shown that with the numerous entities with whom we collaborated in some fashion. We started by sharing quick videos, to promoting why people Love Lansing, to hosting events. It's been a wild and fun journey. <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548129428/dxygador87boqh67gkke.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I have made a deliberate choice to stay, work, and play in Lansing. I have a family here. My kids will be raised here. I tell them that I am doing all I can to help them to be the best that they can be. I want them to share in my amazing Metro Lansing experiences. I want them to share new experiences and opportunities that will arise because of YOUR collaboration with me as they grow in our town.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>Overcoming hurdles.</li></ul>
<p>Lansing Made is just over four years old. It has a good presence and a wonderful network of people. We are growing and expanding. If things don't progress exuberantly with this Indiegogo campaign I will not abandon what is Lansing Made. I guess we will just have to see how things go. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548128935/xqx1jrdh57vuwxg89jiz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul><li>Challenges.</li></ul>
<p>Lansing Made has overcome many challenges over the years. It has helped that we keep listening to people to see what they are saying about our community. With the help of Paul Brogan of River Town Adventures, we created the first ever 517 area community celebration at the Lansing City Market with the inaugural Lansing Made 517 Day. Wow that was  great day. Forty plus vendors participated. 400 plus people participated. 2019 Lansing Made 517 Day is shaping up to be HUGE. With your support it will be a fantastic celebration of Metro Lansing.</p>

What your contribution will help Lansing Made achieve.
My goal for Lansing Made was to start combating the notion that there is nothing to do in Metro Lansing. Charlotte's Frontier Days have been going on for almost fifty years. Mason's Sundried Music Festival is young and it will celebrate its tenth year in 2019. The St. Johns Mint Festival will be celebrating its 35th year. The OhMi Organics Eat Health Eat Local Festival in St. Johns went from 0 to 100 m.p.h. its first year, 2017. Festivals are just the beginning.

What We Need & What You Get
How much funding Lansing Made needs and where it's going. 
Thank you for your continued interest / reading.It's cliche, but every dollar does count. If you help Lansing Made raise $100 on this campaign, that's another month worth of rent. If you raise $400 on this campaign that would mostly cover a year's worth of software expenses. If you put up $1600 in this campaign Lansing Made can get its own editing computer and won't be limited to not only time of use, but it would increase the variety of videos that Lansing Made could produce to promote Metro Lansing. If you support the campaign enough to raise $10,000 Lansing Made could expand our services and outreach.  Lansing Made will be able to build more bridges with businesses as well as promote more activities and entities in the area. Throw another ten grand on top of that and we there would be a Lansing Made website that would rival others in the area. Working together we can percolate Metro Lansing Mania in the most positive of ways. Go ahead and visit www.lansingmade.com, then check out www.discoverkalamazoo.com. WOW! Website want indeed.

Lansing Made perks. Get excited!
Have you ever wanted to hang out with a few superheroes at your own party? The League of Enchantment can fulfill that fantasy. Or maybe you just want to show your love every where you go. You could do that with a Lansing Made window cling or t-shirt. There are perks for the individual, for business person or for a company. If you got five on it I have a perk for you!
What happens with the funds if Lansing Made does not reach the entire goal?
I stated it before, Every Dollar Counts. That is the reason why I chose flex funding. Every dollar counts is also the reason why I chose the Indiegogo platform. I wanted YOU to have something for your generous contribution to the cause. Other crowd sourcing sites did not offer a give back for your contribution. I didn't feel comfortable with that. The pricing is pretty much the same as if there was a Lansing Made store. 

What happens with the funds if Lansing Made DOES reach the entire goal?
LANSING MADE WILL THROW A GIANT PARTY or two or three and we can celebrate together. 5/17/2019 is coming up quickly and it will be a weekend celebration of the Lansing Made 517 Day. We have plans to do more community wide celebrations highlighting cool places and faces of Metro Lansing.The future of Metro Lansing is important to me. It is important to my family. I had love for Lansing before I had a Twitter handle. Way back when # meant number or pound[s].


The Impact
Know the difference your contribution will make:
Why this is valuable to the me and to the world.
Lansing Made is about community and collaboration. We have shown that with the numerous entities with whom we collaborated in some fashion. We started by sharing quick videos, to promoting why people Love Lansing, to hosting events. It's been a wild and fun journey. 
I have made a deliberate choice to stay, work, and play in Lansing. I have a family here. My kids will be raised here. I tell them that I am doing all I can to help them to be the best that they can be. I want them to share in my amazing Metro Lansing experiences. I want them to share new experiences and opportunities that will arise because of YOUR collaboration with me as they grow in our town.


Risks & Challenges
Overcoming hurdles.
Lansing Made is just over four years old. It has a good presence and a wonderful network of people. We are growing and expanding. If things don't progress exuberantly with this Indiegogo campaign I will not abandon what is Lansing Made. I guess we will just have to see how things go. 

Challenges.
Lansing Made has overcome many challenges over the years. It has helped that we keep listening to people to see what they are saying about our community. With the help of Paul Brogan of River Town Adventures, we created the first ever 517 area community celebration at the Lansing City Market with the inaugural Lansing Made 517 Day. Wow that was  great day. Forty plus vendors participated. 400 plus people participated. 2019 Lansing Made 517 Day is shaping up to be HUGE. With your support it will be a fantastic celebration of Metro Lansing.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary</h3>
<p>The idea started as a little seed planted in my head, after I managed to recover from long lasting severe lung disease by using (besides conventional medicines) a simple but almost forgotten local recipe.</p>
<p>Results, also tested on my relatives and friends and their relatives and friends who had more or less serious health problems, were so inspirational that my idea grew to the level of deep understanding of the recipe and high level of production technique. Finally, my work has been crowned: SPELTEX successfully passed complicated certification procedures (according EU legislative which Montenegro is conducting) and our small family local business Permakultura.me officially got approval for its production and distribution.</p>
<p>I am Aleksandrina. I am electrical engineer and high school computer science teacher. In my little household, in the biggest urban settlement in Montenegro (Podgorica, the capital), I am exploring the possibilities of urban space in the direction of sustainable life that meets both, the needs of the people and the limitations of the nature. My two sons are helping me and are my strongest support. Currently, we are on our way to establish small but very serious family super-food business, based on socially responsible entrepreneurship which meets both: the real diet needs of the population and its financial capacity. And we need help.</p>
<p>SPELTEX is the extract of the young spelt grass and can be considered either as raw functional food or as a food supplement. It is made of local wild cereal: spelt (latin: <i>triticum spelta</i>).  In order to maintain the immune system of the organism during and after highly aggressive conventional therapies, this  high potential product is dominantly consumed by individuals who have been diagnosed with cancer or leukemia.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our small economy, based in 9m2 backyard facility,  has reached a point where production is significantly lower than demand. In order to raise our production we need to reconstruct (ceramic floor, windows, water and electricity supply) and equip (stainless steel five levels shelves, special trays, special lighting, air conditioning and ventilation) existing but currently unsuitable (according to legislative) facility (basement+ground floor, totally 90m2) and to by industrial special slow extractor for fibrous plants, totally <u>at least</u> around 20,000 US$. </p>
<p>By increasing production capacity we could:</p>
<ul style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<li>totally meet  local's demands for SPELTEX,</li>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The impact</h3>
<p>The combination of alternative medicine with conventional, especially by making essential dietary change by using local super foods that correlate with the genetically accepted habits of the local population, has been worldwide shown to be high successful in treating even the most severe diseases.</p>
<p>In the situation where a small country of Montenegro, with only slightly more than half a million inhabitants with a low living standard, registers nearly 2,500 new cases of malignancies each year, an alternative method of preventing and dealing with illnesses by using affordable food supplements is usually the only one possible.</p>

We can guarantee quality and satisfaction for our customers because we hand make just about every component of our dishes ourselves and source our produce as locally as possible. Veg Out donates all food scraps to Wallflower Sanctuary, a local female-run animal sanctuary outside of Fredericton, to minimize food waste and commits to buying package free whenever possible. We strive to produce the best food while leaving the smallest carbon footprint. With our business platform, we involve ourselves with our community by running contests, pumpkin and toy drives, fundraisers, etc.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554131996/k6e6y8navqmngzirdqph.png"" src=""""/></p><p>From the beginning of our journey, our Veg Out vision included a food truck. After a tremendous amount of hard work and several wrenches thrown our direction, we are excited to officially have the Veg Out truck rolling on Freddy streets this May! We will be cooking up some of our classics as well as showcasing some new must-try items. You will find us at breweries, festivals, and markets in and around the Fredericton area. We are ecstatic to see what this summer will have in store for Veg Out, but we first need the funding to make this dream a reality!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553792376/ypkpy0zoenio7x3tykji.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong><u>Setbacks</u></strong></p><p>We are forever grateful for having made it to where we are today, but unfortunately, the journey has not been all sunshine and rainbows. There have been a lot of expensive speed-bumps that have hindered us from reaching our goals on time; approximately $9500 in total. This is the price of an entire new truck! Some of our setbacks included being sold a “lemon” truck in Ontario that broke down on our drive home, forcing us to pay for flights back to Fredericton, shipping costs on the truck and the subsequent repairs. For these reasons and several others, we have decided to reach out for help. We hope to gather funding from wherever possible to reach our goal of $10,000 to cover these costs and invest into our business.</p><p><strong><u>About Pat &amp; Shelby</u></strong></p><p>Veg Out was an idea that came about one day at the regular plant-based community discussion groups that Patrick, 26, and Shelby, 22, regularly attended in their small town of Fredericton, New Brunswick. After being vegan for about a year and becoming increasingly aware of the lack of variety around plant-based options in the city, the two youth entrepreneurs took it upon themselves to solve this dilemma. Veg Out was created to shift the context surrounding the word vegan and introduce vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores a-like to plant-based food that can be equally, if not more, drool-worthy and satisfying than food containing animal products. They decided to begin their journey with a booth at one of the local markets in town, selling vegan versions of street-food classics; such as, Donairs, Shawarmas, Jackfruit “Chicken” Caesar Wraps, Sloppy Masala Joes, and a Breakfast Special Sandwich. Now, two years after their idea, they have gained crucial experience and a following on social media of over 2500 people. The community support to bring their dream to life has been incredible thus far and they are thrilled to watch their following of loyal customers grow on a daily basis; with this being said, their food truck vision is just out of reach and with your funding, they will make it reality.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553792296/z2rpwmktbi2pzjmsoahp.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong><u>How You Can Help</u></strong></p><p>By you backing this campaign, you are doing your part in contributing to a safer, cleaner, and healthier Earth for all beings.

The food truck will be in business from ~May 1<sup>st</sup> to November 1<sup>st </sup>; however, Veg Out will operate year-round as an indoor vendor at the Cultural Market. A list of events lined up thus far include a Science Fair for over 850 people, Vegan Connexion, Happy Hour Club, The Garrison Night Market, , and The Cultural Market to name a few. There are several other events in which we intend to be vendors; including Beer on the Bridge, Down East Brew Fest, The Boyce Farmers’ Market, Harvest Jazz and Blues, Highland Games, and several others. In order to keep our costs low for our first year of business, we will be primarily parked outside of breweries such as Graystone, Grimross, York County Cider, Maybee's, and Trailway (Fredericton is the brewing capital of the Maritimes!). Veg Out will be available to cater weddings and parties in addition to the many events listed above. We have decided to hold off on vending at the majority of local festivals this year to keep our schedule standard and easy to follow while we are still gaining customers and followers through our first year.</p><p><strong>Funding</strong></p><p>All of the funding to date has been out of pocket. We have invested upwards of $30,000 of saved money into our vision and we are thrilled to see the success of our business continue to grow. With our dream so handy, we wouldn’t want to fall short this far into our journey; which is why we are hoping this Indiegogo campaign will gain us the funds needed to achieve our goal.

Our challenge will be to hold our constant traffic when we shift from being open only one day a week, to five or more days a week.</p><p>Veg Out will be in direct competition with other food trucks and food vendors at markets in the area. We, however, will be the only vendor able to ensure a meal completely free of possible cross contamination of meat, dairy, or egg products; a very desirable attribute to vegans. People with dietary restrictions will be welcomed by our menu, finding a plethora of options catering to their specific needs. The best part of all of this? This means our food is edible to everyone, including the biggest meat eater you know.</p><p><strong><u>Featured On</u></strong></p><p>Find our article with Huddle here:</p><p><a href=""https://huddle.today/vegans-lacking-food-options-take-matters-into-their-own-hands-with-veg-out/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://huddle.today/vegans-lacking-food-options-take-matters-into-their-own-hands-with-veg-out/</a></p></div>","""The most delicious vegan donair ever!""- Tashauna  Robar, Facebook followerAbout Veg OutVeg Out is a vegan food service committed to offering delicious versions of the original messy foods people order on the streets, but ethically sourced, environmentally-friendly, and cruelty-free. We can guarantee quality and satisfaction for our customers because we hand make just about every component of our dishes ourselves and source our produce as locally as possible. Veg Out donates all food scraps to Wallflower Sanctuary, a local female-run animal sanctuary outside of Fredericton, to minimize food waste and commits to buying package free whenever possible. We strive to produce the best food while leaving the smallest carbon footprint. With our business platform, we involve ourselves with our community by running contests, pumpkin and toy drives, fundraisers, etc.From the beginning of our journey, our Veg Out vision included a food truck. After a tremendous amount of hard work and several wrenches thrown our direction, we are excited to officially have the Veg Out truck rolling on Freddy streets this May! We will be cooking up some of our classics as well as showcasing some new must-try items. You will find us at breweries, festivals, and markets in and around the Fredericton area. We are ecstatic to see what this summer will have in store for Veg Out, but we first need the funding to make this dream a reality!SetbacksWe are forever grateful for having made it to where we are today, but unfortunately, the journey has not been all sunshine and rainbows. There have been a lot of expensive speed-bumps that have hindered us from reaching our goals on time; approximately $9500 in total. This is the price of an entire new truck! Some of our setbacks included being sold a “lemon” truck in Ontario that broke down on our drive home, forcing us to pay for flights back to Fredericton, shipping costs on the truck and the subsequent repairs. For these reasons and several others, we have decided to reach out for help. We hope to gather funding from wherever possible to reach our goal of $10,000 to cover these costs and invest into our business.About Pat & ShelbyVeg Out was an idea that came about one day at the regular plant-based community discussion groups that Patrick, 26, and Shelby, 22, regularly attended in their small town of Fredericton, New Brunswick.

I started training with the wrestling team in high school so I wouldn't get beat up by upperclassmen at Damien High. I tried it, and hated it. I got crushed at practice and at every tournament. I would ditch practice to avoid the pushups, sit ups, and hard wrestling.</p><p>When the next season started up, I wasn't interested. I didn't want to stay an extra 3 hours after school. I didn't want to get beat up all the time. And I certainly didn't want to sacrifice my time to play World of Warcraft. No way did I want to come back to wrestling.</p><p>However, my Mom forced me to go back to practice. She said ""Once you start something, you don't quit."" She never let me quit anything easily I was apart of the team, even though I sucked, even though I hated it. I didn't have a choice.</p><p>When I went back to practice, to my surprise, I wasn't getting beat  up so bad, I was still getting beat up, but I was also succeeding against new kids who just started. That gave me confidence. It showed me with practice I could get good. After a few practices I realized ""I can do this, and it's a lot of fun to be good at it."" I started training more and more. I went from shy, lazy, and fat. To more outgoing, hard working, and in great shape. I eventually got recognition from Coach Angel and Abad. They were my mentors, and they instilled confidence and drive in me. My Mom and my coaches were my saving grace. I was developing into a confident young man through the sport.</p><p>After High School Wrestling I had to find an outlet for my competitive spirit. I started training MMA at a local gym. I loved watching MMA and the UFC. Somehow I heard that Joe Rogan would be doing a Live podcast on ustream. I had to check it out. I saw the first few episodes with Redban, Duncan Trussell, Joey Diaz, and best of all Eddie Bravo. I looked up all of Eddies Youtube instructional videos and funny videos with Renato Laranja. I was hooked on 10P.</p><p>I spent a few years going to college, traveled a bit, hung out with the wrong crowd, and made a ton of mistakes. I was trying to find myself. I entered a local Jiu Jitsu tournament in Northern California where I was going to school and dominated everyone at the tournament. I knew I was wasting time going to college just to party and wanted to commit myself to getting better at Jiu Jitsu. I knew from watching Joe Rogan that if I dedicated myself and knew the way broadly I could see it in all things. So I packed my bags and moved back to LA to train with Eddie Bravo at 10th Planet HQ. Hopefully by dedicating myself to Jiu Jitsu I could figure out my life.</p><p>My first time at 10th Planet HQ was magical. I got to meet Eddie Bravo, I got to take a class with one of my biggest hero's. I had 5-6 years of grappling experience and I was getting beat by guys with 6 months of 10P training. At my old gym I was the top dog in class, I was feared. At HQ I felt like a beginner, a fish out of water. The level of technique and instruction was levels beyond anything I had ever done at regular martial arts gyms. 10th Planet pushed my mind and body like nothing else. I knew I had to go all in with 10P if I wanted to be the best I could be.</p><p>I dove in head first. I was training at HQ 5 days a week, 3-4 hours a day. I was evolving faster than I ever could have imagined. I was obsessed with improving my own game, and I also loved helping others. During my free time I would introduce Jiu Jitsu to my friends from school.</p><p>I started a Garage Jiu Jitsu Club. It was called Philia Jiu Jitsu. Philia is the greek word for brotherly love or family love. The foundation of the Jiu Jitsu club was to highlight the importance of community and building a family atmosphere. The club was free and open to anyone. Back then I had absolutely no interest in being a gym owner. It looked like a huge headache, and the gym owners I knew were just scraping by. It seemed like a failing business model. I just liked to show people what I know and hopefully they could benefit. I truly enjoyed coaching more than anything. I love teaching people martial arts because it gives them confidence in themselves, it gives them confidence in their ability to practice, dedicate, and improve on whatever they set their minds to. It was fulfilling. </p><p>6 months into garage training, the garage was filling up. We only had 2 car widths of mat space to work with for 15 people. We even prepared for tournaments, and took home some gold. It was madness at times. Oh the glory days of getting taken down right next to a sharp metal corner. I was bringing on a lot of people, and I knew it wasn't sustainable in my garage. My family was tired of me bringing random people over, and so was I. The Club was unsustainable and losing traction.</p><p>The problem was I was making no money. I was taking just 1 class a semester at Citrus College and spent all my free time going to Jiu Jitsu, and had no plan for my future. Don't get me wrong, I was ambitious, I had a lot of ideas, but nothing stuck. I wasn't excited about anything, and I wasn't good at anything other than wrestling and Jiu Jitsu. But I needed money, I was desperate to provide for my family and girlfriend. I hated feeling like a broke loser. That day I applied to every job I could find, Starbucks, McDonalds, Uber, you name it. My garage Jiu Jitsu club was failing, people stopped showing up, and I was on the verge of terminating the program to focus on getting work. As a last resort I called a crossfit gym to see if they would be interested in starting a Jiu Jitsu program. To my surprise I got a call back.</p><p>While most of my garage students died off, I was able to bring over a few into the new crossfit location. Still only 400 sqft of space, but at least in an actual gym. Training at the Crossfit gym was great, but after 3-4  months, once again, we needed to expand. 400 sqft of space just wasn't enough. If we wanted to be a successful 10th Planet we would need a lot more space. So I began looking for other locations to take my small team.</p><p>We took a break for a month to build our current location. The barf colored brown carpet and the hot pink walls were god awful. But with the help of our small Jiu Jitsu family we pulled the carpet, painted the walls, layed down tile, and set up mats. We turned the Jackson Hewitt Tax Service into a functional Jiu Jitsu Gym. </p><p>Since moving into the latest location we have been able to make big impacts on peoples lives. People love being apart of the 10th Planet Covina Family.</p><p>-Megan M</p><p>""I have been training at 10th planet for 7 months now. I have tried other martial art forms and honesty became bored. After attending a trial class at 10th Planet, I fell in love. Over the course of these 7 months, my self-discipline has sky rocketed; my focus and drive are part of my day to day routine. The curriculum is very rigorous, which makes for a fast-paced learning environment. Coaches are thorough and very informed on the intricacies of each move, ensuring quality instruction. Classmates are all very welcoming and supportive. With these coaches and classmates, I am aware of the very supportive community that is always present on and off the mats. I love seeing myself, my classmates, and this local business flourish! If you're thinking of training anywhere, it should definitely be at 10th Planet Covina.""</p><p> </p><p>-Matt L</p><p>""Throughout my experience at 10th Planet Covina, I have been impressed with all of the coaches. They have an exceptional work ethic and are genuinely passionate about what they do. This is definitely an awesome place to workout and learn jujitsu. Whether it's an in-depth wrestling based seminar or an in-gym tournament, there's never a dull moment here. Coach Kuwy and Coach Richard are very creative and mindful. They are going to push you to be better every time you step on the mat. In my case it was two months after a shoulder surgery, both the coaches and students worked with me, and helped me progress mentally and physically. Regardless, of an injury or set back you can still train, learn, and study with the best. If you can do jujitsu you can deal with the instability and the unknowns of life!</p><p>P.S. A very friendly &amp; humble environment filled with tons of talented individuals.""</p><p> </p><p>-Andrew B</p><p>""Hands down the best place to train Jiu jitsu. I've always contemplated starting but I was always afraid. Finally took the leap and tried it and I'll never regret it. From my first class ever to now, every single coach in this gym has treated me like family, like they've known me forever. Everyone who attends is awesome and has nothing but a positive attitude. Literally everyone wants to help you get better. I truly believe there's no better place to train than 10th planet Covina. This place isn't just my gym but it's become my home, with each and every individual who attends being like my family to me. If you're looking to train Jiu jitsu look no further, I promise you won't regret it.""</p><p>These are just a few of many testimonials we wanted to highlight. Check out our Yelp page and see for yourself what kind of impact we are making.</p><p>We've come a long way. But we're not stopping here. I received my brown belt from Eddie Bravo this past August and I've never been more excited to grow as a Martial Artist, a coach, and gym owner. Our goal is to move into the large building next to Yoga and Kaos Records. It's roughly 4000 sqft in total.</p><p>Our challenge is that the new space is raw. It's going to take a lot of work to get it operational. We have to build the bathrooms and showers from scratch as well as buy new mats.</p><p>This is an ambitious goal but I know we have a very supportive family oriented community that can help us with this build, if we all do a small part we might be able to pull this off.</p><p>Here's a few of the many things we will be raising money for</p><p>-Brand new high quality Fuji or Zebra Jiu Jitsu mats</p><p>-Heavy Bags</p><p>-Comfortable showers and clean bathrooms</p><p>-Private training room dedicated for working out and private lessons</p><p>-Traditional Japanese Style Ambiance and Samurai Artwork </p><p>-New Flooring, Ceiling, and walls.</p><p>We are doing everything we can to cut our costs to afford this upgrade. However, it could be a while before we are ready to move. But not if we get some help. Our Goal is to raise at least $10k in the next 3 months. 10k should be just enough for us to get operational. Nothing fancy at first, just a ton more mat space, and showers. Hopefully, we can grow a lot from there and build the gym of our dreams. </p><p>Thank you! We are eternally grateful.</p><p>-Coach Kuwy</p><p>ALSO! We are implementing a reward system to encourage people to donate to our evolution. I know you're not donating so you can get stuff However, we'd like to show you our appreciation and give you some rewards in return for your generosity.  Let us know if you have any other cool reward ideas.

I was hooked on 10P.I spent a few years going to college, traveled a bit, hung out with the wrong crowd, and made a ton of mistakes. I was trying to find myself. I entered a local Jiu Jitsu tournament in Northern California where I was going to school and dominated everyone at the tournament. I knew I was wasting time going to college just to party and wanted to commit myself to getting better at Jiu Jitsu. I knew from watching Joe Rogan that if I dedicated myself and knew the way broadly I could see it in all things. So I packed my bags and moved back to LA to train with Eddie Bravo at 10th Planet HQ. Hopefully by dedicating myself to Jiu Jitsu I could figure out my life.My first time at 10th Planet HQ was magical. I got to meet Eddie Bravo, I got to take a class with one of my biggest hero's. I had 5-6 years of grappling experience and I was getting beat by guys with 6 months of 10P training. At my old gym I was the top dog in class, I was feared. At HQ I felt like a beginner, a fish out of water. The level of technique and instruction was levels beyond anything I had ever done at regular martial arts gyms. 10th Planet pushed my mind and body like nothing else. I knew I had to go all in with 10P if I wanted to be the best I could be.I dove in head first. I was training at HQ 5 days a week, 3-4 hours a day. I was evolving faster than I ever could have imagined. I was obsessed with improving my own game, and I also loved helping others. During my free time I would introduce Jiu Jitsu to my friends from school.I started a Garage Jiu Jitsu Club. It was called Philia Jiu Jitsu. Philia is the greek word for brotherly love or family love. The foundation of the Jiu Jitsu club was to highlight the importance of community and building a family atmosphere. The club was free and open to anyone. Back then I had absolutely no interest in being a gym owner. It looked like a huge headache, and the gym owners I knew were just scraping by. It seemed like a failing business model. I just liked to show people what I know and hopefully they could benefit. I truly enjoyed coaching more than anything. I love teaching people martial arts because it gives them confidence in themselves, it gives them confidence in their ability to practice, dedicate, and improve on whatever they set their minds to. It was fulfilling. 6 months into garage training, the garage was filling up. We only had 2 car widths of mat space to work with for 15 people. We even prepared for tournaments, and took home some gold. It was madness at times. Oh the glory days of getting taken down right next to a sharp metal corner. I was bringing on a lot of people, and I knew it wasn't sustainable in my garage. My family was tired of me bringing random people over, and so was I. The Club was unsustainable and losing traction.The problem was I was making no money. I was taking just 1 class a semester at Citrus College and spent all my free time going to Jiu Jitsu, and had no plan for my future. Don't get me wrong, I was ambitious, I had a lot of ideas, but nothing stuck. I wasn't excited about anything, and I wasn't good at anything other than wrestling and Jiu Jitsu. But I needed money, I was desperate to provide for my family and girlfriend. I hated feeling like a broke loser. That day I applied to every job I could find, Starbucks, McDonalds, Uber, you name it. My garage Jiu Jitsu club was failing, people stopped showing up, and I was on the verge of terminating the program to focus on getting work. As a last resort I called a crossfit gym to see if they would be interested in starting a Jiu Jitsu program. To my surprise I got a call back.While most of my garage students died off, I was able to bring over a few into the new crossfit location. Still only 400 sqft of space, but at least in an actual gym. Training at the Crossfit gym was great, but after 3-4  months, once again, we needed to expand. 400 sqft of space just wasn't enough. If we wanted to be a successful 10th Planet we would need a lot more space. So I began looking for other locations to take my small team.We took a break for a month to build our current location. The barf colored brown carpet and the hot pink walls were god awful. But with the help of our small Jiu Jitsu family we pulled the carpet, painted the walls, layed down tile, and set up mats. We turned the Jackson Hewitt Tax Service into a functional Jiu Jitsu Gym. Since moving into the latest location we have been able to make big impacts on peoples lives. People love being apart of the 10th Planet Covina Family.-Megan M""I have been training at 10th planet for 7 months now. I have tried other martial art forms and honesty became bored. After attending a trial class at 10th Planet, I fell in love. Over the course of these 7 months, my self-discipline has sky rocketed; my focus and drive are part of my day to day routine. The curriculum is very rigorous, which makes for a fast-paced learning environment. Coaches are thorough and very informed on the intricacies of each move, ensuring quality instruction. Classmates are all very welcoming and supportive. With these coaches and classmates, I am aware of the very supportive community that is always present on and off the mats. I love seeing myself, my classmates, and this local business flourish! If you're thinking of training anywhere, it should definitely be at 10th Planet Covina."" -Matt L""Throughout my experience at 10th Planet Covina, I have been impressed with all of the coaches. They have an exceptional work ethic and are genuinely passionate about what they do. This is definitely an awesome place to workout and learn jujitsu. Whether it's an in-depth wrestling based seminar or an in-gym tournament, there's never a dull moment here. Coach Kuwy and Coach Richard are very creative and mindful. They are going to push you to be better every time you step on the mat. In my case it was two months after a shoulder surgery, both the coaches and students worked with me, and helped me progress mentally and physically. Regardless, of an injury or set back you can still train, learn, and study with the best. If you can do jujitsu you can deal with the instability and the unknowns of life!P.S. A very friendly & humble environment filled with tons of talented individuals."" -Andrew B""Hands down the best place to train Jiu jitsu. I've always contemplated starting but I was always afraid. Finally took the leap and tried it and I'll never regret it. From my first class ever to now, every single coach in this gym has treated me like family, like they've known me forever. Everyone who attends is awesome and has nothing but a positive attitude. Literally everyone wants to help you get better. I truly believe there's no better place to train than 10th planet Covina. This place isn't just my gym but it's become my home, with each and every individual who attends being like my family to me. If you're looking to train Jiu jitsu look no further, I promise you won't regret it.""These are just a few of many testimonials we wanted to highlight. Check out our Yelp page and see for yourself what kind of impact we are making.We've come a long way. But we're not stopping here. I received my brown belt from Eddie Bravo this past August and I've never been more excited to grow as a Martial Artist, a coach, and gym owner. Our goal is to move into the large building next to Yoga and Kaos Records. It's roughly 4000 sqft in total.Our challenge is that the new space is raw. It's going to take a lot of work to get it operational. We have to build the bathrooms and showers from scratch as well as buy new mats.This is an ambitious goal but I know we have a very supportive family oriented community that can help us with this build, if we all do a small part we might be able to pull this off.Here's a few of the many things we will be raising money for-Brand new high quality Fuji or Zebra Jiu Jitsu mats-Heavy Bags-Comfortable showers and clean bathrooms-Private training room dedicated for working out and private lessons-Traditional Japanese Style Ambiance and Samurai Artwork -New Flooring, Ceiling, and walls.We are doing everything we can to cut our costs to afford this upgrade. However, it could be a while before we are ready to move. But not if we get some help. Our Goal is to raise at least $10k in the next 3 months. 10k should be just enough for us to get operational. Nothing fancy at first, just a ton more mat space, and showers. Hopefully, we can grow a lot from there and build the gym of our dreams. Thank you! We are eternally grateful.-Coach KuwyALSO! We are implementing a reward system to encourage people to donate to our evolution.

Colleyville’s current recycling program is a reflection of KCB members’ efforts. Additionally, KCB administers Colleyville’s Adopt-A-Street program and participates in the annual city wide Clean Sweep event. KCB would like to expand its efforts to include such things as a community garden and more community events.

A race has lots of expenses, and we expect the Pumpkin Mash Dash at a minimum to cost $4000 at a minimum to put on. This will drain a large portion of our limited funding. With 300-400 runners and their associated registration fees, the Pumpkin Mash Dash is expected to just break even. Since this is the first time KCB has put on such an event there is a great unknown around how many participants there will be and a chance for unplanned expenses. We have teamed with a great race organizer, PlayTri, who has donated their skills and expertise to help us put on the Pumpkin Mash Dash. We have also consulted with other non-profit groups who put on races. We feel prepared, but there still are risks. By raising funds through Indiegogo, these risks can be offset and more of the registration fees can be used by KCB for its efforts.

<p><b>What is
Brothers Ale House?</b></p>
<p>Brothers
Ale House is Guelph’s newest craft beer destination, opening spring 2016 at 15
Wyndham Street North in Guelph’s historic Petrie Building. The facility will
include a fully functioning brewery, bar and retail store. Our aim is to
provide Guelph residents a local source for innovative and North American style
craft beer, along with a unique place to gather and enjoy them. The bar will
have 12 taps which will pour a wide selection of core brands, seasonals,
one-offs, multi-brewery collaborations, and guest taps from some of the best
craft breweries in the province. Our goal is to breathe new life into the
historic structure which has loomed the sky line since the late 1800’s,
and make it a focal point for local activity. We plan to work with as many
local providers as possible to bring a diverse selection of entertainment and
activity into the space. Examples include acoustic bands, open-mic nights,
brewery yoga, community beer events, beer-dinners, beer runs, and tandem bike
races. We will utilize local providers when sourcing ingredients, packaging
design, advertising and merchandise. Guelph has a lot to offer, we want to
showcase that through beer.</p>
<p><b>Where are
we now?</b></p>
<p>Our
brewing equipment has been ordered and renovations have begun. We have spent our
savings, sold some organs, and acquired loans to afford the basics. We are now
seeking assistance to make the interior of the bar area as kick-ass as
possible. We intend on keeping the historic feel of the building and transform
the ground floor back into a space that matches its past…but with a hip brewpub
twist.</p>
<p><b>How can
you help?</b></p>
<p>To start,
you can help us in achieving our pledge goal. Indiegogo works by allowing
supporters to pledge money (in return for tiered prizes) towards our funding
goal. The campaign is timed and pledges are only accepted for the duration of
the campaign. Pledges are accepted and prizes are given regardless of whether
the pledge goal is reached.</p>
<p><b><i>Steps:</i></b></p>
<p>• Select
a reward or enter an amount you wish to donate.</p>
<p>• Enter
your email or log on with your Facebook account.</p>
<p>• Pay by
credit card or Paypal.</p>
<p>• Wait
anxiously for your favorite brewpub to open</p>
<p>• Repeat</p>
<p>It’s that
simple. <br/></p>
<p><b>What are
our plans for the pledge money?</b></p>
<p>All the
funds from this campaign are going to be put towards the construction and
renovation of the bar area. This means the more money pledged, the cooler we
can make the space, and the more you can enjoy it. Below are pictures of the space
now, followed by a 3D rendering of what we want it to look like. Feel free to
share your comments or suggestions in the comment section of the campaign.</p>

<p><b>Who are
we?</b></p>
<p>Brothers
Brewing Company was started by twin brothers, Asa and Colton Proveau, in the
spring of 2014. It is the culmination of a long-term plan they devised in their
senior year of high school to one day open their own microbrewery. To ensure
their success, Asa earned a degree from the Brewmaster and Brewery Management
program at Niagara College and Colton in Business Administration from Brock
University. They gained valuable hands on experience working in some of the top
craft breweries in the province, including Sleeman Breweries Ltd., Muskoka
Brewery, Sawdust City Brewing Company and NC Teaching Brewery. After almost six
years of preparation they decided they had enough experience to launch a
brewery of their own and Brothers Brewing Company became a reality.</p>
<p>While
contract brewing a batch of their beer at the Niagara College Teaching Brewery,
the brothers met Michael Bevan, then a student in the Brewmaster and Brewery Management
Program. Michael had just retired from a 20 year career with RBC
Dominion Securities and was looking for a change of pace<span>. He enrolled in the program to learn about beer-making/
brewery operations and hopefully, in combination with his business experience, join a venture and help bring a small brewery to the next level. After numerous

<b>Why Guelph!?<br/></b><p></p>
<p>While
working as a seasonal relief brewer at Sleeman Breweries Ltd, Asa was
introduced to Guelph and most importantly, the Petrie building. With its
towering, dark, Victorian façade, the building caught Asa’s eye on the first
trip he made downtown. With ideas of opening a brewery in the future, every
cool building seen was sized up for its brewpub or brewery potential. The
Petrie building seemed perfect for Brother's Alehouse. Realizing the size and
cost of the project, the idea remained an unrealistic dream. When learning of
its potential demolition, and joining a petition/Facebook group dedicated to saving the
building, the brothers kept a watchful eye on the building. The day the
building was purchased by the Tyrcathlen Group, a shot-in-the-dark email was
sent that sparked a series of meetings, and a chance was given to turn that
unrealistic dream into a reality. Knowing they would need someone to help them
make the dream of Brother's Ale House a reality, another quick email, a few beers, and
a lot of signed documents later, Michael became the adopted brother. This was the
last piece in an extremely fortunate series of events that has led to Brothers
Ale House coming to downtown Guelph. <br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447299573/ylxofymthbppsxiakp5j.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Brothers Ale House?
Brothers
Ale House is Guelph’s newest craft beer destination, opening spring 2016 at 15
Wyndham Street North in Guelph’s historic Petrie Building. The facility will
include a fully functioning brewery, bar and retail store. Our aim is to
provide Guelph residents a local source for innovative and North American style
craft beer, along with a unique place to gather and enjoy them. The bar will
have 12 taps which will pour a wide selection of core brands, seasonals,
one-offs, multi-brewery collaborations, and guest taps from some of the best
craft breweries in the province. Our goal is to breathe new life into the
historic structure which has loomed the sky line since the late 1800’s,
and make it a focal point for local activity. We plan to work with as many
local providers as possible to bring a diverse selection of entertainment and
activity into the space. Examples include acoustic bands, open-mic nights,
brewery yoga, community beer events, beer-dinners, beer runs, and tandem bike
races. We will utilize local providers when sourcing ingredients, packaging
design, advertising and merchandise. Guelph has a lot to offer, we want to
showcase that through beer.
Where are
we now?
Our
brewing equipment has been ordered and renovations have begun. We have spent our
savings, sold some organs, and acquired loans to afford the basics. We are now
seeking assistance to make the interior of the bar area as kick-ass as
possible. We intend on keeping the historic feel of the building and transform
the ground floor back into a space that matches its past…but with a hip brewpub
twist.
How can
you help?
To start,
you can help us in achieving our pledge goal. Indiegogo works by allowing
supporters to pledge money (in return for tiered prizes) towards our funding
goal. The campaign is timed and pledges are only accepted for the duration of
the campaign. Pledges are accepted and prizes are given regardless of whether
the pledge goal is reached.
Steps:
• Select
a reward or enter an amount you wish to donate.
• Enter
your email or log on with your Facebook account.
• Pay by
credit card or Paypal.
• Wait
anxiously for your favorite brewpub to open
• Repeat
It’s that
simple. 
What are
our plans for the pledge money?
All the
funds from this campaign are going to be put towards the construction and
renovation of the bar area. This means the more money pledged, the cooler we
can make the space, and the more you can enjoy it. Below are pictures of the space
now, followed by a 3D rendering of what we want it to look like. Feel free to
share your comments or suggestions in the comment section of the campaign.


Who are
we?
Brothers
Brewing Company was started by twin brothers, Asa and Colton Proveau, in the
spring of 2014. It is the culmination of a long-term plan they devised in their
senior year of high school to one day open their own microbrewery. To ensure
their success, Asa earned a degree from the Brewmaster and Brewery Management
program at Niagara College and Colton in Business Administration from Brock
University. They gained valuable hands on experience working in some of the top
craft breweries in the province, including Sleeman Breweries Ltd., Muskoka
Brewery, Sawdust City Brewing Company and NC Teaching Brewery. After almost six
years of preparation they decided they had enough experience to launch a
brewery of their own and Brothers Brewing Company became a reality.
While
contract brewing a batch of their beer at the Niagara College Teaching Brewery,
the brothers met Michael Bevan, then a student in the Brewmaster and Brewery Management
Program. Michael had just retired from a 20 year career with RBC
Dominion Securities and was looking for a change of pace. He enrolled in the program to learn about beer-making/
brewery operations and hopefully, in combination with his business experience, join a venture and help bring a small brewery to the next level. After numerous
meetings and discussions the partnership with Asa and Colton was forged.

<p>
        I want to provide a safe and empowering workplace for Autistic individuals where their struggles are accommodated and their strengths are maximized and fully utilized.
    </p>
<h3>Why am I doing it?</h3>
<p align=""center"">
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443551029/tgkfhxasqqu3naolxxrg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
        Autistic individuals face an estimated 80-85% unemployment or underemployment.
        When you consider there are 4,700,000 million Autistic individuals (1 in 68 according to the US Centers for Disease Control), it is clear why there is an estimated yearly cost of $236 billion to U.S. taxpayers (equal to over 35% of the entire U.S. defense budget in 2011).
    </p>
<p>
        But I have a much more personal reason.
        I myself was diagnosed with Asperger’s in 2012, at age 33, after a lifetime of frustrations, questions, and struggles.
        Finally finding answers not only transformed my own life, but also showed me how I can use my experiences to improve the lives of so many others who struggle like I have.
        Among them, I have personally encountered the difficult and sometimes debilitating challenges that Autistic people face in traditional workplaces.
        The reasons are many and vary from individual to individual, but can be broadly categorized as sensory overload, social stigmas, political pressures, and executive dysfunction struggles.
    </p>
<p align=""center"">
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443551051/pvicpqywh6ojsfipqq3p.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
        Yet Autistic people have tremendous capabilities, and many are aptly suited for high-tech careers. Platinum Bay provides successful career opportunities in software technology and engineering.
    </p>
<h3>What is my action plan?</h3>
<p>
        Platinum Bay is a software company founded with the mission to make a large-scale, impactful difference in the Autism community.
        To do that requires whole new ways of thinking about hiring, workplace accommodation, business models, partnerships, and every other facet of our vision.
    </p>
<p>
        For the past fifteen months, I've been working tirelessly with scores of advisors, and I have bootstrapped all efforts with my own time, money, research, networking, and plenty of sweat and tears.
        Our For-Purpose company has been incorporated, the strategy is comprehensive and sustainable, our trademark is registered, and I have personally assembled a dedicated leadership team – all initially volunteering their time and skills as a labor of love and belief in our mission.
    </p>
<p align=""center"">
</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443551207/eh59hyj7l8oxkmpwmtmk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With that mission and my 16 years of experience as a software engineer, I created Platinum Bay Technologies, a first-of-its-kind workplace for Autistic individuals that will support their individual needs and highlight their many strengths. We will do this by providing an environment where our team can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work remotely from home, anywhere in the United States.</li>
<li>Work on a flexible schedule because many Autistics have unconventional body clocks.</li>
<li>Receive full market salaries plus benefits, not a disability wage.</li>
<li>Work in a text-based environment with clear and consistent written direction, enabling us to consider candidates who are non-verbal, as well as account for auditory processing issues and more.</li>
<li>Be supported by Autism-friendly managers and a team that is part of the Autism community and cares deeply about creating successful opportunities for our people.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
        Our Business Model
    </h3>
<p>
        Platinum Bay is also unique in our business model as a first-of-its-kind For-Purpose company designed for maximum impact.
        We have combined for-profit operations to hire top talent and do aggressive sales and marketing, and a non-profit financial model coupled with public, transparent accountability and reporting designed to achieve maximum impact for the Autistic community.
        Our projections estimate that by year five, we will employ 120 Autistic individuals, with 77.9% of gross revenue going to salaries and benefits for Autistic individuals and the Foundation.

<p>
        A portion of net profit is set aside to create and endow the Platinum Bay Foundation, our planned corporate non-operating (grant writing) foundation to help fill the many gaps in the Autism support ecosystem and empower even more Autistic individuals to find their own individual success.

<h3>
        What We Need &amp; What You Get
    </h3>
<p>
        I also struggle with various aspects of my Autism and in order to get this company off the ground, I need to bring on a team with strengths in areas I am not strong in. This campaign is my avenue to raise the necessary money to do just that – provide the support system, through a talented and capable leadership team, this vision needs to reach its potential. The money we raise will also help to cover business expenses including CPA, HR, payroll, legal, and our co-employment relationship.

<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<h4>$150,000 – Software Engineering Skills Training Program</h4>
<p>Our first stretch goal of $150,000 will enable us to start building a skills training program, especially for Autistic individuals, with our potential technical training partners. Our specialized technical skills training program curriculum will be available online, on-demand, with individualized guidance and support from our technical volunteers. While geared towards high school students and older, there will also be some resources for younger folks as well, as it is never too early to begin discovering the fun, challenges, and community that are part of a career in software development.</p>

    </p></div>","What am I doing?

        I want to provide a safe and empowering workplace for Autistic individuals where their struggles are accommodated and their strengths are maximized and fully utilized.
    
Why am I doing it?



        Autistic individuals face an estimated 80-85% unemployment or underemployment.
        When you consider there are 4,700,000 million Autistic individuals (1 in 68 according to the US Centers for Disease Control), it is clear why there is an estimated yearly cost of $236 billion to U.S. taxpayers (equal to over 35% of the entire U.S. defense budget in 2011).
    

        But I have a much more personal reason.
        I myself was diagnosed with Asperger’s in 2012, at age 33, after a lifetime of frustrations, questions, and struggles.
        Finally finding answers not only transformed my own life, but also showed me how I can use my experiences to improve the lives of so many others who struggle like I have.
        Among them, I have personally encountered the difficult and sometimes debilitating challenges that Autistic people face in traditional workplaces.
        The reasons are many and vary from individual to individual, but can be broadly categorized as sensory overload, social stigmas, political pressures, and executive dysfunction struggles.
    



        Yet Autistic people have tremendous capabilities, and many are aptly suited for high-tech careers. Platinum Bay provides successful career opportunities in software technology and engineering.
    
What is my action plan?

        Platinum Bay is a software company founded with the mission to make a large-scale, impactful difference in the Autism community.
        To do that requires whole new ways of thinking about hiring, workplace accommodation, business models, partnerships, and every other facet of our vision.
    

        For the past fifteen months, I've been working tirelessly with scores of advisors, and I have bootstrapped all efforts with my own time, money, research, networking, and plenty of sweat and tears.
        Our For-Purpose company has been incorporated, the strategy is comprehensive and sustainable, our trademark is registered, and I have personally assembled a dedicated leadership team – all initially volunteering their time and skills as a labor of love and belief in our mission.
    


With that mission and my 16 years of experience as a software engineer, I created Platinum Bay Technologies, a first-of-its-kind workplace for Autistic individuals that will support their individual needs and highlight their many strengths. We will do this by providing an environment where our team can:

Work remotely from home, anywhere in the United States.
Work on a flexible schedule because many Autistics have unconventional body clocks.
Receive full market salaries plus benefits, not a disability wage.
Work in a text-based environment with clear and consistent written direction, enabling us to consider candidates who are non-verbal, as well as account for auditory processing issues and more.
Be supported by Autism-friendly managers and a team that is part of the Autism community and cares deeply about creating successful opportunities for our people.


        Our Business Model
    

        Platinum Bay is also unique in our business model as a first-of-its-kind For-Purpose company designed for maximum impact.
        We have combined for-profit operations to hire top talent and do aggressive sales and marketing, and a non-profit financial model coupled with public, transparent accountability and reporting designed to achieve maximum impact for the Autistic community.
        Our projections estimate that by year five, we will employ 120 Autistic individuals, with 77.9% of gross revenue going to salaries and benefits for Autistic individuals and the Foundation.
    



        A portion of net profit is set aside to create and endow the Platinum Bay Foundation, our planned corporate non-operating (grant writing) foundation to help fill the many gaps in the Autism support ecosystem and empower even more Autistic individuals to find their own individual success.
    



        What We Need & What You Get
    

        I also struggle with various aspects of my Autism and in order to get this company off the ground, I need to bring on a team with strengths in areas I am not strong in. This campaign is my avenue to raise the necessary money to do just that – provide the support system, through a talented and capable leadership team, this vision needs to reach its potential. The money we raise will also help to cover business expenses including CPA, HR, payroll, legal, and our co-employment relationship.

I would never finish the painting. My whole life changed and I made a decision then I needed to find my happiness. It took me a couple years and many friends and family would visit and ask, ""When are you going to complete that?!"" In my heart I knew that I would never finish it, that life was over. Two years later I would end my marriage of 15 years and the last thing I did was go into the garage and grab a gallon of paint and wipe that off the wall. </div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So, there I was with a crayon in my hand and memories of shooting pains ran through my hands.

<br/>Silly represented at first myself and very quickly she became many ladies little fan. She is every girl, we all have horns, halo and wings.

I love finding the secrets within myself.<br/>Flip de Bird came about on accident. A wonderful friend asked me if I could draw Silly ""flipping the bird!"" Yikes! Ummmmm....considering her audience I had to come up with a bratty way to show this. So I drew Silly Stiks with a bird flipping around her arm and tada!!!!! Flip de Bird was born.</div><div>

As we've gotten more serious about making things with our goat's milk, mainly cheese, we've been invited to participate in several local farmer's markets - and we've sadly had to decline. In order to sell our fantastic dairy goods, we need a license.</p>
<p>We have invested a lot of time and money in getting together a herd of the very best Nigerian Dwarf dairy goats available. We are incredibly passionate about our goats and the milk they produce. We love making cheeses, caramel, fudge and more.</p>
<p>If we are able to get the things we need to get licensed it would mean we would finally be able to attend local farmer's markets with our products and work on getting them into stores. It would mean we could finally start to realize the possibility of making our farm a full time venture for the whole family.<br/></p>

Since milking is mostly a one man operation at this point, this machine will be essential as we have more goats coming into milk to meet the milk production levels we will need. </p>
<p></p>

<br/>
<p><b>$400</b> - Herd testing. In order to sell RAW milk products, which we are very passionate about, we have to have our entire herd tested by a veterinarian for Tuberculosis and Brucellosis and the results submitted to the state for approval. Just for the vet to come out to the farm is a $100 charge.</p>
<p><b>$400</b> - New milking stand. In order to milk two goats at once with the new machine, we will need a second milk stand. Since our current stand is a very ammature construction, we would love to be able to buy a really nice stand from a friend of ours who hand crafts some amazing milk stands, which will hold up for a very long time. </p>

<p><b>$250</b> - Upgrading the milking area. All of the walls need serious painting so they can be non-porous and withstand being wiped down and sanitized regularly. We will also need to put up plywood sheets in the ceiling to prevent any dust from filtering down from the hay loft.  Non-porous flooring will also have to be installed under the milking area so that it can be properly sanitized as well. All of this is to meet state regulated standards.</p>
<p><b>$300</b> - The rest. This goes towards small equipment like storage containers, milk filters, cheese cultures, utensils, sanitizer, packaging, and all of the other odds and ends that make the magic happen. </p>

<p><b>The Goal</b></p>
<p>If we don't reach out hoped-for goal, the money we do raise will all go towards funding the milk machine, as this is our most critical need. If we happen to go over goal by some miracle, we will put additional funds towards fencing for expanding the goat pastures and building materials for expanding goat housing.  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Getting our dairy licence would be a huge achievement for our small farm, and would allow us to bring our passion for artisan cheeses and other fantastic goat milk products.

<h3>We are Zasaka's founders</h3>
<p>Sunday was born and raised in Zambia. His passion for alleviating poverty, improving the lives of farmers, and gender equity drove him to work for organizations like Heifer International and get his degree in Developmental Studies from Zambia Catholic University.</p>
<p>Carl grew up on a wheat farm in Northern Idaho and farming is in his blood. He has worked with subsistence farmers in several countries around the world, but he now calls Zambia home. At UC Davis he studied International Agricultural Development focused on soil management (how dirty!) and entrepreneurship. </p>

</div><div><i>Big thanks to Josh Hyde, LoFu Productions for our video!</i></div></div>","We are farmers at heart.



Zasaka uses market-based approaches to help farmers create lasting income. We introduce affordable, appropriate technologies and work with farmers to grow and market high-value crops through local entrepreneurs.

In the past year, we have:



Established a crop diversification program with
40 farmers in Zambia’s Eastern Province.

Raised maize yields for these farmers by an estimated 75%

Introduced 5 tested technologies to reduce labor demands and increase farm profitability.



This farmer group has seen 2X increase in income from their
increased yields and access to new crop markets and technologies. Plus, 100% of
these farmers have re-elected to join the program next year!
  

Through Zasaka and our team of lead farmers, this group will grow to reach 800 farmers in just 3 years! Help us reach our next group of 40 amazing farmers and watch us grow! Make a
contribution today. 
   

We are Zasaka's founders
Sunday was born and raised in Zambia. His passion for alleviating poverty, improving the lives of farmers, and gender equity drove him to work for organizations like Heifer International and get his degree in Developmental Studies from Zambia Catholic University.
Carl grew up on a wheat farm in Northern Idaho and farming is in his blood. He has worked with subsistence farmers in several countries around the world, but he now calls Zambia home. At UC Davis he studied International Agricultural Development focused on soil management (how dirty!) and entrepreneurship. 




 
We truly love legumes. We monkey around with maize. We have fun on the farm. Thank you for supporting Zasaka! 
Scaling impact
The new group of 40 farmers we will reach through your support, has 1 lead farmer (we call
them farmer-preneurs), and 1 apprentice. This seed group will grow to reach 800 farmers in just 3 years!
Here’s how it’s done: 





Our partners help by nominating local, entrepreneurial lead farmers to be farmer-preneurs and apprentices. Our trainings help these leaders build the capacity of their community of farmers, and increase their own earnings.


Your funds go to getting the technologies, trainings, and
crops in the hands of these farmers. Check out the details on corn shellers,
cowpea seeds, water pumps, and more, plus the awesome rewards you will get for
supporting our work. The product catalogue is on our website.

    Risks and challenges

Working with rural farmers comes with risks &
challenges. The weather can affect the growing season as well as our team’s
ability to reach every farmer. Prices of and access to seeds and other farming
inputs can fluctuate over time. We work to reduce risk by strategies including:



investing in the training and leadership of our
farmer-preneurs,


creating distribution and training partnerships,


carefully mapping our growth in the region,

promoting crop diversity while including
improved practices for staple crops.

Without these funds, Zasaka will continue to grow, but much more slowly. We create revenue through the new technologies we have introduced in agrodealer shops and the sales of our crops. Our business model is working, and we need your help to grow quickly to serve more farmers.

<p>So what's Rep My Vote about? </p>
<p>Would you hire anyone based on whether you recognize their face, their name,
or where their name falls on a list?  Of course not you'll probably ask
for a resume, references and an interview.  Then you will likely compare
them to others you've interviewed to determine whether they are the best
candidate. </p>
<p>Political parties were built to support voters in this process, but over the
years the sheer number of candidates and the complexity of their work has made
a mess of it all. Rep My Vote (RMV) is being built to fill this critical gap
for you.  WE the people are disengaged, apathetic and just frustrated with
how we are being represented.  Candidates spend more time fundraising (to
be heard), than governing or legislating.  Sound bites and pundits rule
our airwaves.</p>
<p>Well, if you're tired of it; help us do something about it. 
I'm not interested in being a candidate for office, but I am passionate about
getting the most out of our political system.  I've registered voters,
volunteered for campaigns, attended conventions, but those activities only
worked within the system; RMV is seeking a paradigm shift.  Since 1776
we've not really changed the way voters engage in the electoral process. 
Voters hope to hear from candidates; candidates are struggling to access
voters, but until now there’s never been a centralized location for candidates
and voters to meet. </p>
<p>Today, we are 320,000,000 Americans strong; only 725 thousand or 0.25% of us
are elected to an office.  Most of us are at least familiar with our
national or statewide candidates (i.e. POTUS, Congress, Governors), but we are
far less familiar with our local, county and municipal candidates and
representatives.  These are the folks that actually determine your local
tax rates, if your legal suite is substantiated, and whether roads are
repaired.</p>
<p>We need your support to finalize the beta Mobile App which is launching in
time for the 2015 Texas Primaries.  The free app will make it easy for any
voter to access and review their candidates’ resumes and references, to see how
they compare to others, and to save voting preferences.  You can print a
voting card or just save it to your online profile. </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>Here’s what we need:</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul><li>
<p>The total amount needed for start-up is ≈ $700k </p>
<ul>
<li><p>$150k for the mobile app integration</p></li>
<li><p>$150k for general operating expenses</p></li>
<li><p>$400k for staff and contracted workers</p></li>
</ul>
</li></ul>
<p>The amount we’re looking to raise now is $40k.  This will help us finalize the Beta Version
of the mobile app for a limited launch in Texas</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your perks are sure to impress your friends&amp;
neighbors. Additionally, you should note that they will become collector’s
items. Imagine 4 score and 7 years from now, generations of voters will ask
where were you when… and you can show them your pin, tote bag, or framed
t-shirt!  How cool is it that your name will be recorded in the official
records?  Your generous gifts will never be forgotten. </p></li>
<li><p>All funds raise will be applied to the
development </p></li>
</ul>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>The risks associated with building this tool are real and the challenges are
great.  No one has ever created a central repository of voters and
candidates.  </p>
<ol>
<li><p>Security
of information is our highest priority. To ensure the highest level of
protection we ask you for minimal personal info </p></li>
<li><p>The
amount of data required to pull this off is ridiculous.  Which is one big
reason no one else has done it.  Most people have attempted to start at
the national level, but have all failed to get local.  Our approach is to simple
you’ll control the inputs </p></li>
<li><p>Moving
the needle on voter engagement can be like climbing Mt. Everest.  We’re

to vote.  We’ll use this market to fix bugs and fine tune our ground
strategy </p></li>
</ol>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help:</p>
<p>Perhaps you can’t donate now but still want to assist:</p>

<b>I want the PERFECT PLANNER for Moms - DO YOU?</b>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In my career, both during my
studies for the MPhil in Management at <b>University of Cambridge, UK</b> and later as a <b>top-bank Project Finance Manager</b> in leading financial institutions, like <b>HSBC</b>, I’ve been Head of significant economic projects and managed their successful completion. After having my second daughter, though, and being under the pressure of daily tasks, work and family, I was caught up in a daily routine and realized that there was no real fun in scheduling my daily program anymore.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">I knew that by organizing my tasks, I could stay on top of the game and if I could find a tool that could help me schedule exciting things for my daily program I could add that extra sparkle that was missing... so I started looking for a planner.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Most printed planners in the market were <b>simplified</b>. They all lacked functionality and NONE could really help me get myself back. Digital planners, on the other hand, could not even get close. <i><b>Shouldn't there be a planner planner dedicated to moms? One that could help making motherhood more ""fun""? </b></i>One that could transform the not-so-hot sides of being a mom, to brighter, more enjoyable realities?</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The answer was, and still is (if you go out and start looking): <b>NO</b>! No, planners, no agendas, no... nothing dedicated to moms. At least, no serious planners with goal-setting pages, but plenty of simple planners with romantic sketches and colors.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">So, I decided that I had to make my own planner. And <b>this is how EASY LIFE Planner for Moms was born</b>. Through my experience as a mom of two, a business woman and a wife, but also by joining the experience of numerous mothers who worked with me on this project, for more than 18-months, through emails, comments and thoughts, I created the EASY LIFE Planner in such a way that will make every mom <i><b>enjoy her daily ""routine""</b></i> and be able to see the glass <b>“half full”</b> instead of <b>“half empty”</b>. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">EASY LIFE Planner was created, over the past 18-months, by the <b>joined work</b> and cooperation of several talented people, among which are <b>psychologists, pediatricians, experts on diet and nutrition, talented designers and artists</b>.

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Printing colors were chosen carefully</b>, as colors can actually have a psychological and physical impact on us. Light gray and red were chosen as the most suitable ones, for creating a relaxing environment for mothers to keep their notes, and schedules.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I personally, examined many types of papers and binding options and picked those that were more pleasant to write on. I also chose elements, such as an elegant cover in multiple mood-lifting colors and upscale materials that would create a stylish planner. </p>

THEIR DAILY MEMORIES

Monthly Astrological Analysis (First time in a Planner!)""Void of Course"" Moon Phases"" (First time in a Planner!)More than 60 Recipes based on the Mediterranean Diet (First time in a Planner!)

If my campaign is funded above the amount of USD 30,000 all planners printed will be accompanied by a collectible slipcase that will allow you to keep your planner elegantly on your bookshelf forever and cherish your memories.

This version of EASY LIFE Planner is
dedicated to mothers and is designed in such a way to help them enjoy their role as a mom, stay happy, good humored and connected with
their children and family. 
EASY LIFE Planner is a 15-month,
weekly planner unlike ANY planner you’ve ever used before and
is designed in such a way to challenge the scheduling skills of even the most
organized moms. Beautifully organized and colored, it provides daily tools that will assist mothers to organize their daily schedule, keep their children's itinerary in order and have fun in scheduling their day through. 


I want the PERFECT PLANNER for Moms - DO YOU?

In my career, both during my
studies for the MPhil in Management at University of Cambridge, UK and later as a top-bank Project Finance Manager in leading financial institutions, like HSBC, I’ve been Head of significant economic projects and managed their successful completion. After having my second daughter, though, and being under the pressure of daily tasks, work and family, I was caught up in a daily routine and realized that there was no real fun in scheduling my daily program anymore.I knew that by organizing my tasks, I could stay on top of the game and if I could find a tool that could help me schedule exciting things for my daily program I could add that extra sparkle that was missing... so I started looking for a planner.Most printed planners in the market were simplified. They all lacked functionality and NONE could really help me get myself back. Digital planners, on the other hand, could not even get close. Shouldn't there be a planner planner dedicated to moms? One that could help making motherhood more ""fun""? One that could transform the not-so-hot sides of being a mom, to brighter, more enjoyable realities?The answer was, and still is (if you go out and start looking): NO! No, planners, no agendas, no... nothing dedicated to moms. At least, no serious planners with goal-setting pages, but plenty of simple planners with romantic sketches and colors.So, I decided that I had to make my own planner. And this is how EASY LIFE Planner for Moms was born. Through my experience as a mom of two, a business woman and a wife, but also by joining the experience of numerous mothers who worked with me on this project, for more than 18-months, through emails, comments and thoughts, I created the EASY LIFE Planner in such a way that will make every mom enjoy her daily ""routine"" and be able to see the glass “half full” instead of “half empty”.

</p><h2><b>The Growl64 Story<br/></b></h2>
<p>In January 2014 I was given a gift that would change my life.  It was the GrowlTap®, then known as the Tap It Cap®.  This little device meant I no longer had to finish off a growler in a day or two.  If the growler sat for a week after opening, I would still have fresh, carbonated beer.  Suddenly I realized there were no more excuses for not using a growler all the time. </p><p><span>So here I am,
launching an Indiegogo campaign to establish a 64-tap
craft beer tasting room &amp; growler filling station.</span>  We'll have one tap for each ounce in a growler.  My first store on Capitol Hill will source great beers from within 100 miles of Seattle, Washington.  No cans, no bottles, only fresh delicious beer refills.<br/></p><p>It took me most of 2014 to come to the conclusion that this vision wasn't going to happen if I continued
sitting at home after work writing business plans, doing research and wishing I
was selling beer.  I needed to commit, so I stepped away from my project manager role at a local health care organization to start Growl64.<span>  <br/></span></p><p>
</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have been a craft beer drinker since
the 1990’s and bought my first growler from Snoqualmie Brewery back in
2002.  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It has been great to see this amazing
resurgence in the number of Puget Sound breweries and all of the new local beer.  I know I have missed out on a
lot of new beers because when you have a 3-year-old daughter,
brewery tours don’t always make the priority list.  Too often I end up with
whatever the grocery store has available. </span><br/></p><p>
</p><p>I have attempted home brewing several
times but I’m not very good at it.<span>  But I am good at identifying
great beer! 
</span>I have a varied background and each of
these work experiences will be needed for Growl64 to be successful.<span>  My professional experiences and skill set
have come from selling computers &amp; vacuum cleaners, repairing computers, IT
support for fortune 500 companies and project management in the health care
industry.  Across the board, I have found
the most success when I listen and treat all people with respect.  It also helps to drink good beer with them.</span></p><h3><span><br/></span></h3><h3>
</h3><h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li><h4>We need fans like you!<span>  We need people who love craft beer! </span>
</h4></li>
<li><h4><b>We need people who love the
outdoors and the environment!  </b></h4></li>
<li><h4>We need people who want
convenient access to local craft beer!</h4></li>
</ul>
<br/><p><b>We also need help with:</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Construction</b> – think floors, walls, ceiling, plumbing, electrical, bathroom,
tasting bar</li>
<li>
<b>Walk In Cooler &amp; Keg Racks – </b>Keeping 64 or more kegs cold requires a lot of cooler space. 
In order to keep the space as small as possible, we will be using keg racks to
stack the kegs – 2 deep by 2 tall.</li>
<li>
<b>Keg Couplings, Gas Regulators, Tubes, &amp;
Taps –</b> We have to connect 64 kegs to 64 taps and
keep different styles under different pressure.  We are keeping costs down
by avoiding the Glycol coolant system, since the taps will be mounted directly
on the cooler.</li>
<li>
<b>Bar &amp; Tables – </b>I want you to hang out and have samples from our 64 taps as you
make a decision on which craft beer to take home with you. </li>
</ul><h3><br/></h3><h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Everything from <b>Beer For A Year</b> to a <b>pint
glass Brewzy</b>, there are lots of exciting perks being offered in our
campaign. </p>
<p><b>Beer For A Year – It’s a $1,000 contribution and a great value</b></p>

other perks listed on the right.  <br/><br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a contributor, your value comes from
knowing you are supporting the local economy.  Local breweries employ
thousands of local people and the number of breweries keeps
growing.  Beer discovery will be easier for consumers since 64 local
options will always be on tap at our location.  Washington breweries will be able to
expand their customer base, increasing their chances of long term success.</p>
<p>There is also an impact on the long term success of our environment.  According to a 2011 study by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, refillable glass containers can be used over 50
times.  “In general, multiple reuse (refilling) reduces resource
consumption and produces less environmentally harmful greenhouse gas when
compared to one-way containers” (PricewaterhouseCoopers AG WPG, “<a href=""http://www.duh.de/fileadmin/user_upload/download/Projektinformation/Kreislaufwirtschaft/PwC-Study_reading_version.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reuse and Recycling Systems for Selected Beverage Packaging from a
Sustainability Perspective</a>” , June,
2011)</p><p>Additional value comes in knowing that you
and others who are like-minded are ready to join the more sustainable beer
culture.  Here are a few reuse benefits compared to recycling:<br/></p>
<ul>

</div>","The Growl64 Story
In January 2014 I was given a gift that would change my life.  It was the GrowlTap®, then known as the Tap It Cap®.  This little device meant I no longer had to finish off a growler in a day or two.  If the growler sat for a week after opening, I would still have fresh, carbonated beer.  Suddenly I realized there were no more excuses for not using a growler all the time. So here I am,
launching an Indiegogo campaign to establish a 64-tap
craft beer tasting room & growler filling station.  We'll have one tap for each ounce in a growler.  My first store on Capitol Hill will source great beers from within 100 miles of Seattle, Washington.  No cans, no bottles, only fresh delicious beer refills.It took me most of 2014 to come to the conclusion that this vision wasn't going to happen if I continued
sitting at home after work writing business plans, doing research and wishing I
was selling beer.  I needed to commit, so I stepped away from my project manager role at a local health care organization to start Growl64.  
I have been a craft beer drinker since
the 1990’s and bought my first growler from Snoqualmie Brewery back in
2002.  It has been great to see this amazing
resurgence in the number of Puget Sound breweries and all of the new local beer.  I know I have missed out on a
lot of new beers because when you have a 3-year-old daughter,
brewery tours don’t always make the priority list.  Too often I end up with
whatever the grocery store has available. 
I have attempted home brewing several
times but I’m not very good at it.  But I am good at identifying
great beer! 
I have a varied background and each of
these work experiences will be needed for Growl64 to be successful.  My professional experiences and skill set
have come from selling computers & vacuum cleaners, repairing computers, IT
support for fortune 500 companies and project management in the health care
industry.  Across the board, I have found
the most success when I listen and treat all people with respect.  It also helps to drink good beer with them.
What We Need

We need fans like you!  We need people who love craft beer! 

We need people who love the
outdoors and the environment!  
We need people who want
convenient access to local craft beer!

We also need help with:

Construction – think floors, walls, ceiling, plumbing, electrical, bathroom,
tasting bar

Walk In Cooler & Keg Racks – Keeping 64 or more kegs cold requires a lot of cooler space. 
In order to keep the space as small as possible, we will be using keg racks to
stack the kegs – 2 deep by 2 tall.

Keg Couplings, Gas Regulators, Tubes, &
Taps – We have to connect 64 kegs to 64 taps and
keep different styles under different pressure.  We are keeping costs down
by avoiding the Glycol coolant system, since the taps will be mounted directly
on the cooler.

Bar & Tables – I want you to hang out and have samples from our 64 taps as you
make a decision on which craft beer to take home with you. 
What You Get
Everything from Beer For A Year to a pint
glass Brewzy, there are lots of exciting perks being offered in our
campaign. 
Beer For A Year – It’s a $1,000 contribution and a great value

1 fill a week for a year from any of the 64 taps
1 GrowlTap® to
     keep your beer fresher for longer 
2 Growl64
     branded growlers
1 Growl64
     branded cooler bag that fits both of your growlers & a pint glass
     Brewzy®

$1,000 too steep?  Check out all the
other perks listed on the right.  The Impact
As a contributor, your value comes from
knowing you are supporting the local economy.  Local breweries employ
thousands of local people and the number of breweries keeps
growing.  Beer discovery will be easier for consumers since 64 local
options will always be on tap at our location.  Washington breweries will be able to
expand their customer base, increasing their chances of long term success.
There is also an impact on the long term success of our environment.  According to a 2011 study by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, refillable glass containers can be used over 50
times.  “In general, multiple reuse (refilling) reduces resource
consumption and produces less environmentally harmful greenhouse gas when
compared to one-way containers” (PricewaterhouseCoopers AG WPG, “Reuse and Recycling Systems for Selected Beverage Packaging from a
Sustainability Perspective” , June,
2011)Additional value comes in knowing that you
and others who are like-minded are ready to join the more sustainable beer
culture.  Here are a few reuse benefits compared to recycling:

Reuse keeps
     goods and materials out of the waste stream and is more efficient than recycling.  Did you know that the average aluminum can
     contains only 40 percent post-consumer recycled aluminum? (Aluminum Recycling Facts, United States Environmental Protection Agency)
Reuse reduces
     the strain on valuable resources, such as fuel, forests and water
     supplies, and helps safeguard wildlife habitat.

The temple supports all religious and spiritual paths, provides classes, personal counseling, and most importantly supports personal growth and healing.

At the time I met them I was in a not so healthy relationship that was affecting my mental health. I didn’t realize that I was continuing a pattern that I had learned in childhood.

They give of themselves constantly, their time, their home, their food, their generosity, etc. Misty is an ordained reverend and a counselor with over 30 years of experience. She offers counseling all week long. She typically charges only $20 per hour, a fraction of what a therapist would. She will work with you for as long as you work with her, and she has never turned anyone away because they were not able to pay. Scott is an experienced priest and author, and he teaches classes throughout the week. Like Misty, he often works for free. Both of them dream of expanding their efforts and serving the community through education programs for youth and adults, outreach and support programs for the homeless, and pagan spiritual services, but they can't do it with only their own resources. By supporting the Temple, you not only support the health of spiritual people in the community, you also support a very special family, who have sacrificed for years to serve others.

<i><b>Lumos works to help the millions of children in institutions worldwide regain their right to a family.</b></i><br/><br/>

8 million children worldwide are living in institutions because they are poor, disabled or from an ethnic minority. This is a serious problem, on a massive scale, but there is a solution.  Lumos works in partnership with governments, professionals and carers, communities, families and children, to transform outdated systems that drive families apart.  Together with their partners they replace institutions with community based services that provide children with access to health, education and social care tailored to their individual needs.  This supports families to provide the loving care their children need to develop to their full potential and build a positive future for themselves.<br/><br/>

We are proud to report that through the various challenges and hurdles we have faced we are still going strong. Our first Show back in May 2015, aboard the Queen Mary, was an overwhelming Success! <br/><br/>

Our Doctor Who-Dunnit show sold out faster than we ever expected and we were unable to accommodate many more guests who we wished could also attend. Our plan is to produce more shows, more often, at a price you can afford. <br/><br/>

<p><b>  </b></p>
<div><b><b><b>TAKE NOTE Y'ALL:  There are multiple, wood-bowl-related CERTIFICATES to choose from in the ""perk"" section at right...scroll down to find the one you'd like. NOTE THIS TOO:  The price of the bowl, itself, has been reduced...after two initial, related ""perks"" were posted. The initial perks, which cite the original price of the bowl, before reduction, cannot be removed, per Indiegogo rules, as they have been selected by contributors. The $69 and $92 bowl ""perk"" certificates reflect the newly-reduced price of the bowl (price at purchase...when the discount certificate is applied). The $185 perk will still cover 50% (and come with additional items, too), but know that the price of the related bowl has been reduced, also. We cannot edit the ""perk"" to reflect the reduction of the price of the bowl, itself, due to Indiegogo rules. Here's a breakdown to explain the bowl perks and how they work. :)</b></b></b></div>
<p><b><b><b><br/></b></b></b></p>
<div>
<b><b><b></b></b></b><p><b>1st ~ $69 PERK: AFFORDABLE, BUDGET-FRIENDLY WAY TO GET YOUR BOWL CARVED: After this perk is redeemed, the balance of the down payment on the bowl can be paid over time, throughout 2016, at a flexible rate you choose! Read below for balance/details. THIS PERK ALSO INCLUDES ONE SET OF FILMS (2 DVDs): ~</b></p>
<p><b><i>How the $69 Bowl Certificate will Work:  </i>The certificate will act as a ""discount voucher"" of sorts...entitling the holder to a 25% discount on the purchase of the bowl, once it's complete. The discount will be applied to the price of the bowl, which is $275. If you give this certificate as a gift this Christmas, when the recipient redeems it (by emailing us that he/she would like to begin making contributions to complete the bowl down payment) – the bowl will have been formally commissioned. IMPORTANT: <i>With this perk certificate, the holder is eligible to contribute toward the full, bowl down payment throughout 2016, at a frequency and amount preferred (i.e. $25 set each month, likely through automatic PayPal® debit, or flexible...$10 one month, $30 another, skip a month...however preferred). </i>With THIS bowl certificate, the bowl will be added to our ""to-carve"" list once 75% of the bowl's total cost has been paid. We'll ship the bowl once it's been carved/completed, if 100% + shipping has been paid. Bowl price: $275...minus the 25% discount covered by the perk certificate...so $206.25 to be paid over course of 2016, at rate preferred but prior to shipping. Shipping costs are separate and determined by shipping location. </b></p>

<p><b><b><b><br/></b></b></b></p>
<div><b><b><b><b><i>How the $92 Bowl Certificate will Work:  </i>The certificate will act as a ""discount voucher"" of sorts...entitling the holder to a 33.33% discount on the purchase of the bowl, once it's complete. The discount will be applied to the price of the bowl, which is $275. If you give this certificate as a gift this Christmas, when the recipient redeems it (by emailing us that he/she would like to begin making contributions to complete the bowl down payment) – the bowl will have been formally commissioned.

<p><b><b><b><b><br/></b></b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b><b><b>Note: The $95 ""perk"" in the right-hand column cannot be deleted, per Indiegogo rules, as it has been selected by a contributor. However, the new $92 ""perk"" reflects the reduced price of the bowl at purchase and the increased discount percentage (from 25% to 33.33%). If you inadvertently choose the $95 bowl perk, know that the reduced bowl price will be honored for it, as well, as will the increased discount percentage (from 25% to 33.33%).

<b><b><b>3rd: ~ $185 PERK: THIS PERK INCLUDES TWO SETS OF FILMS (4 DVDs) AND SWEET-TREAT CLUB TOO:</b></b>  <i>If you choose the $185 wood bowl certificate as your perk, know that it will also come with two full sets of both of Mama's films (so four DVDs).

</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<p><b>How the $185 Certificate will Work: The certificate will act as a ""discount voucher"" of sorts...entitling the holder to a 50% discount on the purchase of the bowl, once it's complete. <b>Remember, this certificate comes with two sets of both films (four DVDs) and one month in our sweet treat club, too.  </b>If you give this certificate as a gift this Christmas, when the recipient redeems it (by emailing us that he/she would like to begin stage I of the bowl's production) – the bowl will have been formally commissioned. Your bowl will be added to the ""to-carve"" list, and carving will begin in January, 2016. At the time of redemption/commissioning, no additional payment will be required. Once the bowl has been completed, we'll notify the holder, who will have 30 days to complete the purchase (by paying the cost of the bowl, set at $275...minus the 50% discount guaranteed by the perk certificate...so $137.50 for the account balance). Shipping separate and determined by shipping location. </b><br/></p>
<p><b>We'll then sign the bowl with the recipient's name...date, number and ship it. If the holder needs additional time to purchase, we'll notify the next commissioning customer and move the first party's name farther back on the list...making stage II of the purchase more budget convenient. Terms and conditions will apply. How long will it take for your bowl to be completed? It's difficult to say...depends upon the number who would like a bowl. Each will be handmade...no factories for sure! Each will be different and unique, too...wood markings will vary, as will other aspects of the bowls.  It could take up to a year to complete all orders, depending upon the number...possibly somewhat longer? We just can't say for sure. We can say, though, that we believe it will be a gift you will cherish for years...all made from hard woods...likely Maple, like the bowl in this photograph...all made right here in America! </b></p>

TAKE NOTE Y'ALL:  There are multiple, wood-bowl-related CERTIFICATES to choose from in the ""perk"" section at right...scroll down to find the one you'd like. NOTE THIS TOO:  The price of the bowl, itself, has been reduced...after two initial, related ""perks"" were posted. The initial perks, which cite the original price of the bowl, before reduction, cannot be removed, per Indiegogo rules, as they have been selected by contributors.

We cannot edit the ""perk"" to reflect the reduction of the price of the bowl, itself, due to Indiegogo rules. Here's a breakdown to explain the bowl perks and how they work. :)

How the $69 Bowl Certificate will Work:  The certificate will act as a ""discount voucher"" of sorts...entitling the holder to a 25% discount on the purchase of the bowl, once it's complete. The discount will be applied to the price of the bowl, which is $275. If you give this certificate as a gift this Christmas, when the recipient redeems it (by emailing us that he/she would like to begin making contributions to complete the bowl down payment) – the bowl will have been formally commissioned. IMPORTANT: With this perk certificate, the holder is eligible to contribute toward the full, bowl down payment throughout 2016, at a frequency and amount preferred (i.e. $25 set each month, likely through automatic PayPal® debit, or flexible...$10 one month, $30 another, skip a month...however preferred). With THIS bowl certificate, the bowl will be added to our ""to-carve"" list once 75% of the bowl's total cost has been paid. We'll ship the bowl once it's been carved/completed, if 100% + shipping has been paid. Bowl price: $275...minus the 25% discount covered by the perk certificate...so $206.25 to be paid over course of 2016, at rate preferred but prior to shipping. Shipping costs are separate and determined by shipping location. 



2nd ~ $92 PERK: AFFORDABLE, BUDGET-FRIENDLY WAY TO GET YOUR BOWL CARVED: After this perk is redeemed, the balance of the down payment on the bowl can be paid over time, throughout 2016, at a flexible rate you choose!

However, the new $92 ""perk"" reflects the reduced price of the bowl at purchase and the increased discount percentage (from 25% to 33.33%).

How the $185 Certificate will Work: The certificate will act as a ""discount voucher"" of sorts...entitling the holder to a 50% discount on the purchase of the bowl, once it's complete. Remember, this certificate comes with two sets of both films (four DVDs) and one month in our sweet treat club, too.  If you give this certificate as a gift this Christmas, when the recipient redeems it (by emailing us that he/she would like to begin stage I of the bowl's production) – the bowl will have been formally commissioned. Your bowl will be added to the ""to-carve"" list, and carving will begin in January, 2016. At the time of redemption/commissioning, no additional payment will be required. Once the bowl has been completed, we'll notify the holder, who will have 30 days to complete the purchase (by paying the cost of the bowl, set at $275...minus the 50% discount guaranteed by the perk certificate...so $137.50 for the account balance). Shipping separate and determined by shipping location. 
We'll then sign the bowl with the recipient's name...date, number and ship it. If the holder needs additional time to purchase, we'll notify the next commissioning customer and move the first party's name farther back on the list...making stage II of the purchase more budget convenient. Terms and conditions will apply. How long will it take for your bowl to be completed? It's difficult to say...depends upon the number who would like a bowl. Each will be handmade...no factories for sure! Each will be different and unique, too...wood markings will vary, as will other aspects of the bowls.  It could take up to a year to complete all orders, depending upon the number...possibly somewhat longer? We just can't say for sure. We can say, though, that we believe it will be a gift you will cherish for years...all made from hard woods...likely Maple, like the bowl in this photograph...all made right here in America! 


Perk: Certificates Toward an Appalachian-Stitched, Patchwork Bears...Made Especially for You or Your Loved One from Baby Clothes, Blankets, Grandpa's Jeans & Shirts...or Other Clothing Sentimental to You. We Can Provide Fabric Too. We Hope You'll Wrap Up a Certificate as a Christmas or Other Gift This Year! :)






Your ""Mtn. Roots Revival Patchwork Bear"" will be modeled after this bear, which my Granny Gilreath made for me...and other grandchildren, too. We'll make your bear from a special fabric...one we'll create from small blocks of fabrics sentimental to you, which you'll send to us. We'll be stitching your squares together to create a cherished, decorative family heirloom...one perfect to adorn a nursery, out of reach of a child...one ideal to adorn an adult's room, too. Our bears will NOT be child-safe bears for play, y'all; so, please do keep them out of reach of children! We can provide fabrics if you choose, too! :) You can put a pair of overalls on your bear, if you like. Whether you outfit your bear or not, we know you'll treasure it for years to come, as we have always treasured ours. Over time, we hope to put lots of Appalachians to work, stitching bears in their mountain-area homes. 

INCLUDES FILMS and SWEET TREAT TOO:  If you choose the bear certificate perk, know that it will also come with two full sets of both of Mama's films (so four DVDs). Plus, it will include a one-month membership in the ""Mtn. Roots Revival Sweet Treat of the Month Club"".  Included perks will be shipped, separately, as completed. Shipping costs for bears and treats are separate.

Patchwork Bears are a Two-Stage Process: 
How the Certificate Will Work: The certificate will act as a ""discount voucher"" of sorts...entitling the holder to a 50% discount on the purchase of the bear, once it's completed. If you give this certificate as a gift this Christmas, when the recipient redeems it (by emailing us that he/she would like to begin stage I of the bear's production) – then, the bear will have formally been commissioned. Your bear will be added to the ""to-stitch"" list, and we'll start piecing bears by February, 2016.  At the time of redemption/commissioning, no additional payment will be required. Once the bear has been completed, we'll notify the holder, who will have 30 days to complete the purchase (by paying the cost of the bear, set at $195...minus the 50% discount guaranteed by the perk certificate...so $97.50 for the account balance). Shipping is separate and determined by shipping location. 

Online Magazine Content Submissions: 
Once funded, we will obtain legal advice to develop submission guidelines. If you are interested in submitting content for our online, video-based magazine, email us at this address and write ""Submission Info"" in the subject line: MountainRootsRevival.News@gmail.com. If you would like to suggest a video-based feature of someone in your area, who practices the old-ways, way of life, email us and tell us about the individual...even if this individual does not reside in the Southeast. We hope to feature folks throughout the United States. 

* ""Referral Rewards"" – Get Your Bowl for $100!

* Referral Rewards: Get Your Bowl for $100 Total! This program will reward you for others' contributions to our campaign – IF those contributions are generated, directly, via your Indiegogo-tracked referral links. IMPORTANT: In order for contributions generated by your referrals to be tracked by Indiegogo and to count toward this referral reward program, you MUST be logged in to YOUR Indiegogo account and you MUST be using Indiegogo's social media tools to share our campaign with others. Indiegogo's social media tools are located to the left of our campaign film, up top. You will have created an Indiegogo account during the process of making your own contribution to the campaign. If you are logged in to your account, and if you use Indiegogo's tools to share this campaign with friends through Twitter®, Facebook®, email, links, etc., then both you and Mtn. Roots Revival will be able to access Indiegogo's tracking screen and determine the dollar amount of contributions generated through your referrals links. If your Indiegogo tracked referrals motivate $1,000 in contributions for our perks...our bowl certificates, bear certificates, DVDs, etc., then your total bowl purchase price will be reduced to $100. If your Indiegogo-tracked referral contributions to our campaign reach the $1,000 threshold – and you had previously selected the $92 or $95 bowl certificate – which also comes with films, then your bowl will be considered paid in full. We'll even cover your shipping within the continental U.S. If you had selected the $69 bowl certificate and your Indiegogo-tracked referral contributions reach this threshold, your remaining bowl balance will be reduced to $31, plus shipping. If you had previously selected the 50% bowl certificate at $185, and your Indiegogo-tracked referral contributions meet this threshold, then Mtn. Roots Revival will consider your bowl paid in full, as well, and will offer you a second bowl for $100, with an additional set of films at no cost, too. Must be at least 18 years of age and a resident of the United States to participate. Void where prohibited by law.

We got tired of looking for the ""X"" button to skip ads. We have found a better system that is more palatable to both customers and vendors. This system is optimized for apps, small businesses, vendors, and social crowdfunding campaigns.  Quick and easy commercials ideal for mobile platforms.  Get the word out and assist in bringing us to market so we can in turn be an asset to your business.

For anyone who has a small business, Indiegogo, Kickstarter, or startup we can be an optimal place to advertise your business or project. 
Contributions to our campaign are actually a purchase of future services, so consider it a down payment on future marketing when we go full scale which development should start soon as that portion is already funded!  For apps we are another revenue stream that pays out at reasonable rates which is rare in mobile advertising.



The Mobile Advertising Video System (MAD VidS) plays application embedded short videos which are pre-cached and API mesh networked from within all participating applications on a mobile device. MAD VidS is different from traditional marketing technologies as we focus both on the human factors and technology required to create the best marketing experience for vendors and consumers alike. Recent backlash against consumer profiling has rocked marketing campaigns back on their heels. MADVidS does not target based on individuals, but correlates application demographics to provide relevant, genre-specific content in the right way. Our service downloads and manages native content on mobile devices so that content can be played instantly with no loading time. This also allows us to both guarantee and regulate content exposure to keep content fresh.


Get the right message, to the right consumer, at the right time. 




Co-founder Ben Henderson Story of MAD VidS

Our Goal



Our goal is to raise money to get from our prototype development to a fully developed architecture to take to market. UPDATE: The development is getting privately funded so contributions for marketing services!  This system will revamp the mobile ad market to be more accomodating to users and vendors alike. This is about making advertising more palatable to us all and providing apps with a revenue stream that actually makes developers money with the appropriate turnover that vendors desire.


Why contribute to us?

If you are an app owner, developer, IoT developer, Kickstarter, Indiegogo project, or a company that wants to advertise on mobile devices then we are a service you will benefit from. We offer a better venue that will not drive consumers to away. When consumers backlashed against being tracked we changed to app demographics, when asked for less intrusive, we did loading time display, with backlash against popups we do quick videos, and when asked for assured views we did 3-6 second ads so skipping was not an option.


Our Product: Mobile advertising videos (MAD VidS)Short commercials that play while apps are loading, and during other periods of loading/syncing. Below is the over simplied diagram, with meta data tracking and demographics on the back end processes in order to not burden the mobile or IOT device processing. 

MAD Vids enables the display of video, or any data-intensive content, onto any mobile device instantly. We specialize in “Picomercials,” short (3-6 second) videos that can be any size. They can be displayed as a full screen or partial screen advertisement over loading screens or at any point in the user experience with no lag time. This is done by implementing the MAD Vids API with a staging area on the local device that synchronizes with a central web server and associated database. Host devices can be anything from computers, mobile devices such as phones and tablets, to emerging internet of things (IOT)-enabled devices. 

Where MAD VidS Fits in the Market
Current mobile advertising and marketing are mostly pop ups, streaming video ads, RTB processes, and programatic viewing. These are not nearly what customers are used to which are TV commercials. Mobile video is the next TV commercial or mobile ""picomercial"". These do not have to be streamed and are short enough to not have viewers scrambling for the skip or ""X"" button. 

The market is screaming for mobile ads to be done right.




MAD VidS is not going to replace the market, but can be integrated into almost every part of the market.Our Niche
The MAD Vids niche combines the best marketing and ad tech into one full end-to-end solution. MAD Vids fuses the desired consumer interest of short video of Vine size/length for marketing and the best solution for ad tech of implanting the commercials into an in application. We do this through a pre-cached application mesh network that can be implemented on mobile devices while being synced with a robust backend database that pairs vendor content with application demographics to display the right content to the right consumer at the right time. 
What we are offering the world (besides better, more palatable commercials)

- Niche - 3-6 sec ads - more venue and repeatability options (more places that an ad can be placed)


- This is about creating a new genre of marketing through mobile ads that are less intrusive to user 



- Guaranteed 5 views per sync instead of 1 constant or rotating - persistence of marketing for each ad



- Better more in-depth impression per customer, but not overwhelming 



- Less bandwidth for swap out as less rotation



- Mesh network allows for less swap as multiple applying apps allows for more views per customers in multiple venues



- Application-based demographics or device profiling (as opposed to consumer profiling)




- Guaranteed views (unable and no need to skip due to short length)




- 3-5 ads cached with the install of the service. Allows for the mesh network function so ads behind one app can be played from another



- Increasing variety and seamless integration

Sample Custom Picomercials









Risks and challenges
Our most difficult test will be winning the first sales and the challenges that come with commercial integration with a diaspora of applications and advertising content. The gifts offered here allow us to build from an initial base platform. 

We have completed a prototype and will need to round out the final stages of development to make this product commercial ready. Full development is being funded so contributions are for services and architecture support. 

We are looking to integrate into larger corporate structures and supplement current advertising mediums -- not supplant them. 

We have a small team consisting of a software developer, two program management subject matter experts, and a sales/marketing coordinator. MADVids has also engaged with external software developers to help round out the team and complete the product.

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Our biggest risk is not being able to market well enough to reach the public. NERF battle centers are very uncommon and we understand that most people don't even know they  exist. This business has a novelty which will need to be exposed and high awareness will need to raised to get the people interested enough to stop in. We are confident that once they play the first time-they'll be hooked for life. Our business plan for expanding into this store front location allocates funds for a sufficient marketing budget. This will be the primary challenge and focus of our start-up strategy.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>The biggest way you can help is by spreading the word. As we said, ""The love of NERF is all that matters in the end!"" We need you to share the idea and let your soccer mom friend know there a new place she can take the kids for fun; let the football coach know there is a new place they can have the football banquet this year; let the youth pastor know we can take the group for an awesome NERF war on Wednesday nights; let you neighbors know they can take their kids to Battle Zone NERF (and hopefully no more NERF darts will fly over the fence into their yard); bring your kids, bring your kids' friends, bring your kid's friend's cousin from out of town; share the word at your next PTA meeting; tell your mom over your next Saturday morning cup of coffee. Basically help us get the Battle Zone NERF business out there in the wild, and we'll take care of the rest. And if you've read this far...Thank you! Because we know you're a true NERFer at heart!<br/>

There are not many businesses like this in the United States, in Colorado, in Denver, and definitely not in your neighborhood. You can have an impact by getting this location up and running and starting a new craze in the family entertainment and as an early adopter you will be greatly rewarded. Our success will surely result in many more NERF arenas popping up around the country and around the world. And we welcome the competition because the love of NERF and physical activity is all that matters to us in the end!




What We Need & What You GetBattle Zone NERF has cost a considerable amount to get up and running. We need to cover building renovation costs, furnishing, additional equipment purchases, and finishing touches on the 9,000 square foot arena near Wadsworth and Jewell in Lakewood, CO. We need your support to reach our mark and get this exciting business off the ground by pre-purchasing admission tickets and booking your parties now.As an amazing supporter we will offer you perks that will suit any Jr. NERFer, wonderful Mother dearest, World's Coolest Dad, or the best Nana Ever!!!! 




  Risks & ChallengesOur biggest risk is not being able to market well enough to reach the public. NERF battle centers are very uncommon and we understand that most people don't even know they  exist. This business has a novelty which will need to be exposed and high awareness will need to raised to get the people interested enough to stop in. We are confident that once they play the first time-they'll be hooked for life. Our business plan for expanding into this store front location allocates funds for a sufficient marketing budget. This will be the primary challenge and focus of our start-up strategy.
  Other Ways You Can HelpThe biggest way you can help is by spreading the word. As we said, ""The love of NERF is all that matters in the end!"" We need you to share the idea and let your soccer mom friend know there a new place she can take the kids for fun; let the football coach know there is a new place they can have the football banquet this year; let the youth pastor know we can take the group for an awesome NERF war on Wednesday nights; let you neighbors know they can take their kids to Battle Zone NERF (and hopefully no more NERF darts will fly over the fence into their yard); bring your kids, bring your kids' friends, bring your kid's friend's cousin from out of town; share the word at your next PTA meeting; tell your mom over your next Saturday morning cup of coffee. Basically help us get the Battle Zone NERF business out there in the wild, and we'll take care of the rest. And if you've read this far...Thank you! Because we know you're a true NERFer at heart!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

This means that funding for arts organizations such as First Night Evanston is either on hold or may be withdrawn completely. Although ticket sales cover most of our costs after the event is done, a large chunk of our regular funding from state sources such as the Illinois Arts Council and others goes toward advance planning.  Without these crucial funds, we can neither reserve the talent and venues nor market and promote this event.<br/><br/>

<p><b>WHEN DOES IT START?</b></p>
<p>Well it actually started 8 months ago after we sat down
together as a family (via Skype, you know the whole far away from each other
thing).  We decided that we wanted to
pursue a business opportunity together and agreed that it had to be something
in which we could give back.  We’ve been
at it ever since and our official  launch coincides with this crowdfunding campaign
January 31<sup>s</sup> – April 1,
2015.  We still have a lot of work to do
so please keep the faith; becasue we are and we believe in this 100%!  </p>
<p><b><u>FINAL THOUGHTS AND THE FUTURE</u></b></p>
<p>We hope that you understand our vision and business model
that we’ve constructed.  In a year, we
would like to be established firmly in the San Fernando Valley, expanded to the
rest of Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Westside Cities region and starting service
in San Diego County.  Finishing the creation
of our RaptorCow App is also one of our main goals. We want to have deals and
discounts for all categories of business and a service that people can easily
use.  </p>
<p>If you have any questions, suggestions, comments or just
want to say “Hi” please feel free to call or email us at any time.  When we say “US” we mean the Founders - Ted,
Lesa and Lew.  We will ensure that we
personally answer your questions and we appreciate all of your support.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p><p>Ted, Lesa and Lew<br/><em><em><em>The RaptorCow Team</em></em></em></p>

WHEN DOES IT START?
Well it actually started 8 months ago after we sat down
together as a family (via Skype, you know the whole far away from each other
thing).  We decided that we wanted to
pursue a business opportunity together and agreed that it had to be something
in which we could give back.  We’ve been
at it ever since and our official  launch coincides with this crowdfunding campaign
January 31s – April 1,
2015.  We still have a lot of work to do
so please keep the faith; becasue we are and we believe in this 100%!  
FINAL THOUGHTS AND THE FUTURE
We hope that you understand our vision and business model
that we’ve constructed.  In a year, we
would like to be established firmly in the San Fernando Valley, expanded to the
rest of Los Angeles, Hollywood, and Westside Cities region and starting service
in San Diego County.  Finishing the creation
of our RaptorCow App is also one of our main goals. We want to have deals and
discounts for all categories of business and a service that people can easily
use.  
If you have any questions, suggestions, comments or just
want to say “Hi” please feel free to call or email us at any time.  When we say “US” we mean the Founders - Ted,
Lesa and Lew.  We will ensure that we
personally answer your questions and we appreciate all of your support.
Thank you!Ted, Lesa and LewThe RaptorCow Team

</h3> <p>My name is Jeffrey Schoettlin and my Wife's name is Ashlie. We're intensely passionate about helping and volunteering in the realm of Special Needs. We've been serving in the Special Needs Ministry at Calvary Community Church in Westlake Village, California for over three years. During that three year time-period we've noticed a large void in our community and we think our calling is to fill that void.

services to the general public. The shop will also use an Internet based

register the shop with online portals so that potential customers can easily
reach the shop business. The shop will also develop its own website. The shop
will maintain a sizable amount of print and traditional advertising methods
within local markets to promote the vintage merchandise the shop is selling. Additionally,
the shop will maintain extensive online distribution channels that allow the NPO to make divestitures of thrift shop clothing on an online basis, by
producing listings on eBay and Etsy.com. This will allow the shop to maintain
a nationwide distribution channel(s) that allows acquired inventories of the thrift
shop to be immediately sold among people within the United States and abroad.

</div></div>","Community Chest Thrift Shop Summary
 My name is Jeffrey Schoettlin and my Wife's name is Ashlie. We're intensely passionate about helping and volunteering in the realm of Special Needs. We've been serving in the Special Needs Ministry at Calvary Community Church in Westlake Village, California for over three years. During that three year time-period we've noticed a large void in our community and we think our calling is to fill that void. There are several thrift stores in the area and they all serve good causes but... there are no thrift shops that represent or contribute to those impacted by Special Needs. That's a problem!

</div></div>","One Equal Share                                            - A Time Exchange -                                          Are there things on your To Do list that just never seem to get done?  Are there errands or other tasks you wish someone else could take off your plate, or some service you need or would like to try?  Do you 'volunteer' and feel your hard work is taken for granted? Do you have a skill or passion that you would share with others if you had the time?Time Exchange is a powerful tool for tapping into the human resources all around us that often go unseen or unrecognized.  We are all assets. We all have something we can share with another.  One Equal Share is a member-based Time Exchange that gives each of us the opportunity to offer our talents and service to other members for time credit.  Each hour of service = 1 credit.  Credits can be received from one member and used with another. Money only changes hands in an exchange when its for reimbursement of supplies.  And members are always in control of their time and the number of services they participate in.   We connect.  We share.  We help each other.  We create community.  
What kinds of service?  As long as its legal, the possibilities are endless:  
Tech wizard Roger helps Jane with her computer issues.  
Roger uses his credits to get some work done on his car by Al.  Al has been working on cars since he was a kid.  
Al gets some business advice from Bernice, a successful business owner herself.  
Bernice needs a ride to the airport, and for Andrea its on her way.  
Andrea needs some tutoring for her child, and Barbara, a retired teacher, is happy to help.  

Barbara has always loved the idea of going for a hike out at Red Rock, but doesn't know where to go.  Tony hikes every weekend and is happy to be her guide.  

               ...It so it goes...[One of our members sharing his talent as a DJ.]Time Exchange members are from every walk of life: teachers and students, doctors and healthcare workers, handymen, attorneys, plumbers, hair stylists, office workers and more.  Businesses and Non-profits can be members too.  The more the merrier!  More members means more types of services and more opportunities for exchange.  It's old fashioned neighborly service - with a twist.  All exchanges are tracked on our member's only exchange site.  This means we add balance, accountability, and reciprocity to the mix.  Give NowShare with Your Social Media Network
So if exchanges are all for time credit, why do we need this campaign?  Time Exchange is an important and valuable complementary economic system, but we still operate in a traditional world.  To support our current members and to continue to grow our organization we use staff, phones and computer systems, printing, marketing, office space, pay taxes and licensing fees, etc.   We started our Pilot Program in the fall of 2012.  We have been sustained by thousands of hours of hard work from our founder and members, and financially by membership dues, gifts from a few hundred dollars up to $13,000, and in Sept. 2013 we received a grant of $7,500 from Royal Neighbors Nation of Neighbors Program.  We have been building our infrastructure and have systems in place.  We have learned what works and what doesn't, and are just about ready for our next big steps.  We are preparing to take the organization to a larger and more prominent level.  We are seeking a combined total of $10,000 (or more) from our friends, fans, friends of friends, and people who see the importance and value of what we are creating.  Be our bridge to that next step!  All contributions are welcome, but we hope you'll enjoy the perks we're offering at special levels.

One Equal Share is the first Time Exchange in Nevada, but Time Exchange is not new. There are now some 435 time banks across the US, with more than 27,250 members who have exchanged more than 1,314,600 hours of service.  This is a tested system.   Time bank members  across the country

Time banking is changing lives...

Our Member Jodi Ann says:
 ""I have met many wonderful people.  I've gotten help with my household appliances and gotten rides to appointments.  I've had an opportunity to share my talents with people that otherwise wouldn't have known about my service.  I love that everyone's time is of the same value. It helps to create a community of mutual respect! So happy that this concept was introduced to me!""

</div>
<p>Onsite shopping in India for Construction and home improvement always leaves a bad taste at the end of the day because of the confusion that is prevalent. Often times the strain of traveling in dense traffic, milling with people in small dusty lanes under the scorching heat plays havoc on one’s health. It is easy to experience, dehydration, lack of appetite and dust filled lungs after each trip that impedes their productivity at work and the time well spent with family.</p>
<p>Buildwares is an attempt to dramatically change this experience by empowering home buyers with tools to plan their construction/improvement projects from the comfort of their Home/workplace without disrupting their daily schedule. One such tool is Augmented reality, that gives the BW consumer direct product information and help them make better purchasing decisions.</p>
<p>It is our way to contribute to the well being of humanity by easing the buying process.</p>

<h4>A word from the co-founders</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>""NuQarta was born after experimenting

the harsh work of helping our family members and our girlfriends to find their cars. The 
problem was not to find a car, but to find the right car. I realized 
that the real concerned was to find a good vehicle at the right price 
which will not be too expensive to maintain and be fuel efficient. The 
bottom line is that it's the whole process that was really hard for 
people who don't know anything about cars. I'm talking about finding the
 information of the car that fits your needs, then finding the cars at 
the right price, and finally maintain your car at the right places to 
keep your costs low. We're creating a platform where you can get all at the 
same place and contrary to the other website dedicated to car ads and 
sales, our platform will be useful even when you buy your car; finally,  NuQarta is a tool
throughout the driver's life.""             <b><br/></b></p>

reinforces the idea that women are less capable than men when it comes to
buying and selling cars. We're out to change that fallacious idea one “NuQarta”

<h3><b>More about the Project</b></h3>
<p>“It’s
important to treat female car shoppers as your market and not a market segment.
They are as important to your success as the male demographic. They’re
important individually as car buyers, and they are profoundly important in
influencing their partner’s choice of car. According to Forbes, women influence
85% of car-buying decisions and in 2012, they purchased nearly 40% of both
used- and new cars.– This fact
prompted us to dig deeper into a solution.<span> 
This is where we started to envision “NuQarta” and all the possible
features we could bring to people:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Sell
and research vehicle</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Getting
information, tips, advices about the car industry (choosing insurance,
maintain your vehicle, buy[negotiating] a car at dealership, etc.)</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Getting
the best garages, car wash, and other service provider according to the
preferences of the members</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Have
targeted offers to save in their vehicle maintenance cost</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>An
simple and user-friendly platform that gives accurate results</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Getting
ads that fits your field of interest<br/>
</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Our Story


When we are a consumer in a market we don’t fully understand it can seem daunting, foreign and even scary.  Especially when they purchase involves a
large sum of money, safety and maintenance. 
We are talking about the buying, selling and maintaining of a vehicle.  For women and non-car enthusiasts anything
that involves a car can seem impossible and that is why we have created: NuQarta.  NuQarta is a platform that is tailored to
your needs, whether it be buying, selling or maintaining your car.  It will tailor the information based on your
specific needs!






Do you ever think about getting
a new car but don’t even want to start the process?
Do you want to sell your
car online to eliminate high dealership prices but don’t know how?
Are you interested in fixing
that nagging car problem but don’t have the time to do the research?



If you answered, “Yes” to
any of these questions, you may want to keep reading…

A word from the co-founders

""NuQarta was born after experimenting

the harsh work of helping our family members and our girlfriends to find their cars. The 
problem was not to find a car, but to find the right car. I realized 
that the real concerned was to find a good vehicle at the right price 
which will not be too expensive to maintain and be fuel efficient. The 
bottom line is that it's the whole process that was really hard for 
people who don't know anything about cars. I'm talking about finding the
 information of the car that fits your needs, then finding the cars at 
the right price, and finally maintain your car at the right places to 
keep your costs low. We're creating a platform where you can get all at the 
same place and contrary to the other website dedicated to car ads and 
sales, our platform will be useful even when you buy your car; finally,  NuQarta is a tool
throughout the driver's life.""             
                                                                    Edson Aristil & Benz W. Figaro
                        


Overview

""Our popular culture
reinforces the idea that women are less capable than men when it comes to
buying and selling cars. We're out to change that fallacious idea one “NuQarta”
account at a time! Help us establish a platform to serve people in need of
information. The information delivered by “NuQarta” to an individual can
change their ideas about what
they can accomplish for the rest of his or her life when they are informed
and knowledgeable on their car purchases. 
Finding out your OUTCOME with ease will be life changing. Empower us
to make this vision a reality with a donation to this project today!""


More about the Project
“It’s
important to treat female car shoppers as your market and not a market segment.
They are as important to your success as the male demographic. They’re
important individually as car buyers, and they are profoundly important in
influencing their partner’s choice of car. According to Forbes, women influence
85% of car-buying decisions and in 2012, they purchased nearly 40% of both
used- and new cars.– This fact
prompted us to dig deeper into a solution. 
This is where we started to envision “NuQarta” and all the possible
features we could bring to people:


Sell
and research vehicle

Getting
information, tips, advices about the car industry (choosing insurance,
maintain your vehicle, buy[negotiating] a car at dealership, etc.)

Getting
the best garages, car wash, and other service provider according to the
preferences of the members

Have
targeted offers to save in their vehicle maintenance cost

An
simple and user-friendly platform that gives accurate results

Getting
ads that fits your field of interest


""With NuQarta your results will be completely adapted to your profile (field of interest, needs, location, etc.).... Imagine, getting results (ads, car search, information, car service providers) based on your needs only!""



It's the perfect tool for both users and businesses!
When reviewing these benefits and much more, it
inspired and assured us that this is a business that needs to be created. We
feel these features will make us incredibly qualified to succeed.  This paired with attention to detail and
quality service will make us the leader in the industry. Our mission is to take
care of every customer and member with the upmost respect and care.  We feel this will be the key to our members AND customers
retention.""NuQarta distinguishes itself by the variety of
the services it offers. On top of helping you find and sell cars easily, our
team educates the users. We offer driving courses, all year long, and car care
clinics for women. Those clinics provide a basic knowledge of simple mechanics
to drivers in order to widen their skills which make them more resourceful if
ever a problem occurs.""                                                                                         Marie Laurence Paquin




NuQarBox

The NuQarBox is an access to all the savings for your car maintenance costs. People spends an average of 1000$ per year to maintain their car:



You don't know where to go in order to save?






Stop searching! NuQarta comes up with the NuQarBox solution where all your car related business is offering deals that will makes you save up to 70%. Stop being bombarded every single day with deals... And on top of that with deals that don't even in your interest fields. And finally Stop getting played by the industry and start getting more for what you pay.

Saving with the NuQarBox is simple as 1...2...3...

the Project</b></p>
<p>Researchers at San Diego
State University found that the film of soap scum that develops on vinyl shower
curtains and shower floors can play host to a number of germs, including
Methylobacterium, a group of bacteria that can cause infections. To reduce
germs on soap bottles, it is best to keep them in a separate container and wash
regularly to remove soap scum; stubborn residue might need a more abrasive
scrubbing sponge and an antibacterial cleaner. Therefore there is no doubt
there is a need for the shower caddy and it is a great product but it doesn't

With
big dreams and a small budget, often times a collaborative effort is
necessary.  An environment where everyone
pulls together their resources to make something possible is the best way to
make your dreams come true.  It just so
happens Shower Caddy Stopper is the next best product that is a simple solution
to a nagging problem and by buying right here on the Indiegogo site, you will help us make the “Shower Caddy Stopper” a household
name.Overview
""Our
popular culture reinforces the idea that shower caddies are necessary to keep
containers off the floor, but they are without a doubt flawed and frustrating.  Then you add in the elements of a shower or
bath: humidity, water, crying kids, slippery soap, and you have the recipe for
disaster.  Well, we're out to change this
situation one Shower Caddy Stopper at a time! Help us establish a product to
serve showering people in need everywhere. As little as $6 gets a Shower
Caddy Stopper to an individual and can change the way they start and finish
their day, everyday.  Finding out your shower
caddy can stay in place with ease
will be life changing. Empower us to make this vision a reality with a
donation to this project today!""More about
the Project
Researchers at San Diego
State University found that the film of soap scum that develops on vinyl shower
curtains and shower floors can play host to a number of germs, including
Methylobacterium, a group of bacteria that can cause infections. To reduce
germs on soap bottles, it is best to keep them in a separate container and wash
regularly to remove soap scum; stubborn residue might need a more abrasive
scrubbing sponge and an antibacterial cleaner. Therefore there is no doubt
there is a need for the shower caddy and it is a great product but it doesn't
stand a chance against the slippery slope of your shower head. – This fact prompted us to dig deeper
into a solution.  This is where we
started to envision the Shower Caddy Stopper and all the possible benefits we could
bring to people.
When reviewing these
benefits and much more, it inspired and assured us that this is a business that
needs to be created. We feel these features will make us incredibly qualified
to succeed.  This paired with attention
to detail and quality service will make us the leader in the industry. Our
mission is to take care of every customer and staff member with the utmost
respect and care.  We feel this will be
the key to our customer AND staff retention.About Us

<p> Omari is 35 years and lives in the village of Mida in Kilifi County,
Kenya. He is a happy user of Marathoner Beacon Solar lamps. He has used a
kerosene lamp to light up his home for as long as he can remember. Now a father
of four children, Omar first heard about the Marathoner Beacon solar lamps in
October 2014 when his wife returned from a community meeting where someone had
come to educate women on income generating activities they can engage in. When
Omari heard the news, he first thought of how he needed the lamp to provide
adequate lighting for his children as they did their homework in the evening. Omari later caled the  lady who came to educate the women wanting to learn
more about the solar lamps. After seeing the features of the lamp, and getting additional information from someone he knew, he bought it.  Since then, his children no longer use the dim kerosene lamps that used to affect their eyes and produced fumes that hurt their lungs.   For Omari he no longer requires the services of a mobile phone
charging agent at the market.  He is even
using the lamp to light up his chicken house.</p>

<h4>Our story</h4>
<div>We are a bunch of entrepreneurs who are passionate about technology and photography.</div>
<div>Our story dates back a couple of years ago, when our CEO, Ernesto, went on a trip to Cusco with some friends. The trip was great and when back at home, Ernesto wanted to organize his pictures together with those of his friends to create a super album of the trip. However, contacting his friends and getting all the pictures everyone has taken to group them and organize them was really complicated and took very long time. He, then, looked for some software to simplify the process but never found any so he had to do it manually. The fact that he realized this was a problem millions of people faced ended up in the birth of the idea of Socialpicz.</div>
<div>This is SocialPicz, a way to preserve, organize and share automatically our most important moments through a collective creation process. We won't need to create albums mannually any more. Through this innovation, we just have to take the pictures since the App organizes everything for us in terms of events (parties, birthdays, concerts, trips, conferences, and every single kind of event).</div>
<div>We started this adventure last year and in order to finally make it happen and launch this global solution which will benefit millions of people in the world, we need your support.</div><div>

everybody!  My name is Pres, the Managing Maker of DeJunk Genies – an
artist collective celebrating makers of decorative creations while also
promoting and educating on the concept of economic freedom through pop-up  events. DeJunk Genies artisans take used furniture and artifacts and remake them to give fresh life, currently offering up those creations at a storefront bazaar.  As we enter into a new phase with this collective, we have a <i>fresh</i>, innovative vision--<i>going mobile</i>.  That is why we are launching our new campaign for a vintage RV, so that DeJunk Genies can be on the move! What we call, ""Living the <b>Pop Life </b>""! </p><p>We’re calling the RV, <b>Pop Life</b>, inspired by the work and passing of the late, great, Prince--""His Royal Badness""--who has been an inspiration in my own life and work. We also call it Pop Life to reference the pop-ups we've held and future ones planned--maybe even one near you!<br/></p><p>Developing as a nonprofit with limited resources, it is difficult for any organization in it's early stages to sustain the overhead of a storefront.  Going mobile will not only keep operational costs far lower, but will give us more freedom to take our work to the people; will afford us to serve a much wider area, and most of all, will pave a way for our sustainability.  With DeJunk Genies On The Move, we can bring the bazaars and promotions to various sections of town.</p><p>
A little about me….I’ve always had a love affair with the arts. From a thespian
in high school, creative <span>costuming,  to performing in productions, writing poetry, building sets, and working for not for profits where art was a central part of the development
project. Recently, I admitted my love for remaking--being constantly
fascinated with tossed things remade by artisans.  Then a couple of years ago, I
went to an estate sale of the Hurt Mansion and left with a butt load of discarded and used materials. It was there, the journey of Dejunk Genies truly began!</span></p>
<p>Since
then, the artist collective developed and has continued to grow while meeting challenges

<p>Classic Car Gaming gives classic car enthusiasts, and online gamers the ability to place fantasy bets on the outcomes of classic car auction sales, without the controversy of ""Daily Fantasy Sports"". Classic Car Gaming provides all the same luxuries as a fantasy sports website, like joining leagues, multiple betting options, and tournaments.</p>
<p>For the past 3 years our team has been working out of a small office room, in the front of a classic car restoration garage in Santa Ana, CA that is fully equipped with no air conditioning, and the smell of differential oil.  We've been hard at work developing a database from the blood, sweat, and gears of the industry, just to bring online fantasy gamers something special. This innovative website is now in the very last stage of development, and seeks Indiegogo crowd funding to finish. The main goals of this venture are to bring people something fresh and exciting to have fun with, to create jobs and to inspire young entrepreneurs.</p>

<p><strong>PLACING BETS</strong><br/>Members can place over 30 different kinds of bets on thousands of vehicles from auctions around the world.</p>
<p><strong>SOCIAL</strong><br/>Chat with friends or with other members following an auction. Chat groups also exist for people with common interests. Custom profile pages will also show member photo galleries and interests.</p>
<p><strong>LEAGUES</strong><br/>Starting or joining an existing league is the ultimate classic car competition! Go head-to-head and show who has the ultimate knowledge and skill.</p>
<p>The two kinds of leagues (Draft and Performance) give you two completely different ways to play, both with a champion crowned at the end of the season. Season length is determined by the managing member, and could be a day, a week, 2 months, or even a year.</p>

<p>This idea came to fruition over 3 years ago, and along the way we have encountered many obstacles - one of which is finding sufficient funding to keep the project moving forward. Since the beginning we have always found a way, and now we’re asking for your assistance to help us reach the finish line. Indiegogo is the perfect opportunity! We feel the best people to fund a project are those who believe in the idea, and want to see it become reality.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign is an exciting milestone, as it’s the first time this new gaming concept is being shown to the world. Combining classic cars and fantasy gaming into a social, exciting website is something we are all passionate about, and we look forward to sharing this new experience with all of you.</p>
<p>Join us, and we’ll bring classic cars and fantasy gaming to a whole new level.</p>

<p>Mark Boice and Phil Shuyler have always loved cars. They’ve worked in the automotive industry for years, both with new cars as well as classics. One day Mark found out about a group of people that made wagers on what classic cars would sell for at auctions. This got him thinking…what if something like this could be accessible for everyone to play? Mark and Phil quickly joined forces, and brought on Joseph Vournazos. After extensive research and dedication, Classic Car Gaming was born. </p>

</div></div>","Classic Car Gaming gives classic car enthusiasts, and online gamers the ability to place fantasy bets on the outcomes of classic car auction sales, without the controversy of ""Daily Fantasy Sports"". Classic Car Gaming provides all the same luxuries as a fantasy sports website, like joining leagues, multiple betting options, and tournaments.
For the past 3 years our team has been working out of a small office room, in the front of a classic car restoration garage in Santa Ana, CA that is fully equipped with no air conditioning, and the smell of differential oil.  We've been hard at work developing a database from the blood, sweat, and gears of the industry, just to bring online fantasy gamers something special. This innovative website is now in the very last stage of development, and seeks Indiegogo crowd funding to finish. The main goals of this venture are to bring people something fresh and exciting to have fun with, to create jobs and to inspire young entrepreneurs.


PLACING BETSMembers can place over 30 different kinds of bets on thousands of vehicles from auctions around the world.
SOCIALChat with friends or with other members following an auction. Chat groups also exist for people with common interests. Custom profile pages will also show member photo galleries and interests.
LEAGUESStarting or joining an existing league is the ultimate classic car competition! Go head-to-head and show who has the ultimate knowledge and skill.
The two kinds of leagues (Draft and Performance) give you two completely different ways to play, both with a champion crowned at the end of the season. Season length is determined by the managing member, and could be a day, a week, 2 months, or even a year.



The money raised will go towards finishing development of ClassicCarGaming.com, the advancements in our user interface to make sure our players are having the best experience possible, and towards the development of our mobile app.
Once the website launches, anyone will be able to sign-up for free and play with Free Coins, which are given to members each day they login. Our backers will receive packages with a range of different rewards including: 

Fantasy Dollars that extend game play, and allow you to join fantasy leagues and be entered to win additional prizes.
Free Elite Player Membership status that allows you to purchase Fantasy Dollars at a discount, and qualifies you to enter special tournaments. 
Classic Car Gaming t-shirt.




This idea came to fruition over 3 years ago, and along the way we have encountered many obstacles - one of which is finding sufficient funding to keep the project moving forward. Since the beginning we have always found a way, and now we’re asking for your assistance to help us reach the finish line. Indiegogo is the perfect opportunity! We feel the best people to fund a project are those who believe in the idea, and want to see it become reality.
This Indiegogo campaign is an exciting milestone, as it’s the first time this new gaming concept is being shown to the world. Combining classic cars and fantasy gaming into a social, exciting website is something we are all passionate about, and we look forward to sharing this new experience with all of you.
Join us, and we’ll bring classic cars and fantasy gaming to a whole new level.


Before bets are placed, members will have access to a database containing thousands of past vehicle sales.

CLASSIC CAR ENTHUSIASTSThis is the ultimate game for those who live and breathe classic cars. Test your knowledge, follow the auctions, and join in the excitement that is Classic Car Gaming.
FANTASY SPORTS FANSIf you love fantasy sports, and have an interest in cars, you’re going to do backflips over Classic Car Gaming.
SOCIAL GAMERSFor those who enjoy playing games online, Classic Car Gaming brings a new gaming experience to the masses.
CLASSIC CAR CLUBSCreate a team building event or just compete for bragging rights within your car club.
 

Mark Boice and Phil Shuyler have always loved cars. They’ve worked in the automotive industry for years, both with new cars as well as classics. One day Mark found out about a group of people that made wagers on what classic cars would sell for at auctions. This got him thinking…what if something like this could be accessible for everyone to play? Mark and Phil quickly joined forces, and brought on Joseph Vournazos. After extensive research and dedication, Classic Car Gaming was born. 



Development TimelineOur exact timeline for development will depend on the amount of support we receive, and the speed of our developers. We are working every day on the site, and we will continue this schedule once funded. 
With more funding, we will hire additional developers to speed up the path to completion. The exact timeline is unknown, however we are adamant on getting the site live as quickly as possible.
Vehicle AccuracyThe information we receive for the vehicles we feature on the site is provided by the vehicle owners and the auctions. Some of the information provided may have some inaccuracies, however we will always try to catch any discrepancies that may exist.

</p><p><b>Our Mission</b></p>
<p>Second Chances is committed to
providing those with convictions resources to establish structure for optimal
community outcomes upon reentry. Our services will support those in need with
employment placement &amp; growth opportunities with prudent supervision to
establish consistency, and empowerment in order to finalize the reform
intended. </p>
<p><b>Why is this needed, &amp; who does
this help?</b></p>
<p>The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
is a federal legislation across the United States that promotes accuracy,
fairness and privacy for data used by consumer reporting agencies, and
employment background checks. KY is known as a lifelong state. This means that
though a conviction may be 10, 20, 30+ years old without further incidence, a
resident of the state can still be denied employment, though this is one of
many prudent conditions of probation &amp; parole means not reoffending or technical violation.</p>
<p>The intent of FCRA is fairness in
background checks, further supported by EEOC. However, FCRA laws can vary from
one state to the next dramatically. For this reason, 2<sup>nd</sup> chances is
working to aid where deficiencies continue to hurt the state of KY in its
advancement; greatly in part because the act is not used as a tool of fairness,
fraught with stigma and lack of general knowledge around the varying conviction
classifications and associated crimes. </p>
<p>Many states no longer allow lifelong
checks such as this, addtionally further support the intent of reform by allowing the
consideration of low level felony expungement for nonviolent, non abusive crimes
for eligibility of expungment; with review &amp; sign off by the court. Those
states have adopted this approach with the understanding not all felonies are
created alike, and are classified by severity, in the case of KY Class A-D.</p>
<p>Those states in which checks are
restricted to 7 or 10 years, or allow consideration for expungment have
subsequently reduced serious deficits &amp; inefficiencies costing tax payers &amp; members of the community. This has been
additionally successful in aiding those with convictions to truly
aspire toward reformed, productive lives which is the intent. Reformed
citizens regain a sense of pride and empowerment, supporting their
families, and are significantly lower risk to recidivism, public aid, and cycle through generations. </p>
<p>Lowered recidivism decreases prison
overcrowding, further risk to inmates &amp; prison staff; lowered state 
costs,
increased state revenue, application of academic &amp; trade skills 
supported
while incarcerated toward a career upon release in a community that 
understands this, all while fulfilling the need of employers in the
community. Organizations also benefit from the Work Opportunity Tax
Credit per person employed, &amp; acting socially responsible for the

<br/></div>","Our Mission
Second Chances is committed to
providing those with convictions resources to establish structure for optimal
community outcomes upon reentry. Our services will support those in need with
employment placement & growth opportunities with prudent supervision to
establish consistency, and empowerment in order to finalize the reform
intended. 
Why is this needed, & who does
this help?
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
is a federal legislation across the United States that promotes accuracy,
fairness and privacy for data used by consumer reporting agencies, and
employment background checks. KY is known as a lifelong state. This means that
though a conviction may be 10, 20, 30+ years old without further incidence, a
resident of the state can still be denied employment, though this is one of
many prudent conditions of probation & parole means not reoffending or technical violation.
The intent of FCRA is fairness in
background checks, further supported by EEOC. However, FCRA laws can vary from
one state to the next dramatically. For this reason, 2nd chances is
working to aid where deficiencies continue to hurt the state of KY in its
advancement; greatly in part because the act is not used as a tool of fairness,
fraught with stigma and lack of general knowledge around the varying conviction
classifications and associated crimes. 
Many states no longer allow lifelong
checks such as this, addtionally further support the intent of reform by allowing the
consideration of low level felony expungement for nonviolent, non abusive crimes
for eligibility of expungment; with review & sign off by the court. Those
states have adopted this approach with the understanding not all felonies are
created alike, and are classified by severity, in the case of KY Class A-D.
Those states in which checks are
restricted to 7 or 10 years, or allow consideration for expungment have
subsequently reduced serious deficits & inefficiencies costing tax payers & members of the community. This has been
additionally successful in aiding those with convictions to truly
aspire toward reformed, productive lives which is the intent. Reformed
citizens regain a sense of pride and empowerment, supporting their
families, and are significantly lower risk to recidivism, public aid, and cycle through generations. 
Lowered recidivism decreases prison
overcrowding, further risk to inmates & prison staff; lowered state 
costs,
increased state revenue, application of academic & trade skills 
supported
while incarcerated toward a career upon release in a community that 
understands this, all while fulfilling the need of employers in the
community. Organizations also benefit from the Work Opportunity Tax
Credit per person employed, & acting socially responsible for the
betterment of the community. 
How are we going to get there?

about Aus $ 200 worth (about 8,000 rupees) of their work but more so because I
wanted them to earn some money from me. Of course, I used some of them but they

<p>Tampon Tribe is a monthly subscription for delivered organic cotton tampons and pads that are toxin free, plastic free, completely compostable, and that give back.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474525515/qfqi1zaoifq0zcw2mwpw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHY WE DO THE THINGS WE DO</h2>
<p>Our mission is to provide super easy access to affordable organic tampons and pads to all women. Everything about our product is focused on sustainability. Even our applicators are compostable and our packaging is made from recycled materials – no plastic. Period. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478120819/r5d2ejzbxn1uglymlt93.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">THE SKINNY</h2>
<p>What's in your tampons and pads? Here's what's in ours..</p>
<p><strong>1.    Certified Organic, GOTS, ICEA.</strong> Our cotton is grown with extreme care and to international certified organic standards, which means everything from the soil, to water use, and of course chemicals, is strictly monitored and regulated. It also means that all stages of production are carefully monitored as well. (GOTS: Global Organic Textile Standard, ICEA: European Eco/Bio Standard)</p>
<p><strong>2.    Toxin Free. Hypoallergenic, chemical free, and 100% organic cotton</strong>. Our tampons are encased in fine a 100% organic veil to avoid fibres staying in our bodies. We are chlorine bleach and dioxin free. With a woven cord, there are no glues, synthetics, perfumes, bleaches or dyes used in our products.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474522994/ogqfkfhu3ffhmsl38fne.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>3.    Plastic Free.</strong> We don't use plastic. Our applicators are a smooth biodegradable, comfortable, and compostable cardboard, our wrappers are paper, and our packaging is burlap and recycled paper. Did you know that the average plastic-applicator tampon user goes through 7,300 plastic applicators in their lifetime? That’s a lot of plastic trash! And it ends up in our landfills and waterways – this is not okay with us.</p>
<p><strong>4.    Completely Compostable ♥.</strong> Everything we use is compostable so we can limit the effect we have on our environment and the Earth.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474524541/ky38eni34aacdahfe3k7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>5.    Customized Selection to Match Your Flow.</strong> Before each month's delivery, you will be prompted to select your tampon sizes online. If you can’t decide, or don’t have time, we’ll mix it up for you! Each monthly delivery is 16 tampons or 10 pads.</p>
<p><strong>6.    Accessible to All Women. </strong>Our mission is to make organic tampons and pads affordable and accessible for everyone. No woman should be forced into using toxic products because she can’t afford or doesn’t have access to an organic option.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474525388/zbf4cvfebuntonoprpkx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>7.    Socially Responsible. </strong>As well as donating a healthy percentage of revenue to charities chosen by the tribe, focusing on those that make a significant impact on young girls’ (and boys’) confidence, pride and inner-strength, we will create an awesome team by employing people who perhaps haven’t had the same access to education or opportunity in our community. We’ll be working with retraining centers such as Chrysalis in Los Angeles, and seeking out skilled veterans, and special-needs adults to make Tampon Tribe the absolute best we can be.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474527105/xc18nglnv37613poo7w1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">NO MORE PERIOD PANIC</h2>
<p>We deliver monthly, so you will never run out of tampons and pads - and why does that happen each month? We've got your back. No more breakdowns or breakups due to period panic.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">ON A SERIOUS NOTE</h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT'S IN YOUR TAMPON?</h2>
<p>Today's tampons and pads are not what you think - they are made from a mix of cotton, rayon, and synthetic fibres. These materials carry toxins from wherever they have been grown/produced. They have been whitened with chlorine bleach that leaves dioxin - a cause of cervical cancer. They contain perfume, dyes, glues, and chemicals called ""super-absorbents."" And you're putting all of this inside or on one of the most sensitive parts of your bodies? It's time to make a change. Take back control.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHAT YOU GET WITH TAMPON TRIBE </h2>
<p>Your first month’s Tampon Tribe selection of certified organic cotton tampons or pads, that are pure, simple and toxin-free, comes in a reusable burlap drawstring bag, which you can place in your bathroom cabinet, on the sink, or set centre stage as a conversation piece. Our tampons aren’t meant to be kept a secret!</p>
<p>Your subsequent refill months will be delivered in a recycled paper bag to lessen our impact on the Earth. You customize your selection online prior to delivery if you need, chose a mix of 16 regular, super, or super-plus. As we grow, we’ll have little purse and travel packs available too.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474526903/rxo8kugnvcwi6lhtkqzl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">HELPING HOMELESS WOMEN</h2>
<p>We've just added some perks that directly give back to homeless women in our community who need our help, especially with access to essential feminine hygiene. We will match purchases and deliver feminine hygiene pads to women on our streets.

<p>Tampon Tribe was started when Australian and Brazilian entrepreneurs from Beijing, Jennifer and Gaby, traveled to Los Angeles. Searching for healthy, organic products, it became clear that in the feminine hygiene arena, scarcity was king. Always running out of tampons, despite the event being a somewhat regular one, the duo paired their need for convenient and affordable tampons with sustainable, organic, and toxic free products. They are now poised to take Tampon Tribe to the world backed up by a growing enthusiastic team who inspire their passion and drive to create impact and change, and to ensure that no woman is forced into using toxic tampons due to availability or price.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">KEEN TO LEARN MORE?</h2>
<p>You can find out everything there is to know about Tampon Tribe, investing in us, and where we are headed. Check us out on <a href=""http://wefunder.com/tampontribe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WeFunder.com</a> where we have just started a crowdfunding equity raise. Exciting!!</p>
</div></div>","Tampon Tribe is a monthly subscription for delivered organic cotton tampons and pads that are toxin free, plastic free, completely compostable, and that give back.

 
WHY WE DO THE THINGS WE DO
Our mission is to provide super easy access to affordable organic tampons and pads to all women. Everything about our product is focused on sustainability. Even our applicators are compostable and our packaging is made from recycled materials – no plastic. Period. 

THE SKINNY
What's in your tampons and pads? Here's what's in ours..
1.    Certified Organic, GOTS, ICEA. Our cotton is grown with extreme care and to international certified organic standards, which means everything from the soil, to water use, and of course chemicals, is strictly monitored and regulated. It also means that all stages of production are carefully monitored as well. (GOTS: Global Organic Textile Standard, ICEA: European Eco/Bio Standard)
2.    Toxin Free. Hypoallergenic, chemical free, and 100% organic cotton. Our tampons are encased in fine a 100% organic veil to avoid fibres staying in our bodies. We are chlorine bleach and dioxin free. With a woven cord, there are no glues, synthetics, perfumes, bleaches or dyes used in our products.

3.    Plastic Free. We don't use plastic. Our applicators are a smooth biodegradable, comfortable, and compostable cardboard, our wrappers are paper, and our packaging is burlap and recycled paper. Did you know that the average plastic-applicator tampon user goes through 7,300 plastic applicators in their lifetime? That’s a lot of plastic trash! And it ends up in our landfills and waterways – this is not okay with us.
4.    Completely Compostable ♥. Everything we use is compostable so we can limit the effect we have on our environment and the Earth.

5.    Customized Selection to Match Your Flow. Before each month's delivery, you will be prompted to select your tampon sizes online. If you can’t decide, or don’t have time, we’ll mix it up for you! Each monthly delivery is 16 tampons or 10 pads.
6.    Accessible to All Women. Our mission is to make organic tampons and pads affordable and accessible for everyone. No woman should be forced into using toxic products because she can’t afford or doesn’t have access to an organic option.

7.    Socially Responsible. As well as donating a healthy percentage of revenue to charities chosen by the tribe, focusing on those that make a significant impact on young girls’ (and boys’) confidence, pride and inner-strength, we will create an awesome team by employing people who perhaps haven’t had the same access to education or opportunity in our community. We’ll be working with retraining centers such as Chrysalis in Los Angeles, and seeking out skilled veterans, and special-needs adults to make Tampon Tribe the absolute best we can be.

NO MORE PERIOD PANIC
We deliver monthly, so you will never run out of tampons and pads - and why does that happen each month? We've got your back. No more breakdowns or breakups due to period panic.
ON A SERIOUS NOTE
WHAT'S IN YOUR TAMPON?
Today's tampons and pads are not what you think - they are made from a mix of cotton, rayon, and synthetic fibres. These materials carry toxins from wherever they have been grown/produced. They have been whitened with chlorine bleach that leaves dioxin - a cause of cervical cancer. They contain perfume, dyes, glues, and chemicals called ""super-absorbents."" And you're putting all of this inside or on one of the most sensitive parts of your bodies? It's time to make a change. Take back control.
WHAT YOU GET WITH TAMPON TRIBE 
Your first month’s Tampon Tribe selection of certified organic cotton tampons or pads, that are pure, simple and toxin-free, comes in a reusable burlap drawstring bag, which you can place in your bathroom cabinet, on the sink, or set centre stage as a conversation piece. Our tampons aren’t meant to be kept a secret!
Your subsequent refill months will be delivered in a recycled paper bag to lessen our impact on the Earth. You customize your selection online prior to delivery if you need, chose a mix of 16 regular, super, or super-plus. As we grow, we’ll have little purse and travel packs available too.

 
HELPING HOMELESS WOMEN
We've just added some perks that directly give back to homeless women in our community who need our help, especially with access to essential feminine hygiene. We will match purchases and deliver feminine hygiene pads to women on our streets. We are partnered with Venice, CA-based Purse Purge, where we fill purses and bags with essential items and either hand-deliver, or make available to, homeless women in the area. Here's our last live video packing purses!

 
PLASTIC FREE

This National Geographic Video says it all.

Our City is Changing
 
We need a new journalism and digital media for a new emerging San Antonio. In the past two decades, San Antonio has transformed itself into a world-class culinary, art, and cultural destination. San Antonio is so much more than the River-Walk and The Alamo. This city is full of brilliant minds with diverse backgrounds who strive to create, collaborate, and educate others about what our city really has to offer, beyond what can be found on Yelp. The Down Market (www.thedownmarket.net) , does exactly that. 
Join The Down Market on an epic journey to power a new media that reflects San Antonio and the surrounding cities of Austin, Houston, and Dallas’ true diversity. As our country’s demographics shift, we also need to change the way we talk about ourselves.
 
Explore With Us.


 
 The past few months a very small team have been working nonstop creating content. We have created original videos which some of you have seen called The Culture + Creative series that touches only the surface of what this great city has to offer.
We have essays, studies, articles, podcasts, graphics & animation coming. But we need more support, we need more resources, we need more video equipment and we need to hire more reporters, producers, editors, multimedia journalists, cinematographers, and writers to give a true depiction of the new emerging Creative Class of San Antonio, Texas.Your donation will help us connect you to stories about your city and reporting with the honest and uncomfortable conversations we should be having to grow as a community.

Risks & Challenges



We can not revolutionize the media in the cities of Texas without your help.
Our city of San Antonio, Texas specifically, is experiencing a seismic shift in our very identity, and the root of that change comes from three key components; technology, community, and culture. Each one is trying to find an identity that can have a lasting and true relationship with the people of San Antonio, the surrounding areas of Texas, and nationwide.There are too many artists, innovators, activist, small businesses, too many voters – too many people – whose stories are not being told. And, too often, when the stories are told, they lack the necessary nuance and context.

 
So...what if we don't reach our fundraising goal?

The power and beauty of The Down Market is that the project can evolve organically to fit within the budget available to us, because its created by the people not a brand conglomerate with share holders to answer too with their own agendas. Whether or not it can become the masterpiece we have designed is up to you, the people and your support. Should we fall short of our campaign goal, we will scale back the number of film vignettes, project series and articles we start with, and hope that a larger body of work will help us to secure grants and private funding. Regardless of money, we will continue to create meet up socials and workshops to find the stories that our important to you, blog and write thought provoking articles, make photo essays, and record live feeds of stories and events even as a labor of love to the city of saints and find ways to continue to bring more stories from all around Texas of it's true strength of diversity, that only The Down Market: Digital Magazine can.

We Need & What You Get
  We need $2800 to obtain the five hives and bees, as well as set up an educational beehive for visitors. Our Bees will have access to 100 acres of unsprayed wild flowers and blackberries.  We also plan to plant a large amount of lavender, one of bees favourite flowers. If we do not reach our goal, the portion we do raise will go towards the a number of hives we can afford with the funds.    The Impact Your contribution will make a difference not only for the colonies of honey bees we will purchase but will support the honey bee in their comeback by providing a chemical free bee-yard with plenty of pollen.  Food is vital, for all of us and honey bees are the key to agriculture success. Apples, Cherries, pumpkins, pears all depend on the honey bee, think of the bees and appreciate what they do for us when you bite into a juicy pear this summer.    Risks & Challenges  There are risks with hiving honey bees, honey bees swarm and leave their hives if they are over crowded and are difficult to ""over winter,"" thus allowing their colonel to continue into the new year.  I am working with a local apiary who has a PHD in Bees and agriculture. Also many bee colonies starve to death from not having enough of their own honey to over winter, I would like to leave them with sufficient stores so they can have the health benefits of their own honey through out the winter.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Plant lavender and marigold flowers and look at dandelions not as weeds but as honey bees first source of pollen.
Appreciate bees and the contribution they make to your living.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>What started out as a small video in 2012 that told the story of a local farmer and his sustainable farm systems has now evolved into a 6 part series featured on the pages of Edible Ottawa magazine and has grown to involve 5 more characters connected in the world of food and the writers, filmmakers, &amp; photographers who tell their story.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The series follows how food moves through the system from Farmer to Driver, from Gardener to Restaurant, from Brewer to Dairy.    These connections show us that food is a major part of our community and the people who are working behind the scenes to bring it to us do so out of passion and commitment to their craft.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We started by taking photographers to shoot the characters we had chosen.    Neither parties had met and by doing things this way we sought out to achieve a series of honest portraits of the people behind the food.   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We chose Edible Ottawa to print the story because of their commitment to quality content and beautiful imagery.    Now that all 6 portraits have been featured in the magazine we are now moving on to the next stage:   a documentary web series that tells the story of, not only the characters we chose, but how the incredible photography came to be (and why).   We feel the story is incredible and the resulting first episode really took what we felt was a great project to start to the next level.   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The best part of this whole idea is the matching of cultures.    We have taken passionate people in the food world and paired them with passionate people of the art world.   Each pays tribute to the other.   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We hope to see this project grow and go beyond the first six characters.    This crowd funding campaign is crucial to make that happen.   We hope to use the funds to:  a) complete the documentary web series eventually highlighting it in film festivals across Canada b) begin a second 6-part series highlighting the vibrant food community in Ottawa and area.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have partnered with Mariposa Farms, Whalebone Oyster House, The Clocktower Brew Pub &amp; Arlington Five/Wilf &amp; Adas to offer an incredible roster of incentives for your support.   As well, with 6 talented photographers who have built a library of photos from the project, each unique to their own style, we can also start getting these photos out to the the community that embraces Ottawa growing food culture.  </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>WHY CROWDFUNDING?</h3> <p></p>
<p>Unfortunately there just isn't a lot of budget out there to support the scope of these projects and compensate the artists that work so hard to tell these stories.   However, with the response we received from the 6 part series in Edible Ottawa, we know that there is demand and people are truly excited about these stories.  This is why we are putting this campaign open for public support;  to see if that demand can take us to the next level.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you support it, we will make it.    This is the true nature of why we have decided to crowd fund this project:   We believe in it and we think that we can bring something truly special to an excited audience.   </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have heard from the food community with their gracious support and faith in this project.   Now we are calling on you to help make it a reality.   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465262165/Where_the_Funds_Go_wygjfe.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>

The projectile has been in use for over ten years and has never caused a death.  Finally, thank you to my engineering team at Parametric Solutions in Jupiter, Florida, Dan Larcomb of Engineering Marvels in Stuart Florida for the Larcomb firing mechanism, and to the always polite & professional, Douglas Perry, Master Machinist, from Palm Beach Gardens, Fl. and soon to re-locate to Palatka, Fl.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><em><strong>About Sitzon</strong></em></p>
<p>Since 2014, <em><strong>Sitzon</strong></em> in West Islip, New York, has been designing handicap furniture that restores accessibility to your favorite activities. Our specially designed products help people regain their independence, dignity, and self image.</p>
<p>This lifting chair is unlike any other. <em><strong>Sitzon</strong></em> was developed by Donna Smith, a Yoga enthusiast  who was disabled due to complications from an accident. Her undying passion for the practice of Yoga drove her to evolve this chair, and she has found it to be an accommodating solution that has restored her independence and self-confidence. You to, may follow your passion with the help of <em><strong>Sitzon</strong></em>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Reaching Better Heights</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sitzon</strong></em> isn't just useful for easily lowering you down to the floor. When you fall and cannot get up, simply reach for <em><strong>Sitzon</strong></em> to help  raise you back up. Unlike a traditional chair, this product goes all the way to the floor. Its operating range lowers you down to four (4) inches off the floor, or raises you 20 inches high (about the height of a regular chair). The raising and lowering process takes about a minute to complete, enabling quick access to what ever you need.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sitzon's</strong></em>  design provides unparalleled comfort, mobility and functionality. Equipped with two wheels and a handle, the chair is able to fold down completely for maximum portability. This allows you to roll it around like a suitcase when you no longer need it. </p>
<p><em><strong>Assistance for ALL</strong></em></p>
<p>Everyone deserves to do what they love. <em><strong>Sitzon</strong></em> gives everyone a means to get down to the floor safely and conveniently. It is the perfect companion for the disabled, amputees, elderly, patients with neurological issues, and individuals recovering from surgery or injures. <em><strong>Sitzon</strong></em> is the perfect aid for Yoga, physical rehabilitation, and playing with children.</p>
<p><em><strong>We Need Your Support</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sitzon</strong></em> is currently in the prototype stage and entering the second iteration of its design. Development is ongoing to make this the perfect aid for individuals with <strong>physical limitations</strong>, <strong>disabilities</strong> and <strong>handicaps</strong>.</p>
<p>Your support will help us complete the prototyping of the final product and  assist us in getting  <em><strong>Sitzon</strong></em> into production and make it available to all persons with physical limitations.</p>

<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>Hello!</b></p>
<p>Thank
you very much for taking the time to watch our video about this campaign and thank you very much for thinking about
making a contribution.</p>
<p>My name is Bill Knepper.<span>  I am a volunteer for a not-for-profit
organization that provides a genuine, proven, structured career path for 
disabled veterans.  We identify, recruit and
hire these veterans and then we educate, train and mentor them for successful careers
in the insurance industry.  So far we
have successfully done this with four disabled vets and with your support of
this fundraising campaign we can help another one.</span></p>
<p>That’s right – with your help today
we can turn the world around for a disabled vet.<span>  </span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Our initial goal amount for this campaign is to raise $32,492.  You might be asking, ""Where did that number come from?""  That number comes directly <span>from the actual average amount
that it costs us to educate and train one disabled veteran during their six
month training period.  That amount is
broken down into 3 parts: $11,196 compensation for the veteran, $14,214 for training
expenses and $7,082 for technology, logistical and administrative costs. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431899157/kvnkza1ztm6zoall1kp2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I am personally hoping that we will exceed our initial
goal – by a LOT!<span>  If that happens and we
double our goal that means that we will be able to help two disabled veterans …
triple our goal and we can help three.  The
sky is the limit!  Whatever money this
campaign raises, p</span>lease
note that 100% of the contributions that we get will go toward accomplishing our
mission to educate and train disabled veterans so that they might have a
meaningful career in the insurance industry.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Disabled Veterans Insurance Careers</b></p>
<p>The name of the not-for-profit
organization that I am part of is Disabled Veterans Insurance Careers (DVIC) and
you are invited to check out our website at <a href=""http://www.dvic.us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>WWW.DVIC.US</u></a>.<span>  You can see how we have already helped four disabled veterans and how we do what we do.  There is a lot of great information on our
site – information about our board and some of the heroes that are part of DVIC
– there are also some great videos on our site there, including one where each
of the four disabled veterans that we have already helped tell their story and how DVIC has helped them.  Those
veterans’ comments make me proud to be part of DVIC and make me happy that I am
in a position to help them.  </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

</div>","Hello!
Thank
you very much for taking the time to watch our video about this campaign and thank you very much for thinking about
making a contribution.
My name is Bill Knepper.  I am a volunteer for a not-for-profit
organization that provides a genuine, proven, structured career path for 
disabled veterans.  We identify, recruit and
hire these veterans and then we educate, train and mentor them for successful careers
in the insurance industry.  So far we
have successfully done this with four disabled vets and with your support of
this fundraising campaign we can help another one.
That’s right – with your help today
we can turn the world around for a disabled vet.  

What
We Need & What You Get
Our initial goal amount for this campaign is to raise $32,492.  You might be asking, ""Where did that number come from?""  That number comes directly from the actual average amount
that it costs us to educate and train one disabled veteran during their six
month training period.  That amount is
broken down into 3 parts: $11,196 compensation for the veteran, $14,214 for training
expenses and $7,082 for technology, logistical and administrative costs. I am personally hoping that we will exceed our initial
goal – by a LOT!  If that happens and we
double our goal that means that we will be able to help two disabled veterans …
triple our goal and we can help three.  The
sky is the limit!  Whatever money this
campaign raises, please
note that 100% of the contributions that we get will go toward accomplishing our
mission to educate and train disabled veterans so that they might have a
meaningful career in the insurance industry.

Disabled Veterans Insurance Careers
The name of the not-for-profit
organization that I am part of is Disabled Veterans Insurance Careers (DVIC) and
you are invited to check out our website at WWW.DVIC.US.  You can see how we have already helped four disabled veterans and how we do what we do.  There is a lot of great information on our
site – information about our board and some of the heroes that are part of DVIC
– there are also some great videos on our site there, including one where each
of the four disabled veterans that we have already helped tell their story and how DVIC has helped them.  Those
veterans’ comments make me proud to be part of DVIC and make me happy that I am
in a position to help them.  Other Ways You Can Help
I know that some people just can't contribute.  If you are one of those people, that doesn't mean you can't help!  If you can’t make a contribution at this time, it would still be very much appreciated if you could help us get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.

</div> <div> <h3>What I Need <br/>

<br/>
The Urban Survival kits under the paracord vary and can consist of  - <br/>
1 x lock Pick, 1 x tension tools, 1 x craft style blade / stanley blade,
 snare wire ,P-38 tin opener, matches, compass, magnifying glass, band

 situations that are out of your control.<br/>
Maybe you are walking down the street and a  incident happens, you may 
need to get away fast, or hide, these tools  will get you in or out of a

evasion and to save lives, maybe a house is on fire and you  need to get
 in or out, again this tool could save your life or someone  else's.<br/>
But at the same time, you have other survival items - tin opener, para

Summary My name is Mike, and I created the Urban Survival Pry Bar Mutli Tools.

The Pry Bars are designed as a survival tool for emergencies in either urban or non urban situations - the tools include two prying ends, cutting edge, saw back, tin / bottle opener, nail puller, sharpened hook, flat head screw driver and a paracord wrapped handle which contains an survial kit underneath which includes band aids, snare wire, lock pick, tension tool, saw blade, compass, matches, safety pins, and more - the contents may vary from each Pry BarThe Pry Bar shown above is blued finish but I also do plain black paint, and can do any colour paracord wrapped handle, I may also do some in bright orange paint finish.
Below are some of the items under the paracord -

The purpose of this campaign is to generate funding so I can start making the pry bars on a larger scale, currently I make them in my shed with very basic hand tools.
If I can get better tools I can make more and sell them cheaper too, currently it takes half a day or more to make one pry bar with the tools I have and therefore the cost of selling them has to be higher than I'd like.

What I need is any funds, potentially even a small amount will at least allow me to buy some hand tools that I don't own, with bigger donations I can get decent power tools that will make the whole process much easier and lower the price too.
  The ImpactAs mentioned above this funding could change my life for the better, this would become my full time job. would give me a living, I could expand other ideas I have, it would really change things for me!
  
Risks & Challenges There really are no risks, any funds will help to change how I make and sell the pry bars, a small amount will allow me to buy some basic tool and materials to get me started, larger amounts will change how the tools are made and the price they are sold.

We want to bring an ever-changing clothing line to you, so that together we can bring hope to people in need.

   OUR NEEDS We are looking to YOU, our global community, to help us meet our needs and the current demand already established by our partnering nonprofits. These funds will also help us reach our goal of kick-starting our own official website, creating more custom t-shirt designs, and partnering with other nonprofits. 
If our goal of $2,000 is not met, the funds received will be split evenly and donated to the two nonprofits that The Warm Heart Company already partners with. 

THE IMPACT
Together, we can make a difference. Your contribution will help people living in poverty all across the world. We deeply appreciate every donation and are committed to doing what we can to make a difference. 
Over the past year, through the purchases of our t-shirts, we have been able to help the people of both Malawi and Rwanda in many ways.

Donated over 1,000 children's books to The Duha Complex School in rural Rwanda.
Spent 3 weeks in Rwanda assisting teachers at The Duha Complex School.
Aided in the donation of old laptops through the Rollins Laptop Legacy Project.
Donated over $1,000 to Children of the Nations and their work in Malawi.


   

   CHALLENGES ALONG THE WAY 
The Warm Heart Company has set us out on an entirely new endeavor in which we hope to continue to make a difference in the global community. In ensuring the independence, growth, and security of each nonprofit, we know that we will be presented with logistical challenges along the way.


Shipping globally.
Turning a profit while upholding our values.
Not imposing Western values on any community.
Making sure we represent each nonprofit in the best possible way.
Continually bringing new, custom designs to the store.
Language barriers.

With these in mind, we are confident in our problem solving and support network. We believe that these issues of global inequality are worth working through any obstacles we may face.   GET INVOLVED If you can't contribute, that doesn't mean you can't help. Please get the word out and make some noise about our campaign! Remember, we need YOU to help make a difference.

<p>My name
is Sabra Michelle and I am a professional actor/dancer/singer/producer in NYC.
I have performed in shows across the country and on national tours and around the world. I have hosted and entertained at hundreds of parties throughout the years and, together with some friends with similar backgrounds, have
started a small Organization which has produced galas for national charities. CATCH Organization (Choose Action To Change
Humanity) <span>started out as an idea on how to make
housing affordable to people in the entertainment
industry, and give back to the community around them.  The idea of what
C.A.T.C.H can be has grown, and the possibilities are endless.  </span></p>
<p>Now we
want to buy a grand Victorian House in rural New Jersey to restore and turn
into an Arts &amp; Events Center, where wonderful things happen- tea parties for wedding/baby showers, children's birthday parties, and wedding receptions for starters! Our dream is
to create a single destination for people within 90 miles of New York, NY,
Philadelphia, PA, and Trenton, NJ where clientele would gladly escape the
concrete jungle for a day of country respite and entertainment, run by
professionals who have a great understanding of catering to city-dwellers'
needs in a pastoral setting. NYC actors would live on the property to cater to guests' needs. We also aim to enrich the culture of the
surrounding community by offering them an elegant place to gather to celebrate
special events.</p>

Or maybe you just think this is a great project to support. If so then thank you for your contribution. 
We do also have the option of setting up monthly direct debits.
    The Impact We are a church based organisation that have spent the last 8 years running successful youth projects, 5 of which have been The Unit Skatepark. The impact of what we are proposing is massive and can literally change peoples lives. 
Something we have noticed over the years is that young people especially don't seem to have the skills and help to write CV's, cover letters and fill in job application forms. Just one of the things we will be offering is free qualified assistants to work through these things with them.

    Other Ways You Can Help There are so many ways you can help. One of which is donating but most importantly we need you to get the word out their about this and get people excited about what could be an excellent facility to serve the community.",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Hello, my name is Janice Beier. I am the inventor of the Rolly Bowl. 
The Rolly Bowl is an  innovative, fun and versatile food storage 
container that will revolutionize the food storage container industry. I
 am raising funds for a new start-up company which will manufacture, 
package and market this new product.  After my funding goal is reached I
 will buy the small, medium and large sized molds necessary to create the bowls. I will begin the 
manufacturing process some time in April. Once I have manufactured the first 100 bowls I 
will work with an artist to come up with a design for the packaging. The Rolly Bowls should be packaged and ready to ship by mid May. Once the bowls have been packaged I will begin fulfilling my pledges. After all pledges have been sent I will begin manufacturing bowls for marketing and trade shows.</p><br/></div>","INTRODUCING THE ROLLY BOWLThe Rolly Bowl is a unique, all-in-one food storage system with a built in roll over lid .

</span>Our campaign is to lease a small warehouse unit, where we can continue
to hand-make our scented candles, enabling us to continue to meet demand from
eco-friendly and forward thinking consumers and businesses throughout the

create our own essential oil farms and protected wood areas internationally,
thus helping on a global scale. As part of our ethical values, we donate to
charities and we are committed to donating sufficiently to ensure animal rights
charities get access to the funding they need to continue their good work.
Please help us to achieve this.</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>As detailed above, helping to continue Senses growth will provide not
just our founders, our employees or our customers with these luxurious

However awareness alone is not enough. Thousands of women depend on homes like
the Salvation Army’s Carehaven as their only way out of the cycle of abuse. By

not only women but their children too. Funds will help Carehaven provide more
women with essentials like food, clothing and educational programs.</p>

<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>The challenge is to turn words into
     action. Many people are quick to condemn abuse and share a
     status or ad, but actions speak louder than words. Homes like Carehaven
     need your support to help those women affected by violence. They struggle

</div></div>","Short SummaryThe Outdoor Vibe was created by Jon Hurley to allow people to discover the incredible outdoor adventures people can experience in Argentina. After moving to Argentina in 2011 from the UK, Jon Hurley wanted to continue the outdoor lifestyle he'd grown up with, whilst living in the capital of Argentina, Buenos Aires.  This lead to the idea of The Outdoor Vibe and all it offers. Discover Argentina your wayThe Outdoor Vibe offers a bespoke tour service to both visitors from overseas  and locals enabling them to discover all the joys the countryside of Argentina has to offer.  Specializing in the core areas of Hunting, Fishing, Polo, Horse riding, Trekking and now Paddle Boarding.“This campaign is aimed at targeting the development of Paddle Boarding tours in Argentina. “Why Paddle Boarding?Argentina has some of the most pristine lakes and rivers anywhere in the world and yet Paddle Boarding, or SUP as it's also known, is not a common sport here.  In the modern age of eco-tourism where protecting the environment we live in is as important as allowing people to discover its beauty, Paddle Boarding is the perfect none invasive way for the waterways of Argentina to be discovered without damaging the habitat around us.Why are we campaigning?With the money we raise from this campaign we will be able to buy the equipment needed to develop tours around the country allowing people a completely new way to see the beauty Argentina has to offer. What We Need & What You GetWe are hoping to raise $20,000 USD but the good thing is that we can tailor the growth dependent on how much we raise. We have chosen to run a flexible campaign because no matter the amount we raise, it will be put to good use.$10,000If we can hit the $10,000 mark this will allow us to purchase enough equipment for small tour parties of up to 4 people along with the development and promotion of 1 location for short weekend breaks.$20,000The full $20,000 will enable us to purchase enough equipment to accommodate parties of up to 10 people at a time whilst also being able to develop and promote 2 locations for the tours in Tigre and Salta allowing us to be much more flexible in both the size of the tour and the lengths of tour we can offer.If we hit our target we will start a short tour around the Tigre delta, one of the world's UNESCO sites, as well as a longer tour in the mountainous lakes of Salta. However, no matter what we raise, all perks will be valid.“By contributing now you can be a pioneer in bringing Paddle Boarding to Argentina.” The futureFurther tours are planned to Patagonia in the South of Argentina and any further monies raised will be used for equipment & tour development in this area to bring our clients the very best experience.The PerksThe great thing about The Outdoor Vibe is that we offer tours in numerous outdoor activities so even if you aren't a big Paddle Boarding fan you can still use your perk across all the tours we offer and still support our bid to bring Paddle Boarding to Argentina.We’ll double your donationThe system of perks we are offering is very simple, we have various different monetary options for you to choose from so that, no matter your budget, you can take advantage of this campaign, and whatever amount you contribute, you'll receive double that amount off a tour offered by The Outdoor Vibe.

 Thank you for reading my story and considering being a part of my dream and vision!  I have been surrounded by books my entire life. I have a deep passion for words, how they shape us, and how they come alive. I would love to provide McPherson with affordable books.

 have had a dream of owning and operating my own used bookstore for 
years. Just now have I been given the opportunity to make it possible.

In the past few years, there have been two major breakthroughs in the world of online advertising... 



Wholesale advertising costs have dropped 70-90% (SHOCKING, I know)

</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We
need your help to raise $100,000. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We will take a portion of this money and
invest it into starting a series of non-profit businesses across the US and
Canada employing approximately 200 people to help us to ultimately raise about
$10,000,000 to build a Luxury Non-Profit Resort in Haiti, which has virtually no tourism from outside the country. This resort will provide nearly 2,000
full time Fair Wage jobs in in an area of Haiti where families are living on
under $1 a day and sharing 1 plate of rice a day. They have no electricity, no clean water, no sewage and an unemployment rate of nearly 100% with no social net. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A larger portion of this
money will go directly to actually purchasing land, building infrastructure and
hiring Haitians to begin the process of building the resort.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The reason we are doing it this way is so that we do not have
to raise the whole amount by donations. This will also allow us to continually grow
and help more people in poverty without having to continually raise more money
from the public.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Once
this project is done we will start 3 more major strategic international businesses
across Haiti to help transform Haiti’s economic and spiritual culture. When this goal is accomplished we can do the same thing in 2 other countries to help
transform their cultures of poverty. This the right and only real practical way to fight poverty. </p>
<p>You can participate in
this project and make a difference with a gift of as little as $1 or help by pre-purchasing a stay and get up to 40% extra on your investment. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">You do not necessarily
need to read and go over every detail of this plan right now if you only want to
help a little now because of time restraints. You can give a smaller gift now and
more later after you have time to go through the information later and feel
more confident and desire to do so.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>You can only give $1.  It is appreciated. We will be $1 closer to our goal.</b></p>The giving process only takes about 1 minute to give whatever you desire. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If you do not have a credit card and want to help, contact us through </span><a href=""http://www.hopeline.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">www.hopeline.org</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> or email us at </span><a href=""mailto:info@hopeline.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></a><a href=""mailto:Haiti@hopeline.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Haiti@hopeline.org</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.</span>

We are starting with a Non-Profit Luxury Resort in Haiti. Haiti has virtually no tourism and has an impoverished economy worse than Mexico and most of the other ones you know of. The intent of this project and resort is for the income to help those living in poverty and not outside corporate executives. This organization and project is set up to help the people it is intended to help not the administrative process which usually happens. </span></p>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Many people have tried to give jobs to help the poor. However, they mostly do it  in a way where their customer is from the impoverished community that they live in. They sell goats and sheep and fix </span>bicycles, etc. Their intent is good. However, most of the people they are attempting to help remain in poverty.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Our goal is and will get them and their community out of poverty.</span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our customers will be people from the first world. We will give them their moneys worth and use it to help the people living in the community rather than the outside money funding it . </span></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">It will take about a year and a half  and about a million dollars to open our doors for business for the first building phase, which will change peoples lives forever. The resort and any other business we start will always remain a non-profit business helping those who once lived in poverty, then help even more that are living in poverty. The ultimate cost of this resort will be $6,000,000 - $10,000,000 over time but this first phase of $100,000+ will help to get it and other non-profit businesses started which is all a part of the process to help raise the finances to help those living in poverty so that we do not have to keep asking you for more.</span></p>

They will earn fair wages and not what we can get away with paying them. Our goal is not to get rich but to help those living in poverty get out of it. We will maintain control and oversight to train and oversee what they are doing so as to keep the integrity and stability of the businesses intact for  long term viability in Haiti and any other country we will eventually help. </span></span></p>

<h3>Haiti: Poverty, death and i'ts history</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Haiti has the beauty of any country God has created . However, it's past is not so beautiful. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Haiti is a country in the Caribbeans on an island connected to the Dominican Republic. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Haiti was started through slavery and is the first black nation to get it's independence over 200 years ago. Unfortunately France and Spain wanted to retake Haiti as a slave nation again.  Because of this and trade embargo's by Europe and the United States Haiti remains the poorest nation in the western hemisphere.   </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I am providing 2 videos that are the best I have seen about the history of Haiti. The first has more of a modern perspective (still before the 2010 earthquake) about Haiti with some history and the second has more details about their revolution, death and the fight for freedom.</p>

At least we will know that there will be some that we have informed about poverty in the world and how they can help.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If we make more than our goal 5% will go to our ""Evens Charles Fund"" to help with medical expenses for those living in poverty in Haiti as they have no social net. The rest will help us to move forward faster and help more people in poverty in Haiti sooner. So obviously the more we get the better it will be.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If we do not make our goal the first $20,000 will go to starting the CARRS program and the rest will go towards starting the resort process. It is the CARRS program that will help the resort and those living in poverty the most if we have limited funds.</p>

Synopsis




We
need your help to raise $100,000. 
We will take a portion of this money and
invest it into starting a series of non-profit businesses across the US and
Canada employing approximately 200 people to help us to ultimately raise about
$10,000,000 to build a Luxury Non-Profit Resort in Haiti, which has virtually no tourism from outside the country. This resort will provide nearly 2,000
full time Fair Wage jobs in in an area of Haiti where families are living on
under $1 a day and sharing 1 plate of rice a day. They have no electricity, no clean water, no sewage and an unemployment rate of nearly 100% with no social net. 
A larger portion of this
money will go directly to actually purchasing land, building infrastructure and
hiring Haitians to begin the process of building the resort.
The reason we are doing it this way is so that we do not have
to raise the whole amount by donations. This will also allow us to continually grow
and help more people in poverty without having to continually raise more money
from the public.
Once
this project is done we will start 3 more major strategic international businesses
across Haiti to help transform Haiti’s economic and spiritual culture. When this goal is accomplished we can do the same thing in 2 other countries to help
transform their cultures of poverty. This the right and only real practical way to fight poverty. 
You can participate in
this project and make a difference with a gift of as little as $1 or help by pre-purchasing a stay and get up to 40% extra on your investment. 
You do not necessarily
need to read and go over every detail of this plan right now if you only want to
help a little now because of time restraints. You can give a smaller gift now and
more later after you have time to go through the information later and feel
more confident and desire to do so.
You can only give $1.  It is appreciated. We will be $1 closer to our goal.The giving process only takes about 1 minute to give whatever you desire. If you do not have a credit card and want to help, contact us through www.hopeline.org or email us at Haiti@hopeline.org.
Please use the above email if you have questions or you have problems giving.*Guests under 18 years of age must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.




Introducing Ourselves
Our family volunteered and served around the world with an organization called ""Youth With A Mission"" for 12 years. We saw much pain, poverty and death in those years. While our family lived in Haiti we finally decide to move back to the US. 

Even though we loved the people we worked with and the Haitian friends we had grown very close to we knew we could help them more from here. 




Below are 2 videos of Haiti's history and why they are living in poverty
Our family moved back home in June, 2013. We set up our constitution and board of directors in Washington state in early July. 
My wife and I both got jobs we love. She worked at McDonald's and home schooled our youngest son and now works for the school-board in our small town and I drive Charter Bus at Alpha Omega Tours and Charters. We love helping and serving people. We started Hopeline Christian Society to help those living in poverty around the world. We finally got our 501(c)(3) in August last year.
We now have a small team which is growing and has a heart to help those living in poverty around the world.
We mostly help 2 groups of people  Self-Supported Missionaries like our selves who help those living in poverty and mostly remain in poverty themselves to help those they live and die for to help;
 Those living in poverty in 3rd world countries who need education, training and more importantly jobs. 


They do not want handouts. They want and need jobs for a better lifestyle.You will help to provide that training, infrastructure and JOBS for them.






Even though we are helping some now. We are not helping as many as we would like, especially those who need jobs. The cost is much more than we have coming in and are unable to raise on our own.
We are normally helpers with construction, social work and administrative backgrounds. We are not normally fundraisers but regular people like you, doing the best we can with what we have. 
We have the infrastructure and everything we need in place and are ready to take the next step with your help.

About this project


The plan has been and is to take some of God's raw beauty and to help those living in poverty around the world. We are starting with a Non-Profit Luxury Resort in Haiti. Haiti has virtually no tourism and has an impoverished economy worse than Mexico and most of the other ones you know of. The intent of this project and resort is for the income to help those living in poverty and not outside corporate executives. This organization and project is set up to help the people it is intended to help not the administrative process which usually happens. 

Many people have tried to give jobs to help the poor. However, they mostly do it  in a way where their customer is from the impoverished community that they live in. They sell goats and sheep and fix bicycles, etc. Their intent is good. However, most of the people they are attempting to help remain in poverty. Our goal is and will get them and their community out of poverty.
Our customers will be people from the first world. We will give them their moneys worth and use it to help the people living in the community rather than the outside money funding it . 
It will take about a year and a half  and about a million dollars to open our doors for business for the first building phase, which will change peoples lives forever. The resort and any other business we start will always remain a non-profit business helping those who once lived in poverty, then help even more that are living in poverty. The ultimate cost of this resort will be $6,000,000 - $10,000,000 over time but this first phase of $100,000+ will help to get it and other non-profit businesses started which is all a part of the process to help raise the finances to help those living in poverty so that we do not have to keep asking you for more.



Nationals will run and operate any business we start in the world, starting with Haiti. We will not hire high paid outsiders to manage and run the non-profit businesses. Professional volunteers in their field of expertise will train nationals of the country to run and manage the businesses. They will earn fair wages and not what we can get away with paying them. Our goal is not to get rich but to help those living in poverty get out of it. We will maintain control and oversight to train and oversee what they are doing so as to keep the integrity and stability of the businesses intact for  long term viability in Haiti and any other country we will eventually help. 


Even though I plan on continuing my normal job. I know the inevitable will come. Therefore I have made it so that our non-profit organization will never let me or anyone else in the future make more than $2,000/month for helping others in an organization dealing with so much money. I believe this is more than enough, appropriate and fair for people who are doing this to help those in poverty. This is not what this project is about nor will we receive anything from this project. However, I want to be up front about it and face the elephant in the room.
What We Need & What You Get
We need $100,000
  
$20,000 will go to starting the first non-profit business CARRS (Commercial and Residential Recycling Services) across the US and Canada. This is crucial so as to not have to raise the full amount through donations. More of a description at www.hopeline.org/CARRS about the CARRS program which will provide 200 jobs in the US & Canada. This will help to raise at least another $1,000,000+ in the first year and double that in subsequent years to build and run the resort and other businesses in future years.                               Land in Haiti


$80,000+ will go to directly purchasing land in one of the poorest area in Haiti, getting equipment to Haiti, start to build infrastructure (buildings, roads, electricity, etc.), hire and train Haitians to build and run the resort.


After the first resort is finished we will work on 3 more strategic locations in Haiti  to help the country as a whole. Then Haiti the helped will become Haiti the helper by investing in and helping other countries who are struggling with poverty. 


Helping others after you are helped


You get perks :)

We will have Non-beneficial and Beneficial perks. Non-beneficial perks which is your typical charity donation where you will get a US charitable tax receipt.  Beneficial perks are those that you will get some kind of personal benefit by purchasing and receiving something in return. Both types of perks will greatly benefit this project and help those living in poverty. We would hope that some of you would find it in your heart to participate in both types of perks :)  
Non-beneficial gifts:

Straight donation gifts (can also be done monthly on our website);

Even small amounts count;

You will have the knowledge that you are practically changing a nation(s) and the people in it forever;

Your gift is a long term investment that will keep growing for years to come even if you don't give anymore.



Beneficial Perks:

You can pre purchase rooms etc. for the resort at a discounted rates. This will be done through purchasing ""Resort Dollars"" (RD) in advance. These RD's can be used for anything that the resort has to offer. Depending how many you get you will receive between 15% and 40% on the dollar more by pre ordering them. It will be like purchasing your room or any other paid amenity that may be offered in advance at a great discount. We estimate that it will take between 2 and 3 years before rooms are available;

When  RD's are used at the resort they will have the value of 1 RD : 1 USD;
You may at any time after 18 months receive a full refund of what you paid. There will not be any time limit like some store purchased gift cards. You can choose to have your money back for any reason. We do not care if it is just because things in your life changed, you do not like the resort or we are taking too long to finish, etc. We will not ask any questions nor will we try to talk you out of it. We will just be glad that you let us use the money for that time to be able do this project and help those living in poverty around the world, starting with Haiti;







We will have 1, 2, 3, and 4 room suites available for families and groups. You may choose to purchase as many ""Resort Dollar"" packages as you desire or anticipate needing (we will refund whatever you do not need or use). The average double occupancy package should be around $400. We will also have more luxurious rooms. We will have discounts for those who may choose to or are volunteering at a ministry in the area for as low as $125 double occupancy. 
The resort will be family oriented and have things for everyone in the family to do. Food and transportation to and from the airport will be included. More included and extra amenities will become available as things move  along.
The more we have to offer you the more we can help.



Not actual Haiti Resort Images, just the things that will be there.

Pre ordered  RRD's will get advance reservation notice and first choice of room and package selection and dates.


Haiti: Poverty, death and i'ts history
Haiti has the beauty of any country God has created . However, it's past is not so beautiful. 
Haiti is a country in the Caribbeans on an island connected to the Dominican Republic. 
Haiti was started through slavery and is the first black nation to get it's independence over 200 years ago. Unfortunately France and Spain wanted to retake Haiti as a slave nation again.  Because of this and trade embargo's by Europe and the United States Haiti remains the poorest nation in the western hemisphere.   
I am providing 2 videos that are the best I have seen about the history of Haiti. The first has more of a modern perspective (still before the 2010 earthquake) about Haiti with some history and the second has more details about their revolution, death and the fight for freedom.

We have a practical chance to show our love and support by giving Haiti a well deserved and needed hand up by helping to build them the infrastructure for them to build their own success and future.

What you are doing!  With this project you will put in action a plan that will not only help Haiti but other countries as well afterward.

You are helping to change the lives of thousands of people living in poverty now and changing the future of generations to come.

You are showing you have trust and faith in the Haitian people .


Will this work?


I know what is needed, have seen and know that the Haitian people have the ability, intelligence, work ethic, creativity and desire to change their country for themselves, their families and their nation if they just get a little help.

What is your risk? For most not even a cup of coffee! Others maybe a family night out at the movies. Would that be worth the risk to change the lives of thousands of starving and dying people? What is the right thing to do?
For me and my family we have given just about everything to help not only these Haitians but many other missionaries and people living in poverty around the world. 
Anyone can search and checkout my character and integrity on Facebook from any of my friends who have known me for 20+ years to verify that I will do what I say and how I say is going to happen: Curtis Blanchet. You might also check out the photos on my old Haitian friends page Curtis Blanc. 

We have high end construction and administration backgrounds, helped manage youth camps and  ministry locations and know what is needed. We how to do it  and where to get it if it is needed.

Once we have the resources starting CARRS and the resort are the easy part. We know how to build, teach and do the impossible.    What's next?  From here we can only trust and pray that God has something better for those living in poverty and that He chooses to use us. All I know is that if we do not collect a dime I will continue to fight this battle for the friends in Haiti and other countries I have who have and are dying, when we can make a difference. At least we will know that there will be some that we have informed about poverty in the world and how they can help.
If we make more than our goal 5% will go to our ""Evens Charles Fund"" to help with medical expenses for those living in poverty in Haiti as they have no social net. The rest will help us to move forward faster and help more people in poverty in Haiti sooner. So obviously the more we get the better it will be.
If we do not make our goal the first $20,000 will go to starting the CARRS program and the rest will go towards starting the resort process. It is the CARRS program that will help the resort and those living in poverty the most if we have limited funds.


If You Can Not Help Financially?
 In reality just about anyone in a first world country can help. We have a such a good social net we really do not have a clue what real poverty is. It is a matter of prioritizing what is important to us. However, if you have gotten yourself so far in the hole of debt and you cannot help now, we do understand. Here are some other ways you can help and we really do appreciate it :)  

You can help get the word out and make this campaign known to help those living in poverty, share it and get your friends to check it out and give.



You can find other ways of helping those in poverty in your own town, country or another country.

Tell others about the struggles in Haiti. The videos and others here are on our Hopeline Christian Society website in our E-Magazine called the Exhorter (first two issues)


You can give in the future through www.hopeline.org 

You might have something that you can donate through the CARRS program to help once we have it up and running at www.hopeline.org/CARRS  You can use the Indiegogo share tools to tell your friends as well to help.
