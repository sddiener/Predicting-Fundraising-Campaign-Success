By owning my accommodations, I hope to be, one day, free (for the most part) from the unsustainable obligation of paying more rent than I could afford, which would both <b>eliminate the prospect of returning to the emotionally abusive environment that I’d escaped, and allow me to begin my entrepreneurial efforts.</b> It is my hope that those efforts would one day culminate in a combination dressmaking-and-vintage goods business of my own. Indeed, <b>seeing an end to the prospect of paying exorbitant rents, would free me to offer my dressmaking services to nonbinary and trans people at little to no cost</b> -- who are often hard-pressed to find beautiful (dare I say fabulous?) styles at the correct size from the majority of fashion retailers. In addition, <b>to be guided through the process of building and maintaining a tiny house, would impart to me knowledge that I could one day use in hopes of building similar, affordable structures for low-income and needy people</b>.<br/><br/><b>Please spread word of this funding drive</b> – which would, in itself, be an immense help. I am grateful for any amount donated, and <b>supporters may receive a customized reproduction vintage garment, sewn by yours truly and made to your own measurements</b>.<br/><br/><b>&gt;Background...</b><br/>First, a bit of background: I live in Vancouver, having moved here from Hong Kong to escape unbearable turmoil and discrimination for being queer. As many of you may have heard, the cost of housing is obscene in Vancouver, being second highest in the world after that of my ex-home-town. The price of a detached home often reaches $1,000,000, and the price of even the smallest flats, a third of that. It is no exaggeration to say that, to pay off one's mortgage, one would be indebted to the bank for the majority of one's lifespan.<br/><br/>Struggling with three concurrent mental illnesses -- Depression, OCD and PTSD -- the effort it takes me to exist from day to day alone is immense. Lethargy, anxiety and apathy seem to cloud my mind at every waking moment, and I am often reminded of my painful past by sight and sound; try as I have, both are only improving at a snail's pace. And, try as I might, work is hard to find in Vancouver -- especially so when one barely has energy to spare. I have, therefore, little income to speak of, even as my job search is under way.<br/><br/>As you can imagine, merely renting a home in Vancouver is unaffordable with such little money; even the smallest flats are far beyond my means, and I daren't think of purchasing one. My family members, who have been generous enough to keep me afloat, may not be able to do so for much longer, as our finances have taken a turn for the worse, rendering renting unsustainable. I simply cannot return to Hong Kong, and risk being mired in an abusive environment, thereby undoing any progress I have thus far made with my mental illnesses. <b>I therefore am in search of more permanent accommodations, which I hope to achieve by investing in a tiny house</b>.<br/><br/>&gt;Tiny house?<br/>The Tiny House movement has been gaining steam for awhile now. As the name implies, that involves <b>eschewing conventional houses, with the million-dollar price tags, mortgages and property taxes that invariably come with them, to live in a small and portable dwelling that could be towed by vehicle.</b> Whereas purchasing a full-sized house, or even a small apartment, would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in Vancouver, a tiny house would only cost around $50,000, and an RV trailer, less than half that. With this portable dwelling, the only remaining monthly costs would be that of renting a driveway from a person who rents or owns an existing, full-sized house, which would include the cost of electricity, water, and as far as I know, no property taxes. Such overheads would be neatly covered by even part-time employment.<br/><br/><b>The tiny house, if built, would serve as my living quarters and sewing studio</b>, from which the dressmaking operation be first based. Owing to the niche appeal of vintage clothing and goods, it is of the utmost importance that the overhead costs be kept as low as possible -- which I hope to achieve when the tiny house is fully funded. <b>Low overhead costs are especially important to make feasible a dressmaking operation that, in part, takes on charity requests -- as I hope to do with nonbinary and trans clientele.</b><br/><br/>A local builder of tiny houses has estimated that, in a year's time, he will be able to begin work on my own, which he estimates would cost upwards of $40,000. Being the thrift store vulture that I am,  I intend to keep costs down by using as much materials from architectural salvage operations as is practical. Nonetheless, one cannot escape the fact that a tiny house is -- true to its name -- tiny, and needs to be accordingly fitted with miniaturized versions of such fixtures as sinks and refrigerators that I may not be able to salvage. Furthermore, components of the plumbing system and various other vital materials on which I am not yet clear, should best be purchased brand-new. The goal that I have set for this funding appeal, $30,000, reflects an optimistic estimate of the total cost of building, which I intend to -- and must -- supplement through other means than begging.<br/><br/><b>As with all funding appeals, even a little means a lot</b>, and I fully expect to fall far short of the $30,000 goal. Nonetheless, I must gather enough funds to put a down payment on the tiny house so that the project can even begin.<br/><br/><b>&gt;So what's in it for you?</b><br/><b>&gt;&gt;Dresses! Reproduction vintage ones, of course.</b><br/>Being a student dressmaker, I could definitely sweeten the deal by sewing reproduction vintage dresses in return for especially generous donations, or skirts and blouses for smaller -- but still immensely helpful -- sums. Such projects would take at least a week to complete, as I must first purchase (or thrift, the latter preferably) the material from which the garment would be made, and go on to sew the garment afterwards. Indeed, if I were backlogged with commissions, the wait would even be longer. You may browse my instagram account (<a href=""https://instagram.com/cerements/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://instagram.com/cerements/</a>) for a better idea of the patterns that I have in my possession at the moment. If the request deviates a fair amount from the original pattern, I may have to make a muslin (which is a mock-up of the finished garment or part thereof). An additional few days of wait time should be expected if that is the case.<br/><br/>The patterns are cut to my size, which is around a size 20 (vintage) or 14 (current North American sizing), and they can be enlarged and/or taken in a few inches at the bust, hip and/or waist. I may also deviate from the existing pattern by, for example...<br/>- sewing a tie collar where there was a peter pan collar<br/>- adding pockets where there were none<br/>- shortening the skirt (by quite a bit if you are so inclined)<br/>- changing the style of the skirt (gathered? circle? how many gores?)<br/>- adding detailing (ric-rac? buttons? bows?)<br/>- buttoning all the way down the front? or only down to the waist, with a zipper opening at the side?<br/>- color and/or fabric print<br/><br/>The $700 donation would also cover the price of a pattern. If none of my existing designs suit you, you are welcome to...<br/>1. Find a pattern that is approximately your size, from Etsy preferably, which I would buy<br/>2. Request any alterations in size or detailing (and the all-important prints and colors) by e-mail or private message<br/>3. When the pattern has been mailed to myself, I will back it with fusible interfacing for preservation and sew the dress according to your request<br/>4. (Optional) Request that the pattern be mailed back to you! If you would rather I keep the pattern, it would most certainly be used many times over when the dressmaking business begins in earnest.<br/><br/><b>&gt;&gt;Skirts!</b><br/>Skirts, especially gathered skirts, are easier to make, often times without the help of a pattern. Therefore they could be made to more diverse measurements. The following would be customizable (that I can think of):<br/>- # gores<br/>- skirt style (gathered, circle, A-line...)<br/>- pockets<br/>- detailing (zipper side? button front?)<br/>- color and/or fabric print<br/><br/>I would also be more than willing to mail out some of the vintage garments that I own -- mostly winter coats -- in exchange for donations. Pictures of those coats will be uploaded to Instagram shortly.<br/><br/>Any donator who contributes enough to warrant these projects, or is thinking of contributing such a sum, should contact me by e-mail to detail their request.<br/><br/><b>In the event that the garment doesn't fit, please take pictures and/or describe the ill-fitting part and mail it back; I will gladly remedy it to the best of my ability.</b><br/><br/><b>Thank you for your consideration!</b><br/><br/><b>If you choose to donate in instalments, I would gladly tally up the amount you intend to donate over time, and reward you with the garment that corresponds to that total, when the sum (or a large part thereof) has been reached.</b></p><p><b>Also on <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/houseoffrocks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gofundme</a>.<br/></b></p></div>","Hello all.My name is Anna, but I hope to one day establish a business by the name of Betty Frocker -- it'd be a dressmaking operation (in addition to a vintage goods store), you see, hence ""Frocks"".I, however, need a bit of help to get started.(Scroll to bottom for more donation options!)>TL;DR:I am raising funds for a tiny house to be built, which would serve as my living quarters and sewing studio.

You may browse my instagram account (https://instagram.com/cerements/) for a better idea of the patterns that I have in my possession at the moment. If the request deviates a fair amount from the original pattern, I may have to make a muslin (which is a mock-up of the finished garment or part thereof). An additional few days of wait time should be expected if that is the case.The patterns are cut to my size, which is around a size 20 (vintage) or 14 (current North American sizing), and they can be enlarged and/or taken in a few inches at the bust, hip and/or waist. I may also deviate from the existing pattern by, for example...- sewing a tie collar where there was a peter pan collar- adding pockets where there were none- shortening the skirt (by quite a bit if you are so inclined)- changing the style of the skirt (gathered? circle? how many gores?)- adding detailing (ric-rac? buttons? bows?)- buttoning all the way down the front? or only down to the waist, with a zipper opening at the side?- color and/or fabric printThe $700 donation would also cover the price of a pattern. If none of my existing designs suit you, you are welcome to...1. Find a pattern that is approximately your size, from Etsy preferably, which I would buy2. Request any alterations in size or detailing (and the all-important prints and colors) by e-mail or private message3. When the pattern has been mailed to myself, I will back it with fusible interfacing for preservation and sew the dress according to your request4. (Optional) Request that the pattern be mailed back to you! If you would rather I keep the pattern, it would most certainly be used many times over when the dressmaking business begins in earnest.>>Skirts!Skirts, especially gathered skirts, are easier to make, often times without the help of a pattern. Therefore they could be made to more diverse measurements. The following would be customizable (that I can think of):- # gores- skirt style (gathered, circle, A-line...)- pockets- detailing (zipper side? button front?)- color and/or fabric printI would also be more than willing to mail out some of the vintage garments that I own -- mostly winter coats -- in exchange for donations. Pictures of those coats will be uploaded to Instagram shortly.Any donator who contributes enough to warrant these projects, or is thinking of contributing such a sum, should contact me by e-mail to detail their request.In the event that the garment doesn't fit, please take pictures and/or describe the ill-fitting part and mail it back; I will gladly remedy it to the best of my ability.Thank you for your consideration!If you choose to donate in instalments, I would gladly tally up the amount you intend to donate over time, and reward you with the garment that corresponds to that total, when the sum (or a large part thereof) has been reached.Also on gofundme.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Introducing Rides of Intoxicated Drivers of Eugene</h3>
<p>My name is Jonathan Russell, and I spent my life watching my father drink and drive, endangering the community in the process. It became my goal to try to figure out a way to help reduce drunk driving in the local communities.</p>
<p>After going to school for Business Management, and meeting the person who would end up convincing me to start this, RIDE was born.</p>
RIDE Eugene offers free, sober rides home for intoxicated drivers and their vehicles in the Eugene/Springfield metro area, in Lane County, Oregon.</div>
<div>
<h3>Dram Shop Law and Community Safety</h3>
<p>There are two reasons we are providing this service:</p>
<p>The first one is that there were over 14,000 DUII incidents in 2011, 97 of which resulted in fatalities. That is entirely too many incidents, and it is time to reduce these incidents and make our communities safer.</p>
<p>Secondly, Oregon implemented a Dram Shop law. The Oregon Dram Shop Act imposes liability on persons or drinking establishments that illegally sell alcohol. A dram shop violation may include selling alcohol without a license, selling or serving to someone less than 21 years of age, selling to someone without a license or identification, selling after hours, or selling to someone obviously intoxicated.If illegal service or sale results in someone's injury or death, the at-fault individual or establishment may be held legally responsible. In most cases, it is enough to show that giving alcohol added to the existing intoxication, and ultimately led to property damage or personal injury.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for initial startup funding. The nonprofit has been filed in the state of Oregon, but 501 (c) (3) status still needs to be achieved. We are also looking for additional funds for other legal and marketing fees to get started. Your initial contributions will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Filing of 501 (c) (3) status</li>
<li>Marketing costs including magnetic car door signs, business cards, and membership recruitment activities.</li>
<li>Beginning insurance costs</li>
</ul>
<p>Any funds left over will be earmarked for the first wages for our chase vehicle drivers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>RIDE Eugene hopes to drastically reduce the amount of drunk driving related incidents in the Eugene and Springfield, Oregon areas with the plans to increase to be able to offer something to the entire state within a few years. Your contributions now will help make that happen by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving us the opportunity to get started providing services that will generate statistical information for further fundraising activities</li>
<li>Showing that you are committed to reducing drunk driving incidents in your community.</li>
<li>Allowing funds to be earmarked for additional educational programs to help reduce drunk driving.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Can't Donate Cash?</h3>
<p>We understand that some people just can’t contribute, but they really want to help out and be active in the community. If that describes you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please reach out and share this campaign with your friends, family, and colleagues! Share our link on your social media sites, and shout it out that there is a new DD service in town. Help this go viral !!!!!</li>
<li>Share our campaign using IndieGoGo's share tools</li>
<li>Tell any servers or establishment owner's that serve alcohol that there is a new designated driving service that will get their patrons and vehicles home safely!</li>
<li>Let us know if you'd like to volunteer as a driver!</li>
</ul>

<h3><span>Who We Are and What We Are Doing</span></h3>
<p>Hunger is a growing problem in our nation. One in every six people in the United States is considered at-risk while over 1/4 of the food produced in this country is thrown away. In other words, our current waste management methods are horribly ineffective, and we need to do something about it.</p>
<p>We are striving to create a system that will help eliminate food waste and redistribute it to those who need it. In order to do this, we reach out to a variety of food distributors such as large grocery stores, restaurants, community farms and gardens. Over-cautious expiration dates and the culture of constant law-suits in this country have led these businesses to throw away pounds and pounds of perfectly edible food every day. Luckily, under the ""Good Samaritan Food Donation Act"" an established non-profit organization such as ourselves may receive donated food from any distributor, clearing them of any liability while simultaneously giving them an opportunity to file for tax-deductions on the donated food. This gives companies incentive to donate to us and is essentially the reason an organization like us is able to exist. </p>
<p>Once we have the food, we rely on a crew of volunteers to fill up bicycle trailers, stationed at every donation site, and pedal across town to a variety of other organizations that have agreed to receive and use the food. Recipients range from Homeless Shelters to Senior Care Centers to Youth Attention Homes to anyone else who needs to be fed. We operate on a ""just in time"" rescue schedule. This means that after we deliver the food, it is expected to be eaten within the next 48 hours.</p>
<br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to begin operations, we need to buy a few more supplies.<br/>- Trailers ($400 each)<br/>- Bike Locks ($45 each)</p>
<p>- Scales ($30 each)<br/>- Thermal Bags ($65 each)<br/>- Extra Bikes ($200 each)</p>
<p>- Merchandise (Ongoing)<br/>- Bike and Trailer Maintenance (Ongoing)<br/>- Bike Tools ($50 per kit)</p>
<p>We have estimated the total price of supplies and operational costs for the next year will amount to $5000. We need your help to achieve this goal! For your generous donations we are offering a couple of thank you gifts based on the donation amount. These will range from personalized thank you emails to slapping YOUR name on one of our bike trailers!</p>
<br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create a better, more sustainable system of food waste redistribution in our community. We are closely affiliated with and modeled after the established non-profit organization, Boulder Food Rescue, who has already managed to save 395,000 POUNDS of food in only TWO YEARS! We are striving to rival these numbers by creating a similar system here in Colorado Springs. We also encourage those of you who are reading this to start up a food rescue in YOUR community! You can contact us or Boulder Food Rescue for more information on how to get started. They have helped us tremendously, and they can help you too! Let’s spread the word and inspire people to act! </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not all of you will be able to donate money… but that doesn't mean you can’t help our cause. We are also looking for:</p>
<p>- volunteers able to bike the rescued food around</p>

What now?!</h3><h3></h3><p>About Me &amp; My Campaign</p><p>My name is Jessica Poland and I am 28 years old. I live with my wonderful husband and our two beautiful sons (ages 3 &amp; 3 mos) in North Tonawanda, NY. I have known my entire life that I wanted a career in helping others. The details have only recently become clear to me.</p><p>The typical 9-5 job is not for me anymore - and I want to spend more time with my family. I want to start my own maternity consulting and baby planning business - and you can help me make my dreams come true!</p><p>Having the privilege of being a parent is the most incredible and rewarding job that a person can be given. But it is not always fun or easy. From the moment of conception to the birth of a child - there a million choices to be made. Here are just a few things that new parents need to consider:</p><ul>
<li>Breast or formula feed?</li>
<li>What OB/GYN and hospital should I chose?</li>
<li>What are the best items to use for my baby and to put on my registry?</li>
<li>What to pack in the hospital bag?</li>
<li>What to expect when returning to work/daycare options</li>
<li>What classes should I take to prepare for baby</li>
</ul><p>I want to work in conjunction with all of our Maternity and Baby businesses in WNY to provide top of the line services.

What now?!About Me & My CampaignMy name is Jessica Poland and I am 28 years old. I live with my wonderful husband and our two beautiful sons (ages 3 & 3 mos) in North Tonawanda, NY. I have known my entire life that I wanted a career in helping others.

I want to start my own maternity consulting and baby planning business - and you can help me make my dreams come true!Having the privilege of being a parent is the most incredible and rewarding job that a person can be given. But it is not always fun or easy. From the moment of conception to the birth of a child - there a million choices to be made. Here are just a few things that new parents need to consider:
Breast or formula feed?
What OB/GYN and hospital should I chose?
What are the best items to use for my baby and to put on my registry?
What to pack in the hospital bag?
What to expect when returning to work/daycare options
What classes should I take to prepare for baby

<p><span>My name is Martin Wuest. I live with my wife and children in Michigan. We have been growing and making Cannabis medicines for several years and have been working with people to treat and reverse many unique and complex conditions, as well conditions that are more common than others, like pain and anxiety.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>In the Spring of 2014 we started working with our son's new friend friend Noah to treat his Autism and Dravet Syndrome with higher THC cannabis and nutrition. Noah was on several AEDs and supplements as well as a 20:1 CBD oil at the time, and while his seizure control was very good, Noah's neuronal activity was anything but ""good"" and he was suffering every day. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>Noah did not communicate and was very obsessive, compulsive, and hyperactive. He had no comprehension, he defied and attacked those around him, and his coordination and motor skills were very limited. I felt that the CBD was too high in ratio for Noah and after doing a bit of research, I began to feel intuitively that children with Autism may often benefit more from the higher THC ratios as the THC redirects the neurons in a way that is more manageable for Autistic persons.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>We started Noah the next day on a higher THC ratio with added THC-a....and the helmet came off. Noah's new life started that day. He could smile, he could sit still, he could calm down, he could communicate, he could cry, he could hug, he could listen.....he could be a little boy. Noah is 4.5 years old and has come from being developmentally less than 18 months old to about 30 months old in less than 6 months. For months he would have new milestones every week, catching up cognitively where he was prevented from growing and learning before.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We slowly added in more CBD into Noah's mixed strain oils until we learned that Noah benefited most from a 1:3 CBD:THC ratio from mixed strains and a 2:1 Cannatonic phenotype made into oil, but the higher THC ratio was important at night as Noah was able to stop taking his 7mg dose of Melatonin and sleep through the night without seizure activity. During the day Noah seems more focused and better able to learn with the 2:1 Cannatonic. We acknowledge though that his brain and his body will change throughout the years to come and he may need different ratios and medicines.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Noah and his mom Lisa have become good friends of ours over the months and we have grown together and branched out to help dozens of other Autistic and Epileptic families, as well as families of children with cancer and other serious conditions and diseases. But to our surprise, it was what we learned about our own 4 year old son Emery through our work with other Epileptic children that would change our lives forever.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Emery has had an Autism diagnosis since Spring of 2014. We knew then that we would work as hard as possible and do whatever it took to make sure that Emery's Autism, or features of his impairment, would qualify him for two doctor's recommendations so that he could use cannabis legally under our supervision. We knew then that it would change everything for him.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We had felt since Emery was a baby that he was on the Autism spectrum, and we learned later on that his teaching himself to read and putting together 100 and 300 piece puzzles from memory by age two correlated to Hyperlexia, but it wasn't until around the time of his Autism diagnosis that he started to express ""Rage"". Emery is a big kid, in the 97th percentile for height, and he's as strong as a bull. So when we started receiving punches, kicks, and headbutts for simply trying to put him in his carseat, or for trying to comfort him....it was very hard on the heart, on the soul.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>And when Emery's 2 year old sister would try to comfort him, and be projected across the room or thrown down on the ground and jumped on, it defeated our souls on some days. Emery was going to have to be separated from his sister on a permanent basis. We were already looking for land up north where we could just live and farm on, with more room for separate houses or trailers. We didn't feel like Emery was digressing mentally, but we had to face the facts that whatever was happening to him, our little genius was going through the same stages that we saw many other kids with his diagnosis go through before things like self injury behavior and bolting became an issue.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>When Emery was 2 months old I witnessed a seizure from a reaction to his first dTap shot. We were only picking and choosing vaccines, and it was only going to be PC and dTap. We had only done a limited amount of research and were comfortable with those vaccines. That was the only time I was ever sure Emery had actually had a seizure, although through the years we became concerned about the way he would ""wake himself"" at night and seem stiff for up to a minute or more or roll his eyes back a little. Sometimes he would wake up screaming and start and stop for seemingly no reason. But these types of movements and actions aren't what people typically think of as seizure activity.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>It wasn't until Lisa and some of the other parents we worked with noticed how often Emery would fall for no reason or would seem to space out and walk into something. We realized from talking to other parents that this wasn't a feature of his Autism, and why would it be? We started paying more attention to what we thought could be seizure activity, and sure enough, the convulsions actually started to evolve around that time into something we could recognize more easily. He was definitely having seizures, not bad dreams, and we had simply never known. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We immediately scheduled Emery an appointment with a neurologist, one that unfortunately wasted Emery's precious time for over four months before we found a great neurologist that we could trust to help him. While Emery's Epilepsy is not yet diagnosed, his seizure diagnosis was enough for him to get the doctor's recommendations he needed to get his card to start using cannabis!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Emery's Autism Impairment has been almost completely reversed on cannabis oil. He's a happy productive member of our family and he will never have to be separated from us.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>If it seems like a bold statement, then you'll understand why it's so important to make this film. Just like every other child in this world, Emery has an endocannabinoid system in his body that has evolved with the plant cannabis and when Emery uses cannabis, all of the beauty that is inside of him; you can see it, you can feel it, and he can express it.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Emery has only been able to communicate through echoing his entire life. If you asked him if he wanted Pad Thai for dinner he'd say ""maybe Rabbit will say ""how about some lunch'"" and we'd have to interpret his message. But within just a couple of months of using cannabis, I can ask Emery is he would like some Pad Thai and he'll respond with ""no"". And I'll ask if there's anything else he'd like and he'll say ""Can I please have some peanut butter toast dad?"" and ""can you cut it in 4?"".<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Because of cannabis oil, when Emery falls down, instead of acting like he's not hurting - or even bleeding - he looks up and cries out for help. For a hug and a kiss and affection and attention. To be held until he feels better. To have his hair brushed from his eyes. On days when Emery's energy brings him to a place of panic or anxiety in the morning; with a simple dose of his medicine he's back to doing age 7-12 lego sets and building his own creations that are beyond what I can do as an adult. If he's having an especially hard day mentally, another microdose can relax him enough to take a nap in my arms by noon. Yes....a Hyperlexic, Autistic, and Epileptic 4 year old that takes naps and sleeps through the night. Unbelievable?<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>It was to us too, as just like myself, Emery has a sleep disorder that is separate from his Autism and most mornings, seizures or not, he would wake up between 3 and 5am and make his way around the house turning on lights and playing with toys before we'd wake up. Then he'd be up until the next night, cranky and irritable, and never sleeping enough. By the time he was 3 he had started unlocking the front door and had actually made his way off the front porch one morning before we got to him. If we hadn't heard the door open....who knows.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Overnight, Emery went from only parallel and limited associative play to cooperative, imaginative, and fantasy play with his sister and others. Emery can even play cooperatively with other Autistic children in situations where without cannabis oil and proper nutrition, neither child would be able to play with the other. Emery eats better, sleeps better, comprehends more, communicates now in full and thoughtful sentences, seizes less and comes right out of seizures with his rescues, expresses love, makes friends, helps out around the house, and teaches us something new everyday about possibilities and how endless they truly are.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Emery couldn't have this life without cannabis. Neither could I as his father, as I am Autistic and suffer from many conditions that have been reversed with cannabis and nutrition myself. And we personally work with dozens of children that not only NEED CANNABIS TO LIVE, but cannot have a life of quality or happiness without safe and affordable access to the plant. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span>We won't rest until EVERYONE has safe access to this plant as well as informed consent to medical procedures and medications that should be considered themselves as the ""alternatives"" as they carry considerable side effects and risks.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span></span></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>
</h3>
</div>This film is really important and the reason we're producing it is simply because it doesn't exist yet but in the hearts and minds of those who have experienced what we want to express in the film. The more funding we can raise to produce the film, the better we can make the film and the more potential there will be for more films to follow that will build on and grow from each other.<br/><br/>Almost equally important in this film will be the documentation of sharing high CBD genetics. Many parents are still caught up by the hype that profit-hungry CBD companies have created that insinuate that not only is high CBD cannabis hard to find, grow, or produce, but that imported hemp-derived CBD products are safe to use and legal to use in all 50 states. <br/><br/>None of that is true. For years now there have been many high CBD phenotypes circulating the country in the 1:1 all the way up to the 30:1 range including phenos like AC/DC, Cannatonic 4, R4, Harlequin, and more. These plants produce high CBD medicines that are exactly what people who benefit from high CBD medicines need. They are not hard to find or obtain and it's important to share that message with everyone that is willing to listen to it.<br/><br/>We have the opportunity to pick up a high CBD Cannatonic phenotype that is in the 100:1 CBD range, which to the best of our knowledge is the highest CBD phenotype in the country, and we're going to document the propagating and sharing of this phenotype. The person who originally discovered this strain has already been sharing it and it's all over the place already. We simply want to show everyone that it's happening, and that it's real.<br/><br/>Yet, we're not doing this to promote CBD as a medicine. That's already been done, thus the hype. What we're here to do is promote THC and other cannabinoids as medicine. And as we've had more success treating Epilepsy and Autistic impairment with higher THC ratios, we want to make sure everyone knows that we need to THE WHOLE PLANT, and plants that express many different cannabinoid ratios, to treat these conditions and to protect our children's brains. And we are involved in the lives of many families that are excited to be a part of the film.<br/><br/>We only need enough money for a car rental and for fuel and food on the road. We can cover the other expenses on our own if we need to. We're hoping to raise much more than our goal however so that we can purchase additional equipment like cameras to use in the vehicles, hotel rooms for hot showers, good sleep, and a place to scrub footage, bail/bond money, and anything else we might need to finish the film.<br/><br/>It's up to all of you though. We want this to be HUGE. Help us make it that big!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><div>
<h3>
<span><br/></span>The Impact</h3>
<p><span><span><br/></span>For some bizarre reason, there is not a state in this country that recognizes Autism as a qualifying condition to use cannabis medically, except in the case of California where doctors can prescribe cannabis to anyone they feel will benefit medicinally.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>That's not to say that activists in some states aren't fighting and working hard to add Autism to the list, but with the endless stream of anecdotal and peer-reviewed evidence that proves that Autistic people function better using cannabis, it isn't something we should have to fight for. It's something we should be embracing right away.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Our aim with this film is to bring Autism into focus and show that it's not just about preventing seizures for these kids or regulating behaviors, it's about regulating hormones, neuronal activity, growing new brain cells, super-charging mitochondria....it's about kids being happy and comfortable in their bodies for the first time. It's about the possibility of an entirely impossible future for Autistic families.<span><br/></span></span></span><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""><span><br/></span><span><br/></span>Risks &amp; Challenges<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span></p>
</div><div>
<p><span>I could go to prison for this work. I could be taken from my family for the rest of my life. I think about it often, please don't think that I don't. I've been in a raid and I've been attacked by the Police and the courts and the system in general my entire life. But I take that risk simply by using Cannabis myself. I take that risk by using Cannabis for my son, even though it's legal for both of us to use it. But realistically, every single person takes this risk every day regardless of the way we choose to live until we end the War on Drugs.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>I also think about the risk I would be taking by not using Cannabis for myself or my child, and how it would negatively affect our futures. I think about children all over the country being put on dangerous drugs by doctors that have sworn oaths to ""do no harm first"" when their are natural options like cannabis that work better and protect the brain. Children that don't have the option to use cannabis because if their parents are caught providing it to them, they can be kidnapped by the State and put into foster homes with a 1 in 3 or greater chance of being abused and neglected while their parents are prosecuted and in some cases incarcerated.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>We want to do our part to end this war and to help a future generation to have the opportunity to heal the way we've seen so many heal already. And we have quite a few families who are eager to share their stories and their successes!<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span><br/></span></span></span></span></p>

</div></div>","My name is Martin Wuest. I live with my wife and children in Michigan. We have been growing and making Cannabis medicines for several years and have been working with people to treat and reverse many unique and complex conditions, as well conditions that are more common than others, like pain and anxiety.In the Spring of 2014 we started working with our son's new friend friend Noah to treat his Autism and Dravet Syndrome with higher THC cannabis and nutrition. Noah was on several AEDs and supplements as well as a 20:1 CBD oil at the time, and while his seizure control was very good, Noah's neuronal activity was anything but ""good"" and he was suffering every day. Noah did not communicate and was very obsessive, compulsive, and hyperactive. He had no comprehension, he defied and attacked those around him, and his coordination and motor skills were very limited. I felt that the CBD was too high in ratio for Noah and after doing a bit of research, I began to feel intuitively that children with Autism may often benefit more from the higher THC ratios as the THC redirects the neurons in a way that is more manageable for Autistic persons.We started Noah the next day on a higher THC ratio with added THC-a....and the helmet came off. Noah's new life started that day. He could smile, he could sit still, he could calm down, he could communicate, he could cry, he could hug, he could listen.....he could be a little boy. Noah is 4.5 years old and has come from being developmentally less than 18 months old to about 30 months old in less than 6 months. For months he would have new milestones every week, catching up cognitively where he was prevented from growing and learning before.We slowly added in more CBD into Noah's mixed strain oils until we learned that Noah benefited most from a 1:3 CBD:THC ratio from mixed strains and a 2:1 Cannatonic phenotype made into oil, but the higher THC ratio was important at night as Noah was able to stop taking his 7mg dose of Melatonin and sleep through the night without seizure activity. During the day Noah seems more focused and better able to learn with the 2:1 Cannatonic. We acknowledge though that his brain and his body will change throughout the years to come and he may need different ratios and medicines.Noah and his mom Lisa have become good friends of ours over the months and we have grown together and branched out to help dozens of other Autistic and Epileptic families, as well as families of children with cancer and other serious conditions and diseases. But to our surprise, it was what we learned about our own 4 year old son Emery through our work with other Epileptic children that would change our lives forever.Emery has had an Autism diagnosis since Spring of 2014. We knew then that we would work as hard as possible and do whatever it took to make sure that Emery's Autism, or features of his impairment, would qualify him for two doctor's recommendations so that he could use cannabis legally under our supervision. We knew then that it would change everything for him.We had felt since Emery was a baby that he was on the Autism spectrum, and we learned later on that his teaching himself to read and putting together 100 and 300 piece puzzles from memory by age two correlated to Hyperlexia, but it wasn't until around the time of his Autism diagnosis that he started to express ""Rage"". Emery is a big kid, in the 97th percentile for height, and he's as strong as a bull. So when we started receiving punches, kicks, and headbutts for simply trying to put him in his carseat, or for trying to comfort him....it was very hard on the heart, on the soul.And when Emery's 2 year old sister would try to comfort him, and be projected across the room or thrown down on the ground and jumped on, it defeated our souls on some days. Emery was going to have to be separated from his sister on a permanent basis. We were already looking for land up north where we could just live and farm on, with more room for separate houses or trailers. We didn't feel like Emery was digressing mentally, but we had to face the facts that whatever was happening to him, our little genius was going through the same stages that we saw many other kids with his diagnosis go through before things like self injury behavior and bolting became an issue.When Emery was 2 months old I witnessed a seizure from a reaction to his first dTap shot. We were only picking and choosing vaccines, and it was only going to be PC and dTap. We had only done a limited amount of research and were comfortable with those vaccines. That was the only time I was ever sure Emery had actually had a seizure, although through the years we became concerned about the way he would ""wake himself"" at night and seem stiff for up to a minute or more or roll his eyes back a little. Sometimes he would wake up screaming and start and stop for seemingly no reason. But these types of movements and actions aren't what people typically think of as seizure activity.It wasn't until Lisa and some of the other parents we worked with noticed how often Emery would fall for no reason or would seem to space out and walk into something. We realized from talking to other parents that this wasn't a feature of his Autism, and why would it be? We started paying more attention to what we thought could be seizure activity, and sure enough, the convulsions actually started to evolve around that time into something we could recognize more easily. He was definitely having seizures, not bad dreams, and we had simply never known. We immediately scheduled Emery an appointment with a neurologist, one that unfortunately wasted Emery's precious time for over four months before we found a great neurologist that we could trust to help him. While Emery's Epilepsy is not yet diagnosed, his seizure diagnosis was enough for him to get the doctor's recommendations he needed to get his card to start using cannabis!Emery's Autism Impairment has been almost completely reversed on cannabis oil. He's a happy productive member of our family and he will never have to be separated from us.If it seems like a bold statement, then you'll understand why it's so important to make this film. Just like every other child in this world, Emery has an endocannabinoid system in his body that has evolved with the plant cannabis and when Emery uses cannabis, all of the beauty that is inside of him; you can see it, you can feel it, and he can express it.Emery has only been able to communicate through echoing his entire life. If you asked him if he wanted Pad Thai for dinner he'd say ""maybe Rabbit will say ""how about some lunch'"" and we'd have to interpret his message. But within just a couple of months of using cannabis, I can ask Emery is he would like some Pad Thai and he'll respond with ""no"". And I'll ask if there's anything else he'd like and he'll say ""Can I please have some peanut butter toast dad?"" and ""can you cut it in 4?"".Because of cannabis oil, when Emery falls down, instead of acting like he's not hurting - or even bleeding - he looks up and cries out for help. For a hug and a kiss and affection and attention. To be held until he feels better. To have his hair brushed from his eyes. On days when Emery's energy brings him to a place of panic or anxiety in the morning; with a simple dose of his medicine he's back to doing age 7-12 lego sets and building his own creations that are beyond what I can do as an adult. If he's having an especially hard day mentally, another microdose can relax him enough to take a nap in my arms by noon. Yes....a Hyperlexic, Autistic, and Epileptic 4 year old that takes naps and sleeps through the night. Unbelievable?It was to us too, as just like myself, Emery has a sleep disorder that is separate from his Autism and most mornings, seizures or not, he would wake up between 3 and 5am and make his way around the house turning on lights and playing with toys before we'd wake up. Then he'd be up until the next night, cranky and irritable, and never sleeping enough. By the time he was 3 he had started unlocking the front door and had actually made his way off the front porch one morning before we got to him. If we hadn't heard the door open....who knows.Overnight, Emery went from only parallel and limited associative play to cooperative, imaginative, and fantasy play with his sister and others. Emery can even play cooperatively with other Autistic children in situations where without cannabis oil and proper nutrition, neither child would be able to play with the other. Emery eats better, sleeps better, comprehends more, communicates now in full and thoughtful sentences, seizes less and comes right out of seizures with his rescues, expresses love, makes friends, helps out around the house, and teaches us something new everyday about possibilities and how endless they truly are.Emery couldn't have this life without cannabis. Neither could I as his father, as I am Autistic and suffer from many conditions that have been reversed with cannabis and nutrition myself. And we personally work with dozens of children that not only NEED CANNABIS TO LIVE, but cannot have a life of quality or happiness without safe and affordable access to the plant. We won't rest until EVERYONE has safe access to this plant as well as informed consent to medical procedures and medications that should be considered themselves as the ""alternatives"" as they carry considerable side effects and risks.   What We Need & What You Get

This film is really important and the reason we're producing it is simply because it doesn't exist yet but in the hearts and minds of those who have experienced what we want to express in the film. The more funding we can raise to produce the film, the better we can make the film and the more potential there will be for more films to follow that will build on and grow from each other.Almost equally important in this film will be the documentation of sharing high CBD genetics. Many parents are still caught up by the hype that profit-hungry CBD companies have created that insinuate that not only is high CBD cannabis hard to find, grow, or produce, but that imported hemp-derived CBD products are safe to use and legal to use in all 50 states. None of that is true. For years now there have been many high CBD phenotypes circulating the country in the 1:1 all the way up to the 30:1 range including phenos like AC/DC, Cannatonic 4, R4, Harlequin, and more. These plants produce high CBD medicines that are exactly what people who benefit from high CBD medicines need. They are not hard to find or obtain and it's important to share that message with everyone that is willing to listen to it.We have the opportunity to pick up a high CBD Cannatonic phenotype that is in the 100:1 CBD range, which to the best of our knowledge is the highest CBD phenotype in the country, and we're going to document the propagating and sharing of this phenotype. The person who originally discovered this strain has already been sharing it and it's all over the place already. We simply want to show everyone that it's happening, and that it's real.Yet, we're not doing this to promote CBD as a medicine. That's already been done, thus the hype. What we're here to do is promote THC and other cannabinoids as medicine. And as we've had more success treating Epilepsy and Autistic impairment with higher THC ratios, we want to make sure everyone knows that we need to THE WHOLE PLANT, and plants that express many different cannabinoid ratios, to treat these conditions and to protect our children's brains. And we are involved in the lives of many families that are excited to be a part of the film.We only need enough money for a car rental and for fuel and food on the road. We can cover the other expenses on our own if we need to. We're hoping to raise much more than our goal however so that we can purchase additional equipment like cameras to use in the vehicles, hotel rooms for hot showers, good sleep, and a place to scrub footage, bail/bond money, and anything else we might need to finish the film.It's up to all of you though. We want this to be HUGE. Help us make it that big!

The Impact
For some bizarre reason, there is not a state in this country that recognizes Autism as a qualifying condition to use cannabis medically, except in the case of California where doctors can prescribe cannabis to anyone they feel will benefit medicinally.That's not to say that activists in some states aren't fighting and working hard to add Autism to the list, but with the endless stream of anecdotal and peer-reviewed evidence that proves that Autistic people function better using cannabis, it isn't something we should have to fight for. It's something we should be embracing right away.Our aim with this film is to bring Autism into focus and show that it's not just about preventing seizures for these kids or regulating behaviors, it's about regulating hormones, neuronal activity, growing new brain cells, super-charging mitochondria....it's about kids being happy and comfortable in their bodies for the first time. It's about the possibility of an entirely impossible future for Autistic families.Risks & Challenges

I could go to prison for this work. I could be taken from my family for the rest of my life. I think about it often, please don't think that I don't. I've been in a raid and I've been attacked by the Police and the courts and the system in general my entire life. But I take that risk simply by using Cannabis myself. I take that risk by using Cannabis for my son, even though it's legal for both of us to use it. But realistically, every single person takes this risk every day regardless of the way we choose to live until we end the War on Drugs.I also think about the risk I would be taking by not using Cannabis for myself or my child, and how it would negatively affect our futures. I think about children all over the country being put on dangerous drugs by doctors that have sworn oaths to ""do no harm first"" when their are natural options like cannabis that work better and protect the brain. Children that don't have the option to use cannabis because if their parents are caught providing it to them, they can be kidnapped by the State and put into foster homes with a 1 in 3 or greater chance of being abused and neglected while their parents are prosecuted and in some cases incarcerated.We want to do our part to end this war and to help a future generation to have the opportunity to heal the way we've seen so many heal already. And we have quite a few families who are eager to share their stories and their successes!

<p>My name is Shereese and I’m
addicted to science. It started as a fascination while watching the discovery channel

SciBuy is yet another way that I can share my passion for science with others. These
handmade products are visually stunning and have an interesting scientific

<p><b>Fabric and Accessories</b>: The first handmade items I’ve been making
are wallets. These require custom made fabric for the outside, commercially
available canvas for the lining, and extra structural features making up the
skeleton of the wallet.</p>
<p><b>Images</b>: At the moment I have to purchase a seller’s license for
each image I use. My plan is to eventually curate images directly from
scientist and build a library of even more amazing prints. But for now I must
buy these rights.</p>
<p><b>Emergency Fund</b>: Hopefully my sewing machine doesn’t quit on me, but
in case it does I want to be ready. I will also likely need to replace various attachments
over time.</p>
<p><b>Online Presence</b>: This includes buying a domain name, paying for
digital book keeping, and upgrading my weebly website to an e-store.</p>
<p><b>Professionalism</b>: I would like business cards and a business mailing
address to make SciBuy that much more legit. </p>
<p><b>Personalization</b>: Screen printing equipment can be used to personalize
and customize just about anything—and it’s lots of fun to do!</p>
<p><b>Image Enhancement</b>: The images I purchase are already stunning, but it’s
sometimes hard to capture all of the detail of those images on fabric using my basic
camera phone. A new camera and some photo editing software will go a long way
in helping me render accurate depictions of each product for online platforms.</p>
<p><b>Studio Upgrades</b>: My “studio”, a.k.a. the corner of my bedroom where
I create, could use some much needed organizers, a larger desk to use as a
workspace, and an industrial iron for making my products look even more
professional.</p>
<p><b>Transaction Fees</b>: Indiegogo and paypal will be taking a small cut
of whatever I raise, so I’ve built that into the fundraising budget.</p>
<p><b>Insufficient Funds</b>: If I don’t reach my funding goal any money raised
will be applied to as many of the aforementioned categories as possible.</p>
<p><b>Surplus Funds</b>: If I exceed my goal any excess funds will be used to
purchase more images (I currently have 116 on my wish list) and more custom
fabric.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><h2><b>What You Get</b></h2>
<p>Each perk listed will have the
motto “I Heart Science” emblazoned across it as either a screen printed or laser
printed image. This image features a thin microscopic slice of an actual heart
and will be sold specifically for this campaign. Perks include stickers, flash
drives, mugs, and more!<b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p><p style=""display: inline !important;"">                                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1352933/files/20150403125035-I__heart_science_no_line.jpg?1428090635"" src="""" style=""width: 281px; height: 281px;""/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><h2><b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></h2>
<p>Starting anything new is
always a risk—and I say, “bring it on!” Because SciBuy will primarily be an
online store it creates two challenges: the first is letting my target market
know that I’m on the scene; the second is connecting with my costumers
personally. One way that I’ll be able to find customers more easily is through relying
upon my social (and scientific) network, namely you lovely people. Another way
is by using a trusted online platform like Etsy to help find buyers who enjoy
having handmade goods. Social media will also be combined with in-person
selling at local maker-fairs to help build community</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><h2><b>Other Ways
You Can Help</b></h2>
<p>What if you are not able to
contribute financially at the moment but you still want to help? That’s a great
question! One easy way to help is by sending me your positive and encouraging
words through comments, emails, or on social media, in order to give me an
extra boost motivation and inspiration. Also, by sharing this campaign with
your friends and family, and through social media, you can help me extend my
reach even further. </p>
<p>If you’ve read this far, you’ve
already shown me a <i>ton</i> of support so
THANK YOU!</p>

workspace, and an industrial iron for making my products look even more
professional.
Transaction Fees: Indiegogo and paypal will be taking a small cut
of whatever I raise, so I’ve built that into the fundraising budget.
Insufficient Funds: If I don’t reach my funding goal any money raised
will be applied to as many of the aforementioned categories as possible.
Surplus Funds: If I exceed my goal any excess funds will be used to
purchase more images (I currently have 116 on my wish list) and more custom
fabric.
What You Get
Each perk listed will have the
motto “I Heart Science” emblazoned across it as either a screen printed or laser
printed image. This image features a thin microscopic slice of an actual heart
and will be sold specifically for this campaign. Perks include stickers, flash
drives, mugs, and more!                                      Risks &
Challenges
Starting anything new is
always a risk—and I say, “bring it on!” Because SciBuy will primarily be an
online store it creates two challenges: the first is letting my target market
know that I’m on the scene; the second is connecting with my costumers
personally. One way that I’ll be able to find customers more easily is through relying
upon my social (and scientific) network, namely you lovely people. Another way
is by using a trusted online platform like Etsy to help find buyers who enjoy
having handmade goods. Social media will also be combined with in-person
selling at local maker-fairs to help build community
Other Ways
You Can Help
What if you are not able to
contribute financially at the moment but you still want to help? That’s a great
question! One easy way to help is by sending me your positive and encouraging
words through comments, emails, or on social media, in order to give me an
extra boost motivation and inspiration. Also, by sharing this campaign with
your friends and family, and through social media, you can help me extend my
reach even further. 
If you’ve read this far, you’ve
already shown me a ton of support so

At least I will be once I get it up and running again. 8 years ago, a divorce and pretty serious injury at work, marked the end of one life and the beginning of a new one. I had spent 8 years making medieval plate armor for people that fought in it. At it's peak I had people fighting in my armor, literally, all over the world.  After giving up everything to the divorce and spending a year recovering from the injury at work, I've spent until now getting my life and my family back on it's feet. Over the last few of years I've been learning the art of knife making and forge work from a friend who turned out to be my mentor in the forge.</p>
<p>I just recently moved out of my apartment into a nice house with a 2 car garage.. I mean work shop. Now that I have a place to work, I hope to rebuild my business to what it was and then some. In addition to getting back into armor smithing, I plan to explore more about knife making and black smithing.</p>
<p>I've decided on the amount of $3000. All of this is for tools and materials. I've managed to reacquire some of my lost tools and most of what I can't get back I can make. There are a few pieces, however, that I can't make.  An <a href=""http://www.oldworldanvils.com/anvils/workhorse.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">anvil</a> is at the top of that list. The anvil is the center of the smiths shop. There are a great many things that can be used in place of an anvil but number of tools necessary to accomplish what one anvil will, is a little silly. Second on the list is a belt grinder. While I can built the grinder as a whole I need a few pieces in addition to a small arc welder to put it together.  And last on the list is a forge. I'd like a nice coal forge but the mess from working with coal is prohibitive. So I'll stick with a <a href=""http://www.majesticforge.com/knifemaker_forges_products.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">small gas forge</a> for now. Again, If I need to, I can build most of it but there are a few pieces that I'll need to purchase. Whatever is left after those few things will go to hand tools and materials, both sheet steel and bar stock.</p>
<p>In the event that I am unable to achieve my goal, all of the funds that I do collect will still go to as much of the list as it possible, starting with a smaller anvil. I'll just adjust it to include more parts so that I can build what I need. </p>

<p>A project like the longest, fastest and kinkiest zipline will definitely attract more tourists and adrenalin junkies to the Kingdom of Lesotho. The zipline is not seasonally bound like skiing activities are bound to the winter season, so tourists will visit Lesotho throughout the year. If tourists can visit throughout the year it will definitely impact the local businesses positively.</p>
<p>Jala's management has been involved in projects like AfriSki for over ten years and has managed to create a resort that attracts over 500 people per day during the winter season (June - August). The resort ensures job opportunities for the communities (75 people in summer and 200 people during winter). The zipline will insure at least 5 full time job opportunities. AfriSki provides a platform for communities to do business with tourists in synergy with its own operations.</p>

<p>Entrepreneurship and sustainable job creation is what Emcee believes will alleviate poverty and eliminate most of the social problems in Southern Africa. Emcee, Nathanaël and the rest of their team members are focused on starting sustainable companies that can create jobs and set the platform for people to become entrepreneurs. <br/></p>
<p>Emcee started to collect used cooking oil in 2007 to pay for his university studies. In 2009 he, his father and Nathanaël started a recycling company called Kabusha Recycling. Kabusha manufactures biofuel used in industrial burners and currently has 35 people working for the company .</p>
<p>Since January 2014, Kabusha is transforming into an ecosystem for change; with the objective that humans develop towards an entrepreneurial culture, improving productivity by empowering humans.

Jala Investment Network Limited (www.jala.co.ls OR www.jalanetwork.com) is a Lesotho registered public company that is focused on uplifting the Basotho people by creating sustainable job and investment opportunities. Jala helps develop tourism attractions like the AfriSki Ski resort (www.afriski.net) in Butha-Buthe, Lesotho, the only ski and adventure resort in Southern Africa. Instead of giving money to the communities and keeping the communities dependent on donations, we want to use the money donated to create sustainable businesses for the communities. The Kingdom of Lesotho has a lot of tourism potential, but it has to be developed. 
Jala is working on the longest and fastest zipline in the world. This will be any adrenalin junkie’s dream. The zipline will be a total length of 3.2 kilometers but with a twist… Adrenalin junkies will go down the zipline in a faced down, Superman position and will reach speeds in excess of 170km per hour on the first 2 kilometers of the zipline, making a u-turn around a post without stopping and continuing on the last 1.2 kilometers length down to the AfriSki resort.





The funds raised in this campaign will be used to develop and manage the zipline on the communities' behalf. The community will hold shares in the zipline and Jala based on the funds raised. The profits will be re-invested in similar tourist attractions. The zipline will also make sure that tourists visit the resort throughout the year which will uplift existing local community businesses and create more job opportunities.  What We Need & What You Get
An amount of $300 000 is needed to finance the infrastructure, the engineering expenses, the equipment, and running costs of the project. The project will sustain itself once it is up and running. Jala has private investors to co-finance the project. This project will definitely ensure that more tourists visit the area and that will impact the community businesses positively.

Every dollar contributed will give you one entry into the lucky draw. The prize will include travel costs from any of the mayor cities in South Africa or Lesotho, accommodation, activities at the resort and three meals per day.
Donate money and build a legacy in Lesotho.

We still need 299 780 people to contribute US$ 1 towards the Zipline Community project to reach our goal of $300 000.
In a world with a population of 7 billion, it means that 0.0042827143% of the world population must each contribute $1 to achieve our goal. Impossible? Maybe.... but you will never know if you haven't tried.
The power of $1 can be more than you think! 
Donors have the option to have their names included on the ""Wall of Thanks"" - A ""Wall of Thanks"" will be available on Jala's website and a granite wall listing all the donors will be erected at the Zipline site.
""Main Sponsor"" perk:
One company has the chance to be listed as the main sponsor of the Zipline. The Zipline will carry the main sponsor's name for a period of 5 years.  The zipline will be advertised as  (Your Company Name) AfriZip Zipline. The main sponsor's name and logo will be listed as the ""First Main Sponsor"" on the top of the website and on the granite wall on site.
""Company Logo"" perk:

Companies can select the ""Company Logo"" perk. Have your company logo on the website ""Wall of Thanks"" and on the granite ""Wall of Thanks"" on site.

The donor clubs:
Other donors have the option to have their names included in ""clubs"" (The Dassie Club will not be on the granite ""Wall of Thanks"" on site but it will be on the website). 
The donation clubs will be as follow (the clubs are based on the scarcity of the animals in Lesotho):
1, $1 - Dassie (Hyrax) Club


2. $10 - Porcupine Club



3. $50 - Baboon Club



4. $100 - Caracal Club



5. $250 - Zebra Club


6. $500 - Lion Club


7. $1000 plus - Leopard Club


Donors' names can be listed in multiple clubs.
The Impact
A project like the longest, fastest and kinkiest zipline will definitely attract more tourists and adrenalin junkies to the Kingdom of Lesotho. The zipline is not seasonally bound like skiing activities are bound to the winter season, so tourists will visit Lesotho throughout the year. If tourists can visit throughout the year it will definitely impact the local businesses positively.
Jala's management has been involved in projects like AfriSki for over ten years and has managed to create a resort that attracts over 500 people per day during the winter season (June - August). The resort ensures job opportunities for the communities (75 people in summer and 200 people during winter). The zipline will insure at least 5 full time job opportunities. AfriSki provides a platform for communities to do business with tourists in synergy with its own operations.

Management Team
Emcee Nell
Emcee is a South African Chartered Accountant. Emcee is currently working for the PIN Group of companies and is a director of Jala Investment Network Limited.  He worked for KPMG South Africa from 2011 - 2013 and for KPMG USA in January 2014 to February 2014 where he audited various listed and unlisted companies in the following industries: 
Mining
Micro lending and banking
Renewable Energy
Vehicle trading
Manufacturing
Government
Entrepreneurship and sustainable job creation is what Emcee believes will alleviate poverty and eliminate most of the social problems in Southern Africa. Emcee, Nathanaël and the rest of their team members are focused on starting sustainable companies that can create jobs and set the platform for people to become entrepreneurs. 
Emcee started to collect used cooking oil in 2007 to pay for his university studies. In 2009 he, his father and Nathanaël started a recycling company called Kabusha Recycling. Kabusha manufactures biofuel used in industrial burners and currently has 35 people working for the company .
Since January 2014, Kabusha is transforming into an ecosystem for change; with the objective that humans develop towards an entrepreneurial culture, improving productivity by empowering humans. This project is being rolled out to the rest of the PIN Group of companies and Jala as well. A volitionally driven management style is used, empowering humans by provoking their volition towards higher willpower. Supervisors and managers are to pose ‘just-right’ challenges which enhance willpower and mobilise action. Occupational Intelligence (OI) is the level of responsibility with which humans react to these challenges and tasks they are occupied with. 
The A2B model is being put into practice, which is a psycho-social and neuron-scientific research based on six levels of Occupational Intelligence. This implementation received a “World best practice” award from Asoka Foundation - the global association of leading Social Entrepreneurs –for transforming human beings from being in a state of complete incompetent dependence, to innovative socially responsible leaders and entrepreneurs

Risks & Challenges



This zipline will be the first of its kind in the world, therefore the challenge is to ensure that the professionally designed system is safe for the public! The safety of the public is first priority, therefore a top team of engineers has been appointed. The engineers follow statutory guidelines and before the zipline can be opened to the public, a series of tests will be done to ensure the zipline is safe and secure.  The tests will be done under various weather conditions with all parameters tested to the limits before the green light will be given to open the zipline to the general public. 


    Other Ways You Can Help

Spread the word! Send this project's link to as many people as you can and share the project on all forms of social media.
Tell your friends and family about the project and how it will contribute to the communities of Lesotho. If we can get more tourists to visit the Kingdom of Lesotho, it will impact the country and the communities positively.

Jefferson County, population of approximately 660,000 and the largest county in Alabama, has been in the news frequently regarding the billions in fees the county owes from the financing (and multiple refinancing) of its sewer system. Along with Detroit, Jefferson County has been one of the largest municipal county bankruptcies in the U.S.  http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/11/all_jefferson_county_sewer_cus.html


The main question in these proceedings is whether the county tax payers should be forced to service $14 billion (no typo here) of sewer rate increases over the next 40 years. (A Sewer debt of $1.6 billion dollars will increase to more than $14 billion dollars).  This bankruptcy court ruling puts an extraordinary burden on some of America's poorest citizens.


So far the legal defense costs for the county tax payers' defense have come from private donations through community led fundraisers at churches and other venues around Birmingham, AL.  This online fundraiser, through Indiegogo, would create economies of scale making it more efficient to raise moneys and promote this very important cause. This is not a political campaign. This is a high profile constitutional matter where one side (the county commissioners) have already paid over $25 million in legal fees to cover this proceeding (which, like the sewer taxes, the county commissioners' legal fees are financed from the county tax payers) and the taxpayers have not had access to any resources besides charitable giving. http://www.al.com/news/birmingham/index.ssf/2014/10/short_on_cash_attorney_plans_t.html


It should also be noted that the taxpayers were forced to carry the consequences of a ""pay for play"" scandal where certain county officials were bribed by WallStreet bankers to enter into these complex financing of a sewer system that should have cost no more than $250 million (but instead is now costing taxpayers billions in dollars).  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2009/lr21280.htm

What We Need & What You Get
We need up to  $250,000 - $300,000 in funding to cover the legal costs of the Jefferson County taxpayers, which include research and administrative costs, expert witness retention, and other expenses to successfully represent the tax payers in this appeal.

Your donation will get mention in court briefs and supporting petitions filed with the court and will also be listed on the website: www.jeffcosewerdefense.com 
The ImpactAccording to the NY Times, ""government bankruptcies are rare and usually involve small single-purpose authorities and districts, not large, complicated counties with a lot of debt.""  The resolution of this case will leave a tremendous impact on (1) how courts and governments handle municipal debt; (2) the municipal bond market; and (3) whether it is constitutional for citizen taxpayers to bear the costs of financing a public entity without the ability to veto these complex financing mechanisms.Risks & ChallengesFor the past few years, we have covered the legal costs through private donations and pro bono counsel.  With your support, we can further strengthen the momentum that is on our side.  Of course, our appeal may not be successful but our efforts at drawing national and international attention to this matter have been. Other Ways You Can HelpWe appreciate your support and look forward to working with you.  If you cannot support, please do not worry.  You can always write, tweet, use Indiegogo to share this campaign with others, and send us positive energy.  Thank you so much for your consideration.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

the following business plan, which blends the best of intuition and research
and summarizes the eco-friendly practices and multi-curriculum approach that
will be implemented in my childcare. The 10 Founding Facts present a snapshot
of critical statistics that have influenced my thought process in creating a
business model I can be proud of. The primary focus of The Baby Vine is to
provide nurturing and complete care for children’s minds, bodies and spirits. One differentiating aspect to this holistic approach is the focus on organic and
environmentally sustainable practices both in foods offered as well as products
purchased. Another distinguishing factor of The Baby Vine is that it will
strive for 4-star accreditation through Parent Aware once licensed from the
State. This is the highest ranking that can be given to a center or in-home
provider and greatly exceeds basic licensing requirements commonly met by
in-home care.</p><p><b>THE BABY VINE BREAKDOWN</b><br/></p>The Baby Vine will specialize in infant/toddler care with a maximum
ratio of 3 children per 1 adult. This model allows for quality attention for
each child as they develop at their own rate and for the children’s individual
needs to be met during this critical time of their lives. An in-home
environment uniquely allows providers to adapt to individual learning within
the comfort of being in a home. The Baby Vine is located in the Diamond Lake area
of Minneapolis, MN and will service families within South Minneapolis and
neighboring communities. I have invested my savings into purchasing my first
home in this area, which was chosen specifically for it being family-friendly,
safe residential and conveniently and centrally located with close freeway
access for parents. With Pearl and Todd Parks within three blocks of the home,
the location also provides the opportunity for outdoor play and exploration. Childcare
will be on the main level, therefore allowing the children to have excellent
light exposure and comfort in the living room and main floor bedroom. <p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>IMAGES FROM PEARL PARK - </b>The Baby Vine is fortunate to have so many outdoor options for children to explore on a daily basis!<br/></p>

business model that I can be proud of.<br/></span></p><p><b><span></span></b></p><p><b><b>1.<span> 
</span></b><b>The importance of high quality early
childhood care - one of the greatest investments you can make for your child’s lifetime.</b></b></p><b>
</b><p>o<span> 
</span>Children
develop much of their capacity for learning in the first three years of life,
when their brains grow 90% of their eventual adult weight. (Karoly et al.,
1998)</p>
<p><b>2.<span> 
</span></b><b>Forming close and secure relationships
as an infant with parent and/or provider is crucial for successful long term
development.</b></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>When
we consistently and lovingly meet the needs of the young children in our care,
secure attachments are formed. Children who develop secure attachments to one
or more adults are more likely to develop positive social and emotional skills.
(Webster-Stratton, 1999)</p>
<p><b>3.<span> 
</span></b><b>Children placed in full-time childcare
spend the majority of their awake time with the childcare provider, just as
adults do while they are at their job. Parents should research providers and
find out exactly what and whom they are selecting for a primary caregiver for
their child. </b></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>The
relationships formed with significant primary caregivers become the core
context of the child’s development. Interactions between infants and caregivers
are the basis of the child’s learning and development across all developmental
domains. (<a href=""http://www.zerotothree.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zerotothree.org</a>)</p>
<p>4.<span> 
</span><b>In order to allow for consistent practices
for a child, families should look for alignment with the provider. Explore the
basis of provider’s methods, approaches and values to ensure consistent care.</b></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>The
first three years of life is a time of amazing developmental progress where
infants evolve from dependent newborns to capable toddlers. Remarkable
development can occur as babies gaze, roll, crawl and toddle through their
environments, enveloped in supportive, nurturing relationships. (<a href=""http://www.zerotothree.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zerotothree.org</a>)</p>
<p><b>5.<span> 
</span></b><b>Often parents are so focused on
academic curriculum. Music, however, is also vital for children, especially in
the early years.</b></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>Developmentally
appropriate music activates the whole child. The child’s desire for language,
the body’s urge to move, the brain’s attention to patterns, the ear’s lead in
initiating communication, the voice’s response to sounds, as well as the
eye-hand coordination associated with playing musical instruments.” (Early
Childhood Connections)</p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>Melodies
and rhythmic patterns help develop memory and when the brain is engaged, neural
pathways associated with higher forms of intelligence such as abstract
thinking, empathy and mathematics are stimulated. (Early
Childhood Connections)</p>
<p><b>6.<span> 
</span></b><b>Early communication is entirely
physical in humans; movement is our infants’ language so let’s learn how to
support it.</b></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>Movement
plays an important role in language development because early communication is
entirely physical. Babies are able to create neural pathways, particularly
across the two hemispheres through movement as they learn the concept of
spatial awareness and physical realities of their bodies. (<a href=""http://www.madacademy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.madacademy.com</a>) </p>
<p><b>7.<span> 
</span></b><b>The Baby Vine is dedicated to caring
for the little ones hearts as well as their minds. Compassion, empathy and
emotional expression are all important aspects to child development.</b></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>With
music and dance, a child will have a creative experience which involves the
expression of feelings. Young children often do not have the words to express
themselves and need positive ways to release their emotions. (Early Childhood
Connections)</p>
<p>8.<span> 
</span><b>People spend 90% of their time indoors
and most of our exposure to environmental pollutants occurs by breathing the
air indoors.</b></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>Children
breathe in a greater volume of air than adults relative to their body size.
Infants and young children breathe through their mouths, more so than do
adults, which increases their risk of pulmonary exposure to particulates and
fibers that would otherwise be filtered out in the nose.(<a href=""http://www.greenguard.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.greenguard.com</a>) </p><p></p><p>9.<span> 
</span><b>Pollutants come from activities,
products and materials we use every day. At The Baby Vine Childcare, pollutants
are kept out in the first place - by investing in top quality products that
allow long term benefits for the children in my care. </b></p><p>o<span> 
</span>By
using products bearing the GREENGUARD certification mark, parents, teachers and
school officials can rest easy knowing these products have been independently
tested and verified to meet strict emission levels of pollutants as well as
sustainably made and sourced materials for products. (<a href=""http://www.greenguard.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.greenguard.com</a><span>)</span></p><p><b>10.<span> 
</span></b><b>Food is our minds and bodies’
nourishment and source of sustenance. It is one of the highest costs for a
childcare provider which is why it is often viewed as an area to cut. When
infants start their life with all organic foods, freshly purchased and made
daily, you are supporting a lifetime of good health.</b></p><p>o<span> 
</span>A
study at Washington University in 2003 found that children who ate organic food
had 6 times lower levels of pesticides in their bodies than those who did not.
Pesticides have been connected with a broad range of health problems, including
cancer, lung disease and disorders of the endocrine and
immune system. Children under two years are more sensitive because they are consuming more food per pound of body weight than any other aged person. This can be even more alarming when research has found that mixtures of the additives in non-organic food, which are commonly found in children’s foods, have a much more potent effect on nerve cells than each additive on its own. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">(</span><a href=""http://www.goodhealth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">www.goodhealth.com</a><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">)</span></p><p><b><span>WHERE WILL THE FUNDS GO? <br/></span></b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/986851/files/20141104181449-TBV_Graph_copy.png?1415153689"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Greenguard: </b>Greenguard products have been

<p><b>Licensing: </b>Hennepin County can require in-home

<p><b>COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS &amp; GIVING BACK</b><br/></p><p>Strategy is behind every aspect of this business model, with
the giving back mentality weaved into every step. At The Baby Vine, I plan on
having quarterly food and used clothes/toy drives for families to be involved
in giving back to our community and helping those in need. Since I will not be
transporting the children other than via stroller due to safety and liability,
I intend to have quarterly family volunteer events with local non-profits whose
missions align with The Baby Vine’s values (<b>the Perks section highlights three
key local partners</b>). Another area of focus is to support the elders of our
community by intentionally pairing some of these events to focus on
inter-generational interaction which is very important to child growth and
understanding. Finally, The Baby Vine is seeking a partnership with local food
cooperatives to allow for all organic and local foods to be purchased and meals
to be made with love. All of these business elements speak to the desperate
need for community involvement and partnerships, emphasizing the importance of inter connectivity on both a human and environmental level.</p><p><b>HOW THE BABY VINE CAME TO BE - THE FULL STORY</b></p><p><b></b></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FN0MPcEQJEn8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DN0MPcEQJEn8&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FN0MPcEQJEn8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><b><br/></b><p></p><b>THE PERKS THAT KEEP ON GIVING!</b><br/><p>Rather than creating a product that you often do not need (or

<ol></ol><ul><ul>
<li><p><b><span>Freedom of Movement: </span></b>This intuitive approach believes that
respect and confidence in the child is essential and that every movement has a
purpose and is a response to a need for the child’s growth with minimal adult
interference. </p></li>
<li><p><b>2<sup>nd</sup> Step Curriculum &amp; Conflict Resolution Methods: </b>Encourages emotional awareness as
well as provides language to identify and communicate feelings in an understandable
manner for children as well as be used as tool for teaching emotional control. When
implemented by children, they follow a process that allows problem solving
between them with minimal adult interaction and guidance. These tactics can be
very beneficial for children because once they are in classroom and school age;
they are expected to have life skills which enable them to navigate their daily
tasks and challenges. </p></li>
<li><p><b>HighScope Curriculum:</b>Stems from decades of research that supports the belief that
active participatory learning for children and adults allows them to learn best
through hands-on experiences with people, materials, events, and ideas. This
supports and enhances each young person's growth in terms of
academics as well as in life skills relating to social-emotional, physical, and
creative areas.</p></li>
<li><p><b>AMAZE Diversity Early Childhood
Curriculum:</b>An anti-bias program that uses
picture books, classroom/playground activities and open-ended questions to help
children explore and understand differences in a safe and supportive
environment.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Reggio Approach:</b> Encourages pursuing the interests and curiosities that children have of
the natural environment. By expanding upon those topics, children are eager to
learn activities that can support multiple domains for their development. </p></li>
<li><p><b>Play Based Methods: </b>Allow for all 6 educational domains to be met with intentional activities
that are fun and often common for children. Informed providers are able to
accurately assess as they observe children engaging and interacting in play
based activities and many life skills are acquired through play based
approaches.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Music &amp; Movement Classes: </b>Movement and music are used as a means of delivering
essential content and encouraging various aspect of learning/development.
Through these class types, healthy physical growth is a priority as well as
reinforces academic concepts and creative expression.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Sign Language: </b>When
infants can’t communicate constructively, they get frustrated which then can
lead to meltdowns and tantrums. Baby sign language is a way to help children
communicate what they want and feel supported in their needs. Research suggests
that baby sign language might give a typically developing child a way to
communicate several months earlier than those who only use vocal communication
(<a href=""http://www.Mayoclinic.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.Mayoclinic.org</a>). </p></li>

hours of certified training and extensively researched curriculums and 
methods
related to working with infants/toddlers. The Baby Vine’s position
within the market focuses on critical areas such as life skills, social 
emotional
development, anti-bias and diversity, nutrition, as well as creating
 a safe environment with quality  equipment. By completing field 
interviews
and/or environment observations of more than 30 local top-accredited 
centers
(accredited by Parent Aware and MnAEYC) and in-home providers 
recommended by local
educators, I was able to
gain invaluable information. Through this self-driven research I have 
acquired
two key mentors who are active leaders within statewide trainings and 
have served on
educational boards striving for top quality care in the state of 
Minnesota. Below
you can find a list of associations I am a member of to ensure I am 
up-to-date
with licensing requirements and critical educational information from 
the state
of Minnesota. 
IMAGE FROM SEWARD CHILDCARE CENTER - For the past year I
 have been volunteering at this amazing, top rated childcare in South 
Minneapolis. In its earlier years, this actually is the childcare I went to when I was little! THE BEST OF INTUITION & RESEARCHAs the founder of The Baby Vine, I want to share with you
the following business plan, which blends the best of intuition and research
and summarizes the eco-friendly practices and multi-curriculum approach that
will be implemented in my childcare. The 10 Founding Facts present a snapshot
of critical statistics that have influenced my thought process in creating a
business model I can be proud of. The primary focus of The Baby Vine is to
provide nurturing and complete care for children’s minds, bodies and spirits. One differentiating aspect to this holistic approach is the focus on organic and
environmentally sustainable practices both in foods offered as well as products
purchased. Another distinguishing factor of The Baby Vine is that it will
strive for 4-star accreditation through Parent Aware once licensed from the
State. This is the highest ranking that can be given to a center or in-home
provider and greatly exceeds basic licensing requirements commonly met by
in-home care.THE BABY VINE BREAKDOWNThe Baby Vine will specialize in infant/toddler care with a maximum
ratio of 3 children per 1 adult. This model allows for quality attention for
each child as they develop at their own rate and for the children’s individual
needs to be met during this critical time of their lives. An in-home
environment uniquely allows providers to adapt to individual learning within
the comfort of being in a home. The Baby Vine is located in the Diamond Lake area
of Minneapolis, MN and will service families within South Minneapolis and
neighboring communities. I have invested my savings into purchasing my first
home in this area, which was chosen specifically for it being family-friendly,
safe residential and conveniently and centrally located with close freeway
access for parents. With Pearl and Todd Parks within three blocks of the home,
the location also provides the opportunity for outdoor play and exploration. Childcare
will be on the main level, therefore allowing the children to have excellent
light exposure and comfort in the living room and main floor bedroom. IMAGES FROM PEARL PARK - The Baby Vine is fortunate to have so many outdoor options for children to explore on a daily basis!
10 FOUNDING FACTS - The following stats have greatly influenced my thought process in creating a
business model that I can be proud of.1. 
The importance of high quality early
childhood care - one of the greatest investments you can make for your child’s lifetime.
o 
Children
develop much of their capacity for learning in the first three years of life,
when their brains grow 90% of their eventual adult weight. (Karoly et al.,
1998)
2. 
Forming close and secure relationships
as an infant with parent and/or provider is crucial for successful long term
development.
o 
When
we consistently and lovingly meet the needs of the young children in our care,
secure attachments are formed. Children who develop secure attachments to one
or more adults are more likely to develop positive social and emotional skills.
(Webster-Stratton, 1999)
3. 
Children placed in full-time childcare
spend the majority of their awake time with the childcare provider, just as
adults do while they are at their job. Parents should research providers and
find out exactly what and whom they are selecting for a primary caregiver for
their child. 
o 
The
relationships formed with significant primary caregivers become the core
context of the child’s development. Interactions between infants and caregivers
are the basis of the child’s learning and development across all developmental
domains. (www.zerotothree.org)
4. 
In order to allow for consistent practices
for a child, families should look for alignment with the provider. Explore the
basis of provider’s methods, approaches and values to ensure consistent care.
o 
The
first three years of life is a time of amazing developmental progress where
infants evolve from dependent newborns to capable toddlers. Remarkable
development can occur as babies gaze, roll, crawl and toddle through their
environments, enveloped in supportive, nurturing relationships. (www.zerotothree.org)
5. 
Often parents are so focused on
academic curriculum. Music, however, is also vital for children, especially in
the early years.
o 
Developmentally
appropriate music activates the whole child. The child’s desire for language,
the body’s urge to move, the brain’s attention to patterns, the ear’s lead in
initiating communication, the voice’s response to sounds, as well as the
eye-hand coordination associated with playing musical instruments.” (Early
Childhood Connections)
o 
Melodies
and rhythmic patterns help develop memory and when the brain is engaged, neural
pathways associated with higher forms of intelligence such as abstract
thinking, empathy and mathematics are stimulated. (Early
Childhood Connections)
6. 
Early communication is entirely
physical in humans; movement is our infants’ language so let’s learn how to
support it.
o 
Movement
plays an important role in language development because early communication is
entirely physical. Babies are able to create neural pathways, particularly
across the two hemispheres through movement as they learn the concept of
spatial awareness and physical realities of their bodies. (www.madacademy.com) 
7. 
The Baby Vine is dedicated to caring
for the little ones hearts as well as their minds. Compassion, empathy and
emotional expression are all important aspects to child development.
o 
With
music and dance, a child will have a creative experience which involves the
expression of feelings. Young children often do not have the words to express
themselves and need positive ways to release their emotions. (Early Childhood
Connections)
8. 
People spend 90% of their time indoors
and most of our exposure to environmental pollutants occurs by breathing the
air indoors.
o 
Children
breathe in a greater volume of air than adults relative to their body size.
Infants and young children breathe through their mouths, more so than do
adults, which increases their risk of pulmonary exposure to particulates and
fibers that would otherwise be filtered out in the nose.(www.greenguard.com) 9. 
Pollutants come from activities,
products and materials we use every day. At The Baby Vine Childcare, pollutants
are kept out in the first place - by investing in top quality products that
allow long term benefits for the children in my care. o 
By
using products bearing the GREENGUARD certification mark, parents, teachers and
school officials can rest easy knowing these products have been independently
tested and verified to meet strict emission levels of pollutants as well as
sustainably made and sourced materials for products. (www.greenguard.com)10. 
Food is our minds and bodies’
nourishment and source of sustenance. It is one of the highest costs for a
childcare provider which is why it is often viewed as an area to cut. When
infants start their life with all organic foods, freshly purchased and made
daily, you are supporting a lifetime of good health.o 
A
study at Washington University in 2003 found that children who ate organic food
had 6 times lower levels of pesticides in their bodies than those who did not.
Pesticides have been connected with a broad range of health problems, including
cancer, lung disease and disorders of the endocrine and
immune system. Children under two years are more sensitive because they are consuming more food per pound of body weight than any other aged person. This can be even more alarming when research has found that mixtures of the additives in non-organic food, which are commonly found in children’s foods, have a much more potent effect on nerve cells than each additive on its own. (www.goodhealth.com)WHERE WILL THE FUNDS GO? Greenguard: Greenguard products have been
independently tested and verified to meet strict emission levels of pollutants
as well as sustainably made.

o Products
include: Cribs/Toddler Convertible Beds, bookstand, table & chair set, bookshelves
& storage center, changing table
Sustainable: These
products are sustainably sourced and/or utilize recycled materials that are
eco-friendly for safe, durable products.
o Products include: Organic cotton mattresses and bedding,
glider, area rug, food equipment including bottles, trays, bowls, etc. 
Educational: These products support both academic
and social emotional development, including curriculum costs as well as reading/activity
materials. 
o Products include: Highscope Curriculum, 2nd Step Curriculum,
AMAZE Diversity Curriculum, books & learning activities.
Transportation: Due to safety and liability concerns,
I will not be transporting children within my care in a vehicle. For outdoor
exploration I intend on purchasing a stroller that can hold up to 4
infants/toddlers. 
Licensing: Hennepin County can require in-home
childcares to have their yard fenced in order for the environment to be safe
for children to play. 
COMMUNITY PARTNERSHIPS & GIVING BACKStrategy is behind every aspect of this business model, with
the giving back mentality weaved into every step. At The Baby Vine, I plan on
having quarterly food and used clothes/toy drives for families to be involved
in giving back to our community and helping those in need. Since I will not be
transporting the children other than via stroller due to safety and liability,
I intend to have quarterly family volunteer events with local non-profits whose
missions align with The Baby Vine’s values (the Perks section highlights three
key local partners). Another area of focus is to support the elders of our
community by intentionally pairing some of these events to focus on
inter-generational interaction which is very important to child growth and
understanding. Finally, The Baby Vine is seeking a partnership with local food
cooperatives to allow for all organic and local foods to be purchased and meals
to be made with love. All of these business elements speak to the desperate
need for community involvement and partnerships, emphasizing the importance of inter connectivity on both a human and environmental level.HOW THE BABY VINE CAME TO BE - THE FULL STORYTHE PERKS THAT KEEP ON GIVING!Rather than creating a product that you often do not need (or
really want), The Baby Vine wanted to do something a little different that
demonstrates its founding principles in action. Community partnerships and
leadership involvement are essential for growth and development within our
states and our nation. The following three organizational partners have been
recognized as incredible assets to the state of Minnesota and align with The
Baby Vine’s values. Go to the Perks section and see how you can select which of
the three organizations you would like to support and The Baby Vine will donate
a percentage of your donation amount on your behalf. Your gift of donation will
not only allow The Baby Vine to launch but will continue to give to those
actively making a positive impact for our communities and environment.

THE MULTI-CURRICULUM APPROACH THE BABY VINE WILL IMPLEMENT:

Freedom of Movement: This intuitive approach believes that
respect and confidence in the child is essential and that every movement has a
purpose and is a response to a need for the child’s growth with minimal adult
interference. 
2nd Step Curriculum & Conflict Resolution Methods: Encourages emotional awareness as
well as provides language to identify and communicate feelings in an understandable
manner for children as well as be used as tool for teaching emotional control. When
implemented by children, they follow a process that allows problem solving
between them with minimal adult interaction and guidance. These tactics can be
very beneficial for children because once they are in classroom and school age;
they are expected to have life skills which enable them to navigate their daily
tasks and challenges. 
HighScope Curriculum:Stems from decades of research that supports the belief that
active participatory learning for children and adults allows them to learn best
through hands-on experiences with people, materials, events, and ideas. This
supports and enhances each young person's growth in terms of
academics as well as in life skills relating to social-emotional, physical, and
creative areas.
AMAZE Diversity Early Childhood
Curriculum:An anti-bias program that uses
picture books, classroom/playground activities and open-ended questions to help
children explore and understand differences in a safe and supportive
environment.
Reggio Approach: Encourages pursuing the interests and curiosities that children have of
the natural environment. By expanding upon those topics, children are eager to
learn activities that can support multiple domains for their development. 
Play Based Methods: Allow for all 6 educational domains to be met with intentional activities
that are fun and often common for children. Informed providers are able to
accurately assess as they observe children engaging and interacting in play
based activities and many life skills are acquired through play based
approaches.
Music & Movement Classes: Movement and music are used as a means of delivering
essential content and encouraging various aspect of learning/development.
Through these class types, healthy physical growth is a priority as well as
reinforces academic concepts and creative expression.
Sign Language: When
infants can’t communicate constructively, they get frustrated which then can
lead to meltdowns and tantrums. Baby sign language is a way to help children
communicate what they want and feel supported in their needs. Research suggests
that baby sign language might give a typically developing child a way to
communicate several months earlier than those who only use vocal communication

Jann and this company will complete all orders. The closer we are to our goal helps us, but we are prepared to fill as many orders as we sell. <br/><br/>2. <b>Will this hurt my pet or loved one?</b> A: No, your pet and loved one are constantly exposed to radiation everyday from your wifi router, FM radio station, and cell phones. The collar has a simple antenna to pick up signals already in the air and read them on your smartphone. The collar is attached with a strong earth magnet, but will break at strangulation pressure. You will be alerted once your pet is on the run. GO GET THEM! The collar is not meant to let you pet roam for hours. <br/><br/>3. <b>Why is there no lock on the collar or the bracelet?</b> A: For pets, the answer is simple. People steal cars with alarms, they will steal pets. The collar is not a deterrent for horrible people. When society solves this issue, than we will all be better off. Next, the collar can be cut off with a scissor or a buck knife....what is the point? As far as people, I, Derek M. Sheldon will NOT lock a bracelet on a person no exceptions what-so-ever. I will not take away the fundamental right for a human being's freedom. Too many bad scenarios can be applied if a bracelet would lock. The Arden Collar and the Arden Bracelet are tools, not answers to complacency. You need to charge them and use due diligence.<br/></span></p>

We utilize three of the smallest yet greatest capacity Li-ion batteries current technology can offer. They are safe even if your dog or cat tries to chew the collar. The backup battery to power the backup GPS system will last one year. Understandably, running your HI-LED lights causes an extreme drain on your power resources. At a full charge, the HI-LED lights and collar will last until full battery completion, approximately 6 hours. Your blinking ""A"" light will alert you to the status of remaining battery power as well as the app. As a safe guard, while in emergency mode, once your battery has 10% remaining or less, your strobe lights will turn on every 15 minutes for a one minute cycle and then turn off. This will extend the emergency time for another 4-5 hours. If your pet depletes their battery in emergency mode, the back up GPS system will instantly take over. This will provide you with another 7-10 days of continuous tracking using standard GPS. </span></figure><p></p>

So far our tests have proved positive across the board. We also need to further test the rare earth magnet on the clasp for its breaking points in rugged environments and larger breeds. We hope to get a few great or willing dogs and cats to help us further test in our ""First Look/Beta"" Testing rewards portion. Lastly, we need to finalize and develop the Arden Collar application for iOS and Android for users and veterinary clinics. </span></p>

</div></div>","The Arden Collar™ and Smartband is the voice of your loved one in a world filled with noise. Our product isn't just about technology or the future, it’s about one of the most important family members in your life- your pet, your child, your elderly parent, or your child with autism. Imagine for a moment your loved one is lost, wandering, and alone without the ability to find their way home or able to speak. They are scared, hungry, and exposed to the harsh elements. You would give anything to help your family find their way home. That path home will be the…Arden Collar™ and the Arden Smartband. 

What would you pay for peace of mind knowing you can find your loved one anywhere at anytime? What would you do for the ability to always know you can find your family member if he or she should become lost? We hope you never  have to use the Arden Collar™ and Smartband in this way, but it will be there when you need it the most.***We will be completing all orders regardless if we hit our goal or not. We are not nameless people, Jann Arden and Derek Sheldon both have gave their word and are backing this project 100%. We take our word and our obligations very seriously. ***








What: The Arden Collar™ and the app will be available for the USA and Canada upon our production roll out in October 2015. We are working on expanding globally - so keep your paws on. A lot of people ask if this is a Canadian or US venture. The answer - both!Who: Two friends who love animals, Jann Arden a famous Canadian singer/songwriter/author, and Derek Sheldon from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania a top 50 iOS developer, got together and created the initial idea/concept for the Arden Collar™ and our main pet app Diffurence™.How: We have made it as far as we have through the support of twenty-two animal loving investors and friends from the US and Canada and our small talent team from across the globe.How Much: Retail standard Arden Collar™ starts at $149.00. Our World Arden Collar™ is $350.00. Get your early bird special now for only $129.00! PLEASE ADD $25.00 FOR EACH COLLAR OR BRACELET PERK FOR SHIPPING! THANK YOU :)Where:  There are no borders here we say. Our app development and North American headquarters are located in the suburbs of Philadelphia, PA. We also have an office in Burlington, Ontario.Why: Jann and Derek invented the Arden Collar™ for one reason, as a gateway to our world called Diffurence (sounds like Difference). Diffurence is an expansive feature rich platform, fully dedicated to one simple mission - enriching the lives of animals and their owners across the globe, including the ones who do not have owners yet but would like to. We will be using all the funds raised here to finalize the development, manufacturing, and shipping of the Arden Collar™.  After all of our obligations and orders are fulfilled, we will apply whatever remains to build and develop Diffurence. We did not invent the Arden Collar™ for self-serving monetary benefit or to create another tech gadget. We are truly committed to make a Diffurence and have a positive impact on the well-being of pets and their owners around the globe. A quote from Jann: ""The Arden Collar™ is going to give you and your family and beloved pets the peace of mind you have always wanted. Whether you're on a camping trip, a hike, at an off leash park, or traveling with your pet across country or around the world, the Arden Collar™ will help to keep your furry family members safe. If they're lost, you will be able to find them quickly and effectively using this state of the art 'wearable' technology. I will be using the Arden Collar™ on all three of my dogs for the added comfort of knowing I can find them whenever I need to. Thank you for supporting all of us at Diffurence as we make a DifFURence for animals all over the globe.""
Jann Arden on ""The Social"" Promoting The Arden Collar™ 




• Made of highly durable hypoallergenic silicone rubber ( same material as the Lance Armstrong LIVESTRONG band and the Nike Fuel band). The collar is extremly water-resistant up to 3 fathoms (18 feet) for the Golden Retriever in all of our pets. 
• A North American GPS tracker for our base/standard Arden Collar™ or a World Arden Collar™ which use the Iridium satellite network with global coverage. The World Arden Collar™ can literally track your pets while in the air, in the middle of any ocean, or in the middle of the Sahara Desert. Great for pet owners who live in heavily forested/rocky areas or large urban cites with an abundance of tall structures. 
• A GSM (WorldBand, AT&T & T-Mobile (USA), all Canadian cellular providers) cellular network connection via SIM card. We strongly believe it is important to have two systems as WiFi does not reach far enough and satellites cannot see underneath large concrete structures such as bridges or underground. 


• Our patented HI-LED (High Intensity) lighting and emergency strobe feature is visible day or night. This will be the voice for your pets who cannot speak for themselves as the lights will attract attention to them as well as illuminate them against threats such as a cars, larger animals, or other forms of danger. **See the tech specs and a look inside section for an in-depth look.** 
• Our patented HI-LED (High Intensity) lighting also works as an agent to assist with visibility when walking your dog. You can program the side LED lights to emit any color spectrum of the rainbow. This is great for runners and pet walkers at low light and night time settings, as it aids in protecting you and your pet from cars and other moving threats that may not see you. **See tech specs and a look inside section below for a cool light show demo.**

• Easy charging and a detachable charging module. We wanted to make it seamless for you to charge your Arden Collar™ without the hassle of removing the collar itself. By simply removing the front ""A"" module, you will be able to use a micro-usb connection which plugs directly into the wall or your computer. Your unit will charge quickly and with ease. The ""A"" light will always glow a specific color to let you know visually how much power you have remaining. Your collar will glow blue when fully charged, yellow to alert you that the battery is getting low, and red signaling you are out of battery power. If you forget to replace your ""A"" module and go too far, your app will alert you that you must place the ""A"" module back into your pet's Arden Collar™. If you fail to replace the “A” module after this alert and your pet wanders, there is a backup battery and standard GPS backup in the side of the collar which will last several days. The ""A"" collar is attached to the unit using strong rare earth magnets.


 • Our patented ambient air/skin/surface temperature with push notifications. We measure directly at the front of the neck, which is one of the least covered areas on an animal, for hot or cold temperatures. If your pet's readings become too high or too low, an instant alert will be sent to your smartphone. We believe in true air/area readings versus other methods. • A pedometer and gyroscope will not only display the activity level of your pet, but it will also work in tandem with our data storage in which vets can store their records and information via NFC or bluetooth. You and your vet will be able to tell exactly how much activity your pet is getting so you can track their progress over time. • A Bluetooth 4.0 LE™ chip to connect your smartphone and your Arden Collar™ together. Will work with our cloud storage system which saves and stores all of your pet's data including temperature, activity and location. 


• A NFC (near field communication) chip which is the heart of public discovery of lost pets. New iPhones (6 & 6+) and other Android phones with an NFC reader will be able to obtain quick information on your pet while in ""emergency mode"". When you activate your Arden Collar™ strobe, your NFC chip will turn on and constantly broadcast the URL (working link ex: ardencollar.com/murphy123) which can be picked up by smartphone users within 2 feet. Think of NFC as a mini radio station and your smartphone is your car radio. This information will include owners name and phone number, address, medical issues, veterinarian contact information, food preference, and notes which will provide vital information to others who are not familiar with your pet. This is their ""voice"" in the world to others who do not speak dog or cat! The best thing about this feature is you can change this information via your app or the web at anytime of day, as many times as you want indefinitely and instantly. This works great when traveling with your pet. **note this information is only available and sent out while in emergency mode to prevent misuse or abuse of your information.**
• Health record storage, veterinarian records, and immunization records are stored directly in the cloud on your collar. If you are crossing the border to the USA, or from the USA to Canada, all of your required health and pet immunization records will be stored on your collar and your app. This saves a lot of trouble carrying around paperwork which can get lost and damaged. Veterinarians using a special and separate app we are building will be able to access and store information about your pet using the NFC chip. Much like the human digital record systems at our doctors offices, vets will be able to simply tap into the collar and store information directly on the collar and in the cloud. All information will seamlessly plug into a health management system we are building for medical providers in 2015. 


• Aircraft grade aluminum coupled with a heavy duty earth magnet connection. Built to be durable and strong, yet easy for the pet owner to take on and off. Will stay on under the most strenuous conditions. 
• Completely safe for pets to use. All internal components are reinforced with a heavy duty lightweight plastic polymer, and none of our internal components contain harmful fluids - such as battery acid. We do not advise using the collar as a chew toy, however, we make it pretty darn tough! 
• Pets and people are constantly surrounded by radio waves and radiation which pass through us 1000000x a second. If you're comfortable using a cell phone, then so will your pet. The Arden Collar's radio output is about 1/10th of a normal smartphone. 
• A dual GPS backup system and battery is located toward the rear of the collar in the event an owner should forget to replace the ""A"" module and the pet becomes loose. This backup system will also take over if you should run out of battery on the ""A"" module. The backup battery is not rechargeable, however, it will have a lifespan of one year and is very easy to replace. Your app will alert you when it is time to change your backup battery. Please note this backup system will not power the HI-LED lights due to the amount of power required to illuminate the lights. 
Important F&Q about the Arden Collar and Bracelet:1. If you do not reach your goal will you still fulfill my order? A: Yes, we have a lot of pride and respect in our word. Jann and this company will complete all orders. The closer we are to our goal helps us, but we are prepared to fill as many orders as we sell. 2. Will this hurt my pet or loved one? A: No, your pet and loved one are constantly exposed to radiation everyday from your wifi router, FM radio station, and cell phones. The collar has a simple antenna to pick up signals already in the air and read them on your smartphone. The collar is attached with a strong earth magnet, but will break at strangulation pressure. You will be alerted once your pet is on the run. GO GET THEM! The collar is not meant to let you pet roam for hours. 3. Why is there no lock on the collar or the bracelet? A: For pets, the answer is simple. People steal cars with alarms, they will steal pets. The collar is not a deterrent for horrible people. When society solves this issue, than we will all be better off. Next, the collar can be cut off with a scissor or a buck knife....what is the point? As far as people, I, Derek M. Sheldon will NOT lock a bracelet on a person no exceptions what-so-ever. I will not take away the fundamental right for a human being's freedom. Too many bad scenarios can be applied if a bracelet would lock. The Arden Collar and the Arden Bracelet are tools, not answers to complacency. You need to charge them and use due diligence.

The Arden Collar™ will come in several sizes for all of your pet's needs. Small, Medium, Large, and Extra-Large. Simply, take a string and measure your pet's neck dimensions and determine the best collar for your pet. We will also offer 1"" and 2 "" extensions to provide a custom fit if needed. The collar girth will change in different sizes, however, the width will remain around 1"" to 1.5 inchs (25.4 millimeters). The weight of the extra large World Arden Collar™ is about 1 pound (454g) and will vary on different sized models .We use a light-weight heavy-duty plastic polymer shrouded with light-weight durable hypoallergenic silicone to keep the weight of the collar in check for the maximum comfort of your pet.
 

 Battery Life:The battery life of the Arden Collar™ will vary largely depending on individual usage of the collar. For example, under normal usage for tracking purposes, on average the Arden Collar™ can last up to one week (7 days) on a single charge. We utilize three of the smallest yet greatest capacity Li-ion batteries current technology can offer. They are safe even if your dog or cat tries to chew the collar. The backup battery to power the backup GPS system will last one year. Understandably, running your HI-LED lights causes an extreme drain on your power resources. At a full charge, the HI-LED lights and collar will last until full battery completion, approximately 6 hours. Your blinking ""A"" light will alert you to the status of remaining battery power as well as the app. As a safe guard, while in emergency mode, once your battery has 10% remaining or less, your strobe lights will turn on every 15 minutes for a one minute cycle and then turn off. This will extend the emergency time for another 4-5 hours. If your pet depletes their battery in emergency mode, the back up GPS system will instantly take over. This will provide you with another 7-10 days of continuous tracking using standard GPS.

Arden Collar™ PawBack ProgramPets are always developing, growing, and changing. We believe you should start protecting your pets no matter the age or size. We decided to institute a buy back program for all collars which we call PawBack. Simply return the collar to us once they out grow it, and your will receive a brand new Arden Collar™ at 30% off. 
Continuing to pay it forward, all returned collars will be refurbished to like-new condition and will be donated to in need pet organizations, shelters, and low income families. 
Really cool light show demo with Chris Mackey.


We have accomplished a great deal to date. There are of course some items we need a bit more time to perfect before we can manufacture a final production model. Upon a successful IndieGoGo campaign we can use the funding to perfect the Arden Collar™. What we completed:
We have completed the molding, plastic collar housing, silicone shroud, the HI-LED system including the ""A"" light and the side lights. We have completed the rear clasp, and most of the ""A"" module. All internal chips (gyro, pedometer, altimeter), parts, and radio antennas (NFC, Bluetooth 4.0LE, GPS) are working and functional. 
What remains:
We need further development on our ""A"" module and are working to reduce the overall size of the module. Our current model is working well, however, I think we can do better! Our ambient and area temperature system is in place and needs further testing on various other breeds of animals. So far our tests have proved positive across the board. We also need to further test the rare earth magnet on the clasp for its breaking points in rugged environments and larger breeds. We hope to get a few great or willing dogs and cats to help us further test in our ""First Look/Beta"" Testing rewards portion. Lastly, we need to finalize and develop the Arden Collar application for iOS and Android for users and veterinary clinics. 
November - December 2014:  First press is released  on CTV show ""The Social"" IndieGoGo campaign begins November 15, 2014. Jann and Derek will be working with the press to help bolster and fuel the campaign for success.
January - April 2015:  Upon successful funding campaign, we will begin final testing and R&D on the Arden Collar and procuring materials, electronics, recruiting staff,  and tooling plant to begin pre-production builds, pilot collars, and mastering quality control process. Staffing and work also begins on the Diffurence™ application. All merch is shipped in Feb. 
May - June 2015:  In this phase we will be working with our beta testers and animals to further expand real life scenarios with various breeds and owners. We will obtain raw data and feedback and finalize our collar. 

July-August 2015: Full production ramps up and all models of collars begin. This includes molds, leathers, and all handcrafted parts. Assembly will commence at the end of the run. Then we prepare for pre-packaging. 
September 2015:  Packaging and shipment to beta clients. Packaging and shipping prepared for the remaining units. 
October 2015: Begin and complete fulfillment. Launch Diffurence App.



 Once you purchase the standard Arden Collar/Bracelet™ or the World Arden Collar™/Bracelet in order to track your loved one you will need to purchase bandwidth (little signal and radio waves you use) on a GSM (ATT, T-Mobile, Bell, Rogers, etc.) cellular network, and our GPS satellite network provider. (Iridium satellite network for World Arden Collar™)Cellular Data Cost: Typically adding a device to your account is around $5-$10 USD or CAD a month. It's just like adding an iPad to your account. We will provide unregistered SIM cards of your carrier of choice. All you will need to do to activate service is to simply call your carrier of choice and provide your SIM card number. Iridium Global Coverage for World Collar is $40.00 USD per month. You will pay this directly to Iridium. 
Ask yourself, is $15 or $45 dollars a month worth total peace of mind for complete safe keeping of your loved one? 
All Collar shipping is $25.00 US and Canada.
Wristbands are $3.00 shipping to US and Canada.
Teeshirts are $5.00 to US and Canada, Premium Teeshirts are $10.00 to US and Canada.
Merch Pack is $10.00 to US and Canada.
Super Cold Merch Pack is $25.00 to US and Canada.

 
Derek Sheldon is no stranger to app development and design. As a Top 50 iOS Developer, Derek will create a top quality app for our Arden Collar™ users. We are focused on ease of use and  a simplistic design. We've thought it out and developed a revolutionary user interface to track lost pets. The Arden Collar™ app will utilize Google's street view technology. Having to find a lost pet using a small map with lines and dots is not particularly helpful, especially in strange areas or unfamiliar settings.
 Having the ability to literally see what your lost pets see in real time in tandem with our strobe lights, our app will make it very simple and easy to find your pet. The Arden Collar™ app will also allow you to constantly view your pet's collar battery status from any range and will also feature a control to change the color of your collar lights when you are walking your pet. 
The Arden Collar™ app will be available for iOS (Apple) users and Androids. We also intend to build an app for the Apple Watch™.  


















 

 

 

 

  
We did our job so well, we believe there is little to improve in our design and functionality. If we surpass our goal there are several great benefits that will do so much to improve the lives of those animals that may not have as many resources at their disposal. All profits from this campaign (minus our development and production costs) will be applied to build our platform Diffurence.
Goal One: 10,000 collars or bracelets sold: 
If we can secure over 10,000 units sold we will be offering you your choice of the following custom Arden Collar™/Bracelet colors in addition to your standard Arden blue (as seen in the above video)!

<h3><b>This all sounds great, but is it safe?</b></h3>The OddGrill team have an extensive background in commercial design and engineering and we take safety extremely seriously. Cooking in OddGrill is a unique style of cooking but is very safe and you’ll have it mastered in no time. Our comprehensive user manual will cover the dos and don’ts and absolutely everything in between from safely firing up the Grill, to handling the machine after use. We have worked exceptionally hard and have taken considerable care to ensure that OddGrill is as safe to use as any BBQ you’ll find on the market! We will of course meet all the relevant safety standards and certifications in each country that we ship to<b>. </b>
</div><div><b style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></b></div><div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Safety instructions:</b><br/>

The handy carry which we have designed means that lifting OddGrill out of its box is a breeze and at just 4kg, OddGrill can be carried short &amp; long distances single handedly ready to pop up wherever you chose!<br/>

</div>OddGrill’s gas burner was a challenging component to get right. Although skilfully designed, it is the more simplistic of the two burners in terms of operational use and maintenance. You simply can't beat the consistency or convenience of a constant, regulated flame when optimising an environment for cooking Simply turn the gas burner on and adjust the temperature to suit your cooking style.<br/>

<p>OddGrill’s charcoal burner is an engineering masterpiece and was the most challenging part of creating OddGrill. The entire burner has been designed to draw air through its body, creating an intense flame with a secondary combustion that has all the power of a mini oven flame without the need of a power sourceIt really is a pretty cool piece of engineering!</p>
<p>Using the charcoal burner is a much more traditional process, but a uniquely rewarding one. OddGrill wouldn't be true to its roots without a sustainable fuel option and we think the authentic flavor that charcoal fired cooking brings to all dishes is more than worth the effort. </p>

<h3><b>Product Warranty. </b></h3>
<p>We are confident you will be able to enjoy OddGrill with your family and friends without a hitch. However, to cover our valued customers from any unlikely and unforeseen manufacturing defects or faults, every OddGrill comes with a 1 year warranty. </p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464904425/line_smtagj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>There are always possible bumps in the road with any new product development. Maintaining the integrity of the design and high standards of quality in the materials and craftsmanship is important to us, as is staying on schedule so our customers get their OddGrills as soon as possible. </p>
<p>We've worked hard to minimize risks by first designing, creating, testing, using and improving several working prototypes in-house so that any design flaws, however minor, could be identified and solved well ahead of time.</p>
<p>Next we've carefully selected and vetted our manufacturing resources to ensure reliability, quality and scheduling is monitored and maintained throughout the process. Instead of having one factory make our product, we will source to factories that excel for each unique part and then bring everything together to assembly. </p>
<p>Finally, before the first unit ships, we'll personally perform final quality inspections so every OddGrill meets our high standards of quality and performance. </p>
<p>All that said, there's always the possibility for unforeseen delays due to circumstances beyond our control. Inclement weather can affect shipping times. Ports can become backed up with surplus cargo.</p>
<p>But no matter what, we promise to keep you informed with frequent updates on the progress of our project. So check back often to see how everything is going, and thank you again for all your support!</p>

<h3>Kevin Shark - Executive <strong>Chef</strong>
</h3>
Being a chef today is very different 
than it was even just a decade ago. Chefs used to be invisible 
workhorses hiding behind a stove, churning out glorious dish after 
glorious dish without much recognition from their diners. One thing that
 hasn't changed in all this time is the life of a chef
 -- and how very difficult it can be. Chefs work when everyone else is 
off. On their feet; without breaks; in a hot kitchen. The work is 
intense, fast-paced and demands perfection every time. Cuts and burns 
are expected. And yet, my career choice is now revered by many people 
who only wish they had the courage to devote their life to back-breaking
 long hours all in the name of good food.<br/>

<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In everyday usage, a vegetable is any part of a plant that is consumed by humans as food as part of a savory meal. The term ""vegetable"" is somewhat arbitrary, and largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition. Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and fiber.</span><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In general, vegetables benefit from a direct, high-heat grilling method. The exceptions are dense root vegetables, like potatoes and turnips that are best grilled by the indirect method or parboiled and finished over the fire.</span></p>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Preheat the BBQ over medium-low heat. Chop vegetables into desired sizes and place on vegetable skewers. Brush oil on veggies to coat all sides and season with salt and pepper. Grill the kebab for around 15 minutes, rotating every 5 minutes. Serve kebab immediately.</span><p></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is such an easy and tasty fish kebab; you can use any firm fleshed fish like cod lion, tuna or salmon. Meaty swordfish, kilic baligi, is traditionally used at home and its firm, chunky flesh really works well in the kebabs. I like to roast extra vegetables by the side to complement the fish kebabs; with some boiled potatoes aside, these fish kebabs make a delicious, impressive meal for entertaining. You can cook them over preheated barbecue, oven grill or hot griddle for 6 – 8 minutes, until they are cooked through and lightly browned.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is one of my favorite recipes for entertaining. Chicken thighs are marinated in a tangy Middle Eastern-style blend of yogurt, oil, saffron and spices, then grilled on skewers until golden brown. The kebabs are delicious over a bed of golden Basmati Rice Pilaf with Dried Fruits and Almonds, with my Couscous Salad with Apricot Vinaigrette or on top of a Greek salad. Just be sure to make extra — the first time I made this dish for a crowd, I actually ran out of food!</span></p>

Choose from four stylish colors.

It has become our iconic statement color over the past few years and we know you are going to go crazy for it! If you tend to opt for the slightly understated look and prefer your gadgets a little more sleek and stealth-like, don’t worry we’ve got you covered! 






This all sounds great, but is it safe?The OddGrill team have an extensive background in commercial design and engineering and we take safety extremely seriously.

We will of course meet all the relevant safety standards and certifications in each country that we ship to. 

Safety instructions:
1- As far as possible, place the grill on a flat surface.2- Do not use the grill in an enclosed area.
3- Do not place the motor inside the grill when it is hot.4- Make sure to use low pressure, standard LP Gas Burner Orifice for connecting the gas cylinder.5- Use special Gas Burner Orifice while using natural piped gas or cylinders.6- Always light the match or lighter before turning on the gas knob.

Light enough for one person to carry.
Portability is key issue with traditional Grill Machines. One of the biggest problems of regular Grill machines are their weight and of course their size & Volume. We knew therefore that OddGrill had to be balanced carefully in order to achieve its mission. Dense enough to work effectively but light enough for one person to carry. After almost 100 material and composition variations, we've got it just right. The handy carry which we have designed means that lifting OddGrill out of its box is a breeze and at just 4kg, OddGrill can be carried short & long distances single handedly ready to pop up wherever you chose!

Includes 2 burners: charcoal & gas.Originally, both burners were going to be sold as separate products. However, during the testing stages of OddGrill, we soon realized that both charcoal and gas offer a unique cooking experience that everyone should be able to experience right out of the box. All customers will receive both a charcoal and a gas burner Grill.

Gas Burner



OddGrill’s gas burner was a challenging component to get right. Although skilfully designed, it is the more simplistic of the two burners in terms of operational use and maintenance. You simply can't beat the consistency or convenience of a constant, regulated flame when optimising an environment for cooking Simply turn the gas burner on and adjust the temperature to suit your cooking style.

Charchoal Burner


OddGrill’s charcoal burner is an engineering masterpiece and was the most challenging part of creating OddGrill. The entire burner has been designed to draw air through its body, creating an intense flame with a secondary combustion that has all the power of a mini oven flame without the need of a power sourceIt really is a pretty cool piece of engineering!
Using the charcoal burner is a much more traditional process, but a uniquely rewarding one. OddGrill wouldn't be true to its roots without a sustainable fuel option and we think the authentic flavor that charcoal fired cooking brings to all dishes is more than worth the effort.

Risks & Challenges
There are always possible bumps in the road with any new product development. Maintaining the integrity of the design and high standards of quality in the materials and craftsmanship is important to us, as is staying on schedule so our customers get their OddGrills as soon as possible. 
We've worked hard to minimize risks by first designing, creating, testing, using and improving several working prototypes in-house so that any design flaws, however minor, could be identified and solved well ahead of time.
Next we've carefully selected and vetted our manufacturing resources to ensure reliability, quality and scheduling is monitored and maintained throughout the process. Instead of having one factory make our product, we will source to factories that excel for each unique part and then bring everything together to assembly. 
Finally, before the first unit ships, we'll personally perform final quality inspections so every OddGrill meets our high standards of quality and performance. 
All that said, there's always the possibility for unforeseen delays due to circumstances beyond our control. Inclement weather can affect shipping times. Ports can become backed up with surplus cargo.
But no matter what, we promise to keep you informed with frequent updates on the progress of our project. So check back often to see how everything is going, and thank you again for all your support!

Kevin Shark - Executive Chef

Being a chef today is very different 
than it was even just a decade ago. Chefs used to be invisible 
workhorses hiding behind a stove, churning out glorious dish after 
glorious dish without much recognition from their diners. One thing that
 hasn't changed in all this time is the life of a chef
 -- and how very difficult it can be. Chefs work when everyone else is 
off. On their feet; without breaks; in a hot kitchen. The work is 
intense, fast-paced and demands perfection every time. Cuts and burns 
are expected. And yet, my career choice is now revered by many people 
who only wish they had the courage to devote their life to back-breaking
 long hours all in the name of good food.

1- Chicken (Jujeh) Kebab


Chicken (Jujeh) Kebab is a Middle East dish that consists of grilled chunks of chicken. It is common to marinate the chunks in minced onion, lemon juice and sometimes saffron.
Chicken (Jujeh) Kebab is a popular dish in Iran and other countries in the Middle East often served on basmati rice or wrapped in lavash bread, both of which are staples in the Middle East cuisine. The former is more often served in restaurants and elaborate parties such as wedding receptions while the latter is often eaten in domestic settings, kebab joints and picnics or packed for road trips. Other optional components include grilled tomatoes, peppers (grilled or raw), fresh lemons or other vegetables.
2- Chicken Barg
Chicken Barg is a Persian style barbecued Beef or chicken kebab dish, Kebab just means “Cooking on Fire”. The main ingredients of Chicken Barg Kebab are fillet chicken breast.
The meat is cut in strips and given a special marination in olive oil, onions, saffron, salt and black pepper. It is then skewered and grilled to the perfection.
It is served with grilled tomatoes and paper on the bed of fluffy basmati rice, and butter on top of the rice. Somagh (powdered sumac) is also made available, and can be sprinkled on the rice. A dish of fresh Basil, onion and radish, served with fresh and soft flat bread, will come gratis before your meal.
You can also combine it with one skewer of Chicken Koobideh, The combination of one Chicken Barg and one Chicken Koobideh is called a Chicken Soltani, meaning “for the sultan”.
3- Chicken Koobideh

Everyone loves Koobideh Kebab, I tend to prefer Chicken Koobideh (Kebab-eh Morgh), for quick everyday meals. It is easier to make, quicker to prepare and definitely lighter in calories!
Chicken  koobideh is made using chives or green onions, parsley, salt and pepper.
Traditionally, Persian Chicken Koobideh begins with marinating chicken meat in salt, black pepper, onion, egg, saffron mixture and the other spices. Onion makes a terrific marinade, as it tenderizes the meat as lemon juice or vinegar would do.
Traditionally Persian Chicken Koobideh is served with grilled tomatoes, onions and any other grilled vegetables you like with a big bed of basmati rice. We always enjoy our Chicken Koobideh with Salad or Mast-o Khiar (Persian Yogurt with Cucumbers) and a plate of fresh herbs, onions and radishes.

4- Barg Kebab

Barg Kebab meaning Fillet Kebab is a Persian style barbecued lamb, chicken or beef kebab dish. The main ingredients of Barg Kebab are fillets of beef tenderloin, lamb shank, along with onions and olive oil.
The meat is cut in strips and given a marinade in olive oil, onions, garlic, saffron, salt and black pepper. It is then skewered and grilled. Tomatoes are grilled separately.
It is usually served with rice or bread, sometimes seasoned with sumac.
At Persian restaurants, the combination of one Barg Kebab and one Koobideh Kebab is typically called soltani, meaning ""sultan's (meal)"".

5- Koobideh Kebab

Koobideh Kebab is a Iranian meat kebab made from ground lamb or beef, often mixed with parsley and chopped onions.
Kebab means ""cooking on fire"" and koobideh refers to the style that meat was prepared, originally meat was placed on a flat stone (precisely a black flat stone) and smashed with a wooden mallet. It is cooked on skewer.
Lamb or beef (precisely 20% fat, 80% meat) is minced twice for a finer consistency. Salt, garlic powder, black pepper, celery powder, sumac, very finely grated onion (the extra juice is squeezed out and saved for later) and one egg yolk per pound of meat are added. All ingredients are mixed, covered, and left to marinate in the refrigerator for at least four hours or overnight.
Koobideh Kebab is grilled on skewers, traditionally over hot coal, and is served with basmati Rice with oil, salt and saffron, accompanied by grilled tomatoes and onions. Sumac is usually served as a tableside garnishing spice.
6- Jigar, Del & Gholveh (Lamb Liver, Kidney & Heart Kebab)

Jigar, Del & Gholveh is a traditional Iranian dish of fried lamb’s kidneys, liver and heart.
Don’t be put off by the thought of offal. This is a tasty and nutritious meal! Potatoes are an optional extra in Jigar, Del & Gholveh and a relatively recent addition to the dish. Tomatoes can also be added in summer.
7- Donbalan (Lamb testicles) Kebab 

Donbalan is the testicles of calves, lambs, roosters, turkeys, and other animals are eaten in many parts of the world, under a wide variety of euphemistic culinary names. Testicles are a by-product of the castration of young animals raised for meat, so they were probably a late-spring seasonal specialty, though nowadays they are generally frozen and available year-round.
Donbalan are known by a wide variety of euphemisms, including 'stones', 'mountain oysters', 'prairie oysters', and so on. Lamb testicles in particular are often called 'lamb fries' or simply fries (though that may also refer to other organ meats).
In Greece, Cyprus, Iran, and Turkey, lamb testicles are often grilled on coals.
8- Sheesh Leek Kebab 

Sheesh Leek Kebab is a form of Shish kebab popular in Eastern and Central Europe, the Caucasus, Central Asia, Afghanistan, India, Iran, Israel, Iraq, Mongolia, Morocco, Pakistan, Turkey, Bangladesh and other places.
Sheesh Leek (meaning skewered meat) was originally made of lamb. Nowadays it is also made of pork or beef depending on local preferences and religious observances. The skewers are either threaded with meat only, or with alternating pieces of meat, fat, and vegetables, such as bell pepper, onion, mushroom and tomato.
While it is not unusual to see sheesh Leek Kebab today listed on the menu of restaurants, it is more commonly sold in the form of fast-food by street vendors who roast the skewers over wood, charcoal, or coal. It is also cooked in outdoor environments during social gatherings, similarly to barbecue in English-speaking countries.
The meat for sheesh leek is in form of medium-size meat cubes is maintained making it similar to brochette. The meat is marinated overnight in a high-acidity marinade like vinegar, dry wine or sour fruit/vegetable juice with the addition of onions, herbs and spices. Sheesh Leek is usually cooked on a grill.
9- Chenjeh Kebab

Chenjeh Kebab which are pieces of lamb or beef tenderloin (fillet) that are grilled. It is pure meat and very similar to western steaks. Chenjeh is usually made from the meat of newly slaughtered sheep, when it’s still soft and fresh. 
Traditionally, pieces of sheep tail-fat are threaded between the pieces of the meat to add flavor and keep the meat moist. You can substitute pieces of smoked bacon cut into 2-inch pieces for a similar effect.
Marinade the meat at least 1 day prior to grilling. This is make the meat far more tender.serve with rice or Persian bread.  It is typical to garnish with a barbecued tomato with can be cooked on a skewer in similar fashion.

10- Veggie Kebab

In everyday usage, a vegetable is any part of a plant that is consumed by humans as food as part of a savory meal. The term ""vegetable"" is somewhat arbitrary, and largely defined through culinary and cultural tradition. Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition, being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates, but high in vitamins, minerals and fiber.
In general, vegetables benefit from a direct, high-heat grilling method. The exceptions are dense root vegetables, like potatoes and turnips that are best grilled by the indirect method or parboiled and finished over the fire.
Preheat the BBQ over medium-low heat. Chop vegetables into desired sizes and place on vegetable skewers. Brush oil on veggies to coat all sides and season with salt and pepper. Grill the kebab for around 15 minutes, rotating every 5 minutes. Serve kebab immediately.

11- Tomato Kebab

Persian kebabs always have grilled tomatoes accompanying them. The tomatoes are roasted over the grill using long flat skewers.
Heat a charcoal grill with coals. Spread them out in one dense layer and brush the grill with oil. Place the tomatoes on skewers, threading them through the stem of the tomato. Brush the tomatoes with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Place the tomato skewers on the grill, turning once, until seared on the outside but still firm inside, about 5 minutes.

12- Fish Kebab

This is such an easy and tasty fish kebab; you can use any firm fleshed fish like cod lion, tuna or salmon. Meaty swordfish, kilic baligi, is traditionally used at home and its firm, chunky flesh really works well in the kebabs. I like to roast extra vegetables by the side to complement the fish kebabs; with some boiled potatoes aside, these fish kebabs make a delicious, impressive meal for entertaining. You can cook them over preheated barbecue, oven grill or hot griddle for 6 – 8 minutes, until they are cooked through and lightly browned.
Be it a special meal for family or a party, Kebabs always does the trick. Fish Kebab is a very popular recipe.
If you’re cooking for a load of friends, or for a party, these kebabs will do the trick. They are so easy to make and damn tasty. Marinated in a blend of spices, they can be grilled, char-grilled or cooked on the barbie. 
13- Shrimp Kebab

Shrimp kebab are quickly marinated in a bright and tangy mixture of olive oil, tomato paste, lemon, garlic, and herbs and then grilled until plump and slightly charred.  They’re perfect for entertaining — either as an appetizer or main course — because all of the prep is done ahead of time. All you have to do when your guests arrive is throw the skewers on the grill. But be forewarned: people will eat more than their fair share. Make extra!
Tender and juicy, shrimp are a quick pick for a fresh meal.  These brightly flavored kebabs feature chunks of fresh pineapple, teriyaki sauce, shrimp, and red onions.  Serve with mashed sweet potatoes and grilled asparagus for a complete meal. 
14- Yogurt Kebab

This easy chicken kebab recipe features chicken marinated in a mixture of yogurt, lemon juice and seasonings, then grilled on skewers along with red pepper and onion.  Serve with pita bread, rice and peas to round out the meal. 
This is one of my favorite recipes for entertaining. Chicken thighs are marinated in a tangy Middle Eastern-style blend of yogurt, oil, saffron and spices, then grilled on skewers until golden brown. The kebabs are delicious over a bed of golden Basmati Rice Pilaf with Dried Fruits and Almonds, with my Couscous Salad with Apricot Vinaigrette or on top of a Greek salad. Just be sure to make extra — the first time I made this dish for a crowd, I actually ran out of food!
15- Balal (Corn) Kebab

Grilled Corn on the Cob is a popular menu item for barbecues and clambakes, and it’s easy to do. Grilled corn on the cob is not only tasty, but grilling your corn never fails to impress your guests.

Grilled Corn is especially delicious when you add herbs and spices to the ear of corn before grilling it. The herbs and spices liven up the flavors and add an interesting spin on basic roasted corn. Plus it’s easy to do - just use your favorite variety of corn!
Shuck and clean corn. Don't worry about getting every last stray piece of silk—they'll burn away on the grill anyway. Do not be tempted to brine your corn. Place the corn directly over a very hot fire and grill, turning occasionally, until charred and cooked through, about 10 minutes total. Serve immediately with flavored or plain butter and salt.
It's quick, easy, let's you keep an eye on the corn as it grills, and produces plenty of smoky, charred, grilled flavor.",76.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>Hi lovely people!  It's me, Tracy.</b></h3>
<p>Well, first, thanks for being curious enough to click on over here and see what
it is that I’m getting up to these days. 
I’m seriously giddy with excitement to be working on a new project and
hooking into a new space…well, it’s a cross between excitement and, you know,
being just sliiiiightly terrified.  Isn’t
that always how it goes?</p><blockquote>PLEASE NOTE: This is really a long, open letter instead of a traditional ""pitch"" but yes, I'm here to raise money for a new venture.  If you're more the Executive Summary type, let me sum up.  I am:<ul><li>Launching a new consulting business late spring/early summer 2016</li></ul>
<ul><li>Providing consulting services, tools, resources, etc. tailored to Inn/B&amp;B type businesses...similar to what I've been doing, but with a fresh, techy-focused twist.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Leveraging an online + Skype/phone model instead of in-person in order to help more people</li></ul>
</blockquote><p></p><div>ANOTHER NOTE:  If you're here and you see that I crossed my original goal, please don't stop reading.  While the small opening number gets me started, there is a <b>whole</b> lot more I am doing beyond that, should we exceed the initial goal...so please read on.  I appreciate your kind interest.</div><div><br/></div><h3><b>Back to my story.</b></h3>
<p></p><p>So yes, I’ve been working for the past few months on a brand spankin’ new business.  It’s not <em>entirely</em> new, but fresh enough around the edges that it’s been a bit like starting over.  You know, if I were starting over in a new country, learning a different language, and eating with my non-dominant hand.  Whilst bouncing on one foot.  Which is to say that it’s been a LOT of learning, research, planning, and poking around in some new things that – until now – have remained a bit of a mystery to me.</p><p>For the past 15+ years, I’ve been consulting with and growing small businesses and solo entrepreneurs; helping provide strategic business planning and marketing bench strength where these smaller operations don’t have it and can’t afford to hire it full time.  I’m great in these scenarios – an experienced utility player, able to both zig and zag, find creative solutions, and make things happen – and I truly love supporting these fabulous, passionate entrepreneurs and particularly the hospitalitiarians (a Stephanie March-ism that I’ve adopted).  This industry has my heart.</p><p>Anyway, the past year has been about reinvention – looking at me, my services/talents, my audience, how I want to show up for these folks, and all that related jazz.</p><p>And I realized one stupidly important thing: I am only one person.  Which means that the traditional consulting model stinks for helping many people/many businesses.  </p><p>So?  I’m setting out to change that.  (This isn’t a cloning exercise; you can breathe again.)</p><p></p>
<h3><b>What is it, already?</b></h3>
<p></p><p>Later this spring/early summer, I’ll be launching an online-based community to provide consulting services, resources, tools, and support to businesses in the hospitality industry.  This community will (eventually) be something a client pays to participate in, on a monthly/ongoing basis.  They’ll get all kinds of online schtuff, but they’ll also get me, one-on-one, just via phone or Skype instead of in person.  This means I can keep it simple - for me and for my clients.  The one-time project fees of the past are gone, along with the larger upfront investment those clients had to make.  But better than that, this is a truly a community – think of it as a niche-y Mastermind group – that, by nature, will provide support as well as share badass knowledge.  A community of like-minded business owners who may not have all the resources they need in house, but they sure do have a lot of smarts to share between them.  With me as their ringleader.  Orchestrator.  Ok, instigator is probably more like it.</p><p>And, while this may surprise you, I’m not talking about the restaurant industry…at least not yet.  These next clients will be in the inns/lodging category of hospitality.  Think: B&amp;Bs, ranches, lodges, guest houses, inns, and other non-traditional hotels.  </p><p>In my research, I found that resources and assistance available to these folks was rather thin on the ground and painfully, embarrassingly dated.  Dated decor, dated websites, dated approaches to marketing, dated business systems.  Discussions about social media, Millennials/GenX guests, advertising beyond the staid “reservation service agencies” are nil.  And, have I mentioned, dated?  Yea.  </p><p>There’s a lot more to it than that, but suffice it to say: there’s a giant gap here and I know how to fill it.</p><p></p>
<h3><b>Why all the fuss for $2000?  Doesn’t seem like that big a number, really.</b></h3>
<p>Here’s the thing: this business is happening.  Regardless of what transpires here over these 21 days:  IT. IS. ON.  I believe so strongly in not
only the audience and gap I mentioned above, but also in the technology and platforms
now accessible, that I will make this happen come hell or high water.  But, I really would prefer to skip the hell
and high water situation…for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>HELL = DEBT</p>
<p>- and -</p>
<p>HIGH WATER = TIME</p>
<p>Sure.  I could throw a
credit card at this problem or borrow a little cash from a slightly more liquid
pal.  But, if I’m completely honest, I
have enough debt to be getting on with. 
That’s, you know, why one goes out and works to begin with!</p>
<p>And sure, I could also delay the project until the funds
were better lined up.  But here’s what
I’ve realized in my 20+ years in entrepreneurial, innovative, mad scientist-type businesses: there are a few golden moments when
a worthy audience and a clever product present themselves together.  And for those two to show up AND to have the
money in order?  Well, that’s not usually
how that shit goes.  You take the idea,
nurture the idea, test the idea, maybe even start operating the idea, and then
you figure out how you’re really going to take that thing to town.  (We used to call it kicking the tires while you're doing 60 down the highway.)  Because time is important – both from a competitive
standpoint (get out there before someone else does) but also from a momentum
standpoint (I’m ready, man, let’s rock this out).</p>
<p>Time – that lovely, destructive word. Filled with such
gorgeous possibility and hauntingly quick passage.  Wheeeeeee.</p>
<p>So that’s why we’ve gathered here today. </p><p>Let me also mention why I'm NOT here: I'm NOT here for this ask to get beyond my own circle of family &amp; friends.  I'm NOT doing this to get funding from strangers.  I DON'T have any <i>serious</i> perks to offer, and don't want to spend any time or energy trying to be clever and coming up with stuff that's essentially just a big expense on a brand new business.  I have a few things to ante up but I really just want to say, hey, I'm doing something cool...can you help me?</p>
<h3><b>Why all the fuss and
formality and fees?</b></h3>
<p>Because I’m dead serious.</p><p></p>Due diligence is done, plans are in place, financials look solid enough to continue. Roadmap is coming together; some product testing is already underway.  Branding is just coming along but feeling solid.<div>
<br/><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I simply have a resource need I’m trying to fill (I’m thinking of you as really cool unpaid interns, feeding me good energy and maybe a little coin). </span><div> <div>But if you do decide to throw a bit of yourself into the hat – this money, after all, represents your time, the effort &amp; smarts it took you to earn it, your clever ability to hang on to it, and your decision to share it – then I consider myself accountable.  I want a little formality around that, and a campaign like this is a good mechanism to provide that structure.  I think of you as stakeholders and want to let you know how things are progressing, what investments are being made, what I’m learning, how the brand evolves, and so forth.<p></p>
<p>Oh and also, meeting/exceeding the goal means a lesser fee...funding models are finicky that way.  So I'm hoping to clear this hurdle, so to speak, with air under me.</p>
<h3><b>So, really.  This is only going to take $2000?</b></h3>
<p>Um, busted.</p>
<p>No, it’s definitely going to cost more than that.  But that’s what I need to get moving...a friendly push down the hill, a gust of wind in my sails.  When the first customers come in, they will
fund the next evolution and so forth.  I
can sling myself down the hill as quickly or as slowly as I need to.</p>
<p><i>But if we do get all wild and put a few more bucks behind
that friendly push? </i> I’m ready for that, too.  </p>

</div></div>","Hi lovely people!  It's me, Tracy.
Well, first, thanks for being curious enough to click on over here and see what
it is that I’m getting up to these days. 
I’m seriously giddy with excitement to be working on a new project and
hooking into a new space…well, it’s a cross between excitement and, you know,
being just sliiiiightly terrified.  Isn’t
that always how it goes?PLEASE NOTE: This is really a long, open letter instead of a traditional ""pitch"" but yes, I'm here to raise money for a new venture.  If you're more the Executive Summary type, let me sum up.  I am:Launching a new consulting business late spring/early summer 2016
Providing consulting services, tools, resources, etc. tailored to Inn/B&B type businesses...similar to what I've been doing, but with a fresh, techy-focused twist.
Leveraging an online + Skype/phone model instead of in-person in order to help more people
ANOTHER NOTE:  If you're here and you see that I crossed my original goal, please don't stop reading.  While the small opening number gets me started, there is a whole lot more I am doing beyond that, should we exceed the initial goal...so please read on.  I appreciate your kind interest.Back to my story.
So yes, I’ve been working for the past few months on a brand spankin’ new business.  It’s not entirely new, but fresh enough around the edges that it’s been a bit like starting over.  You know, if I were starting over in a new country, learning a different language, and eating with my non-dominant hand.  Whilst bouncing on one foot.  Which is to say that it’s been a LOT of learning, research, planning, and poking around in some new things that – until now – have remained a bit of a mystery to me.For the past 15+ years, I’ve been consulting with and growing small businesses and solo entrepreneurs; helping provide strategic business planning and marketing bench strength where these smaller operations don’t have it and can’t afford to hire it full time.  I’m great in these scenarios – an experienced utility player, able to both zig and zag, find creative solutions, and make things happen – and I truly love supporting these fabulous, passionate entrepreneurs and particularly the hospitalitiarians (a Stephanie March-ism that I’ve adopted).  This industry has my heart.Anyway, the past year has been about reinvention – looking at me, my services/talents, my audience, how I want to show up for these folks, and all that related jazz.And I realized one stupidly important thing: I am only one person.  Which means that the traditional consulting model stinks for helping many people/many businesses.  So?  I’m setting out to change that.  (This isn’t a cloning exercise; you can breathe again.)
What is it, already?
Later this spring/early summer, I’ll be launching an online-based community to provide consulting services, resources, tools, and support to businesses in the hospitality industry.  This community will (eventually) be something a client pays to participate in, on a monthly/ongoing basis.  They’ll get all kinds of online schtuff, but they’ll also get me, one-on-one, just via phone or Skype instead of in person.  This means I can keep it simple - for me and for my clients.  The one-time project fees of the past are gone, along with the larger upfront investment those clients had to make.  But better than that, this is a truly a community – think of it as a niche-y Mastermind group – that, by nature, will provide support as well as share badass knowledge.  A community of like-minded business owners who may not have all the resources they need in house, but they sure do have a lot of smarts to share between them.  With me as their ringleader.  Orchestrator.  Ok, instigator is probably more like it.And, while this may surprise you, I’m not talking about the restaurant industry…at least not yet.  These next clients will be in the inns/lodging category of hospitality.  Think: B&Bs, ranches, lodges, guest houses, inns, and other non-traditional hotels.  In my research, I found that resources and assistance available to these folks was rather thin on the ground and painfully, embarrassingly dated.  Dated decor, dated websites, dated approaches to marketing, dated business systems.  Discussions about social media, Millennials/GenX guests, advertising beyond the staid “reservation service agencies” are nil.  And, have I mentioned, dated?  Yea.  There’s a lot more to it than that, but suffice it to say: there’s a giant gap here and I know how to fill it.
Why all the fuss for $2000?  Doesn’t seem like that big a number, really.
Here’s the thing: this business is happening.  Regardless of what transpires here over these 21 days:  IT. IS. ON.  I believe so strongly in not
only the audience and gap I mentioned above, but also in the technology and platforms
now accessible, that I will make this happen come hell or high water.  But, I really would prefer to skip the hell
and high water situation…for obvious reasons.
HELL = DEBT
- and -
HIGH WATER = TIME
Sure.  I could throw a
credit card at this problem or borrow a little cash from a slightly more liquid
pal.  But, if I’m completely honest, I
have enough debt to be getting on with. 
That’s, you know, why one goes out and works to begin with!
And sure, I could also delay the project until the funds
were better lined up.  But here’s what
I’ve realized in my 20+ years in entrepreneurial, innovative, mad scientist-type businesses: there are a few golden moments when

formality and fees?
Because I’m dead serious.Due diligence is done, plans are in place, financials look solid enough to continue. Roadmap is coming together; some product testing is already underway.  Branding is just coming along but feeling solid.

I simply have a resource need I’m trying to fill (I’m thinking of you as really cool unpaid interns, feeding me good energy and maybe a little coin).  But if you do decide to throw a bit of yourself into the hat – this money, after all, represents your time, the effort & smarts it took you to earn it, your clever ability to hang on to it, and your decision to share it – then I consider myself accountable.  I want a little formality around that, and a campaign like this is a good mechanism to provide that structure.  I think of you as stakeholders and want to let you know how things are progressing, what investments are being made, what I’m learning, how the brand evolves, and so forth.

But if we do get all wild and put a few more bucks behind
that friendly push?  I’m ready for that, too.  
In the fancy world of crowdsourcing, they
call these stretch goals.  Let me hum a few bars for you:



With $2000, I'm in business.  Literally.


With $3500, I'm in business with better design (graphic +
web), a much more functional community platform, and more promotion/outreach options.


With $5500, we’re stepping onto a fast track to getting things like webinars, podcasts, and other communications built up - like a library - and, ready to go.


And something in the neighborhood of $10000 gets us talking
about more content from other sources, developing live/in person presentations tied to industry
events, more professional/scalable technology systems, and so forth.  And it gets me a

</figure><h1>Why a paper notebook?</h1>
<p>Just the act of writing down an idea on paper makes it more real and gives it value in a way that digital format does not. There's so much digital media these days that it it feels fleeting, less permanent. When we make a note on our phones we often completely forget it's there. </p>

<p>We find that when you write all your ideas down in one place where you can see them all together, you start to have more ideas and draw connections between them. <b>The key to having great ideas is having a lot of ideas, so all ideas—even the bad ones—serve a purpose. </b>This is harder to do in digital format because it's not as easy to flip through and see things. Also for us, it's more fun to sketch and draw on paper. And you can look back at your notebook for years to see what your thinking was at that time.</p>

It's a simple, 3-step system to generate and evaluate ideas, keep them organized, and then design and plan them.The Hatch notebook will help you find an idea that you’re passionate about and then take action on it.Hatching ideas requires a blend of creativity and practicality, inspiration and perseverance. Hatch is a place for both—it has enough structure to guide you, but also the flexibility to allow for all different types of people to use it for their creative endeavors.Organize all your ideas in one place  If you're like us, your ideas end up in all different places—blank notebooks, dry erase board, napkins—you know how it goes. Without an organized system, it's hard to know which ideas are good, or how excited you are about a particular idea. With the Hatch notebook, you’ll be able to see all your ideas at a glance and decide which ones you’re excited about.
We’ve found that having one place for all our ideas helps generate more ideas, and make connections between them.



Bringing an idea to life can be an emotional roller coaster. The Hatch notebook will keep you committed and inspired throughout the process!



How does it work?
 
There are 3 steps in the Hatch process.

 
STEP 1: ConceiveFirst, you list your ideas by category to create an unorthodox table of contents as you enter page numbers. As you fill in the excitement & difficulty levels of each idea, you’ll be able to see which ones might be worth pursuing at a glance.


Conceive - TOC page

There are also blank dot grid pages that you can use to brainstorm and mindmap to generate new ideas. And, we’ve included some tips & suggestions for how to get the ideas flowing in the back of the notebook (just in case you get stuck!)

Conceive - Brainstorm page

STEP 2: IncubateNext, evaluate and define your ideas by answering some questions. This will help you figure out which ones you’re most passionate about (and most viable) and want to Hatch.

STEP 3: HatchHere, you'll fill out your project specs and an action plan that will keep you moving forward. Then you can use the blank pages to sketch, take notes, code, write, or anything else that's part of your process. Dream big, be creative, and have fun!

We're still finishing the content for the Guidelines, tips & resources section, and are open to suggestions for what you'd like to see!

Our Inspiration & Process



We came up with this idea about a year ago, and started using a basic version to organize our own ideas. We quickly found that having one place for all our ideas helped us generate more ideas and make connections that we wouldn’t have otherwise. Also, we found that just the act of writing down an idea made it more real and helped us stay committed.
Over the past year, we've created and used several prototypes, sought feedback from different types of makers, and continually refined and revised the concept. We’ve learned so much about book binding and printing. It's come quite a long way from the initial spark, and we've enjoyed the process.
How did we get from Foodie Dice to Hatch? On the surface, these two products might seem unrelated, but at their core they both inspire creativity and a sense of adventure, and that's our ultimate goal.

</div></div>","My name is Lisa LaPoint. Valentino came into my life as a young child - he and my daughter had been close ever since 5th grade. He always had a great smile and was a good kid.  He was even better as a young adult - very respectful, and we considered him part of our family.  I loved when he walked in my house and always said ""Hi Mom"",  it brought a smile to my face every time.  He was an incredible person and very giving.  He was also a very special friend to my daughter - and she misses him every day.

Valentino (Tino) Hemmatianpour was shot on June 9th stopping a robbery.  Tino was only 21 years old and his un-selfish act got him killed.  Valentino will always be a hero to everyone he touched, and will be dearly missed.

As young as Valentino was (of course) no one is prepared to bury their 21 year old son.  We are trying to help the family by raising some money to help with the added cost this has caused the family.  

Please give what you can knowing that you are helping a great cause. Whatever you give will be grately appreciated by Tino's mother, Selena Jimenez and family. If you are not able to make a donation, please help spread the word to your friends and neighbors.  By all means use Facebook, Twitter, texting, emailing, or calling your friends to help spread the word.  Thank you for your support and assistance.

<p><strong><strong><strong>WHO IS WATER FOR WASLALA</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>Water for Waslala (WfW) was founded in 2004 by a group of Villanova University students who traveled to Waslala, Nicaragua on a service break trip and witnessed both extreme poverty in Waslala as well as inspiring people filled with strength, generosity, and sense of community. They returned to the U.S. with a feeling of responsibility to help the Waslalan people meet the basic of access to clean drinking water, one of the most acute problems in Waslala.</p>
<p><span>Since WfW's inception, we have constructed <em><strong>14 water systems</strong> </em>in Waslala and provided clean water to more than <strong><em>2,600 people</em></strong>. One of the next water systems to be built will be in the San Jose Dipina region of Waslala.</span></p>
<p><span><span>WfW has set its sights on <strong><em>2030</em></strong> as the date by which we would like to achieve Water for Waslala and </span><span>end the water crisis for all 56,000 Waslalan residents. Such an end date will require Water for Waslala </span><span>to <strong><em>provide roughly 3,000 Waslalans with clean water each year for the next 18 years</em></strong> - a pace that we plan to initiate in 2013.  </span>Over the next 20 years, we will need to raise least <em><strong>$6 million to provide every Waslalan man, woman, and child with clean drinking water for a lifetime.</strong></em> </span></p>

<strong>WHERE IS WASLALA?</strong><span><br/></span>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Waslala is a remote region located in central Nicaragua. Traveling to Waslala from the capital of Managua involves a seven-hour journey on treacherous, muddy mountainside roads. Waslala is home to 56,000 residents, most of whom live in the 90 rural villages outside the town center. Nearly all communities are only accessible by hiking or riding mules for hours through the humid rainforest.</div>

</ul>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Most Waslalans live in extreme poverty and lack access to even the most basic human needs: clean water, electricity, telephones, sanitation, and health care. Many men, women, and children are therefore needlessly suffering and dying every year of preventable waterborne diseases.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>These problems are typically solved through government action; however, Waslala’s municipal government is devoid of the resources and expertise needed to implement water infrastructure in all 90 rural communities. For all of these reasons, the Waslalan water crisis represents the most acute issue facing the Waslalan people – now, and even more so in the future. </div>
</div>
<div>
<div class=""column"">
<p><strong><strong><strong>WHAT IS OUR ASK?</strong></strong></strong></p>
<p><span>Water for Waslala (WfW) is looking to raise $2,500 to help fund the construction of an extension to one of our planned water systems in San Jose Dipina in the improvised municipality of Waslala, Nicaragua. When the full system is complete it will supply clean water to 4 schools, 58 houses, and a total of 370 people.</span></p>
<p><span>In San Jose Dipina, problems relating to water are two-fold: lack of water safe for human consumption, and the need to fetch water from far distances. Currently, people in San Jose Dipina drink water from local streams but their access is so far downstream from the source that the water has become contaminated. Most contamination is caused by human or animal waste, from the many dairy cattle in the region, and agro-chemicals used in the cultivation of staple food crops. Additionally, these streams are located far away from the schools and houses putting a significant time and physical burden of gathering water on the women and children of the community.<br/></span></p>
<p><span>Through the construction of a water system, the men, women, and children, in San Jose Dipina will gain access to a constant supply of fresh, clean drinking water directly at their homes or school. </span></p>

<p><strong>WHY WATER FOR WASLALA? WHY SAN JOSE DIPINA</strong></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>When the entire San Jose Dipina water system is completed, the 370 beneficiaries will immediately reap an array of tangible benefits that will dramatically improve quality of life of families in the region. Such benefits include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Improved access to water</strong>: by having a faucet located outside their homes and schools, beneficiaries will be able to consume greater quantities of water each day by having more convenient, regular access to drinking water. </span></li>
<li><span><strong>Safe water</strong>: for the first time in their lives, 370 people will have access to drinking water that is free of contamination. Having access to safe water will help reduce infant mortality rates due to the expected reduction in water-borne deaths in the region. </span></li>

<li><span><strong>Community organization and cohesion</strong>: By working together to form a management committee, write a set of bylaws governing the use of the water system, and contributing their own “sweat equity” to the project by volunteering their labor to construct the water system, the project will foster a greater sense of community organization and solidarity. </span></li>
<li><span><strong>Education of health and hygiene</strong>: Water for Waslala’s local project team in Waslala conducts health and hygiene workshops before and after the project is completed. This education carries the tangible benefit of helping community members better manage their own health by developing safe personal hygiene habits. </span></li>

I Notre Histoire
 
Le Carlie, c'est d'abord une rencontre, une rencontre autour d'un verre entre Charlie et Carole dans un troquet bourguignon. De cette rencontre naquirent d'autres verres, autres lieux,autres régions, autres vins, autres bières, un bar à vins ici, une planche par là, Bourgogne, Bordeaux, Languedoc, Australie, Nouvelle-Zélande, Epoisses, Cantal, jambon fumé du Morvan, micro-brasseries. Une découverte d'endroits et de saveurs. De cette rencontre et de ces lieux émergea une idée, deux idées, trois idées, une envie, et puis cette phrase tant prononcée à une heure généralement tardive :
 
WE SHOULD BUY A BAR!!!!!!!  (et si on achetait un bar)
 

 
 Cette simple phrase anodine est cependant devenue une envie de changer de vie, puis un projet et un matin, de nombreuses négociations, des rendez-vous bancaires multiples, pas mal de visites, nous y voilà avec notre local là devant nous, une multitudes d'idées, plein d'énergie et d'envie pour faire de «  Le Carlie » une réalité à vous faire découvrir. Un lieu de rencontres, de découvertes, de partage, de dégustation...

II Le Carlie (Et Les Dessous de Carlie...) :

 

 
Le Carlie est un bar situé au cœur du 3iéme arrondissement dans la rue Saint Martin à coté du musée Beaubourg. Si nous parvenons à atteindre nos objectifs et les fonds nécessaires, voici nos engagements ( toute ressemblance avec un candidat à la présidence de notre république est une coïncidence) L'ouverture si tout se passe bien sera pour septembre 2013 !!!!!
 

 
 
 A. Le Carlie : produits du terroir, qualité et ambiance
 
 Nous Charlie et Carole avec Le Carlie, nous ferons du rez-de-chaussée, un espace convivial et chaleureux, du bois, des barriques, des tables hautes, des tables basses, des lumières chaudes, des jambons pendus au plafond, un endroit qui sentira bon l’authenticité, les bons produits et un accueil toujours souriant.

 Nous Charlie et Carole avec Le Carlie, nous vous offrirons des vins de qualité, nous irons chercher nos produits à travers les nombreux vignobles français et autres. Nous nous engageons à vous offrir pour des prix appréciables des vins conçus par des amoureux de la vigne, nous vous raconterons l'histoire de ces vins, de ces producteurs et vous ferons voyager à travers les cépages du monde. Nous nous engageons à varier les appellations, et à ajouter de nouvelles découvertes régulièrement. Il y aura des surprises, des étonnants, des inattendus et toujours une valorisation du produit et du savoir-faire.
 

 
 
Nous Charlie et Carole avec Le Carlie, nous vous concocterons des cocktails de qualité, avec des produits frais, des dosages judicieux, sans la prétention d'un bar à cocktail mais avec la garantie d'une surprise agréable à chaque commande ( que les personnes ayant déjà bu un mojito raté lèvent la main!!!!!!)

 Nous Charlie et Carole avec Le Carlie, nous vous préparerons une sélection de rhums arrangés, toujours maison et dans le respect de la tradition. Produits frais, rhums arrangés évolutifs selon les saisons .

 Nous Charlie et Carole avec Le Carlie, sans prétention d'un bar à bière, nous nous engageons à vous trouver à coté de classique toujours efficace, des découvertes, des bières de micro-brasseries, des nouvelles saveurs pas toujours si loin de chez nous !!!!.

 Nous Charlie et Carole avec Le Carlie, nous veillerons à ce que les produits de nos planches, charcuteries, fromages, baguettes...) ne soient pas des produits industriels. Nous irons vous dénicher des petits producteurs soucieux de respecter le produit et gardien d'un certain savoir-faire. Les planches sentiront le terroir et le frais. Toujours en mouvements, nous continuerons tout au long de notre activité de multiplier les découvertes, les produits, les saveurs pour vous offrir toujours une qualité irréprochable et contribuer à récompenser l'économie locale.
 

 
 Nous Charlie et Carole avec Le Carlie, nous vous offrirons une ambiance musicale toujours agréable, festive dans les heures plus tardives, des concerts acoustiques auront lieu régulièrement et des DJ sets viendront pimenter les soirées.

 Nous Charlie et Carole avec Le Carlie, nous vous offrirons une programmation de soirées variées, des événements culturels, vernissages, dégustations.... auront lieu tout au long de l'année.

B. Les dessous de Carlie : intimiste et secret, à la découverte des choses rares

 Nous Charlie et Carole, si notre projet va au bout, nous vous ferons découvrir Les Dessous de Carlie, un espace secret et intime, une partie interdite, une partie privée et confinée ou l'on fera des découvertes, des dégustations inédites, nous aimerions vous en dire plus....mais il faut garder une part du mystère...


III Pourquoi nous avons besoin de vous ?

Ces promesses, nous nous engageons à les tenir, mais pour cela nous avons besoin de vous !!!!! Aujourd'hui, nous avons obtenu la signature du local et le financement d'une partie des travaux par une banque qui a eu confiance en nous.
 

                                         (Et oui, y a du boulot!!!!)
 
Le chemin jusque là a été difficile : notre jeune âge et les conditions économiques actuelles nous ont valu des refus, de nombreuses négociations, des concurrents sur ce local avec une expérience et un budget plus solide. Mais notre projet a plu et finalement notre propriétaire et notre banquier ont décidé de nous accorder notre chance malgré un manque de trésorerie...
 
 Soyez acteur du premier bar participatif à PARIS!!!!!
 
C'est pourquoi nous avons décidé de faire appel à vous pour mener cette aventure !!!!! (avec des contreparties bien entendu:) )

Qu'est ce qu'il nous manque aujourd'hui ?
 Environ 20 000 euros
A quoi vont servir vos contributions ? 


En priorité nous permettre de payer nos premiers fournisseurs et de vous dénicher les meilleurs produits


Financer une partie des travaux qui ne sont pas encore compris dans le budget (rénovation de la devanture complète, réisolation phonique d'une partie du plafonds... les travaux seront en fonction du montant récolté)



  IV Comment nous aider et les contreparties : faites partie de l'aventure !!!!!!

Vous souhaitez nous apporter une contribution financière :


choisissez un des packages (ou aucun si vous souhaitez contribuer anonymement ou sans contrepartie)


Un mur des donateurs sera créé dans le bar où tous les noms des participants apparaitront


Venez profiter de votre apéro chez nous, nous vous accueillerons avec plaisir et passerons du temps ensemble !!!!


Les fonds seront bien sur intégralement redistribués si le projet pour quelques raisons n'aboutissait pas (mais essayons de ne pas penser à cette option, nous y arriverons!!!!)


ps : selon les goûts de vos papilles gustatives, les boissons des contreparties peuvent être discutées

 
 
Vous souhaitez nous aider autrement :
 


Parler-en à vos amis, à vos collègues, à tout votre entourage pour soutenir notre projet, aux médias même (nous somme preneurs!!!!)


Rejoignez nous sur Facebook et invitez vos amis : www.facebook.com/LeCarlie


Et sur Twitter (et oui il faut bien...) : @LeCarlie


Si vous souhaitez organiser un événement, une exposition, vous jouez de la musique, vous avez un groupe, vous souhaitez juste nous envoyer un petit email de soutien (parce que cela fait du bien!!!), passez nous voir pendant les travaux pour nous apporter un petit macaron ou discuter un peu écrivez nous à lecarliebar@gmail.com.


Votre oncle produit du vin, un ami à vous a une mirco-brasserie, votre voisin fait d'excellents fromages de chèvre, n'hésitez pas à nous mettre en contact !!!


Des idées de chansons ou de groupe pour notre playlist, envie d'entendre la dernière petit trouvaille musicale chez nous ? Envoyez vos suggestions, on sera ravi de les intégrer : lecarliebar@gmail.com


Vous êtes graphiste, web designer, vous aimez dessiner et avez plein d'idées nous sommes à la recherche d'une personne pour dessiner notre logo, le développer (son design n'est pas encore arrêté) nous aider avec notre site web, n'hésitez pas à nous contacter et nous envoyer vos propositions, devis, essais...

 


Le mot de la fin : Voilà j'espère que nous vous avons (un peu) conquis, et que nous pourrons mener cette aventure ensemble. Nous espérons à travers Le Carlie vous offrir des bons moments, des ambiances chaleureuses, dans ambiances festives, que Le Carlie soit pour vous un QG, un endroit de passage, un lieu d'apéro ,de fête ou de fin de soirées nous souhaitons que pour tous il soit un lieu ou l'on se sent bien. Nous espérons également mettre en avant les bons produits, les amoureux de la vigne et de leur terroir, valoriser et vous faire découvrir (même rencontrer) le travail de producteurs qui contribuent à la richesse des goûts et des saveurs. 
Quant au bar Les Dessous de Carlie.....on vous attend....

Ouverture en Septembre 2013 si tout se passe bien !!!!!
 
                                                          A très bientôt....

The shop will also offer cakes and desserts for birthdays and other special occasions, as well as take home and bake items such as cookie dough and buttery tart dough.</p>
<p>Since this neighborhood has been our home for almost 10 years and is now where we are choosing to raise our daughter, it is very exciting and important for me to have this chance to expand my role as a part of the Bernal Heights community.

este un oraș frumos. Dar frumusețea lui este ascunsă după indiferența noastră
față de spațiile publice. Orașele au nevoie de spații publice în care oamenii
să se întâlnească, să interacționeze sau pur și simplu să se odihnească,
spații care creează siguranță și confort. În Chișinău, confortul se termină în
pragul casei sau localului nostru preferat. Spațiile publice urbane degradează,
iar oamenii devin tot mai îndepărtați de propriul oraș.</span></p>
<p>Primăria nu prea
are timp să se ocupe de aceste spații, așa că un grup de inițiativă și-a propus
să reamenajeze un scuar din centru orașului pentru a-l face mai atractiv pentru
locuitorii și oaspeții capitalei.</p>
<p> Noi vrem să transformăm acest spațiu în unul
pentru oameni. Dacă chișinăuienii și oaspeții orașului vor alege să petreacă
clipele lor de liniște și fericire în acest loc (să citească, să creeze, să
comunice, să iubească, să facă poze, să filmeze spoturi, să cânte și să
danseze) – să știți că scopul nostru a fost realizat. </p>
<p><b>Scuarul Cehov – potențial de atracție maximă </b></p>
<p>Acest scuar este
amplasat chiar în centrul orașului, la intersecția străzilor Mitropolit Varlaam
cu Vlaicu Pârcălab. Lângă hotele, centre comerciale, cafenele, o universitate
și la câțiva pași de parcul Catedralei: o zonă 
de maximă atracție pentru chișinăuieni, dar mai ales pentru străini (turiști,
oameni de afaceri, diplomați). În această zonă, zilnic, circulă între 5 și 10 mii
de pietoni. Dar rar cine intră în acest spațiu. Și mai puțini sunt cei care se
opresc acolo. </p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/849250/files/20140911030007-foto1.jpg?1410429607"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Acest scuar este
un spațiu gol și urât. El nu folosește absolut la nimic, în afară de loc pentru
veceu pentru câini și pisici. Din cauza mașinilor parcate și a trotuarului
spart, pietonii sunt nevoiți să meargă în zigzag sau să iasă pe carosabil. Iar dacă
ești cu cărucior pentru copii sau în scaun cu rotile nu ai nicio șansă să treci
prin zonă.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/849251/files/20140911030044-foto3.JPG?1410429644"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>În afară de
parcări, tufari și gunoi, scuarul Cehov mai are o problemă: lipsa utilităților.
Cel mai mult se simte lipsa iluminatului și a locurilor pentru așezat.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/849254/files/20140911030250-foto4.jpg?1410429770"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Recent, am format
un grup de inițiativă care și-a propus să reamenajeze și să revitalizeze
această zonă urbană astfel încât oamenii să treacă prin scuar și, poate, să se
oprească acolo.  Pentru că oamenii au
nevoie de spații frumoase. </p>
<p>Amplasarea
băncilor, a felinarelor, repararea și amenajarea trotuarelor și a trecerilor
pietonale – sunt lucruri foarte simple, care fac spațiul public mai confortabil
și mai sigur.  Când apare o
infrastructură pietonală normală, oamenii încep a merge pe jos. Acolo unde
totul e plin de mașini și nu ai unde te așeza, pietonii nu au ce face. Iar orașul
fără pietoni este un oraș lipsit de viață. </p>
<p><b>Probleme și soluții</b></p>
<p>Pentru prima
etapă ne propunem să amenajăm câteva bănci, urne pentru gunoi, iluminare și să
facem o curățenie generală. De asemenea vrem să organizăm aici o zonă de wi-fi
gratuit. </p>
<p>Costurile
aproximative pentru aceasta au fost estimate la <b>15,000</b> de dolari. Cu acești bani am
putea procura un mobilier urban de calitate, am putea acoperi costurile
lucrărilor de amenajare și alte cheltuieli curente. Banii vrem să îi adunăm de
la chișinăuieni, în cadrul unei campanii de crowdfunding, dar și de la eventuali
sponsori și parteneri. </p>

<p>Кишинев - красивый город. Но его красоты не видно из-за
нашего безразличия к общественным местам. Города нуждаются в общественных
местах, где люди могут встречаться, общаться или просто отдыхать. Эти <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">места </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> должны создавать чувство безопастности и комфорта. В Кишиневе, комфорт
заканчивается перед порогом собственного дома или любимого заведения.
Общественные места города деградируют, а люди все более отдаляются друг от
друга и от своего города.</span></p>
<p>Примэрия не уделяет внимания этой проблеме, поэтому
инициативная группа задалась задачей обустроить один из скверов в центре
столицы, чотбы сделать его более привлекательным для жителей и гостей
столицы.  </p>
<p>Мы хотим превратить это место в место для людей. Если
кишиневцы и гости города захотят провести моменты спокойствия и
счастья (читать, творить, общаться, любить, фотографироваться, снимать клипы,
петь и танцевать) - значит мы достигли цели.</p>
<p><b>Сквер Чехова - место с высочайшим потенциалом</b></p>
<p>Этот сквер расположен в самом центре города, на пересечении
улиц Митрополит Варлаам и Влайку Пыркэлаб. Рядом находятся отели, коммерческие
центры, кафе, университет, парк Кафедрального Собора. Это зона максимального притяжения для кишиневцев, но еще больше для иностранцев
(туристы, преприниматели, дипломаты). Через этот сквер ежедневно проходят 5-10
тысяч пешеходов. Несмотря на это, мало кто здесь <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">останавливается </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">.</span></p>
<p>Этот сквер - пустое и некрасивое место. Из-за припаркованых на тротуаре
машин и ям, пешеходы вунуждены ходить зигзагами или выходить на проезжую часть.
Если же у вас детская или инвалидная коляска то у вас ни одного шанса пройти здесь.</p>
<p>Кроме парковок, 
кустов и мусора, сквер Чехова имеет еще одну проблему: отсутстивие
удобств. Больше всего чуствуется отсутствие освещения и скамеек.</p>
<p>Недавно, мы создали нициативную группу которая задалсь
задачей обустроить и возродить эту городскую зону чтобы люди могли ходить в
сквер, проводить здесь время. Потому что людям нужны красивые общестенные места. </p>
<p>Установка скамеек, фонарей, ремонт и обустройство тротуаров
и пешеходных переходов - простые но очень важные элементы комфорта и
безобастности общественного места. Когда появляется нормальная пешеходная
инфраструктура, люди начинают ходить пешком. Там где полно машин и негде присесть,
пешеходам делать нечего. А город без педходов это город без жизни.</p>
<p><b>Проблемы и решения</b></p>
<p>Для первого этапа мы намерены установить несколько скамеек,
мусорных урн, освещение и навести генеральную уборку. Также будет организована
зона с бесплатным wi-fi. </p>
<p>Стоимость этих удобств оценена в 15 000 долларов. На эти
деньги можно купить качественную парковую жителей города мебель, оплатить установочные работы и
текущие затраты. Деньги мы хотим собрать у жителей города в ходе кампании по сбору
средств, но и у потенциальных спонсоров и партнеров. </p>

<p>1) Очистка деревьев и обустройство газона</p>
<p>2) Ремонт тротуара</p>

de maximă atracție pentru chișinăuieni, dar mai ales pentru străini (turiști,
oameni de afaceri, diplomați). În această zonă, zilnic, circulă între 5 și 10 mii
de pietoni. Dar rar cine intră în acest spațiu. Și mai puțini sunt cei care se
opresc acolo. 

Acest scuar este
un spațiu gol și urât. El nu folosește absolut la nimic, în afară de loc pentru
veceu pentru câini și pisici. Din cauza mașinilor parcate și a trotuarului
spart, pietonii sunt nevoiți să meargă în zigzag sau să iasă pe carosabil. Iar dacă
ești cu cărucior pentru copii sau în scaun cu rotile nu ai nicio șansă să treci
prin zonă.

În afară de
parcări, tufari și gunoi, scuarul Cehov mai are o problemă: lipsa utilităților.
Cel mai mult se simte lipsa iluminatului și a locurilor pentru așezat.

Recent, am format
un grup de inițiativă care și-a propus să reamenajeze și să revitalizeze
această zonă urbană astfel încât oamenii să treacă prin scuar și, poate, să se
oprească acolo.  Pentru că oamenii au
nevoie de spații frumoase. 
Amplasarea
băncilor, a felinarelor, repararea și amenajarea trotuarelor și a trecerilor
pietonale – sunt lucruri foarte simple, care fac spațiul public mai confortabil
și mai sigur.  Când apare o
infrastructură pietonală normală, oamenii încep a merge pe jos. Acolo unde
totul e plin de mașini și nu ai unde te așeza, pietonii nu au ce face. Iar orașul
fără pietoni este un oraș lipsit de viață. 
Probleme și soluții
Pentru prima
etapă ne propunem să amenajăm câteva bănci, urne pentru gunoi, iluminare și să
facem o curățenie generală. De asemenea vrem să organizăm aici o zonă de wi-fi
gratuit. 
Costurile
aproximative pentru aceasta au fost estimate la 15,000 de dolari. Cu acești bani am
putea procura un mobilier urban de calitate, am putea acoperi costurile
lucrărilor de amenajare și alte cheltuieli curente. Banii vrem să îi adunăm de
la chișinăuieni, în cadrul unei campanii de crowdfunding, dar și de la eventuali
sponsori și parteneri.

Кишинев - красивый город. Но его красоты не видно из-за
нашего безразличия к общественным местам. Города нуждаются в общественных
местах, где люди могут встречаться, общаться или просто отдыхать. Эти места  должны создавать чувство безопастности и комфорта. В Кишиневе, комфорт
заканчивается перед порогом собственного дома или любимого заведения.
Общественные места города деградируют, а люди все более отдаляются друг от
друга и от своего города.
Примэрия не уделяет внимания этой проблеме, поэтому
инициативная группа задалась задачей обустроить один из скверов в центре
столицы, чотбы сделать его более привлекательным для жителей и гостей
столицы.  
Мы хотим превратить это место в место для людей. Если
кишиневцы и гости города захотят провести моменты спокойствия и
счастья (читать, творить, общаться, любить, фотографироваться, снимать клипы,
петь и танцевать) - значит мы достигли цели.
Сквер Чехова - место с высочайшим потенциалом
Этот сквер расположен в самом центре города, на пересечении
улиц Митрополит Варлаам и Влайку Пыркэлаб. Рядом находятся отели, коммерческие
центры, кафе, университет, парк Кафедрального Собора. Это зона максимального притяжения для кишиневцев, но еще больше для иностранцев
(туристы, преприниматели, дипломаты). Через этот сквер ежедневно проходят 5-10
тысяч пешеходов. Несмотря на это, мало кто здесь останавливается .
Этот сквер - пустое и некрасивое место. Из-за припаркованых на тротуаре
машин и ям, пешеходы вунуждены ходить зигзагами или выходить на проезжую часть.
Если же у вас детская или инвалидная коляска то у вас ни одного шанса пройти здесь.
Кроме парковок, 
кустов и мусора, сквер Чехова имеет еще одну проблему: отсутстивие
удобств. Больше всего чуствуется отсутствие освещения и скамеек.
Недавно, мы создали нициативную группу которая задалсь
задачей обустроить и возродить эту городскую зону чтобы люди могли ходить в
сквер, проводить здесь время. Потому что людям нужны красивые общестенные места. 
Установка скамеек, фонарей, ремонт и обустройство тротуаров
и пешеходных переходов - простые но очень важные элементы комфорта и
безобастности общественного места. Когда появляется нормальная пешеходная
инфраструктура, люди начинают ходить пешком. Там где полно машин и негде присесть,
пешеходам делать нечего. А город без педходов это город без жизни.
Проблемы и решения
Для первого этапа мы намерены установить несколько скамеек,
мусорных урн, освещение и навести генеральную уборку. Также будет организована
зона с бесплатным wi-fi. 
Стоимость этих удобств оценена в 15 000 долларов. На эти
деньги можно купить качественную парковую жителей города мебель, оплатить установочные работы и
текущие затраты. Деньги мы хотим собрать у жителей города в ходе кампании по сбору
средств, но и у потенциальных спонсоров и партнеров. 
Больше деталей о проэкте на нашей страничке в facebook.
Работы по обустройству:
1) Очистка деревьев и обустройство газона
2) Ремонт тротуара
3) Обустройство пешеходных переходов на уровне тротуара
4) Проэктирование и установка освещения
Обустройство удобств:
1) Скамейки со спинкой - 5 шт.
2) Скамейки без спинки - 6 шт.
3) Мусорные урны - 6 шт.
4) Фонари - 7 шт.
5) Информационное панно - 1 шт.
6) Декоративные ограждающие столбики - 77 шт.
Также будет организована бесплатная wi-fi зона, парковка для
велосипедов,  little free library и др.",13.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are Camille DeBiase and Tom Gambale, native Brooklynites and co-owners of a New York City audio post production company called MediaRacket.  In 2008, Camille authored a children's book called ""Bert The Runner Duck Runs the New York City Marathon"" which lead both of us to become more aware and involved in various homeless and children's issues here in New York City.  <br/></p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As recent statistics reflect, the number of homeless have been increasing rapidly each year throughout the City.  To make the upcoming season festive and do some goodwill for New York City area homeless children our goal is to donate 100 Easter Baskets filled with items such as coloring books, crayons, candy, small toys, etc., to children and their families residing in New York City's homeless shelters.<br/></p></li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>THE EASTER BASKET PROJECT NYC - 2014</b>, with your donation, is a wonderful way of bringing some fun and happiness to at least 100 homeless children and their families.  Your donations will be used to purchase and fill the 100 Easter/Passover/Spring Baskets.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">100% of your donation will go to buying and filling the baskets.    <br/></p>
</li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">A donation of $1.00 can buy items such as crayons or a coloring book or candy; $5.00 can buy items such as puzzles, small toys or a stuffed bunny; with a $10.00 donation we can buy socks, hats, toiletries, food vouchers or a gift card for the older kids (who unfortunately sometimes get overlooked); or with a $25.00 Sponsored Basket donation, we can really load up a basket with all these items and more. <br/></p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: justify;"">This is our first Indiegogo campaign, so even an E-mail wishing us luck and cheering our project on, or helping to get the word out about our campaign to your family and friends would be so appreciated. At the very least, if we don't meet our goal, we can still make as many baskets as donations allow, and still be able to donate to the shelters - but of course, more money means more baskets - 100 Easter/Passover/Spring Baskets is our minimum goal.</p></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;""><p>Under the guidance of the New York City Department of Homeless Services (DHS), we will be delivering all Easter Baskets to shelters within the five boroughs.  We will be posting video of our deliveries. </p></li>
<li style=""text-align: justify;"">Your thoughtful contribution will go a long way to put smiles on the faces of homeless children, their parents and families.  The families you will be generously donating to are from many different backgrounds and faith traditions, our aim is to bring a festive and surprising seasonal gift to as many children as possible. </li>

<p></p></div>","We are Camille DeBiase and Tom Gambale, native Brooklynites and co-owners of a New York City audio post production company called MediaRacket.  In 2008, Camille authored a children's book called ""Bert The Runner Duck Runs the New York City Marathon"" which lead both of us to become more aware and involved in various homeless and children's issues here in New York City.  
As recent statistics reflect, the number of homeless have been increasing rapidly each year throughout the City.  To make the upcoming season festive and do some goodwill for New York City area homeless children our goal is to donate 100 Easter Baskets filled with items such as coloring books, crayons, candy, small toys, etc., to children and their families residing in New York City's homeless shelters.

THE EASTER BASKET PROJECT NYC - 2014, with your donation, is a wonderful way of bringing some fun and happiness to at least 100 homeless children and their families.  Your donations will be used to purchase and fill the 100 Easter/Passover/Spring Baskets.  
100% of your donation will go to buying and filling the baskets.    

A donation of $1.00 can buy items such as crayons or a coloring book or candy; $5.00 can buy items such as puzzles, small toys or a stuffed bunny; with a $10.00 donation we can buy socks, hats, toiletries, food vouchers or a gift card for the older kids (who unfortunately sometimes get overlooked); or with a $25.00 Sponsored Basket donation, we can really load up a basket with all these items and more. 
This is our first Indiegogo campaign, so even an E-mail wishing us luck and cheering our project on, or helping to get the word out about our campaign to your family and friends would be so appreciated. At the very least, if we don't meet our goal, we can still make as many baskets as donations allow, and still be able to donate to the shelters - but of course, more money means more baskets - 100 Easter/Passover/Spring Baskets is our minimum goal.
Under the guidance of the New York City Department of Homeless Services (DHS), we will be delivering all Easter Baskets to shelters within the five boroughs.  We will be posting video of our deliveries. 
Your thoughtful contribution will go a long way to put smiles on the faces of homeless children, their parents and families.  The families you will be generously donating to are from many different backgrounds and faith traditions, our aim is to bring a festive and surprising seasonal gift to as many children as possible.

If I have to run around town to accomplish whatever needs to be handled that day, I run. One thing at a time, little step by little step.

(For those of you that don't 'know' me, I am literally the most dedicated person on the planet. A survivor. If I can survive all that I have and still stand up to 'try' things, I can do just about anything.)




The Impact?


Honestly? I'm just a random girl from Nashville that found something she loves to do while chronicling it all on the internet...but I've got 'heart', as they call it. There's nothing else in this world I'd love than to settle into a cute indie business in Nashville and grow from there. Wanna help a girl that's in the middle of seeing if she can spread her wings a bit? Well here I am. 

Other Ways You Can Help-

WAIT... Some people don't have money. Not even $10. And that's ok! You can still help me get the shop ready to open to the public. Do you have gently used or new supplies, furniture, building materials, or well...what do you have? I just may have a use for it. (I'm that girl that steals old windows from the side of the road, I have all kinds of uses for all kinds of things.)
Post, retweet, reshare and email it to everyone you know You can still make a difference. 
Or do you have something else that I'm totally missing but you know I'm gonna need it? Give a girl a shout, & I'll give you a listen. 
And that’s all there is to it.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

                     By Kwasmo Enterprises, LLCFirst Delivery Week is 12/8/2014!All orders are guaranteed fulfillment regardless of campaign results!
The Cash Cannon Is Officially A Hit!  Kwasmo Enterprises would like to thank our early backers on the Cash Cannon project.  Our initial shipment of the product sold out in 9 months! Now, we are asking for your help to take this product to the next level!    What is the Cash Cannon?If you haven't already seen it, the Cash Cannon is an automatic, paper-dispensing toy gun.  It can shoot confetti, coupons, fliers, or cold hard cash in rapid-fire.  Its intuitive design makes operation a snap; open the top to drop in a stack of bills, point and shoot.The cannon is great for any special event: trade shows, marketing booths, weddings, parties, concerts, family reunions, festivals, or even just playing with the kids.  See how exciting it is to use at Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter with #cashcannon.
You can even get a cash cannon with your own logo and branding.               Here's What's NewThe Cash Cannon 2.0 features upgrades from the original release. The clear UV coating provides a beautiful glossy finish, and changes to the holding compartment increase material dispensing efficiency and reduce paper jams.  Party with a PurposeThe Cash Cannon 2.0 is also available in a new color; Pink! Fighting Breast Cancer is important to us here at Kwasmo Enterprises on a personal level.  So in honor of cancer survivors everywhere, a portion of the proceeds from each Pink Cannon Perk go to the fight against breast cancer! Pink Cash Cannons also come with a breast cancer awareness stickers and Pink Confetti. Stretch GoalsThe possibilities with the Cash Cannon are endless.  Currently we offer only one type of custom confetti.  If we can sell enough, we would love to offer a wide range of customizable confetti and flyers.  There are also plans in the works for Cash Cannon games, and educational cash flash cards.  Imagine the potential uses in schools- all kids love the cannon.  We can only do this if we sell enough units, so please share our campaign with your friends and family.  Whether you buy a cannon or not, you can still have a huge impact by spreading the word.Why contributions?  Are there any risks?Incredibly, to this point the Cash Cannon has been completely self-funded.  No loans or grants have been used, and we have already handled the various manufacturing, legal, and business expenses of bringing a product to market. Now we need $25,000 in sales to make Cash Cannon Phase 2 a success. The majority of cost for each cannon goes to manufacturing and shipping.  By ordering in bulk we can cut those costs significantly.  We only work with experienced manufacturers to ensure quality.  The Cash Cannon is our passion, and we can't wait to ship these to consumers, event planners and marketers nationwide.

Our test ran for 10 days and after those ten days we had 400 users, thousands of hits, and had to close down our website to rebuild to sustain the high traffic. The day before we closed down we even caught the eye of a member of the silicon valley community and numerous Venture Capitalists who contacted the founders; however, we decided to no longer pursue investment and pursue a new approach at funding… crowd funding.</p>

<p>Most media conglomerates operate with hundreds of millions of dollars in order to capture large audiences, advertise, and report news quickly.</p>
<p>We, however, have figured a low cost solution to news and media. We will need to raise $25,000 to meet our first year fundraising goal.</p>
<p>$15,000 of this fundraised money will allow hearsay.today to purchase new servers for our audio content, new recording devices and microphones for higher quality mobile audios, and new technology to code a mobile app that we plan to release for the winter holiday season this year. This money will also be used to rent out a location where we can have house all of our servers.</p>
<p>A specific item to item planned purchase list can be received upon request.</p>
<p>$8,000 of the money will be used for marketing and online advertisements. Between Google AdWords, Facebook advertising credits, Twitter advertising credits, and mobile advertising solutions, marketing the idea can get expensive. Thus far thousands of people have used our services, mostly from people passing the site link around. Imagine if we were advertising too. We would truly change the media game.</p>
<p>$2,000 of the funds rose during the campaign, plus excess funding will be used to back up our data online, along with housing our website on a high bandwidth online hosting site, email hosting, and purchase new mobile domain name.</p>

Such social experience will allow events to become easily sharable and people conversations (chats) will flow around such events to enhance the community building interaction and experience. This will also allow neighborhoods and communities to become happily and closely together as MyHappyHour invitations from people to go out and meet together will start  to spread out and users will get rewarded with Happy scores which will help their cities look Happier than others (<i>is my city the Happiest city around?</i>).<br/><br/>We'd like to humbly contribute to <b><i>a more balanced and fair trade oriented future</i></b>. We believe proximity is the factor which contributes the most to create physical social bonds. We wish local communities to enlighten their presence around their geographical locations, we wish people becoming concerned about their communities in first person, not as observers. We want to use technology as a strong enabler for supporting human exchanges as opposed to human avoidance. <br/><br/>We wish to reduce the technology gap between big and small businesses by creating a platform where the <b>concepts of big and small are completely absent from the design</b>. We wish to see people open their home doors and meet outside. We wish people to smile, to feel part of something bigger around them. For that to happen, we need people ready to build a MyHappyHour environment around them, spreading our world around, talking to their town halls, institutions and store owners about MyHappyHour and explaining to them how MyHappyHour can help them promote their public interest events for free. The more events will be published by institutions, local store owners, town halls, tourism offices or associations, the more people will gather and meet around those events. <br/><br/>Event attendance is by itself an activity which has a strong potential for gamification: once the events will be published and people around them will be consulting them naturally, we could imagine people in such communities playing together around the concept of event participation, thrilled to increase their Happy scores and their own city Happy score (which would be the Happier city around?).<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need people with the potential to create events (store owners, tourism offices, town halls, etc), we need them to join our growing community and to publish event-based content to inform their neighbors around about their latest news, latest proposals, latest discounts, special offers, open activities, unusual events.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FfXBowAYlk08%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DfXBowAYlk08&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FfXBowAYlk08%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>We also need people who would love to benefit from the platform environment, people who would love to get easily informed about events around and get connected to them. We need people who would love to invite other people to go out with them, people who would love to play fun games around event participation. We need people who would be willing and motivated to convert their neighborhoods and cities into Happy zones, spreading MyHappyHour's word to their town halls, associations and store owners, so that they start creating such event based contents. We want people communicating around such events so that the movement becomes viral helped by our Facebook and Twitter integration. <br/></p>
<p>In summary, we need people motivated to build Happy Communities around their homes.</p>
<p>Upon our imminent launch, we are in need of <b>funding </b><b>to advertise and promote the MyHappyHour platform</b>.
 While we need individual community builders with lots of energy and 
vision to develop their Happy zones, we will also need to multiply our 
presence in the media to increase our own visibility beyond such 
individual efforts. We have faith in this campaign, but 
preparing other campaigns and extending our presence into other media 
such as radios, local newspapers, Facebook, internet engines will become
 an imminent need for the team. We also need to create publishing and 
promotional material, etc. Also, <b>we want to reward community builders as they deserve</b>!<br/></p>

That being said, we are also interested in your back up even if you'd not be in a position to help us with our funding needs. That's why we will make some <b>free fun perks available</b> that we hope you will love and enjoy!<br/><br/><ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<div>  
						We define the following important concepts around <b>events (i.e, a Happy Hours)</b>:<br/><div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>the vendor</b>: person, institution, town hall or association who is responsible for the publication of an event</li>
<li>
<b>the store</b>: location where the event takes place</li>
<li>
<b>the users</b>: people interested in following, sharing or attending an event </li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/705404/files/20140709093949-31.png?1404923989"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>The <b>impact</b> MyHappyHour brings to both <b><i>vendors and users</i></b> is immediate:<br/><ul>
<li>Publication of events in a matter of seconds allows <b><i>vendors</i></b>
 to effectively expand their geographic exposure instantly. No need to pass by the door to know about the offers. No need to keep flyers nor booklets, nor to access specific individual web sites to know about what's going on. No need to be referred to aim self-existence. Furthermore,
 MyHappyHour also makes available for vendors a free loyalty service to keep in contact with users attending their events: whenever a user decides to follow a <b>store
 </b>in MyHappyHour, she will receive a notification on her smartphone for every new event created in such store.</li>
<li>
<b><i>Users</i></b> running MyHappyHour instantly know about 
what's going on so cool around them at any time: now, in 5 hours, tomorrow, in 3
 days time. All such info available from a one-stop location, MyHappyHour. Just one click away. Moreover, as a social network, users can follow the events 
and stores that interest them, share them with friends, invite each 
other to go together, chat, play, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>MyHappyHour is not a middle-man organization: we are not interested in 
selling coupons nor cards, nor being paid commissions on any potential 
economical transactions happening between participating parties (<b><i>vendors and users</i></b>). We are only concerned about developing and maintaining the platform 
availability, we dream in a future where the communication, promotion, fidelity and awareness services we provide can be perceived
 as helpful and useful for and by local communities around the world, 
we'd like to become humble enablers for <b><i>Happy</i></b> contributions. <b>Thinking Global, Acting Local</b>. We offer all of our event publication services for free to all vendors. We wish everyone to have access to these modern dynamic promotion and fidelity services, we wish to reduce the technology access gap between big vendors and small vendors. </p>

<p>Our team has a strong record of <b>sustainable community projects</b>, such as the <a href=""http://treeplanet.moonfruit.com/#/about/4560727341"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tree Planet project</a> which allowed to plant more than 50K trees in the Amazon during 2012 through simple game proposals. Convinced that sustainability MUST BE at the core of this 
project since its inception, we are already running sustainable 
actions even before the network has begun its development. As part of 
such commitment, we have partnered with the Tree-Nation social
 network, a worldwide inspiring example of global community-driven eco 
engagements. As such, we have decided to plant 1200 trees upfront in the
 <a href=""http://www.tree-nation.com/projects/42"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">reforestation project in Dassa, Burkina Faso</a> which aims at stopping the
 intense desertification concerns affecting the area. <br/></p>
<p>Our tree planting efforts will be made visible through the <a href=""http://www.tree-nation.com/forests/913"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>MyHappyPlanet by MyHappyHour forest</i></a> inside Tree-Nation and our deepest wish will be to see the 
forest grow on a daily basis: we will be plant trees to thank every 
single MyHappyHour vendor (local stores, associations, toursim offices, 
clubs, institutions, town halls) that will start using MyHappyHour to 
publish their events of interest. We will be thanking them for their 
trust in our proposal. In other words, the more MyHappyHour will expand 
its reach, the more trees we will be able to plant.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> MyHappyHour is a collaborative initiative, <b>it is the network we build together</b>.
 For a MyHappyHour environment to work, <b>we need both users to bring in vendors/stores
to the platform and vendors/stores to bring in users</b>. In an ideal world, an initiative of this kind should be able to work by itself provided that such two starting assumptions are met. <i>The devil is in the details</i>, and as it happens with any new initiative of this kind, it is extremely hard to start the wheel during the initial stages. Lack of general knowledge about the idea, lack of a well-known brand credibility, time required to gain trust from <b>vendors </b>when explaining these innovative concepts to them, these are all factors that come into play sooner or later during the adoption phase which may add some hurdles to achieve fast adoption.<br/></p>
<p>To overcome that, we leverage acquisition strategies in 4 different areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>users to bring users: </b>1) Adding friends from social networks, 2) chat capabilities, 3) inviting friends to go with them to events, 4) playing with friends to location based games and fun location based battles among communities, 5) interaction and synergies with other social networks</li>
<li>
<b>users to bring vendors:</b> 1) Store 
Pre-registration and Events Pre-creation capabilities, so 
that users can help newly subscribed store owners to start their Happy journeys inside 
the MyHappyHour social platform from their own mobiles (no need from the vendor to be <i><b>connected </b></i>to benefit from MyHappyHour), 2) community building programs to invite and reward motivated users to become an active part of the creation of this network around their locations.: we need leaders with both the ability to understand the great things MyHappyHour can bring to their communities and neighborhoods and the ability to engage in a <i><b>knights crusade</b></i> to convert their cities into Happy-enabled ones<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>vendors to bring users:</b> 1) Follow My Store capabilities as a strong fidelity tool to connect vendors with their users, 2) door stickers and posters to advertise their presence in MyHappyHour's platform<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>vendors to bring vendors:</b> 1) community building programs to invite and reward motivated vendors to become an active part of the creation of the network around their locations, 2) unique advantages for their own stores</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Short Summary A concert? An open-air movie projection? A neighbors meeting? A sports event? A local festival? A street market? A shop special offer? A Happy Hour? Imagine a smartphone application which would give you 
instant access to all the proposals going on around your location in one single click, without the need to know in advance what to search for in a web engine
 today. MyHappyHour makes this dream come true by offering you the 
perfect dynamic experience for the place you'll be located, anytime anywhere
 !
MyHappyHour is a free social open platform that brings people together by 
allowing store owners, cities, tourism offices, associations, etc. to publish 
events of interest that can be immediately seen and shared by users 
around the locations where the events are taking place directly from their smartphones.

Shop, play, meet & bond combined together anytime anywhere. Around home ! Festivals, concerts, neighbor meetings, informal gatherings in parks, 
local store offers for happy hours, discounts or last minute offers, school events,
 club events, road works... With MyHappyHour (download Android app at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mhh), knowing about what's going on right now around me is just one click away (check http://www.myhappyhour.me/appfaq).


The social side of it ? Our friends and messages will be just one click away too ! Any event we will locate through MyHappyHour becomes immediately sharable and communication with friends around events (inviting, talking, sharing, playing) becomes easy and direct from inside the platform:


Such social experience will allow events to become easily sharable and people conversations (chats) will flow around such events to enhance the community building interaction and experience. This will also allow neighborhoods and communities to become happily and closely together as MyHappyHour invitations from people to go out and meet together will start  to spread out and users will get rewarded with Happy scores which will help their cities look Happier than others (is my city the Happiest city around?).We'd like to humbly contribute to a more balanced and fair trade oriented future. We believe proximity is the factor which contributes the most to create physical social bonds. We wish local communities to enlighten their presence around their geographical locations, we wish people becoming concerned about their communities in first person, not as observers. We want to use technology as a strong enabler for supporting human exchanges as opposed to human avoidance. We wish to reduce the technology gap between big and small businesses by creating a platform where the concepts of big and small are completely absent from the design. We wish to see people open their home doors and meet outside. We wish people to smile, to feel part of something bigger around them. For that to happen, we need people ready to build a MyHappyHour environment around them, spreading our world around, talking to their town halls, institutions and store owners about MyHappyHour and explaining to them how MyHappyHour can help them promote their public interest events for free.

  What We Need & What You Get We need people with the potential to create events (store owners, tourism offices, town halls, etc), we need them to join our growing community and to publish event-based content to inform their neighbors around about their latest news, latest proposals, latest discounts, special offers, open activities, unusual events.

We also need people who would love to benefit from the platform environment, people who would love to get easily informed about events around and get connected to them. We need people who would love to invite other people to go out with them, people who would love to play fun games around event participation.

  The Impact 
  
						We define the following important concepts around events (i.e, a Happy Hours):


the vendor: person, institution, town hall or association who is responsible for the publication of an event

the store: location where the event takes place

the users: people interested in following, sharing or attending an event 



The impact MyHappyHour brings to both vendors and users is immediate:
Publication of events in a matter of seconds allows vendors
 to effectively expand their geographic exposure instantly. No need to pass by the door to know about the offers. No need to keep flyers nor booklets, nor to access specific individual web sites to know about what's going on. No need to be referred to aim self-existence. Furthermore,
 MyHappyHour also makes available for vendors a free loyalty service to keep in contact with users attending their events: whenever a user decides to follow a store
 in MyHappyHour, she will receive a notification on her smartphone for every new event created in such store.

Users running MyHappyHour instantly know about 
what's going on so cool around them at any time: now, in 5 hours, tomorrow, in 3
 days time. All such info available from a one-stop location, MyHappyHour. Just one click away. Moreover, as a social network, users can follow the events 
and stores that interest them, share them with friends, invite each 
other to go together, chat, play, etc.




MyHappyHour is not a middle-man organization: we are not interested in 
selling coupons nor cards, nor being paid commissions on any potential 
economical transactions happening between participating parties (vendors and users). We are only concerned about developing and maintaining the platform 
availability, we dream in a future where the communication, promotion, fidelity and awareness services we provide can be perceived
 as helpful and useful for and by local communities around the world, 
we'd like to become humble enablers for Happy contributions. Thinking Global, Acting Local. We offer all of our event publication services for free to all vendors. We wish everyone to have access to these modern dynamic promotion and fidelity services, we wish to reduce the technology access gap between big vendors and small vendors.

</div></div>","Summary
The Brass Eye will be a community-minded lounge that gives back to the community while celebrating the art of the craft cocktail. Focusing on classic recipes as well as new techniques and local and regional beers and wines.
The owner Bryan Williams has been studying craft cocktails for the past 4 years (it's a hard job but someone has to do it!) and while he still acknowledges that he has a lot more to learn he is ready to share his passion with the community.


Taking cue from local brew pub ""South Bend Brew Werks"", ""The Brass Eye"" will be a community-minded lounge by not only purchasing  local ingredients when available but also giving back to the community with a percentage of each drink being donated to a community organization. We will partner with a few yet to be determined organizations ( a couple of current possibilities are Hunter Ice Festival and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Berrien and Cass Counties) and you, the patron, will be able to choose which one your cocktail will be donated to. There will also be opportunities for local schools and charities to have ""give back"" nights as well.  Could there be a more fun way to support your community??? So not only will you be helping the community by helping to fund a new business but by patronizing ""The Brass Eye"" you will automatically be giving back to the community! 
  What We Need & What You Get
The Brass Eye will be opening in the old ""Stein & Vine"" location, a bar that is basically turn key so most of the contributions will go to legal fees, liquor license fees, insurance and stocking the liquor and supplies. There are a few cosmetic changes that we would like to make as well.  We will definitely need more shelves, signage, coasters etc. There are nowhere near enough shelves to house the amount of booze we want to stock!!

This generator uses no gas, oil, sun, batteries, wind, diesel fuel, it only uses rare earth magnets to generate power. This means once you get your unit take it out of the box and it is ready to go.</h3><p><br/></p><h3><b>Short Summary</b></h3>
<p>Tim Slavings, the inventor of the portable
generator, has been involved in the energy and electronics industries for more
than forty years. As an electrician, he has wired, or rewired, schools,
businesses, hotels, hospitals, churches, nursing homes and funeral homes
throughout the mid-west, and has handled electronic equipment contracts for airports
and other secured locations throughout the country.</p>
<p>In the energy industry, he has developed more
efficient wind and solar energy systems that he marketed through one of his
previous companies. He has been developing the concept,
plans, designs and prototypes of the U-Plug Generator for the last twenty
years.</p>
<p>We successfully tested and demonstrated a prototype
of the U-Plug for two years. The current production model went through
independent testing in February and March, 2015 at the corporate headquarters
of Energy Power Systems, Intl., in Maryland Heights, Missouri. </p>
<p>We are bringing this generator to the public market
to help offset the use of fossil fuels, and to help clean the air for
everyone.<span>  Our generator will save people
money, and provide power in any natural disaster, and is also the perfect
system for homes to be totally off-grid.This generator is only 24 inches tall, 6 inches in diameter,  produces 115 volts at 17.3 amps of power, and weighs only 20 pounds. That is truly a powerful generator in a compact size. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438730616/s8akmp9stmjmwbmhyc7u.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We have developed a generator that will
revolutionize the energy industry.<span>  We
need your help to bring that generator to market.  Your contributions, which can include
pre-ordering our portable generator, will allow us to build the factories to
make this generator in America, with American workers.  We will be creating hundreds of good jobs for
workers who will be building unique generators, and building a new future for
America.  </span></p>
<p>When you contribute to our campaign you will be
helping to save our natural resources, while cleaning our air, saving our
precious water, and making the world a better place for everyone.</p><p><br/></p>

<p>We are seeking $250,000 for building space,

together.<span>  We also know that the U-Plug
Portable Generator will attract additional interest and additional funding once
you begin to envision how the generator will help you, your friends and
family.  A generator that can sit inside
your home, at your camp site, or work site, while making virtually no noise,
is a generator you will love to own.  In
turn, your friends and family will love to own one for themselves, and will
help us sell many more units.</span></p>
<p>Should as few as 1500 people choose to buy their own
unit from this campaign, we will have raised all the funds necessary to
complete our factory, order the raw materials, train the workers, and begin
production, without seeking outside funding. From those 1500 people, we would
raise $2,242,500, allowing us to reach full production more quickly than we
have anticipated.<span>  We would then be able
to make decisions that impact the way we can produce more units.  </span></p>
<p>Should you as a contributor purchase one of these
units and then purchase a grid-tie unit from the internet, you would be able to
use your generator to make your electric meter run backwards. Yes, it will go
backwards at times, and the power company will have to pay you for your power.
As you can see, your unit will pay for itself many times and in many ways, as
you use your U-Plug Generator.</p>
<p>We have many perks to fit the needs of everyone
looking to support our endeavor, without buying a generator, including stylus
pens, can koozies, ball caps, USB jump drives, T-shirts, hoodies, 
lightweight jackets and 3 in 1 winter coats. All of these high quality items

I'm a simple human- being like you are. Many times I've spent nights or hours between conecting flights in bus stations, train stations and I couldn't afford myself going to hotels because of the prices. So, the idea came to my mind- to join people who think the same to one group, to build houses in every country and to travel freely without having to pay for hotels. Volunteers in each country would take care of the houses or flats. Below are some thoughts, and if you have any questions please, write to me. <br/></p><p></p><p>Nowadays people are forced by many factors to suffer from alienation, loneliness, depression, poverty.</p><p>According to scientific researches more and more people think about suicide or feel insufficient life, or they suffer from the “bubble effect”.</p><p></p><p>What’s the difference between this and other organizations? Many organizations offer you virtual communication, not real communication, in order to keep you in a “bubble”. Everything works mentally in a communicative level. You can’t touch, smell, or taste anything. Do you? You just raise profit for a few billionaires.</p><p>The main principle of this organization is to bring people together, to travel freely, to meet other cultures, to make friends and move back to the places and countries you like again and again.</p><p>This organization is going to buy property in all countries that every member could travel worldwide freely and enjoy everything just for being a part of organization. Each person is born to be free and the best feeling is freedom and love. In this case members see the world, changes their “bubbles”, join other “bubbles” and feel different life, different cultures and meet different ideas. S T O P saving A L L your money! Saving is a good habbit but you don’t have to save A L L you get. By saving A L L you get, you join the group of people who are slaves of money and people who are above them. You must share at least a few dollars with all the rest of the world. The more you share the stronger organization becomes. That is not only the money. That is your attitude, a small part of you, that you can share with others. There are many people who are clever, like you are, and can build the world, our world. The world of trust, safety, confidence, continuation. This organization is not hiding from masses. It’s goal is to bring masses together. The main thing of this organization is  to share everything we have in order to give joy to each other. Just imagine yourself of traveling and having no problems of staying in our common houses, meeting new cultures and people. Everybody can enjoy and share it. I’m sure if you join this organization you will discover and experience new things, you will broaden your experience.

I'm a simple human- being like you are. Many times I've spent nights or hours between conecting flights in bus stations, train stations and I couldn't afford myself going to hotels because of the prices. So, the idea came to my mind- to join people who think the same to one group, to build houses in every country and to travel freely without having to pay for hotels. Volunteers in each country would take care of the houses or flats. Below are some thoughts, and if you have any questions please, write to me. Nowadays people are forced by many factors to suffer from alienation, loneliness, depression, poverty.According to scientific researches more and more people think about suicide or feel insufficient life, or they suffer from the “bubble effect”.What’s the difference between this and other organizations? Many organizations offer you virtual communication, not real communication, in order to keep you in a “bubble”. Everything works mentally in a communicative level. You can’t touch, smell, or taste anything. Do you? You just raise profit for a few billionaires.The main principle of this organization is to bring people together, to travel freely, to meet other cultures, to make friends and move back to the places and countries you like again and again.This organization is going to buy property in all countries that every member could travel worldwide freely and enjoy everything just for being a part of organization. Each person is born to be free and the best feeling is freedom and love. In this case members see the world, changes their “bubbles”, join other “bubbles” and feel different life, different cultures and meet different ideas. S T O P saving A L L your money! Saving is a good habbit but you don’t have to save A L L you get. By saving A L L you get, you join the group of people who are slaves of money and people who are above them. You must share at least a few dollars with all the rest of the world. The more you share the stronger organization becomes. That is not only the money. That is your attitude, a small part of you, that you can share with others. There are many people who are clever, like you are, and can build the world, our world. The world of trust, safety, confidence, continuation. This organization is not hiding from masses. It’s goal is to bring masses together. The main thing of this organization is  to share everything we have in order to give joy to each other. Just imagine yourself of traveling and having no problems of staying in our common houses, meeting new cultures and people. Everybody can enjoy and share it. I’m sure if you join this organization you will discover and experience new things, you will broaden your experience. The new world created by you and people who are thinking the same way is waiting for you!Now we are raising money to buy property in some exotic countries, like India, Tanzania, etc. Some people can't afford themselves to stay in hotels while traveling. So from now, you will have a place where to stay for FREE. Just join. Now we already have a small house in Lithuania, that you can use.

<span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What is 3Dx360?</span><br/>
</div><div>
<div> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span>That's a really good question!</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Let me explain that with a few words</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">: 3Dx360 is an electronic device which allows you to display all kinds of digital content in a completely new way. Every content displayed with 3Dx360 will be in real 3D. So you will not only be able to see images in 3D like in the cinema or with a 3D home cinema system, but you will feel like you are standing right in the scene. But our goggles will not only display your digital content in 3D. They also have several sensors built in, which allow you to turn your head in every possible direction and to look around in interactive scenes like in ""Google Streetview"", with our special 3Dx360-Panorama-Viewer or in every 3Dx360 enabled game!</span></p>
<p>3Dx360 is a device which you put on your head just like skiing-goggles. In it, there is a high definition display, which allows you to look at your images, videos, games, movies and so on in ultra sharp HD. This display has a high contrast and brightness, which leads to images that appear even more alive.</p>
<p>Apart from the HD-screen there are two lenses in our goggles. These create a high fov (field of view), which gives you the feeling to stand right in the scene you are watching. But that's only one small part of the illusion.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are several sensors built in. One of it is a magnetic compass, wich will tell the device's brain where you look right now. If you turn your head and you are displaying interactive content, the content updates and you can look around and maybe even interact with the displayed scene.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Our Vision</span></p>
<div>
<span>We want to develop a cost-effective VR-Device, so you can enjoy your digital media in a much more intense way in the future. That's the reason why we want to sell our finished product for under 500€.</span>
</div>

</div></div>","What is 3Dx360?

 That's a really good question!
Let me explain that with a few words: 3Dx360 is an electronic device which allows you to display all kinds of digital content in a completely new way. Every content displayed with 3Dx360 will be in real 3D. So you will not only be able to see images in 3D like in the cinema or with a 3D home cinema system, but you will feel like you are standing right in the scene. But our goggles will not only display your digital content in 3D. They also have several sensors built in, which allow you to turn your head in every possible direction and to look around in interactive scenes like in ""Google Streetview"", with our special 3Dx360-Panorama-Viewer or in every 3Dx360 enabled game!
3Dx360 is a device which you put on your head just like skiing-goggles. In it, there is a high definition display, which allows you to look at your images, videos, games, movies and so on in ultra sharp HD. This display has a high contrast and brightness, which leads to images that appear even more alive.
Apart from the HD-screen there are two lenses in our goggles. These create a high fov (field of view), which gives you the feeling to stand right in the scene you are watching. But that's only one small part of the illusion.
As mentioned earlier, there are several sensors built in. One of it is a magnetic compass, wich will tell the device's brain where you look right now. If you turn your head and you are displaying interactive content, the content updates and you can look around and maybe even interact with the displayed scene.
Our Vision

We want to develop a cost-effective VR-Device, so you can enjoy your digital media in a much more intense way in the future. That's the reason why we want to sell our finished product for under 500€.

Not only this, but we also want to give special facilities (like universities or technical schools) the opportunity to learn how to make such a device themselves, so they can teach their students. We want to make this, because we think that this kind of technology is the future.


So educational partners will get a ""cookbook"" of how to make 3Dx360. This will also contain 3D-Models which can be printed with every conventional 3D-printer, just like we did with our prototype!

Our prototype
We developed a first prototype where we've set the focus on the functionality, but not on the goggle's design. As you have read above, we printed this prototype with a 3D-Printer.




With this technology we were able to make a real good prototype which also was very cost-effective. So this version of the prototype you can see above (some parts are not on the picture), only costs around 300$!

Our next goal is to make this prototype even better. We not only want to increase it's functionalities (which already are state of the art), but we also want to make the design much more modern.

a group of young people came to the village and said they wanted to help those

winter, the girl together with her family, cats, dogs and, of course, the duck,
moved into a new house which had wide windows, as many light bulbs as to read all the
books in the village, and no one needed to bend their head when inside. The girl lived happily ever after, but

houses and a day center for children in the village of Belciugatele, Calarasi
county, South-East Romania. Many people there live at the edge of their world,
in extremely poor conditions and with no future. These families could be
reintegrated in society, were they to move into a better house, and engaged
into a good social programme. At the same time, a day center would bring
peace of mind for parents who seek work, but worry about leaving their children
unsupervised at home.</em></p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The vicious circle of
rural poverty. How did we get here?</b></p>
<p></p><p>Some may argue that people are
responsible for their faith, but we beg to disagree. The culture of poverty is
a cruel place, where people are so far off the functioning society that it
would be virtually impossible for them to lift themselves without any help from
others.</p>
<p>In Romania, around 10% of people live in
extreme poverty, many of them in rural areas, where they have little chance to
change their status. Poor families build small houses, sometimes on illegally-occupied
plots of land. As result of this, they enter a vicious circle, because the cost
of entering legality in Romania is extremely high, and usually accompanied by a
lot of almost impossible paperwork. In this sense, poverty is no longer an
ethical issue, but is seen in light of its deprivation of potential. A house is
no longer just shelter, but the initial deposit for a better life.</p>
<p><br/></p><p>We can give you loads of
statistics or we can just go back to the girl from our story and her life
before she had a house. Imagine you are Georgiana and you want to have your
first birthday party. You invite your friends from school, but when they arrive
they laugh at you, your house and family, and then they leave. </p>
<p>Unfortunately this is not
fiction; this is what happened to Georgiana when she wanted to celebrate her
14th birthday in her old house.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What is Arhipera?</b></p>
<p>Arhipera Association means a
group of young Romanian architects, volunteers and their mentor, <b>Lorin
Niculae</b>. Founder and coordinator at Arhipera association and school,
Lorin is an experienced architect and professor at the ""Ion Mincu"" Architecture University in Bucharest. Despite having a lot on his plate, he
spends a big part of his time mentoring the young architects involved in the
social housing projects. </p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1073160/files/20141204030713-LorinProfil.jpg?1417781669"" src="""" style=""width: 254.281596452328px;height: 381px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The Arhipera <b>members and volunteers</b> are regular architecture students, but who have an apetite for doing more than just the usual university assignments. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1070368/files/20141204030933-StudentiPozaGrup.jpg?1417691373"" src="""" style=""width: 543.438256658596px;height: 362px;""/></p>
<br/><p></p><p>Since 2011, the team has designed
clever social housing, knocked on the doors of investors, and built homes
together with several families which lived at the margins of Romanian society.</p>
<p>Arhipera’s aim is to build homes for but also with those who
need them. In the professional jargon this means <b>social participative
architecture.</b> We start from the belief that people deserve a decent house, but
it is only when they truly get involved in the construction process and alter
their home with time, that we consider our project a success. When people feel
a place reflects their identity and fulfills their needs, then they decide to
stay and make the house their home. </p>
<p>This is successful social architecture.</p><p></p><p><b> </b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>In fact, this is how we normally do what we do:</b></p><ol>
<li>We go to poor villages and talk to the leaders of the community to identify the poorest families with the worst housing situations.</li>
<li>Then we talk to the families. We ask them how many they are, what space they would use most, if children need separate rooms.</li>
<li>After that it is time for Arhipera young architects to start designing. They need to keep in mind all they’ve heard from the families, and also be able to combine sustainable housing with the scarcity of resources.</li>
<li>Measurements – before building the actual house, we have to visit the site many times to get the right measures.</li>
<li>Once all is in place, we call our construction team and they get going.</li>
<li>And, of course, throughout the entire process, the whole family participates in the construction and all other related activities.</li>

day care for children. In numbers, this means around $35.000. In reality, this means helping two large families move into a decent space, and bringing all children in a safe environment.</p>
<p>Based on our past experience, <b>each house will cost $12.500.</b> Of this amount,</p><p> - 60% will go to actual construction costs, </p><p> - 10% to
transport, organization, and community development, </p><p> - 20% to design, building permits and other taxes</p><p> - 10% are operational costs (accounting &amp; programme administration)</p>

</ol><br/></div>","Once upon a time there
was a girl who lived in a mud hut together with her parents, two siblings, and
a few cats, dogs and a duck. The house had only one window and no electricity, and the ceiling
was so low that the parents always had to walk with their heads down. Everyday, Georgiana would do her homework by a candle.
But one winter’s day,
a group of young people came to the village and said they wanted to help those
in most need to build a decent home. After talks to the other villagers, it was
no surprise that Georgiana’s family was to be chosen. As spring came, the team returned to the village and worked along the family. And so, by the next
winter, the girl together with her family, cats, dogs and, of course, the duck,
moved into a new house which had wide windows, as many light bulbs as to read all the
books in the village, and no one needed to bend their head when inside. The girl lived happily ever after, but
not before being the first in the family to finish high school and dreaming of
attending university.What if we told you that this is no fairy tale, but a real
story? What if we told you that people just like you donated and changed the life of Georgiana forever? This is Georgiana. 
This is her old house. One window, no electricity for 17 years.
... and her new houseBuilding on the edge of societyArhipera Association is raising money to build two
houses and a day center for children in the village of Belciugatele, Calarasi
county, South-East Romania. Many people there live at the edge of their world,
in extremely poor conditions and with no future. These families could be
reintegrated in society, were they to move into a better house, and engaged
into a good social programme. At the same time, a day center would bring
peace of mind for parents who seek work, but worry about leaving their children
unsupervised at home.
The vicious circle of
rural poverty. How did we get here?
Some may argue that people are
responsible for their faith, but we beg to disagree. The culture of poverty is
a cruel place, where people are so far off the functioning society that it
would be virtually impossible for them to lift themselves without any help from
others.
In Romania, around 10% of people live in
extreme poverty, many of them in rural areas, where they have little chance to
change their status. Poor families build small houses, sometimes on illegally-occupied
plots of land. As result of this, they enter a vicious circle, because the cost
of entering legality in Romania is extremely high, and usually accompanied by a
lot of almost impossible paperwork. In this sense, poverty is no longer an
ethical issue, but is seen in light of its deprivation of potential. A house is
no longer just shelter, but the initial deposit for a better life.
We can give you loads of
statistics or we can just go back to the girl from our story and her life
before she had a house. Imagine you are Georgiana and you want to have your
first birthday party. You invite your friends from school, but when they arrive
they laugh at you, your house and family, and then they leave. 
Unfortunately this is not
fiction; this is what happened to Georgiana when she wanted to celebrate her
14th birthday in her old house.
What is Arhipera?
Arhipera Association means a
group of young Romanian architects, volunteers and their mentor, Lorin
Niculae. Founder and coordinator at Arhipera association and school,
Lorin is an experienced architect and professor at the ""Ion Mincu"" Architecture University in Bucharest. Despite having a lot on his plate, he
spends a big part of his time mentoring the young architects involved in the
social housing projects. 


The Arhipera members and volunteers are regular architecture students, but who have an apetite for doing more than just the usual university assignments. 

Since 2011, the team has designed
clever social housing, knocked on the doors of investors, and built homes
together with several families which lived at the margins of Romanian society.
Arhipera’s aim is to build homes for but also with those who
need them. In the professional jargon this means social participative
architecture. We start from the belief that people deserve a decent house, but
it is only when they truly get involved in the construction process and alter
their home with time, that we consider our project a success. When people feel
a place reflects their identity and fulfills their needs, then they decide to
stay and make the house their home. 
This is successful social architecture. In fact, this is how we normally do what we do:
We go to poor villages and talk to the leaders of the community to identify the poorest families with the worst housing situations.
Then we talk to the families. We ask them how many they are, what space they would use most, if children need separate rooms.
After that it is time for Arhipera young architects to start designing. They need to keep in mind all they’ve heard from the families, and also be able to combine sustainable housing with the scarcity of resources.
Measurements – before building the actual house, we have to visit the site many times to get the right measures.
Once all is in place, we call our construction team and they get going.
And, of course, throughout the entire process, the whole family participates in the construction and all other related activities.

""Adequate housing means housing which evolves over time and reflects the identity of its owners"" (Lorin Niculae, Arhipera founder)What we want to do now or how your donation will be spentOur wish for the coming year is to build two houses and a
day care for children. In numbers, this means around $35.000. In reality, this means helping two large families move into a decent space, and bringing all children in a safe environment.
Based on our past experience, each house will cost $12.500. Of this amount, - 60% will go to actual construction costs,  - 10% to
transport, organization, and community development,  - 20% to design, building permits and other taxes - 10% are operational costs (accounting & programme administration)
But building houses only fixes half of the probrem. As part of our integrated approach to fighting social inequality, we allocate a third of the money to building a day center
for children. This space in vital for the development of a community because it
allows both parents to go to work, and gives them peace of mind when it comes
to the safety of their children. We have too many sad stories to give you about
children left at homes with improper heating devices or simply without food
until evening.Any donation, however small will help us.In fact, we have even broken it down for you, in case you think a small amount will not make a difference.With...$5 - we buy a bag of cement$10 - we buy a 4m long wood beam$25 - we buy 3 sqm of steel sheets for the roof$100 - we buy one solid front door$1000 - we have enough to lay the foundation$5000 - we build the house structure and walls up to the roof, without the finishings$7500 - the house is ready!Why should you help us?Arhipera means fixing three big problems in one go:
We build homes for and with those who desperately need them. By involving the recipient families we make sure that the house indeed becomes a home and the starting point for a dignifying life.
We give jobs to those who are normally rejected because of discrimination. Our construction team is made of Roma people.
We give a chance to architecture students to show what they can do. The sketches and designs of our young architects have been put to good use in the communities we are working with. 
Our method works. Here is what we've already done:
Since reaching the current formula in 2011, Arhipera has
achieved the following:1. Dor Marunt village, Calarasi county – four houses and one community center
2. Sarulesti village, Calarasi county – four houses and one community
center
3. Belciugatele village – three houses4. We've also rehabilitated ten existing houses in Sarulesti and Dor Marunt villages.
All this, plus many other projects which involded designing,
in Romania and Africa. What we hope to achieve in the long runOur dream is to turn Arhipera into a national project, with teams in all of Romania's 41 counties. What we can do for now is to keep proving that our model works and is sustainable. We are now in talks to have a new Arhipera team in the heart of Transylvania.""My dream for the next five years is to see Arhipera grow into the first truly-sustainable project for social housing in Romania.

<p>My name is Ashley and this is for my mother June. By all means she is the best mother is the world, and I'm not being biased. Not only has she been the best mother I could ever ask for, but she has time and time again stepped up and been a mother to people who aren't her kin. Everyone calls her ""Momma June"", ""Momma"", or just plan ol' ""Ma"". She has taken in multiple teens in the past, just because they needed it, and she could.</p>
<p>She has always been there for everyone, tried her best, even when she kept getting kicked back into the dirt. That isn't why I am here though, just wanted to give you a heads up that this woman loves to help others...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few months ago my mom finally was able to purchase a mobile home on some nice little chunk of land (after money issues in the past), it was a simple, comfy, quiet place. Perfect for her and my Grandma to live in. Needless to say she was over the moon about it. Before moving in she started trying to spruce it up. A little paint, cleaning the rugs, the usual. About one week prior to moving in, she stops by to check on the water (she had just gotten a pipe replaced) as she walked up the stairs she noticed a broken window. Being the wonderful person she is her first thought was ""aww man.. some kids must have hit a ball through it while playing"". If only that was the case. As she opened the front door she walked into total destruction. Every single window was knocked out, there were profanities and (poorly) Nazi related symbols painted on her walls. The walls had holes knocked into them, my Grandmother's bathroom was destroyed, the ceiling and fans were totaled. Whomever broke in to do this (the police never caught them) also pour gallon(s) of paint down into the air vents in the house, ripped out all the light switched and crushed the fuse box. When they police came and looked around the only thing they could say was ""well, you have 4 walls and a roof, it could have been worse, they didn't burn it down"". They also clogged up all the drains and pouring urine in them and on the floors, so everything had to be pulled up.</p>
<p>She has had some help (and we are very grateful), but it hasn't been enough. We don't have the money to finish it up. So currently my mom, Grandma, Puggy Sue (the dog), and 2 cats are living there, they only have single pane windows, one working bathroom, no carpets, the door(s) keep falling off, the stove can't work because of the fuse box, they turn the lights on by pushing a pen cap into the walls.</p>
<p>I just want my mom to have something her's. Something she can be proud of, and love and feel safe in. Please help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Also the pictures loaded are the before hand, since the after has disturbing/offensive symbols and writing I felt it in poor taste to upload them on this site.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need </strong></p>
<p>I put $10,000, that is just a number, anything will help. what the money will get her is</p>
<ul>
<li>Weather proofing double pane windows</li>
<li>a toilet for my grandmother</li>
<li>flooring for for living-room, master bedroom, and kitchen</li>
<li>paint</li>
<li>new doors</li>
<li>new ceiling fans (they were smashed and not in the fun ""HULK SMASH"" way.</li>
<li>A proper fuse box so they can cook (they are eating out of a microwave and my loving kitchen of friends for months now)</li>
<li>Honestly this one ins't a NEED it is more or a wish from me. I want to be able to install an alarm system so I know they are a little safer.</li>

My name is Ashley and this is for my mother June. By all means she is the best mother is the world, and I'm not being biased. Not only has she been the best mother I could ever ask for, but she has time and time again stepped up and been a mother to people who aren't her kin. Everyone calls her ""Momma June"", ""Momma"", or just plan ol' ""Ma"". She has taken in multiple teens in the past, just because they needed it, and she could.
She has always been there for everyone, tried her best, even when she kept getting kicked back into the dirt. That isn't why I am here though, just wanted to give you a heads up that this woman loves to help others...
 
A few months ago my mom finally was able to purchase a mobile home on some nice little chunk of land (after money issues in the past), it was a simple, comfy, quiet place. Perfect for her and my Grandma to live in. Needless to say she was over the moon about it. Before moving in she started trying to spruce it up. A little paint, cleaning the rugs, the usual. About one week prior to moving in, she stops by to check on the water (she had just gotten a pipe replaced) as she walked up the stairs she noticed a broken window. Being the wonderful person she is her first thought was ""aww man.. some kids must have hit a ball through it while playing"". If only that was the case. As she opened the front door she walked into total destruction. Every single window was knocked out, there were profanities and (poorly) Nazi related symbols painted on her walls. The walls had holes knocked into them, my Grandmother's bathroom was destroyed, the ceiling and fans were totaled. Whomever broke in to do this (the police never caught them) also pour gallon(s) of paint down into the air vents in the house, ripped out all the light switched and crushed the fuse box. When they police came and looked around the only thing they could say was ""well, you have 4 walls and a roof, it could have been worse, they didn't burn it down"". They also clogged up all the drains and pouring urine in them and on the floors, so everything had to be pulled up.
She has had some help (and we are very grateful), but it hasn't been enough. We don't have the money to finish it up. So currently my mom, Grandma, Puggy Sue (the dog), and 2 cats are living there, they only have single pane windows, one working bathroom, no carpets, the door(s) keep falling off, the stove can't work because of the fuse box, they turn the lights on by pushing a pen cap into the walls.
I just want my mom to have something her's. Something she can be proud of, and love and feel safe in. Please help.
 
Also the pictures loaded are the before hand, since the after has disturbing/offensive symbols and writing I felt it in poor taste to upload them on this site.
What We Need 
I put $10,000, that is just a number, anything will help. what the money will get her is

Weather proofing double pane windows
a toilet for my grandmother
flooring for for living-room, master bedroom, and kitchen
paint
new doors
new ceiling fans (they were smashed and not in the fun ""HULK SMASH"" way.
A proper fuse box so they can cook (they are eating out of a microwave and my loving kitchen of friends for months now)
Honestly this one ins't a NEED it is more or a wish from me. I want to be able to install an alarm system so I know they are a little safer.
Maybe some sort of fencing for protection too.
The Impact
The impact is simple, and yet so important. They will have a real home. Not a place with some of their stuff in it, with plastic covering the windows to keep the draft out. A home.
Other Ways You Can Help
Look, I know times are rough and hard, I get it if you can't donate money. Your time would be great. If you know how to lay flooring, put in windows, plumping, fuses, anything really. That would be amazing.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>One Small House has been building homes for families in need in Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico for nearly ten years, and has built over 30 homes, a HIV hospice, and a community health clinic as well. We are returning this June to build a home for Rodolfo and Carolina Cabarrubia and their two daughters, Nanci and Martha. The family is supported by Rodolfo, who works two jobs, one painting and the other in car repair. Unfortunately, even with two jobs the family is unable to afford adequate housing. The volunteers for One Small House come from across the country (and sometimes across the world) to support the idea that when one family has a hand up, they can help lift their entire community.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The homes are 16'x20' with 3 rooms, a small loft, and a latrine. Simple and durable, these homes provide families with a space to prosper. Local labor pours the concrete foundation, and local companies supply all the building materials. Volunteers frame, roof, side, wire, drywall, and paint the house under the guidance of our terrific local contractor, Oscar.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our organization is completely staffed by volunteers - this means that 100% of your donation goes directly to the build. And with 4 people living in the house you help to build, that's the same as multiplying every donation by 4. If you're interested, we would be more than happy in having you join us in June, or on any of our two builds later this summer. We take people of all skill and language levels and provide life changing experiences for both the families we support and the volunteers who join us.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>By the end of August we will have built 5 houses and a medical clinic in just under 8 months, and none of this would be possible without generous support from donors and volunteers. We will be finishing our June build on the 20th and need help raising the last $3000!</p>

<h3>How they came alive</h3>
<p>Some people love shoes, others crave coffee. My addiction is knitting, reading fairytales and drawing doodles. Since I was little I've always dreamed of starting my own company. </p>
<p>After graduating art school I've been working in fashion for the last 6 years. Now it's time to broaden my horizon by starting a knitwear company. Well, not just a company but something fun. While knitting a monster-jumper for Nora (the cuttiest 2 year old ever) it all came toghether: it had to be monsters. Nomster was born.</p>
<p>Nomsters' aim is to create knitted creatures only limited by your own imagination. Basically this means I will knit your fantasy, your drawing, your daydream, your funny nightmare. Your own drawing will be transformed into the coolest Nomster. Alongside these bespoke knittings I will launch my own Nomster-family.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Frankenstein them (bringing them alive)</h3>
<p>Handknitting of these nomsters takes loads of time obviously, so to make this company a succes I'll need to invest and therefore I need your support. My goal is to raise 5.000 dollar to fund my monster company. This will fund for:</p>
<p>- product development: use of industrial machinery, creating patterns, expirement with yarns, prototyping and material costs,</p>
<p>- launch Nomster website, pr and marketing (tweet tweet),</p>
<p>- education - training (take classes in how to use the machinery)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By funding this project you're not only helping me to fulfill my dream of my own company. You will also invest in me personally. All the proceeds of Nomster will either be invested in the company or in myself. It allows me to take university classes to enhance my skill level. </p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>We are a network of people from diverse backgrounds who have happened across a scalable social contract which might revolutionise the economy. Ian is making his living as a ethical policy writer. Pam has been working below the radar with African development. Liam is a network activist facilitator. Wendy is a family therapist managing a child mental health service. David is a maths teacher, who played with self-organising systems in his classes. Matt works with social media impact at KPMG. Nick is an architect at /00. What drew us together is the potential of eco^2.</p>
<p>Eco^2 is a new economic entity. It is not a corporation or government or charity. It creates a space for us to co-create value, a financially viable way to fund the ""commons"". With this entity, we will be able to help people align, collaborate, and scale up ideas to prototypes and working models, in such a short period of time that it can outcompete traditional models. Put simply, in eco^2, money flows through people and does not aggregate in things.</p>
<p>By contributing money to this project, we aim to ""birth"" this economic entity with around £50k by 25th April, of which 20% will be raised through crowd-funding. This will allow us to invite and pay people who can produce value in short periods of time. The beauty of eco^2 is that it is not restricted to a set list of ideas, but is essentially receptive to new ideas <em>all the time</em>. So, if you are feeling up for it, contribute an idea in the comments section, and we will respond!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The £10k ($16000) raised will be distributed in the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li>£2000 to invite Michel Bauwens of the p2p foundation to research, analyse, and validate the eco^2 entity in terms of p2p philosophy and practice</li>
<li>£2600 to invite one or other of the members to work for two days a week throughout the first season to engage and assist people who have been invited</li>
<li>£2000 to invite the self-selecting teams who wish to realise three ""gem"" projects</li>
<li>£2000 to birth the entity in countries around the world</li>
<li>£1400 to invite 140 people in the first season</li>
</ul>
<p>Any money which is attracted to the entity as a result of the value participants co-create will be ploughed back in to inviting more people. In this way, the initial fund of £10k attracts a further £10k during its first 13 weeks, thus perpetuating the life-time of the eco^2.</p>
<p>By contributing to the birthing fund, you are entitled to the following list of perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>invitation to the entity for an hour, where you can find out more, or, more importantly, we can find out what you are trying to do, and begin starting to help you realise your most passionate ideas</li>
<li>invitation to the birthing party on April 25th, and subsequent seasonal parties, to network and celebrate all the good things we've done</li>
<li>invitation to be within the entity for the period of time you have funded -- £10-hour, £100-day, £1k-week, £10k-season</li>
</ul>
<p>The funds raised help us exist at the organisational level, even though eco^2 is not correctly speaking an organisation but a network of aligned individuals working together to create social value. By having sufficient funds, we can start the pay-it-forwards cycle. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why is this important to you? Because the entity is not a company, or a bounded thing, it means that you can take part in it as you wish to. It is a new way to engage financially. Your money, on your terms. And because it is scalable, you can start at £10-hour, and ""grow"" your involvement into weeks and larger scales of money-time. One of the side-effects of eco^2 is that the distinction between employer and employee is balanced, as you determine whether you are helping others achieve their dreams, as well as others helping you achieve yours.</p>
<p>Why is this important to the world? Because our social institutions are not equipped to deal with the level of environmental deterioration. It's a problem in how we structure ourselves into groups, companies, political parties and so on. Eco^2 is not a group, but a network. Networks have a better chance of dealing with the scale of disorder we are facing on this planet, in terms of the pressures on the environment, as well as the social inequities.</p>
<p>Eco^2 is not a software platform. We have a prototype platform, but our aim is to give it to google. We believe in collaboration not competition. Eco^2 is a real-world network, where we get things done. This means, we will meet in person some day. This is about getting real.</p>
<p>Trust is the biggest issue. Money has replaced trust in our current economic system. You can go into a shop, do transactions, but we don't need a bond of trust between us; we trust the value of money, not the shopkeeper. Eco^2 necessitates a trust relationship between people in order for people to be accountable and responsible to one another. Money does not flow unless there is trust. That is the way we get things done.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This is a work in progress. We are finalising the details of eco^2, reaching out through our soft contacts, approaching companies with a new methodology, and searching for project gems. It is innovation at all levels, so do join in how you can. If you can't contribute money, please comment, tweet or like or +1.</p>

<h2>The place, and what it does</h2>
<p>The Camas Centre is a residential centre based in some stone fishing cottages, in a remote bay on the Isle of Mull, in the Western Isles of Scotland. It offers small groups of young people a chance to experience a simple, sustainable way of living through outdoor, creative, environmental activities. This means things like swimming in the sea, growing your own food, digging peat, climbing the rocks, and generally living in this really earthy and good and honest community way.  </p>
<p>A lot of the groups that come to Camas bring with them young people who have experienced the most profound kinds of exclusion and disadvantage. Sometimes these groups come from churches or youth groups, sometimes from offenders institutions or schools for those with special educational needs. </p>
<p>In all cases, young people come to Camas for a holiday, for an adventure, and for a chance to live in a way entirely removed from anything they've previously experienced. No electricity, solar powered hot water, no mobile phone signal, no shops, no meat (!). I worked at Camas as a volunteer from March to October of 2009, and have seen first hand what an enormous, uplifting influence this radical change can have on young people often from chaotic, sometimes traumatic backgrounds.</p>
<p>It's hard to explain in a few short paragraphs, but in short:</p>
<p>With the help of <strong>volunteer</strong> staff and donations from folks like you and me, Camas manages to give hundreds of young people from some tough old spots a chance to live for a week in a beautiful, peaceful place, and experience something you can't buy in the shops or stream from the internet or learn in a classroom. </p>
<p>I also learned a lot from volunteering there, but that's not for now.</p>
<h3>In their own, far better words:</h3>
<p><a href=""http://thecamasdiary.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://thecamasdiary.blogspot.co.uk/</a></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>What I'm doing now</h2>
<p>I went back up to Camas this year, for the first time since 09, to help out for a week mending bits of wood, and decided that I'd like to find a way to contribute something even if I'd used up all my annual leave taking countless Mondays off recovering from the weekend. As running is the only sporting activity that I've any semblance of ability at, and marathons are conventionally used as a measurement of distance denoting achievement, and that people often complete this distance in some kind of running style for charitable purposes, I decided that's what I'd do also, being someone easily swayed by the mood of the age.</p>
<p>If you know me at all, you'll know that I like a drink, eating fish and chips in bed, and am <em>absolutely appalling</em> at following through on anything I've ever set out to do.

</div></div>","The place, and what it does
The Camas Centre is a residential centre based in some stone fishing cottages, in a remote bay on the Isle of Mull, in the Western Isles of Scotland. It offers small groups of young people a chance to experience a simple, sustainable way of living through outdoor, creative, environmental activities. This means things like swimming in the sea, growing your own food, digging peat, climbing the rocks, and generally living in this really earthy and good and honest community way.  
A lot of the groups that come to Camas bring with them young people who have experienced the most profound kinds of exclusion and disadvantage. Sometimes these groups come from churches or youth groups, sometimes from offenders institutions or schools for those with special educational needs. 
In all cases, young people come to Camas for a holiday, for an adventure, and for a chance to live in a way entirely removed from anything they've previously experienced. No electricity, solar powered hot water, no mobile phone signal, no shops, no meat (!). I worked at Camas as a volunteer from March to October of 2009, and have seen first hand what an enormous, uplifting influence this radical change can have on young people often from chaotic, sometimes traumatic backgrounds.
It's hard to explain in a few short paragraphs, but in short:
With the help of volunteer staff and donations from folks like you and me, Camas manages to give hundreds of young people from some tough old spots a chance to live for a week in a beautiful, peaceful place, and experience something you can't buy in the shops or stream from the internet or learn in a classroom. 
I also learned a lot from volunteering there, but that's not for now.
In their own, far better words:
http://thecamasdiary.blogspot.co.uk/


What I'm doing now
I went back up to Camas this year, for the first time since 09, to help out for a week mending bits of wood, and decided that I'd like to find a way to contribute something even if I'd used up all my annual leave taking countless Mondays off recovering from the weekend. As running is the only sporting activity that I've any semblance of ability at, and marathons are conventionally used as a measurement of distance denoting achievement, and that people often complete this distance in some kind of running style for charitable purposes, I decided that's what I'd do also, being someone easily swayed by the mood of the age.
If you know me at all, you'll know that I like a drink, eating fish and chips in bed, and am absolutely appalling at following through on anything I've ever set out to do. And yet...here I am, writing this 6 weeks from marathon day, about to go out for yet another training run. I suppose that must mean this is something fairly close to my heart and a cause I'd glady do irrevocable damage to my cartilage for.
The marathon is a fairly tough one around Kielder Water in Northumberland. There's lots of hills and all the reviews say things like ""Not for first timers!!!"" but whatever. Anyway - 26.2 miles off-road in the North East. A serious bit of running.

<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions:</strong></p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Is there a market for pollinating services?</span></p>
<p>The market for honey bee pollination is strong, mainly because of the almond industry in Northern California.  There are 740,000 bearing acres of almond groves and 100,000 young acres have been planted and will need pollination in the next year or two.  Currently, bee keepers from around the country and even Australia come to Northern California each year to pollinate the almond groves.  We want to keep the income in California.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How do I know you are going to use the money for this business and not your vacation?</span></p>
<p>We have a separate business account so that all funds donated will be reserved solely for the business. We are not interested in going on vacation with your money; we are determined to make this endeavor successful.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">How do bees help the economy?</span></p>
<p>In California over 90 different crops are pollinated by bees.  Honey bees pollinate about 15 billion dollars worth of crops in US every year. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Why are bees important for the environment and mankind?</span></p>
<p>Bees, along with birds, bats, and insects, pollinate <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">75%</span></strong> of all flowering plants.  Without them the plants would die off. Honey is one of the few foods that has all the nutrients, enzymes, proteins, and water necessary to sustain human life.  Processed sugars only sweeten, but honey also nourishes.  Also, bees pollinate the plants that constitute over one third of our daily diet.  Every third bite is thanks to the bees. </p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Is Almond pollinating the only thing Sunny Honey will do?</span></p>
<p>No.  We will sell honey and pollinate as many other crops as we can.  In the future we’d also like to make products from wax and honey such as soap, candles, etc.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Are you sure you will be able to double your number of hives each year?</span></p>
<p>Only a small amount of wax and bees are needed from an established hive to start a new hive.  The bees that are separated from the old hive are given a few new egg cells and they immediately turn a number of those eggs into queen cells. The first queen to hatch is their queen and the new hive begins.  Potentially, we could even triple our number of hives each year, but the colonies will have a larger numbers of bees and be stronger if we only double them.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Where are you going to put all your bee hives?</span></p>

<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What about colony collapse disorder?</span></p>
<p>The cause of colony collapse disorder is unknown.  Since 2007 the USDA has reported an overall loss of 30% of hives per year, either through CCD or other causes. A certain number of hives might die each winter due to disease or other hive weaknesses.   We plan for this by having more hives than necessary to fill our pollination contracts and putting extra money aside for lean times.</p>

<p>Florida Certified Organic Growers and Consumers, Inc. (FOG) is a 501(c)(3) grassroots not-for-profit corporation established in 1989 to promote organic and sustainable agriculture. These goals are accomplished in two ways; through education, and outreach via programs.  FOG staff administer a wide range of programs including public policy analysis and development, local food systems development, agricultural social justice, and an organic certification program.</p>
<p>One way we develop local food systems is through our Gainesville Initiative for Tasty (GIFT) Gardens program. GIFT Gardens builds raised-bed vegetable gardens for low-income residents as well as the institutions that serve them. All gardens are free of charge and include the raised bed, soil, seedlings, fertilizer, educational resources, and support to help ensure bountiful harvests. FOG’s GIFT Gardens program has been tremendously successful in Alachua County, with gardens having been built in 270 locations county-wide.</p>
<p>We wanted to use the foundation of that success to build Porters Community Farm - Gainesville’s first urban farm. The main component of the Porters Community Farm will be ten 55’ rows that will be intensively grown to supply fresh organic vegetables to the St. Francis House for the Homeless, which is only a few blocks away. In addition to providing shelter to the homeless in our community, St. Francis House also operates a soup kitchen that supplies lunch to 200 individuals every day. With your support, the annual harvest from the Porters Community Farm would be able to provide <strong>1 TON </strong>of organic vegetables to help feed those individuals. </p>
<p>The garden will also include a permaculture food forest and a community garden with plots available for members of the surrounding Porters neighborhood. While the median household income is $27,420 in Gainesville at large, the families of the Porters community have a median income of just $13,284. The community garden will serve as a remedy to at least some of the hunger needs of this poverty stricken community. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make Porters Community farm a reality we need your help. We hope to raise $ 12,000 to establish the farm and manage it for one year. Our budget includes a drip irrigation system, the cost of water, fertilizer, tools, seeds and seedlings, and the part-time salary for one staff member to manage the farm and organize volunteers.</p>
<p>In return for your generosity we have some great perks. Take your pick from a collection of fall seeds, a fancy organic fair-trade lunch sack, a fully installed raised-bed garden of your own, and many more fantastic options. There’s something for everyone!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation will help us provide 1 ton of fresh produce to 200 needy people! That’s quite an impact! We’ll post regular updates and pictures of the project on our website <a href=""www.foginfo.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank"">www.foginfo.org,</a> so that you can watch your dollars make a difference.</p>
<h3>Donate with a Check</h3>
<p>If you don't feel comfortable donating money over the internet, you can send us a check. Just make it out to Florida Organic Growers and mail it FOG at PO Box 12311 Gainesville, FL 32641.

Call it ley lines, feng shui, or simply the fantastic view . . . there is magic here. Now that John Rigge has passed on and Pat is in her sunset years the next generation is invited to step forth to care for this amazing place. This is where we come in, and invite you. </p>

<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 21.0px; font: 18.0px Geneva; color: #222222;"">Our vision is to create a one of a kind retreat, group venue, or personal getaway. We started this project last Spring and have taken it as far as we can by ourselves.  We put $50,000 into new rooves, beams, and other repairs, and successfully ran our first 10-day writers retreat. Hosting this group and twenty or so other guests over the summer gave us a very clear list of what was working and what still needed to be done.</p>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 21.0px; font: 18.0px Geneva; color: #222222;"">Currently the Finca can house 7 guests and 4 family/staff. We need to be able to accomodate 15 guests and 5 famly/staff for the business model to be financially sustainable. The operation will be able to pay its own way by the second year but we need this jump-start to get there.</p>

All modifications will be done in the historic and aesthetic style of the Finca, using the same local builders that have been working with the property for the last 40 years, keeping the rugged, rural feel that has been its signature.</p>

<h2>The Finca and Locale</h2>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 21.0px; font: 18.0px Geneva; color: #222222;"">One hour from Madrid, the Finca sits in the middle of hundreds of acres of olive trees, almond groves, and natural forest. The gentle slope overlooks a breathtaking valley with a 400 mile view. The original buildings, part of a brickworks,  date back 250 years. There is evidence of habitation on the site going back to Roman times. Three natural springs are the lifeblood of the property. There are 7 buildings, a pigeon house, and a spring fed pool - all connected by meandering footpaths, creating a campus feel. </p>

<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; line-height: 21.0px; font: 18.0px Geneva; color: #222222;"">The Great Hall serves as a central meeting area and is ideal for concerts and large groups. The Casita is a casual sitting room. The Tenar is a large open lean-to for dining, hanging out, or escaping the heat of the late summer sun. There are private quarters, and numerous places to be by yourself or with small groups. A central kitchen serves the whole property. There are smaller kitchens in two buildings. Numerous hiking trails venture to the forrest.  Ancient footpaths lead to nearby villages. The surrounding locale is rich with thousands of years of vibrant history and culture.  Within a half hour of the Finca there are 4 large castles, one the home of the famous El Cid. We are also on the route of Don Quixote - Man of La-Mancha and near the Camino de Santiago de Compostela, the famous ancient pilgrimage.</p>

<h2>What's at stake?</h2>
<p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 18.0px Geneva; color: #222222;"">The honest fact is that unless we create this retreat and guest center, the Finca will have to be sold. Nothing would stop a new owner from bulldozing the buildings and putting in a modern villa. This is our chance to ensure that doesn't happen, and it has to happen now.</p>

<blockquote>I never imagined such a glorious place could exist in today’s world.  The old world pace, the gorgeous vistas, the camaraderie of fireside conversation—here is the ideal place to bring a group of aspiring writers.  After a week at the Finca everyone felt a new sense of purpose and well-being. I found myself reaching for an artist’s sketch pad, something I hadn’t done in twenty years. The Finca’s magic touched us all. Simply put, the Finca is life-changing!<br/>                                                               Joan Baranow, Writing Workshop Leader</blockquote>

<blockquote>The opportunity to spend a full week at the FINCA gave me time to reflect and write in a way that was never possible before.  I have been to many places around the world, as a traveler, as an ex-pat teaching in Japan, studying language in a small village in France.  Nothing in my experience comes close to the feeling I had stepping into this very special place.  A lovely setting, David and Emma guiding us through the history, and Joan, our academic professional, nurturing our writing progress all provided me with a once in lifetime experience. <br/>                                                               Madalienne Peters, workshop attendee</blockquote>

<blockquote>I have seen many beautiful places travelling around the world as a journalist. The view from the Finca ranks among  those to  be remembered. Looking across to the  olive groves, fields hills and mountains, the  landscape is the essence  of rural Spain, unchanged for centuries. That and the old character of the Finca make it a place that encourages you to think about the eternal and good things that matter in life. It is a tranquil place for pleasure and  reflection. <br/>                                                                                   Trevor Goodchild, Journalist</blockquote>

The Finca is a historic and restorative jewel, a one of a kind place to unwind, nurture your creative soul,  break away from the modern world, and really connect with your surroundings and the people you are with. Call it ley lines, feng shui, or simply the fantastic view . . . there is magic here. Now that John Rigge has passed on and Pat is in her sunset years the next generation is invited to step forth to care for this amazing place. This is where we come in, and invite you. 



Our vision is to create a one of a kind retreat, group venue, or personal getaway. We started this project last Spring and have taken it as far as we can by ourselves.  We put $50,000 into new rooves, beams, and other repairs, and successfully ran our first 10-day writers retreat. Hosting this group and twenty or so other guests over the summer gave us a very clear list of what was working and what still needed to be done.
Currently the Finca can house 7 guests and 4 family/staff. We need to be able to accomodate 15 guests and 5 famly/staff for the business model to be financially sustainable. The operation will be able to pay its own way by the second year but we need this jump-start to get there.





We plan to transform 3 existing out-buildings into guest quarters, upgrade the plumbing and heating, purchase a vehicle for transportation of guests, and bring the pool area back to life. All modifications will be done in the historic and aesthetic style of the Finca, using the same local builders that have been working with the property for the last 40 years, keeping the rugged, rural feel that has been its signature.




The Finca and Locale
One hour from Madrid, the Finca sits in the middle of hundreds of acres of olive trees, almond groves, and natural forest. The gentle slope overlooks a breathtaking valley with a 400 mile view. The original buildings, part of a brickworks,  date back 250 years. There is evidence of habitation on the site going back to Roman times. Three natural springs are the lifeblood of the property. There are 7 buildings, a pigeon house, and a spring fed pool - all connected by meandering footpaths, creating a campus feel. 



The Great Hall serves as a central meeting area and is ideal for concerts and large groups. The Casita is a casual sitting room. The Tenar is a large open lean-to for dining, hanging out, or escaping the heat of the late summer sun. There are private quarters, and numerous places to be by yourself or with small groups. A central kitchen serves the whole property. There are smaller kitchens in two buildings. Numerous hiking trails venture to the forrest.  Ancient footpaths lead to nearby villages. The surrounding locale is rich with thousands of years of vibrant history and culture.  Within a half hour of the Finca there are 4 large castles, one the home of the famous El Cid. We are also on the route of Don Quixote - Man of La-Mancha and near the Camino de Santiago de Compostela, the famous ancient pilgrimage.






What's at stake?
The honest fact is that unless we create this retreat and guest center, the Finca will have to be sold. Nothing would stop a new owner from bulldozing the buildings and putting in a modern villa. This is our chance to ensure that doesn't happen, and it has to happen now.

Our gift to you.
With your help we will make sure that the Finca is here for you and others to visit, and for a future where places like the Finca are rapidly disappearing. We can help you get here by offering substantial discounts and time at the Finca.  If you are not the traveling type then you will get a piece of the Finca sent to you – whether a photo, painting, postcard or Finca adventures via the Friends of the Finca newsletter. The Finca and its layers of history will be a part of your world, or at least on your refrigerator or your wall.

Testimonials


I never imagined such a glorious place could exist in today’s world.  The old world pace, the gorgeous vistas, the camaraderie of fireside conversation—here is the ideal place to bring a group of aspiring writers.  After a week at the Finca everyone felt a new sense of purpose and well-being. I found myself reaching for an artist’s sketch pad, something I hadn’t done in twenty years. The Finca’s magic touched us all. Simply put, the Finca is life-changing!                                                               Joan Baranow, Writing Workshop Leader


The opportunity to spend a full week at the FINCA gave me time to reflect and write in a way that was never possible before.  I have been to many places around the world, as a traveler, as an ex-pat teaching in Japan, studying language in a small village in France.  Nothing in my experience comes close to the feeling I had stepping into this very special place.  A lovely setting, David and Emma guiding us through the history, and Joan, our academic professional, nurturing our writing progress all provided me with a once in lifetime experience.                                                                Madalienne Peters, workshop attendee


I have seen many beautiful places travelling around the world as a journalist. The view from the Finca ranks among  those to  be remembered. Looking across to the  olive groves, fields hills and mountains, the  landscape is the essence  of rural Spain, unchanged for centuries. That and the old character of the Finca make it a place that encourages you to think about the eternal and good things that matter in life. It is a tranquil place for pleasure and  reflection.                                                                                    Trevor Goodchild, Journalist

<p>As many of you know, my father and I have a complicated relationship.  Seeing him at the hospital this past Wednesday was the first time I had seen him in 10 years.  I needed every minute of those 10 years to sort out my past.  All i can say is that its hard to stay angry at someone in excruciating pain.  Our past relationship fell away this past Wednesday.  I let go of the past, my heart opened, and I was able to forgive my father.  Forgiving him has revealed my incredible, indescribable, humbling love for him; a love beyond my wildest dreams.</p>
<p>To make up for lost time, i'd like be with him.  Heart disease with an open heart surgery in 2003, sorosis, gout, a kidney infection, and a few other complications to his liver put him at high risk even in very basic procedures.  At this moment, he is unable to eat due to an infection in his throat and esophogas, he is unable to talk clearly but for a few words, his body rejects a lot of the medication given him through dysentary, and he is bed bound,  unable to walk.  He is fighting hard, but his body is shutting down. It is a critical time for us.  He is stable,  he responds weakly when spoken to so we are certain that his head is clear.  But today, he is in intensive care.  I feel I need to act quickly.  We are hopeful for his recovery but as we know, the matter is in God's loving hands.</p>
<p>I'd like to spend the month of march in Los Angeles to help my mom look after my dad  at the hospital, or should we be so lucky as to nurse him at home. I plan to get a part time restaurant job while i'm in Los Angeles. The 1600 dollars I raise will cover my cost of living in New York while i'm away.  I will not be able to sublet my place.</p>
<p>I hate asking for help, but it is my experience that in times of crisis, it takes a village to heal the situation.  Thanks for your consideration and support in this matter.  There is no donation too small and I promise you that i'll pay your donation forward one day.</p>
<p>Humbly and lovingly yours,</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Imagine <span>that your only source of water for all of your daily requirements is a large, but polluted pond outside your village</span>. If this isn’t bad enough, imagine having to share this pond with all the local livestock and wildlife, as this is their only source of water too! Dare I mention that Malaria carrying mosquitoes, bacteria and diseases also co-exist in and around this pond?</p>
<p>Despite being well into the 21<sup>st</sup> century, along with all of its technological advancments, it is a disgrace that communities still have no choice but to depend on centuries old practices for their daily subsistence. </p>
</li>
<li>Although the area has a high concentration of dairy cattle, there is no modern centralised milk collection facility for farmers to bring their milk, where it can be safely stored, prior to being transported to the processing dairy.</li>
</ol><h2><strong>One Solution, and a catalyst for further change.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3>£25,000 is all that is needed to build a modern Milk collection centre in Kyeibuza <strong><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">[pronounced Chee-booza]</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 10px;""><strong>.</strong> </span>
</h3>
</li>
</ul><p>We would be providing a vital service to dairy farmers where they can sell their milk, but more importantly, we would also provide the community with its daily requirements of clean water.</p>
<p>The Milk collection centre is the catalyst that would lead to the establishment of  projects that will provide the community with clean water, improved health and education, income generation and food security systems; considerably improving the overall quality of people’s lives. Kyeibuza, would then in turn serve as a model community, which others, both near and far (with our help), could then replicate.</p>
<h3>How can this change be implemented?</h3>
<p>The tanker that collects the milk each day, will on arrival, deliver clean water for washing down the facility and its associated equipment. We will, however, also bring in an additional 5,000 litres that will be made available to the community for its domestic requirements.</p>
<p>The usual practice of pouring away the water (which will have become contaminated by negligible quantities of milk during the cleaning process), is a truly obscene waste of a resource. However, we will build a filter system with which to clean the water, prior to it being pumped into water troughs and made available to the community’s livestock and wildlife. Any remaining water in the system would then be pumped into the pond each morning.</p>
<h3>Health and further benefits.</h3>
<p>With the provision of the community’s water requirements being met by the construction of the Milk collection centre, we can now convert the pond into a community-based commercial fish farm; by utilising an irrigation system linked to the pond, we can provide additional benefits to the community by creating organic gardens from the surrounding land. This enterprise would not only provide the community with fresh fish, fruit and vegetables; but as fish in the pond would eat mosquitos and their larvae which presently breed there, we would see a considerable reduction in the incidence of malaria within the population.   </p>
<p>Once established, we can add further value to this community enterprise by using the income that is generated to provide funding for other projects, which could include, but not be limited to the following:</p>

<p>Permaculture based farming systems take advantage of the many unique ways that natural systems work together to complement one another and sustain life in both abundance and quality.</p>

<p>Having seen how different communities from all over the world have gone from living  a survival based lifestyle to one of abundant  health and prosperity, by simply utilising the principles of permaculture, I was surprised to find that there was no permanent facility providing formal permaculture training across the whole of East Africa.</p>

<h2>RaeAnne's Breakfast &amp; BBQ is raising funds for start-up costs &amp; equipment.  Your contribution can make  Neller &amp; Leo's dreams of owning a diner a dream come true!</h2>
<h3>So...who are we?</h3>
<p>Neller's the chef in the family. Her love for the culinary world started when she was a kid, working along-side her grandma in the kitchen.  She has over 10 years catering &amp; management experience.  Neller is a graduate of Kendall College in Chicago. Her love of good food &amp; fun times helped develop RaeAnne's unique menu &amp; restaurant design.</p>
<p>Leo was born &amp; raised in Chicago.  He's a resident of the Bridgeport neighborhood, where we'll be opening up. He's the biggest fan of Neller's cooking &amp; can't wait for you all to try it!</p>
<p>Leo &amp; Neller met &amp; fell in love about a year ago.  They realized early in their relationship that they had a common interest in good food &amp; the restaurant industry. Their great big love for each other is the driving force behind RaeAnne's Breakfast &amp; BBQ. </p>

<p>CSA stands for community supported agriculture and is a joint partnership between community members and a local farm.

Our CSA caters to low-income families in Washington Heights, in an attempt to provide healthy nutrition and food security in a community plagued by rising diabetes and obesity levels. </p>
<p>To keep the cost of our CSA shares so low we travel to the farm and harvest the CSA shares ourselves every week. We'd like to be able to provide an internship for one youth in our community to join CSA members as they harvest every week. The experience of traveling to the farm and picking your own vegetables is truly eye-opening and humbling and we'd like to give this opportunity to an intern who values food security as much as the CSA members.</p>
<p>Please help us sponsor an intern and donate today!

American families are intimidated by “good eating” due to pricing and the “fad” of healthy eating.

We are happy to give tours of the farm to those interested. This being our eighth year in operation, we know there is much more to learn, and that our work is never done.

Hi and thank you for your interest! 
   I am from Cyprus and I am looking for the opportunity you can give us funding us...giving this way life to our family dream!The whole idea of this campaign is to help us to make our family dream become true, which is to bottle and distribute the pure mineral water that we have found in our fields using a Smart Mobile Bottling Factory.
 Having in mind alternative solutions we finally decided that this is the most cost effective way to do it after having quotations. 
A SMART MOBILE BOTTLING FACTORY!


AMAZING INDEED!!

                                AND THE MOST AMAZING OF ALL? 
                           IT CAN COME TO LIFE WITH YOUR HELP!Watch an example of a top manufacturer of this kind of Mobile Plant

Watch another example of a top manufacturer of this kind of Mobile Plant
It's a vital and a very crucial big step for our life and for our future because as you may know economic crisis affected very much the economy of Cyprus.

Don't hesitate to fund this honest, healthy and worthy effort and make it flow to the people giving us this way the extra push and strength that we need in order to overcome the financing barriers.

Our needs...
Using our savings we have made a water drilling in our fields and found pure mineral water. We have installed an electric generator and pumping machines and we have made chemical and microbiological analysis tests and all results are within reference values. Now we need :

€3 400 for a 5100 liter stainless steel tank for drinking water which will be connected to the water filling system.

*€251 000 for a semi automatic Mobile Water Bottling Factory 


  or *€459 000 for the full automatic Smart Mobile Bottling Factory according to quotations that we have received from top manufacturers of such bottling systems (wow...a cost effective, smart  and a full automatic complete water bottling, capping and labeling plant installed in an ISO standardised container).

* Of course i have asked quotations both for the semi automatic Smart Mobile Water Bottling Factory which costs € 251 000 and for the full automatic Smart Mobile Water Bottling Factory which costs €459 000 in order to have alternative solutions depending from achieving or exceeding my goal, although the fully automated system would be the ideal. 

Achieving my first goal will give me the message that i can try then to achieve my bigger goal, to install the ideal water filling system that i have in mind.
Any contribution is welcome and it will be used to install the Automatic Smart Mobile Factory and with your help we will make it happen!
At a glance...

''A picture is worth a thousand words''...A picture and some words...?
It's not just a business opportunity

After careful study, bottled water of 1.5 liters is the most demanded volume


Do you know that an average adult body is 50 to 65 percent water and in infants, the figure is a whopping 70 percent according to statistics compiled by the International Bottled Water Association?


                 A cost effective bottling plant and a solution that meets all regulations!


 You can make it flow!

<p><strong>Why Gardens?</strong><br/>Because gardens produce healthier food. Only 2% of American children eat enough fruits and vegetables, and 1 in 3 American children born after 2000 is at risk for Type II diabetes. A garden is an introduction to the real, healthy food students and families need access to.<br/><br/>Because gardens can help fix America's nature deficit. With more than 80% of Americans living in cities and suburbs, we need to work harder than ever to teach the values of natural processes.<br/><br/>Because gardens are a living laboratory for education. Not just healthy food—a lesson on what producing healthy food requires. Not just exposure to nature—a way for children to literally harvest the fruits of their labor.<br/><br/><strong>A True Seed Investment</strong><br/>For as little as $10, you can help a community reap all the benefits a garden has to offer. In just 39 days, we plan to raise $2500 per garden; to feed,  teach, and inspire people in each of these 100 communities. Here are a few things our garden plans to do with your donations:</p>
<p><strong>Our garden will not only involve growth of sustainable fruits and greens, but will also help facilitate the growth of the youths in our community.

Only 2% of American children eat enough fruits and vegetables, and 1 in 3 American children born after 2000 is at risk for Type II diabetes. A garden is an introduction to the real, healthy food students and families need access to.Because gardens can help fix America's nature deficit. With more than 80% of Americans living in cities and suburbs, we need to work harder than ever to teach the values of natural processes.Because gardens are a living laboratory for education. Not just healthy food—a lesson on what producing healthy food requires. Not just exposure to nature—a way for children to literally harvest the fruits of their labor.A True Seed InvestmentFor as little as $10, you can help a community reap all the benefits a garden has to offer. In just 39 days, we plan to raise $2500 per garden; to feed,  teach, and inspire people in each of these 100 communities. Here are a few things our garden plans to do with your donations:
Our garden will not only involve growth of sustainable fruits and greens, but will also help facilitate the growth of the youths in our community. The at-risk youths involved in the Regis House Family Empowerment Program will not only have the opportunity to gain their community service hours but will also learn responsibility as they nurture and maintain the garden. The continued upkeep of the garden will provide a platform for education about the importance of community, environment, and overall health for many groups to come.
