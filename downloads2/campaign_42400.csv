<p><strong>The Inverness Poncho – raingear that fits in your sporran!</strong></p>
<p>The Inverness Poncho is produced and is available immediately in all sizes. Order here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.theinvernessponcho.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theinvernessponcho.com</a></p>
<p>A 10% discount will be applied to orders of 12 or more!</p>
<p>Every kilt wearer has gotten caught in the rain without their rain cape – owning an Inverness Poncho ensures that will never happen again.  The Inverness Poncho is the rain cape that comes in a pouch that is small enough to be conveniently stored in your glove compartment, your bagpipe or drum case, your purse, the cargo pocket of your pants – and yes, even in your sporran when you are kilted and on the go.</p>
<p><strong>I don't wear a kilt... why do I need an Inverness Poncho? </strong> While The Inverness Poncho was designed specifically as emergency raingear for someone who would otherwise wear an Inverness Cape, anyone kilted or not could certainly use a more fitted poncho that frees the arms yet protects the arms from the rain, via the cape.  The price and size of The Inverness Poncho make it inexpensive and convenient for anyone to be prepared for wet weather at any time. Hunters, fishermen, hikers, campers, birders, boaters, sports enthusiasts, soccer moms and dads… keeping an Inverness Poncho in your glove compartment, cargo pants pocket, or purse means your day outside can never be ruined by unexpected rain.  Perfect for sporting events and outdoor concerts!</p>
<p><strong>I'm a kilt wearer and I already own an Inverness Cape... why do I need an Inverness Poncho?</strong> The Inverness Poncho is less than half the price of a typical synthetic Inverness rain cape, yet twice as useful being so small when folded. The potential uses of such conveniently-small emergency raingear are countless – for example, a pipe band might issue these to members to keep in their sporrans when weather threatens but has not broken – in this way the band’s uniform appearance, something every band works hard to perfect, will not be marred by those large, unsightly rain cape belt packs, and, if eschewing those, the band won’t get stuck without raingear should the rain begin mid-performance.  Pipe Majors might keep a couple in their cases for those times one or two band members forget their Inverness Capes - it happens!  In fact, kilt-wearing musicians of any type might keep one in their instrument cases at all times, “just in case.”  A Drum Major friend of mine suggested that one might tuck an Inverness Poncho inside one’s feather bonnet  - it will fit!  And The Inverness Poncho will most definitely fit in one of the cargo pockets of those utility-type or “tactical” kilts and, of course, in the cargo pockets of cargo pants or shorts, or in one’s handbag.  </p>
<p><strong>Specs:</strong>  The Inverness Poncho is a water-proof black poncho that is styled after a traditional Inverness Cape. It is made of proprietary-weight polyester taffeta, which is both sturdy and lightweight. The cape portion has arm straps to keep the cape in place, protecting your arms and anything you are carrying under your arms from the rain, and the armholes in the poncho portion have been designed to allow bagpipers to tuck their instrument against their clothing rather than against the slippery raingear fabric.  The collar has an adjustable drawstring that you can tighten to keep the rain out. The black storage pouch containing your Inverness Poncho measures only approximately 4” by 2” by 1” (varies by cape size).  Check out the photos above to see each of these details on the final Inverness Poncho prototype.</p>
<p><strong>Sizing:</strong>  The Inverness Poncho is available in four sizes:</p>
<p>Small – maximum chest circumference 36”, length 42” (fits youths or petite adults up to 5’1” tall)</p>
<p>Medium – maximum chest circumference 46”, length 47” (fits folks with slim-to-medium builds up to 5’8” tall)</p>
<p>Large – maximum chest circumference 54”, length 48” (fits folks up to 6’3” tall)</p>
<p>XL – maximum chest circumference 62”, length 49”  (fits folks up to 6’6” tall)</p>
<p>**Size should be selected based first upon chest or hip circumference, whichever is widest – your poncho will fit comfortably up to and including the maximum circumference indicated for each size - then according to height**</p>
<p><strong>Backstory, and the plan:</strong>  Brought to you by the creator of The Airy Glengarry, the world’s first and only lightweight, breathable mesh glengarry, The Inverness Poncho was born of a conversation with Dan Lyden - friend, Professional bagpiper in the EUSPBA, and early adopter and supporter of The Airy Glengarry.  Thanks to Dan’s suggestion, and after a many-month R&amp;D period in which several prototypes of different fabrics and dimensions were made and adjusted, I  settled on the final design, material, and sizes, and now production is complete.  The inital pre-orders have shipped and The Inverness Poncho is now available in all sizes!

My name is Kerrie Gill. I'm a veteran, and entrepreneur who wants to make a difference.
We've taken something that doesn't degrade naturally over time in the elements, and repurposed it into something else that everyone needs: shoes.
After nearly 4 years of passionately searching for a solution, and 1 year of trial and error to develop them, we have finally developed our first edition, high-quality comfortable sandals made using recycled tires. Our next step is to purchase molds that will allow us to develop our second edition: sandals with straps made from recycled plastic.  

 

What We Need & What You Get

The extrusion process for recycled plastic is different than using virgin plastic, so we have to purchase new strap casings and molds. Each mold costs $5,681 to produce. We will need one mold for men's sizes, and one for women's. So far we have raised $10,000 to pay for the molds, now the goal to raise an additional $10,000 to pay for the inventory. Any additional funds raised will be used for R&D efforts to develop additional functionality like arch support, new treads, and anti-microbial features.  
For a $25 contribution, you’ll receive one pair of 1st Edition Sandals. For a $50 contribution, you’ll receive one pair of pre-ordered 2nd Edition Sandals, and for a $100 contribution, you’ll receive a pair of both 1st Edition sandals now, and a pre-order for 2nd Edition Sandals.
If we don't reach our entire goal, 1% of the funds will still go toward the African children's charity of donor's popular choice, and the rest will lie in waiting until we have gathered enough through sales and other means to purchase the inventory.  


The Impact
This is the first step of many in our efforts to educate and inspire consumers, allowing them to do their small but collectively mighty part in spreading the word and being aware of where their products go when they're done loving them.

Risks & Challenges
Our Indiegogo campaign ends on September 27, 2017. If we have raised enough, we'll go straight into production with our manufacturer and have our 2nd Edition sandals in hand (and on feet) by March 2018, just in time for Spring Break.
If we fall short, and you were a $50 or $100 contributor, we may not be able to get 2nd Edition sandals to you until next summer. We will continue to push sales and funding efforts to achieve our next edition sandals, but can't be sure how long this will take.

</h2><h3>Our Story</h3><p>Meet Ashley, a South Florida native turned New Yorker after heading to the Big Apple in 2014 to start her namesake label. Ashley learned to make jewelry four years ago as an afternoon hobby at a local Florida bead store. Four years ago, while Ashley was working as an independent medical sales rep, the Healthcare Industry took a nose dive due to reimbursement cuts. This left her scrambling for a job and forced her to do some serious soul searching before making her next career move. She took refuge in creating jewelry and was amazed at just how much attention her jewels sparked when she wore them – and even the amount of women who would buy them right off her body!</p><p>Ashley packed her bags and headed for NYC with nothing but a whole lot of drive, determination, and one hell of a dream. Within weeks of launching in 2016, the line was featured in People Style, Esquire, and Cosmopolitan Magazine. During that time, Ashley also landed a deal with Equinox fitness clubs hosting trunk shows in The Shop(s) at their New York City locations. This year, the line was picked up by The Shop at The Montauk Beach House in The Hamptons, Tictail Market in New York City, and BLVD in Manhattan Beach, California. Her jewelry was also recently seen on The Today Show being worn by Hoda Kotb. </p><p><strong>The Short: </strong>The purpose of this campaign is to generate funding for Ashley and her team to manufacture marketing materials and samples so that they can pitch to the buyers of larger ""brick-and-mortar"" and online retail stores. Creating samples can be very costly due the 14k gold filled material they have committed to using - opposed to their ""fashion jewelry"" competitors who use cheaper, lower quality gold plated materials. Somewhere along the line, Ashley had this wild idea: why not make fine jewelry more accessible? Why not tap into the gap between high and low, between Tiffany's and Fashion Jewelry, and create luxury jewelry for every day? With your help, we can create samples to show off our jewelry in person, and let buyers give it a real test run; allowing them to wear it during their busy everyday lives, during their workouts, and even during their showers, so that they can experience and truly vouch for its' everyday  sustainability! As a backer, you have the advantage of receiving an Ashley Carson original piece (or pieces) at a steep discount that you'll likely never see again. We hope to make you proud to be a part of the campaign that launched a hard working, small town girl's dream of creating a sustainable, lifestyle jewelry line and bringing it to high-end retail shelves all over the world. Please continue reading to learn more!</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512442861/kqtxi42giogaurpslv3t.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512442890/j80cp0ale7vuet4gf1pi.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512442932/avlvnm3iofesxddbeczs.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512425729/rrd824twjptinxth0n8a.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Our Mission</h3><p>Ashley Carson Designs aims to create a delicate, sustainable, yet versatile lifestyle jewelry line. Because this line sprung from Ashley’s love of stylish sustainable jewelry (and the market’s lack there of), she continues to design for women looking for on-trend, high-end jewelry that won’t break the bank. We believe in layered and stacked transitional sets that transition from soft and sweet, to sultry and seductive, any time of day. We are advocates for conscious consumption and ethical production. We aim to not only educate our customers about styling and caring for their luxury items, but bring an awareness to the impact that the fashion industry has on our planet as well.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512425817/f5duttpupvuzzsgmp4qh.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Our Collection</h3><p>What makes Ashley Carson so unique is easily its' versatility - its' ability to be styled up or down, and worn on special occasions or for everyday. Our dainty jewels are crafted to last decades without chipping or tarnish.

</ul></div>","***ORDERS WITHIN U.S.A. MUST BE PLACED BY DECEMBER 19 TO ENSURE CHRISTMAS DELIVERY***
Our StoryMeet Ashley, a South Florida native turned New Yorker after heading to the Big Apple in 2014 to start her namesake label. Ashley learned to make jewelry four years ago as an afternoon hobby at a local Florida bead store. Four years ago, while Ashley was working as an independent medical sales rep, the Healthcare Industry took a nose dive due to reimbursement cuts. This left her scrambling for a job and forced her to do some serious soul searching before making her next career move. She took refuge in creating jewelry and was amazed at just how much attention her jewels sparked when she wore them – and even the amount of women who would buy them right off her body!Ashley packed her bags and headed for NYC with nothing but a whole lot of drive, determination, and one hell of a dream. Within weeks of launching in 2016, the line was featured in People Style, Esquire, and Cosmopolitan Magazine. During that time, Ashley also landed a deal with Equinox fitness clubs hosting trunk shows in The Shop(s) at their New York City locations. This year, the line was picked up by The Shop at The Montauk Beach House in The Hamptons, Tictail Market in New York City, and BLVD in Manhattan Beach, California. Her jewelry was also recently seen on The Today Show being worn by Hoda Kotb. The Short: The purpose of this campaign is to generate funding for Ashley and her team to manufacture marketing materials and samples so that they can pitch to the buyers of larger ""brick-and-mortar"" and online retail stores. Creating samples can be very costly due the 14k gold filled material they have committed to using - opposed to their ""fashion jewelry"" competitors who use cheaper, lower quality gold plated materials. Somewhere along the line, Ashley had this wild idea: why not make fine jewelry more accessible? Why not tap into the gap between high and low, between Tiffany's and Fashion Jewelry, and create luxury jewelry for every day? With your help, we can create samples to show off our jewelry in person, and let buyers give it a real test run; allowing them to wear it during their busy everyday lives, during their workouts, and even during their showers, so that they can experience and truly vouch for its' everyday  sustainability! As a backer, you have the advantage of receiving an Ashley Carson original piece (or pieces) at a steep discount that you'll likely never see again. We hope to make you proud to be a part of the campaign that launched a hard working, small town girl's dream of creating a sustainable, lifestyle jewelry line and bringing it to high-end retail shelves all over the world. Please continue reading to learn more!    Our MissionAshley Carson Designs aims to create a delicate, sustainable, yet versatile lifestyle jewelry line. Because this line sprung from Ashley’s love of stylish sustainable jewelry (and the market’s lack there of), she continues to design for women looking for on-trend, high-end jewelry that won’t break the bank. We believe in layered and stacked transitional sets that transition from soft and sweet, to sultry and seductive, any time of day. We are advocates for conscious consumption and ethical production. We aim to not only educate our customers about styling and caring for their luxury items, but bring an awareness to the impact that the fashion industry has on our planet as well.Our CollectionWhat makes Ashley Carson so unique is easily its' versatility - its' ability to be styled up or down, and worn on special occasions or for everyday. Our dainty jewels are crafted to last decades without chipping or tarnish. Never again will you have to set aside your favorite body chain or necklace for only ""special occasions,"" due to the fear of wearing it out. Our products are so versatile you can wear them nearly anywhere: We design using strictly 14k gold filled materials. Most of our competitors use  gold plated materials, creating a collection that is doomed to chip and tarnish after only a handful of wears. The Ashley Carson collection is created to last. Ashley’s jewelry easily pays itself off times ten over, considering the amount of years it will stay like-new, chip and tarnish free!What Exactly is Gold Filled?The layer of gold alloy on gold-plated jewelry is so minuscule it is barely noticeable in the above image. Gold-filled jewelry has 100x more gold alloy than gold plated and because that layer is so much thicker, it means gold-filled jewelry lasts longer and stands up to wear and tear better than gold plated. All it would take is one small scratch on a gold-plated piece to expose the jeweler’s brass underneath.Why is there such a difference in the amount of gold alloy? The answer lies in the manufacturing process: To make gold-filled pieces, the core metal is sandwiched between two layers of gold alloy which is then heated and passed through a roller several times – a process that both bonds the metals together and thins the sheet out. To make gold-plated pieces, an electric current is used to negatively charge the base metal and positively charge a solution containing gold ions. The positive gold ions are attracted to the negative charge of the core metal, slowly forming a layer of gold on top of the core.   But Ashley, if it doesn't chip or tarnish, why isn't everyone using gold filled? We wondered the same thing at first! However, using gold filled drastically limits a designer's creative freedom, as it cannot be cast (molded) into shapes/designs, unlike its counterparts: solid gold and gold plated.

Even Ashley was frustrated when she made the switch from plated to gold filled...but certainly not as frustrated as when her plated jewelry would tarnish on her over and over again! It was an exciting challenge learning to create something unique with just chain and stones; however, it resulted in a line built to last decades that is suitable for virtually any occasion!What You GetNot long ago, if you wanted luxury jewelry you had to either wait for a gift box to appear under the Christmas tree or visit a traditional jeweler with an intimidating security entrance and a hushed atmosphere.

<p>Here is a quote from Dale Dougherty, the Founder and Executive Chairman of Maker Media, MAKE Magazine, and Maker Faire,  regarding our shows at Bay Area Maker Faire - the original and largest fair, it hosts over 1000 makers and around 150,000 attendees.</p>
<p>""One of the highlights this year was the “MakeFashion” show, organized by Shannon and Maria Hoover from Calgary with a group of wearables designers, and developed along with our crew member, John “Parts” Taylor.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was an incredible, moving experience that created a new genre, using the fashion show model to hack the fashion show and transform who gets to walk down runways and what they are wearing. This show featured fashion for the differently-abled, for men and women, as well as for children. Thousands of people watched. To see prosthetic limbs featured as a multi-colored LED fashion statement was to feel joy and compassion. Everything was stunning and I loved seeing the look on the faces of young girls and women in the audience.""</p>

</div></div>","How do you foster a culture of innovation in Calgary?By working together as designers and engineers, we've developed a new genre of culture in Calgary; the wearable tech fashion scene. Calgary has the most active wearable tech fashion scene we know of. 
We aren't talking about
gadgets on your wrist.
We are talking about enchanting garments that allow true personal expression. 
Fashion that can shift color, monitor your vitals, help with muscle
rehabilitation, respond to incoming notifications, change shape to adapt to
weather and many other useful functions. 
This is the future of fashion and technology. We call it MakeFashion.For three years we've
collaborated to organize the MakeFashion Runway & Gala. Each of the 28 pieces created
this year had hundreds of hours, and thousands of dollars invested. We, as designers and engineers, have been working together to elevate each other, making the engineering more beautiful, and making the beautiful more functional. 
Everything we create is for
the love of exploring what is possible (and what isn’t...yet). We hope to advance our vision and start solving real personal health and habit problems as well as enriching people's lives through human expression that was never before possible. ..........................Designer: Erina Kashihara
What we need help with:
The 2015 MakeFashion show was
sponsored by Seeed Studio, and they have now offered us an opportunity to work with them in Shenzhen, China. There, we'll be working in their makerspace to imagine and create a interactive fashion show for the Maker Faire Shenzhen. We plan to be in Shenzhen from June 2-23. 
Seeed Studio has
contributed $5000 to getting us there for that time.
This is an incredibly vital step to furthering our art. In this case, the technology we are using originates from our destination. We want to travel to the source and help influence what is being developed, and to show the technology companies what we are creating.
..........................



Your donations will help us
with the following:
-Securing a videographer to produce a documentary.
-Cover costs for flights, room and board.
-Acquire the necessary materials and accessories to make our high fashion garments for the world to see on the runway.
..........................



Why should you help us?
As a supporter,  you'll get to follow along with us online and watch how our exploration of technology and fashion develops . Follow us on exciting shopping trips for components in the massive electronics markets, creating the
wearable tech fashion, and fitting electronics inside our own high fashion creations. 
You will also have access to perks listed on the sidebar. Unique handmade products, VIP Tickets to see the next MakeFashion show in March 2016 in Calgary, and many others.
Together we hope to make an
impact on the global technology scene and show the world, and the 100,000+ people at
the Maker Faire, what can come from the city of Calgary.

</p>
<p>I’m passionate about shoes. They’re what I love. Ever since I the
first time I saw Michael Jordan play basketball, all the way back in 1988, I
knew that I wanted to work with shoes. In some way, in some capacity, shoes had
to become my life. The drive inside me was that strong. I was totally
captivated. Then, as a senior at Washington University in St. Louis, I
simulated the creation of a shoe start-up for my thesis project. This was a
great learning experience for me, and after graduation, I accepted the position
of creative director at a shoe startup based out of Memphis. Soon after that,
the startup sent me to China on a six-week business trip. During those six
weeks, however, the startup went under. Instead of returning to the comfort of
the States, I decided to stay in China and see what I could learn.</p>
<p>What I saw will always stick with me. The conditions in the shoe
factory were abysmal, often unspeakable. The workers’ health was failing
collectively, and the environment was unsafe in a lot of glaringly obvious
ways. Every day I went home with a headache or a stomachache, sick from
breathing in the fumes with which these people were living their lives, months,
years, decades apiece. While I picked up a good many lessons relating to
creating the shoe themselves, my main takeaway from this experience was what I
wanted to do differently. I was as devoted to shoes as ever, but now with a
caveat: I must do no evil in the world along the way.</p>
<p>My name is Jamien Sills, and I am the founder of HEROS Footwear,
a small shoe startup based out of Tennessee. I recently ran my first half
marathon after losing more than 100 pounds, and in doing so, I have decided to
focus the attention of HEROS on HOPERUNNER, a specialized running shoe for
people like me. HOPERUNNER is designed to be lightweight and durable with a
unique structure that compensates for supination or pronation, a condition in
which people run on either the inside or the outside of their feet. Because
HEROS is unlike any other shoe company, we will be donating <b>$30</b> from
every shoe sale to St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital, the charity of
choice of HOPERUNNER’s namesake, Chris Hope, whose running group Team Hope has
themselves raised thousands of dollars for St. Jude’s already.</p>
<p>Right now, we are turning to you, Indiegogo, for help raising
$50,000. This capital will cover the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and
distributing HOPERUNNER. We have already gone through two prototypes on this
shoe, and we are just about ready to get it out to market. Your contributions
will make that possible. Thank you.</p>
<p>Life. Hope. Achievement. These are the values upon which
HEROS FOOTWEAR operates. We are a team of scientist-athletes, dedicated to
producing a shoe that is better in every way, a shoe that improves on aspects
that other shoe companies have come to ignore, a shoe that is made from
runners’ minds with runners’ needs and wants at heart. The HOPERUNNER is the
culmination of hundreds of hours of study and experimentation. Super
lightweight at just 10.5 ounces, wearing a HOPERUNNER has the feel of an
ultra-supportive sock. Designed to reduce foot fatigue and to facilitate a
smooth heel-to-toe transition, HOPERUNNER will encourage longer and more
intense runs by creating a comforting environment for your foot. Plus, with our
“O-ring” support system, which locks the top of the shoe over your foot without
any pinch, you will wonder why the traditional shoelace is not already a thing
that we only read about in history books. Truly, HOPERUNNER is the shoe of the
future, brought to you today with steady work and smart effort.</p>
<p>Both developed and tested by a marathon runner, these shoes
were most recently worn in competition at the St. Jude’s Marathon in (city).
Each HOPERUNNER shoe is named after someone who has fought cancer: the pink is <i>Rosalind</i>, after the designer’s sister who
passed away from breast cancer in February 2015, and the blue is <i>Eli</i>, after a survivor who was treated at
St. Jude’s.</p>
<div>We are looking to raise $50,000 in funding in order to fully launch the HOPERUNNER and HEROS Footwear. We will use the funds to order and distribute the initial inventory in both colorways. We currently manufacture in China, and must order a significant amount of units for our first run. As stated, we will donate $30 from EVERY pair sold to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, so you're not only funding a socially conscious start-up, you're also supporting one of the greatest organizations on the planet. After the launch of the HOPERUNNER, we have an extensive line of footwear products built specifically to solve the footwear needs of the EVERYDAY HERO, that we will be rolling out. We are also looking to eventually manufacture our products in the US by utilizing a 3D printing process coupled with organic materials that we have already begun research and development on. </div>
<div>If we are not able to reach our full goal, we will use the funds to order at least one colorway of the HOPERUNNER. Once that colorway is successful, we will offer other colors based on the season.</div>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>HEROS is footwear for the EVERYDAY HERO. We are problem solvers, providing footwear solutions for the unique needs of the EVERYDAY HERO. We are not a typical shoe company, All of our products will derive directly from the needs, input, and feedback of  the EVERYDAY HERO.We will innovate and reinvent in order to accommodate the EVERYDAY HERO. We are committed to producing Eco-friendly footwear and bringing our manufacturing back to America, and making shoes with purpose. </p>
<p>HEROS is not only about making shoes for the EVERYDAY HERO, we are about supporting the EVERYDAY HERO. A portion of the proceeds of EVERY shoe we make will be donated to St, Jude's Children's Research Hospital. We will also be partnering with non-profit and charitable organizations to design a shoe, and raise money for their cause. A portion of the proceeds of their shoe will be shared with their organization as well as St. Jude. Every shoe we make, no matter the color, will feature a crimson red lining to show our support and pay homage to St. Jude. </p>
<p>Our risks mostly involve manufacturing and shipping from China. We have been working closely with our manufacturers since 2007 and have built a trusting relationship. We know who is making our shoes, and that they are treated well, and paid a fair wage. The risks come from production being delayed by either being placed behind an abundance of orders, labor strikes, and natural disasters. The same applies to shipping by sea, delays and even loss can occur due to natural disasters or accidents. We will purchase insurance and use a very reliable and reputable shipping company that we have built a relationship with.  </p>
<p>Now, thanks to Indiegogo, we have a platform to present the HOPERUNNER to you, the EVERYDAY HERO. We need your help to bring this product to the market. Knowing that the HOPERUNNER is just the beginning, we will continue to innovate and revolutionize the shoe industry. Our goal is to become the best shoe company in the world by providing the footwear solutions that you need. We will be there with you, because we are here for you. We need your help to get the word out to as many people as possible, so please share this on your social media feeds, email, text, and with friends, family, and co-workers!!<br/><br/></p>
<p>I want to thank you in advance for your support. <br/>You are Our Hero!<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

We know who is making our shoes, and that they are treated well, and paid a fair wage. The risks come from production being delayed by either being placed behind an abundance of orders, labor strikes, and natural disasters. The same applies to shipping by sea, delays and even loss can occur due to natural disasters or accidents. We will purchase insurance and use a very reliable and reputable shipping company that we have built a relationship with.  
Now, thanks to Indiegogo, we have a platform to present the HOPERUNNER to you, the EVERYDAY HERO. We need your help to bring this product to the market. Knowing that the HOPERUNNER is just the beginning, we will continue to innovate and revolutionize the shoe industry. Our goal is to become the best shoe company in the world by providing the footwear solutions that you need. We will be there with you, because we are here for you. We need your help to get the word out to as many people as possible, so please share this on your social media feeds, email, text, and with friends, family, and co-workers!!
I want to thank you in advance for your support. You are Our Hero!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Lorenzo. I have a passion which started very early in life. When I was a child
I used to look at people and ‘extract’ pieces or components of their look,
convinced that everybody has at least one good item to be evaluated. Then one
day I finally decided to transform my sensitivity into a tangible reality, and
I created Stabole. {Sta-bo-lay}</p><p></p><p><b>Wearing a Stabole piece will bring you to the centre of attention. For the right reasons.</b></p><p>Our wish is to create pieces that will make you stand out in a crowd. We want to make sure you get to enjoy the very best of Italian craftsmanship and the high quality of Tuscan leathers. Contemporary yet timeless design, attention to detail and an urban feel – our  mission is to let you explore the classics of tomorrow.</p><p><br/></p>
<h2>THE PROJECT</h2><p></p><p>The strength of
Stabole is in the search of a real object identity, the project itself is
fuelled by a keen eye for detail, materials and the active involvement of
buyers. Our goal is to make the vision of ‘contemporary tradition’ a reality,
transforming it onto something that everyone can appreciate and live in daily
life.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445098820/y2qlsgjl34kvuf8igmta.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p>Stabole bags are
for all those who really want something unique with a taste of tradition and
want to feel that they are <b>making a
radical yet traditional choice</b>. We design products without frills but with
finishing that only a craftsman would be able to make coming in valuable soft,
candid hides or in worn-out looking, smelling leather. </p>
<p></p><p>For our collection
we have chosen a unique material<b>: a soft
and vegetable-tanned horse leather</b>. With this leather, prepared in the
traditional way but with a contemporary finish, it is possible to achieve high
quality handbags. <b>We aim to keep ‘the
art of tan’ alive, producing fine handbags with the help of some of the finest
craftsmen in Italy.</b></p>

<p>Our collection
takes the tradition of true Italian craftsmanship and joins it with
experimentation and design. It’s here that unusual and precious materials
inspire intense suggestions enabling us to create handbags and accessories
ensuring the combination of dynamic lines and volumes, colours and materials. </p>
This
Stabole collection is by far our favourite and it is dedicated to both women
and men. We spent a lot of time seeking the finest leathers in Tuscany,
selecting creative colours and creating made-to-measure accessories. <p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>We’re excited to
present you with our collection and to have the chance to launch it worldwide.
By creating a crowdfunding project, we hope to raise funds for the production
of the collection, representing a new form of the recovery of Italian tradition
in its highest form of art: the craft of quality. </b></p>
<p><b>We would love your
support in helping us bring it to life!</b></p>

<p></p>
<p>Our team sought
out to create Stabole because of our passion for luxury leather handbags and a
desire to cut out the brand inflation and retail markup of popular name brands.</p>
The
new definition of ‘luxury’ should be based not only on a brand name or a price
tag. It should refer to brands that bring real added value to consumers, which
offer a unique overview, an original concept that expresses the emotions,
passion and inspiration of the designer who created it. Luxury is in the search
for high quality and innovative materials, it’s in the detail, in the
rediscovery of handcrafting and ‘Made in Italy’, in global access to small but
top quality products, in specialists with a very unique identity. <p></p>

<h2>MATERIALS</h2>
<p></p>
<p>Our leathers come from Tuscany. Here the art of
leather tanning can be traced back to the middle ages, where tanners and
craftsmen have existed since the 14<sup>th</sup> century. We use
vegetable-tanned leather. From hides to distressed smelling leather, Stabole
bags are synonymous with the tie existing between the object and its producer.</p>
<p><b><span>The leather</span></b><br/>
</p>
<p>Horse leather is
only obtained from the dorsal/back side of the horse. To obtain this particular
quality of skin, besides the traditional process still followed today, a
further touch is needed.</p>

This
begins with the process of fleshing which goes on till the right thickness is
obtained; then the skins are spread and softened using an ancient tand-tool
called ‘palmella’ and finally the skins are greased and polished using glass
and stone hand-tools.

<br/>
</div></div>","Hello, my name is
Lorenzo. I have a passion which started very early in life. When I was a child
I used to look at people and ‘extract’ pieces or components of their look,
convinced that everybody has at least one good item to be evaluated. Then one
day I finally decided to transform my sensitivity into a tangible reality, and
I created Stabole. {Sta-bo-lay}Wearing a Stabole piece will bring you to the centre of attention. For the right reasons.Our wish is to create pieces that will make you stand out in a crowd. We want to make sure you get to enjoy the very best of Italian craftsmanship and the high quality of Tuscan leathers. Contemporary yet timeless design, attention to detail and an urban feel – our  mission is to let you explore the classics of tomorrow.
THE PROJECTThe strength of
Stabole is in the search of a real object identity, the project itself is
fuelled by a keen eye for detail, materials and the active involvement of
buyers. Our goal is to make the vision of ‘contemporary tradition’ a reality,
transforming it onto something that everyone can appreciate and live in daily
life.Stabole bags are
for all those who really want something unique with a taste of tradition and
want to feel that they are making a
radical yet traditional choice. We design products without frills but with
finishing that only a craftsman would be able to make coming in valuable soft,
candid hides or in worn-out looking, smelling leather. 
For our collection
we have chosen a unique material: a soft
and vegetable-tanned horse leather. With this leather, prepared in the
traditional way but with a contemporary finish, it is possible to achieve high
quality handbags. We aim to keep ‘the
art of tan’ alive, producing fine handbags with the help of some of the finest
craftsmen in Italy.

Become part of this project.









Our collection
takes the tradition of true Italian craftsmanship and joins it with
experimentation and design. It’s here that unusual and precious materials
inspire intense suggestions enabling us to create handbags and accessories
ensuring the combination of dynamic lines and volumes, colours and materials. 
This
Stabole collection is by far our favourite and it is dedicated to both women
and men. We spent a lot of time seeking the finest leathers in Tuscany,
selecting creative colours and creating made-to-measure accessories. 


We’re excited to
present you with our collection and to have the chance to launch it worldwide.
By creating a crowdfunding project, we hope to raise funds for the production
of the collection, representing a new form of the recovery of Italian tradition
in its highest form of art: the craft of quality. 
We would love your
support in helping us bring it to life!







Our team sought
out to create Stabole because of our passion for luxury leather handbags and a
desire to cut out the brand inflation and retail markup of popular name brands.
The
new definition of ‘luxury’ should be based not only on a brand name or a price
tag. It should refer to brands that bring real added value to consumers, which
offer a unique overview, an original concept that expresses the emotions,
passion and inspiration of the designer who created it. Luxury is in the search
for high quality and innovative materials, it’s in the detail, in the
rediscovery of handcrafting and ‘Made in Italy’, in global access to small but
top quality products, in specialists with a very unique identity.

<p></p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>On the journey of starting Novel, we
have experienced many risks and challenges.  We have done in-depth
research on all our fabric materials from farm to factory, the limited amount of ethical choices has
taken great work and certainly has not been an easy process. <br/></p>
<p> However, we
are committed to partnering with organizations choosing ethical practices, ethical materials of utmost quality from around the world,
supporting co-ops, fighting for the rights of farmers, and creating sustainable
jobs in the process. <br/></p>
<p><b>Our History:</b> Given our background, we are
sure that Novel will succeed.  We have past
experience in launching product to fight human trafficking that has proven
successful.  UNCHAINED introduced a
bracelet in THE LIMITED stores nationwide in 2015 that raised  $32,500 for
the UNCHAINED Survivor Scholarship Fund that was awarded to 2 survivors of
human trafficking in January of 2016.  </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Definitions:</b></b></p>
<b></b><p><i>Ethically Sourced: </i>Ethically sourced means fair and safe
labor practices, including outlawing child labor. It also ensures that workers
are paid a fair price for their labor. 

</p>
<b></b><p><i>Certified Organic:</i><b> </b>The World Health Organization (WHO)
estimates that approximately 22,000 people die each year in developing
countries as a result of the chemicals sprayed on non-organic cotton.  All
of our materials are GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certified
organic.  Certified Organic means that both the production of the fibre on
the farm, and the processing of this fibre into textiles has been checked at
every step of the processing supply chain, has met organic standards and is
certified by one of the many governing bodies. Organic textiles  fibres
are free from herbicides, pesticides or anything genetically modified.  

</p>
<b></b><p><i>Natural Dyes:</i><b> </b>Our raw materials for the dyes are
taken from nature rather than constructed from dangerous chemicals.  We
value the health of our clients by utilizing organic textiles and natural dyes since
chemicals used in dyes are absorbed into the skin and can be harmful,
specifically to those that suffer from asthma and allergies.</p>

Novel is an ethical clothing line by the co-founders of UNCHAINED. 
Our Company:
Novel ensures dignity and transparency from our sourcing, to manufacturing, to our delivery whereby you can confidently wear a better story. 
With highest levels of transparency and quality, we ensure that all our fabric is slave-free using organic, sustainable materials that won't harm the environment.  As a result of fast
fashion, many major clothing companies utilize factories that exploit workers through debt
bondage, forced labor,  involuntary child labor and with extremely dangerous working
conditions to make the clothing we wear everyday.  Novel believes
in doing things differently. We are starting Novel in Ohio, creating
 dignified, transparent and sustainable jobs by manufacturing our garments here in the U.S. As we grow, we will empower survivors of human 
trafficking and those at risk of being trafficked through employment opportunities with Novel.
  We need YOU to partner with Novel to change the course of

Novel is working with a silk supplier in Siem Reap, Cambodia that only works with sustainable, natural dying methods and gives sustainable jobs to women in need.  All of our Fall 2016 Collection will have elements of silk hand-crafted by these incredible artisans.

The Impact:
By contributing to Novel, you are partnering to create a sustainable, high-end fashion line  that will allow
people to wear a better story.  You are also helping us:


Create sustainable manufacturing jobs in the U.S. , with the eventual goal of sustainable dignified jobs across the globe. 


Help train individuals at risk of exploitation including survivors, homeless and refugees


Help lift individuals out of poverty

Raise awareness about the injustice of fast fashion and labor trafficking


Risks & Challenges
On the journey of starting Novel, we
have experienced many risks and challenges.  We have done in-depth
research on all our fabric materials from farm to factory, the limited amount of ethical choices has
taken great work and certainly has not been an easy process. 
 However, we
are committed to partnering with organizations choosing ethical practices, ethical materials of utmost quality from around the world,
supporting co-ops, fighting for the rights of farmers, and creating sustainable
jobs in the process. 
Our History: Given our background, we are
sure that Novel will succeed.  We have past
experience in launching product to fight human trafficking that has proven
successful.  UNCHAINED introduced a
bracelet in THE LIMITED stores nationwide in 2015 that raised  $32,500 for
the UNCHAINED Survivor Scholarship Fund that was awarded to 2 survivors of
human trafficking in January of 2016.  

Definitions:
Ethically Sourced: Ethically sourced means fair and safe
labor practices, including outlawing child labor. It also ensures that workers
are paid a fair price for their labor. 


Certified Organic: The World Health Organization (WHO)
estimates that approximately 22,000 people die each year in developing
countries as a result of the chemicals sprayed on non-organic cotton.  All
of our materials are GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) certified
organic.  Certified Organic means that both the production of the fibre on
the farm, and the processing of this fibre into textiles has been checked at
every step of the processing supply chain, has met organic standards and is
certified by one of the many governing bodies. Organic textiles  fibres
are free from herbicides, pesticides or anything genetically modified.  


Natural Dyes: Our raw materials for the dyes are
taken from nature rather than constructed from dangerous chemicals.  We
value the health of our clients by utilizing organic textiles and natural dyes since
chemicals used in dyes are absorbed into the skin and can be harmful,
specifically to those that suffer from asthma and allergies.

<p>I give them the experience of wearing clothes and jewelry from indigiounous cultures.  Items that are hand made and filled with loving energy.  I introduce them to natural fibers and unique designs.  I allow them to feel the magnificence of flowing fabric that makes you feel naked... accept better.</p>
<p>I have been traveling the world creating a small collection of prized items that I have been sharing with my friends and clients.  But it always makes me sad when they can't go home with the pieces that they have fallen in love with.  </p>
<p>So... I have had this vision of a clothing and accessory line called ShammaMama.  Now the first step of this would be creating a a moveable closet, a van with a full wardrobe station inside.  So that I pull up and we fully style you right there on the spot.  </p>
<p>This would be a collection of clothes and accessories and what I call 'activation pieces'.  It would be a 1 stop shop of amazing things from around the world available for purchase.</p>
<p>The bigger vision?  To have a full online sales structure filled with clothes, accessories, home goods, etc.  But to start I have a simple mission... to gather a collection of delicious finds from Bali.  </p>
<p>Your contribution will help me make the initial purchases to get this up and running. </p>
<p>I have had a lifetime of experience in searching for the best items.  I grew up with a mother who was an interior designer.  I would travel the world buying antiques and having them shipped back to the states.  I grew up studying the visual natures of each culture and learning how to identify true authenticity.  </p>
<p>Throughout the years, this knowledge has morphed as a photographer and stylist.  </p>
<p>For as long as I remember I have held the vision of having a brand that held the passion of beautiful fabrics interwoven with the intrigue of history.</p>
<p>It is time...</p>
<p>You have all been asking for this...</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So what do I need???</span></p>
<p>$5,000 would allow me to purchase the needed supplies for the initial launch of my moveable closet.  This would allow me to create enough inventory for a 6 week tour throughout California.  </p>
<p>During this 6 week tour I will be doing private photo shoots along with creating private concerts featuring higher conscious women singers.  Basically I am bringing the best features of the higher conscious movement on tour with me to help more people connect with the new side of hippie.</p>
<p>I believe that there is a new era of hippie.  The women that still loves beautiful things while being connected to their essence instead of ego.  </p>
<p>My hope is to bring them the supplies that help them with that. </p>
<p>So what happens if I don't raise all the funds?  I still move forward with this project. It just means that I will have less inventory.</p>
<p>And... if I raise above the asking price??? Then I get to move into stage 2 of the fundraising.  If I raise $10,000 I would get to go to India and Thailand on the way back to the states!  You can't even imagine the fun stuff I could bring back that you all would LOVE!</p>

</div></div>","Our primary goal is to reach people around the world that don’t have the possibility to invest in graphic design.

From city to city we will exchange our work for services or products from the clients. As simple as that, no money involved. This way it makes graphic design available to anyone. We believe that this is the way of the future, exchanging your talents and assets with the ones of those around you.








We are Tiago Narciso and Ana Abreu, a collective of two young graphic designers from Portugal.
With our strong passion for design, travel & surf, we decided to create this new project. We believe that a society that values graphic design is a more developed society. 
If you don’t find us working on one of our design projects, you’re probably going to find us surfing some perfect waves in the nearest beach. 
Here you can find some of our works: http://fordesign.io/work






While studying and working for different people, we realized that design is undervalued and sometimes neglected by a big part of the society.
Phrases like ""This logo is just letters. I could have done that"", ""Send us your proposal and then we will see if we want to work with you"", ""Design and marketing are not that important"" were part of our daily life. 
We felt frustrated by all this, so we decided that we should do something about it. First, we just wanted to show people the importance of design, but then we realized that most small businesses don't have the necessary money to invest in good design. So, we decided that we should give an opportunity to those people. 






While traveling around the world, we will exchange our design work for services or products from the clients. 
Like in the old times, we want to be face-to-face with all the awesome people we are going to meet and work. For now, we plan to go to over 15 countries, but our goal is to do this in the entire world and to encourage other people to do it too.


During the trip, we are going to live in our van. We will transform it into our small home and design studio. Everything will be recorded and shared in our social media and blog. You will be joining us on a visual ride seeing everything from the places we are going to visit, meeting new friends and clients on the road and all the adventures we get ourselves into. We will also share problems we find, how we solve them, how we speak with the clients, how/where we work and much more.



We spent the last year saving money for this project and now we are risking it all to set it into motion. 
With your support, we can make For Design a reality. Your contributions will help us expand our route and to give this opportunity to more people.


Every bit will help us make this dream a reality!!
If you can't support us with money, don't worry! You can always share our campaign and links. We appreciate your love and support for this project more than you could know!

In doing research, I discovered that a large amount of women aren't aware that they should be cleaning their makeup brushes often to rid them of bacteria and old make up. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Kim Blackmon and I am a Air Force Veteran, Entrepreneurship Student at University of Tampa, Make Up Artist, Cosmetic Retailer, Business Owner, and now Inventor in Tampa, FL. </span></p>
<p>I came up with the idea for Brush EZ while in a Entrepreneurship feasibility class last summer. I was daydreaming in class trying to figure out when i would have time to clean all my brushes from the beauty expo the weekend prior. I searched online and found nothing to clean and dry my brushes. In class we tackled it as a class project and from there I competed in pitch competitions, developed a business plan, and now Brush EZ ready for prototyping! </p>
<p>So far I have raised &amp; won over $3K from friends and family. Those funds were used to file my LLC, Marketing Materials, Logos, 3D Replica, Legal Documents, Web Domain, and Website Development. </p>
<p>I envision women fully washing 8-10 of their brushes in 5 minutes and drying them in under 3 hours with out lifting a finger! Please Fund the Vision! </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your donations will help with getting the provisional patent filed, trademark the name, produce the Brush EaZe Clean Solution (developed by Nardo's Naturals), and get the prototype completed. About $10K is needed to get these essential items covered so I can start taking orders.</p>
<p>Whats in it for you? The ability to jumpstart a start up! This will make my dreams come true. As a student veteran it has been a long and hard road to find a new purpose as well as juggle life and school. I have been in a race to market since Sept 2015 but set backs with a manufacturer have delayed me getting the prototype sooner. Early backers will get an exclusive discount when Brush EZ is available. </p>

</div><p>Sacred Medicine is designed by Shaman Oriah Mirza, who with her husband Riz has spent the last ten years helping countless people find personal freedom, endless love, and self mastery. Their visits to many countries around the world impacted her and has inspired her to create original and authentic boho chic shamanic art you can wear.</p><p>Sacred Medicine is a new brand for the Boho chic lifestylers. Designer Oriah Mirza started Oct 2018 to blend and showcase the power of art, healing sacred medicine, adventure and travel into a physical warm hug you can wear. Sounds too bohemian? Not according to fast growing new clients of Sacred Medicine. The feel the difference. ‘It’s like getting hugged’, they have said. ‘I feel like a super-hero’ even Gary Clark Jr wore a custom design jacket for a full concert in Hollywood, CA Nov 2018 and said he loved it. What makes her jackets so special?</p><p>The designer Oriah Mirza, is a shaman and life coach and has been actively operating a healing center out of their Malibu canyon Red Eagle Ranch for the last 10 consecutive years, helping countless people heal from trauma, addiction, loss, mental illness and more. “People who are on the edge of losing it all, their minds, their families, their life...come to us as a last resort and it works’, said Oriah, mother of five children. Her husband psychic Medium Riz Mirza has been hosting weekly trance channeling gatherings out of their historic home, but also internationally. <i>“Our years of traveling to events and hosting healing retreats around the world two to four times a year, and sometimes more, has given me an invaluable access to touch people's lives around the world in ways I never thought possible. I have taken away with me a deep soul connection to humanity that is worth every second of intensive work I have done with my husband to help people regain their peace and self love.”</i></p><p> </p><p>Looking for a way to connect to people other than verbally and in the healing aspects she has done, Oriah wanted something more tangible to touch the hearts of people through feeling good about what they wear.</p><p><i>“It is like I send a piece of me with them when they leave with my jacket, it makes me very happy. I never considered myself a designer before, I am a storyteller, and these jackets evoke a sense of socialization, when you are out people just innately want to stop you and ask about your jacket and where you got it from.”</i></p><p>The painstaking detail is partially hand stitched with sturdy fibers and the use of exotic materials is hand selected from around the world, each one telling a story. Some materials are faux and some are not.<i> “I believe we all came to the planet to experience being together and experiencing life together, there is always evolution happening. But I choose to use all the fibers and materials of the world that are within reason of being humanely collected and manufactured and developed with the highest standards.”</i></p><p> </p><center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_595/v1549666997/bccsgcke7ykzf6aiphuk.jpg"" src=""""/></center><p> </p><p>Oriah Mirza, a decades long acrylic painter and now an emerging designer found a way to ‘paint with fabric’. <i>“I have endless designs that come to me, many futuristic, that are coming in the collections to come. I wanted to start out with the most bohemian and elegant collection because this is where my heart is now, but I cannot wait for what is to come.”</i> She has plans to bring futuristic AI designs married with the earthy bohemian lust for life. <i>“It can be done, because that is where we are going as a society. I believe clothing is a way to speak back to society about where we are.”</i></p><p><i>“I love life, and every aspect about it. I have a huge story, my life being a survivor of domestic violence, and all that trauma brings with it for decades”.</i> She found healing through the work she has been doing. <i>“As soon as I started to feel better, I started helping anyone I could, especially my own children. I didn't need a certification to share my love, I just started talking about how I transcended violence.""</i> Her oldest son is a NASA origami engineer, her late grandfather, an inventor. Her oldest daughter was inspired to open her own line too and her other children are full of expression.  She says, “If you are not expressing, then what are you doing?”</p><p> </p><center><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_395/v1549667966/kmyakjh8fi4a73hslh2m.jpg"" src=""""/></center><p> </p><p>Her work and personal journey has inspired many thousands and her many-years-in-development new Sacred Medicine fashion line is the wave of the future. <i>“It is what Alexander McQueen accomplished, and I know it may sound cliche to bring him up right now, but he is one of my biggest inspirations. Just tell the story, no matter what. That is my motto.” </i>These wonderfully and carefully constructed ‘story-telling’ jackets are a new wave of conscious clothing.</p><p><strong><i>“Connecting with people has always been my goal and my mission on this planet. Finding a way to help them see their worth, bringing a Shamanistic approach to your day through what you wear that attracts attention and helps bridge the isolation gap, helps people converse with each other, which feels good to both parties.”</i></strong></p><p>Who would have ever thought a garment can feel so good? “This is the new way” Oriah says, “it is limitless freedom of creativity and expression through communication in high end, street-wear garments.”</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549730948/s8aguiiozbju0mkgnrry.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549730910/km84m9hgv8xohvu8t6ja.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_395/v1549823784/o3bgz0qwynq5jcaipmvw.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>(To learn about about the Global Outreach, scroll to the bottom.)</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why you may want to invest</strong></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>1</strong></p><p>PROVEN SALES: Since Oct 2018 with a soft launch and only word-of-mouth, Sacred Medicine has reached 5k in sales since it's inception Oct 2018, three months by word of mouth and hand delivered after weeks of creating each piece herself.</p><p>PROVEN PROFITABILITY: Net income positive 3 consecutive months since launch in Oct 2018.</p><p>MARKET ADVANTAGE: Ashley Knierim wrote 01/03/19 in TheSpruce.com, ‘Boho Is Back...in 2019 we expect it to come back with a bang.

This includes and is not limited to: material costs for prototypes, patternmaking costs, shipping and taxes of materials. Stage two will be calculated to include all costs needed after orders are made. These costs will be much higher as we will be now going into full production.</p><p>We are currently seeking additional funding from outside angel investors and business loans. Start-up funds will be used for manufacturing the line, materials to create the line, creating prototypes of the next season and operating expenses such as rent, utilities and payroll. Further, our initial investment will also be used to purchase equipment and inventory software – all of which will produce future benefits for the company.

</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">Excerpts from David Bloom Contributor , Forbes 2019</p><p>As brands and agencies become more at ease with influencer marketing, they’re getting more sophisticated at integrating influencers into their broader digital campaigns, said Steve Ellis, CEO of WhoSay.com that Viacom bought a year ago.</p><p>Going Nano</p><p>No 2018 trend got more attention than the rise of the micro influencer and then, the nano influencer, very roughly defined as someone with a few thousand followers in a well-defined sector. Fees are less, the talent more pliable, and if one of them does something stupid, it won’t metastasize into a brand-damaging P.R. debacle.</p><p>“Now there's an opportunity to build an influencer network across thousands,” said Neil Patil, Chief Commercial Officer for Tubular Labs, which tracks 5 billion videos and 13 million creators on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. ”In the next few years, our predictions are that that's really where the new war is, in the culmination of these influencer networks.”</p><p>Going Long</p><p>As companies and agencies become more adept at influencer marketing, they've also begun  looking for longer-term relationships. Many influencers want that too, if it fits their own personal brand and the audience they've built over years.</p><p>""This way, influencers can convey a consistent message and grow their audience with the brand as opposed to one-off sponsorships,"" said Michelle Merino, a Los Angeles influencer-marketing consultant. ""Lately, I've experienced an increase in brand requests for influencers to co-brand new product lines or introduce new brands altogether by being the face of the company.""</p><p>""Because it's first party, you know the idea of true reach or true engagement rate has really become more accessible to brands and brand marketers,"" said CreatorIQ’s Nate Harris. ""That is finally putting influencer marketing at parity with other digital marketing channels that have been measurable to their true merits from the very beginning.""</p><p>Brands also are relying far less on pure reach as a metric. It's essentially a leftover of TV’s CPM measurement, counting total possible viewers who might have seen a post. More brands and agencies now know to rely on more sophisticated metrics, such as cost-per-engagement, that can be tied more directly to their return on investment.  </p><p><i>MORE</i></p><p><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomward/2018/12/18/the-influencer-marketing-trends-that-will-explode-in-2019/#3b490ef12786"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Forbes The Influencer Marketing Trends That Will Explode In 2019</a></p><p>Business2community.com <a href=""https://www.business2community.com/marketing/why-2019-will-be-the-year-of-influencer-marketing-02158649"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Why 2019 Will Be the Year of Influencer Marketing</a></p><p><strong>We will hire an Influencer Marketing Agency</strong></p><p><a href=""https://influencermarketinghub.com/25-influencer-marketing-agencies/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">25 Leading Influencer Marketing Agencies</a></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">PROBLEMS &amp; SOLUTIONS</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p>THE PROBLEM</p><p>The World Economic Forum <a href=""http://www.weforum.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.weforum.org</a></p><p>Why 2018 must be the year for women to thrive. The economic facts speak for themselves: raising women’s labour force participation to that of men can boost GDP, for example, by as much as 9% in Japan and 27% in India. IMF research has uncovered myriad of macroeconomic benefits, one of which: and tackling gender inequality can reduce income inequality, which, in turn, can drive more sustainable growth. Some of the barriers holding women back are universal, too. Astonishingly, almost 90% of countries have one or more gender-based legal restrictions. In some countries, for example, women have limited property rights, while in others, husbands have the right to prevent their wives from working. Women in countries in fragile situations are at particular risk of discrimination and exclusion. Besides legal obstacles, there are barriers related to combining work and family life, education, access to finance, and pressures from society.</p><p>By empower female owned business, in turn we can help other women entrepreneurs in developing their potential in the marketplace.</p><p>THE SOLUTION</p><p>Facts and Figures: Women's Economic Empowerment</p><p>Women’s economic empowerment is central to realizing women’s rights and gender equality. Women’s economic empowerment includes women’s ability to participate equally in existing markets; their access to and control over productive resources, access to decent work, control over their own time, lives and bodies; and increased voice, agency and meaningful participation in economic decision-making at all levels from the household to international institutions.</p><p>Empowering women in the economy and closing gender gaps in the world of work are key to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 5, to achieve gender equality, and Goal 8, to promote full and productive employment and decent work for all; also Goal 1 on ending poverty, Goal 2 on food security, Goal 3 on ensuring health and Goal 10 on reducing inequalities.</p><p>When more women work, economies grow. Women’s economic empowerment boosts productivity, increases economic diversification and income equality in addition to other positive development outcomes. For example, increasing the female employment rates in OECD countries to match that of Sweden, could boost GDP by over USD 6 trillion, recognizing, however, that. growth does not automatically lead to a reduction in gender-based inequality. Conversely, it is estimated that gender gaps cost the economy some 15 percent of GDP.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Women empowering Women, When Women Rise, Families Thrive.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549670400/wrun9cngdcbjqll1idwd.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p><strong>BRAND IDENTITY</strong></p><p>With the help of your investment, Sacred Medicine can launch a full PR campaign and in turn bring much needed attention to the world crisis of the Women’s Empowerment Movement. Not only will you be helping Sacred Medicine reach all of their economic goals, you will be apart of a powerful movement in the fashion industry. News outlets, advertisements, partnerships, and retail placement will give a big boost to the equity and sustainability of their brand.</p><p><strong>Product Standard</strong></p><p>Indie Source has utilize in stock options for the fastest delivery from their network of over 50+ domestic mills, converters and importers. Working in Los Angeles avoids overseas delays. Indie Source is committed to complete transparency and integrity throughout their process, pricing and treatment of people. They have worked with over 250+ brands. They made over 415,499 ethically made units. 99.98% Successful delivery rate.</p><p>ACCREDITED CINTAS SOCIAL COMPLIANCE</p><p>As outlined in the Cintas Corporation’s Code of Conduct, the code requires vendors to comply to standards outlined in the code: 1.General Ethical Standards 2.Customs Compliance 3.Drug Interdiction 4.Wages and Hours 5.Child Labor 6.Prison/Forced Labor 7.Discrimination 8.Health and Safety 9.Working Conditions 10.Right to Organize and Workplace Freedom 11.Subcontractors.</p><p>To achieve their vision, the Company is committed to providing the best in class customer service in addition to working with only the most detail oriented local manufacturers and promoting eco-friendly fashion to the mainstream.</p><p><strong>Current Company Status</strong></p><p>Sacred Medicine was incorporated in June, 2018 under Red Eagle Universal, and will be moving to its own LLC status within 2 months of Feb 2019. It will be operating as a Member-Manager status in Oriah’s legal name, Barbara Miller. All company shares are held by the founder. Since sourcing, manufacturing, and selling out of Oriah’s bedroom to friends and family at first, and then to a studio in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, Fashion District, her goal is to sell through local and regional boutiques, and eventually international retailers. The Company has grown to have it’s own online store, relationships with suppliers and manufacturers such as Indie Source in it’s short duration it has existed. With the manufacturer being located in Los Angeles, the sourcing is local and also indigenous countries are responsible for the embroidery and trim.</p><p><strong>Operational Procedures</strong></p><p>At the point that Sacred Medicine requires other employees to work in-house, a separate live or work space might be necessary. Presently, Sacred Medicine does not have a bricks-and-mortar retail location. All prototype construction and manufacturing will be done off-site at a seamstress’ shop and at the chosen manufacturing facility. Marketing can be done in-house or at marketing consultant office space.</p><p>In the next three years of projected operation, the company will be producing in the USA and outsource manufacturing to dedicated service providers. Oriah Mirza will do the designing work herself and through her well-connected business relationships, she will be able to take care of many of the firm’s vital functions of marketing, such as public relations, marketing and other communications-related activities.</p><p>The company will set up a professional supply chain management to be able to cut costs and deliver flexibly and punctually at the same time. Supply chain management is of prime importance for young fashion and design firms. Good supply chain management entails close communication with suppliers, warehouses, logistics firms and the client, Indie Source and Oriah Mirza herself will be supplying this. Diligent research and comparison of shipment options and building relationships with key personnel within logistics providers’ facilities will help Sacred Medicine stay on top of its supply chain management. Due to the small-scale nature in the beginning of the business it will be relatively easy to coordinate the inflow of fabric and outflow of product. Ground transportation with UPS will be utilized in most cases. In the case that international shipments are needed, air transportation will also be an element of the logistics organization of Sacred Medicine. No products will be shipped on consignment basis, consignment will be avoided altogether, due to the risky nature of working on consignment. Sacred Medicine will have a dedicated sales representative who will search out potential buyers.</p><p>The company will secure showrooms in Los Angeles, New York City, London and Japan. Purchasing from Sacred Medicine, buyers receive product displays and promotional materials with purchase. Additionally, Sacred Medicine will work closely with regional sales representative and also of motorcycle apparel manufacturers and buyers. Oriah Mirza will also attend relevant pre-season fashion trade shows and have all the necessary equipment at her disposal.</p><p><strong>Unique Selling Propositions</strong></p><p>The company will have a set of unique features, which will differentiate it from competition. The most important unique selling proposition of Sacred Medicine is to be found in the capabilities of the founder herself. The owner of Sacred Medicine, Oriah Mirza, being very experienced in graphic design and project management and maintaining impeccable contacts in the marketing and fashion industry, will invest all of her personal time and expertise into the startup. The fashion and retail industry tends to be overly youth and small size focused. In addition, many female motorcycle riders are forced to wear men’s clothing which denies their femininity and makes them wardrobe-wary when riding out for a social occasion. However, by closely following high fashion trends as well as customers’ purchasing preferences, Sacred Medicine will tailor styles to meet the specific needs of the clientele.</p><p> </p><p>The key feature of Sacred Medicine is its commitment to providing women with unique quality, stylish clothing options. Because the primary concern is ensuring that consumers are happy with the fit and style of their purchase, Sacred Medicine will have a strong impact on the Boho Chic fashion and All Gender motorcyclist communities and earn strong word-of-mouth endorsements from happy clients.</p><p>When it comes to the material of their clothes, nearly 72  percent of survey respondents say that natural fibers are better for the environment than synthetics, with 51 percent of consumers willing to pay more for them. Such trends are driving global brands like Gucci, Timberland, and others to focus on making their products and supply chain more environmentally friendly.</p><p><strong>Location of Headquarters</strong></p><p>The business is being founded in Downtown Los Angeles, the Fashion Headquarters and District which has a long tradition of being a hub for fashion design and up-and-coming innovative business model. Although it is an expensive headquarters location both in daily operation costs and initial start-up costs, the unique advantages that the location offers outweigh the disadvantage of these elevated costs.</p><p>Very good infrastructure, numerous potential business partners, ease of travel in and out of the city, high-quality materials available, a variety of relevant industry events and an ample supply of highly qualified labor were all factors which persuaded the choice towards Downtown Los Angeles. Also the founder is personally bonded to the area as she is a native Los Angeles and has been living in Southern California her whole life.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549670724/ceemwkewfwo0ullhwk7g.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Sacred Medicine’s Objectives</strong></p><p>The Company is currently selling garments online through its Shopify e-commerce store shipping primarily within Southern California with market penetration in Los Angeles,  southern California regions and New York. The company is laser-focused on growing its sales and operations as broken down in the two phases listed below:</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_995/v1549998280/axo7aasstvd9so8f4pyl.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Phase I (Next 6 Months)</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Increase online sales by 20 percent by end of year through influencer and social media marketing tactics</li>
<li>Pay $11,040.00 to Indie Source, for only one base jacket design, and 3 unique designs. There are total 24 designs in the Spring 2019 collection. Total will be $88,000 if I put 24 designs into production. Instead, I will launch 6 unique designs with two jacket styles, for a total of $22,080 to begin production for retail stores and online inventory.</li>
<li>Continue providing exceptional on-location editorial photoshoots for new and emerging collections with highly sought after models and photographers matching the bohemian theme and any futuristic aesthetic</li>
<li>Partner with 3 additional local high-end fashion boutiques with shared values as distribution channels</li>
<li>Increase online social presence on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest by 30 percent</li>
<li>Right from the start, it is planned to develop and make expert use of an online presence. This is a very important part of the business undertaking, as the web presence will enable Sacred Medicine to showcase its products, establish the brand and raise awareness in the industry. It is likewise thinkable that the first customers of Sacred Medicine will actually buy the product from an integrated webshop. From these early revenues the company will be able to generate a higher cash flow, benefiting from ways to make itself depend less solely on high volume contracts with the retailers and wholesale clients.</li>
<li>Continue designing more fashionable certified armor motorcycle jackets designed by local motorcycle manufacturing company with the highest quality leather cut and rip-proof and can last for decades men's and women's jackets.  The “Boho Motorcycle Chic” line is supposed to fill a niche in the motorcycle apparel market, which makes the emphasis on fashion also a part of the company’s USP in contrast to the usual sports racing/Americana look that is traditionally produced by competitors. They will continue to be crafted in styles that appeal to motorcycle-enthusiastic women and will combine functionality and robustness with clean, aesthetic design. Since Sacred Medicine creates clothing that people can wear on and off the bike, the clothes have removable and/or very flexible padding. When designing the clothing, Oriah Mirza focuses on designs that are able to unify function and beauty. All Jackets and any gear that is meant to protect from abrasion and impact while riding a motorcycle are tested and CE certified, with removable CE EN1621-1 approved back, shoulder, and elbow armour.</li>
<li>The goal is to create pieces that are exactly what an urban, individualistic woman is looking for, something that she would wear even if she is not going to ride a motorcycle. Therefore the clothing has to be serving two needs at the same time, just like for example Nautica that caters to the needs of marine sports enthusiasts but has developed such a cult that its clothing is worn in daily life (also Surface to Air produces beautifully crafted riding jacket that might serve as an inspiration for : <a href=""http://www.surfacetoair.com/store-us/?pg=style&amp;collection_id=52&amp;style_id=58"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.surfacetoair.com/store-us/?pg=style&amp;amp;col...</a>).</li>
<li>Sacred Medicine will give special attention to the styles, colors and fits to flatter all sizes. The niche specialty will be fitting gender neutral, men and women sizes 6-14, although some clothing will range in sizes 0-14.</li>
<li>Sacred Medicine will have a dedicated sales representative who will search out potential buyers.</li>
<li>To control costs, track inventory and manage stock levels at the later stages of business operation, an inventory control system will be set in place. This will include the standard bar code with its related equipment and software. Eventually, staff will conduct annual inventory audits and hire outside auditors when necessary. All accounting and finances will be maintained using in state-of-the-art software.</li>
<li>The goal is to implement a superior customer service system. The well-trained personnel will provide an edge in the competition and the brand will quickly become acknowledged broadly. Protecting the brand and its good reputation will become a key part of the strategy to ensure that the unique selling propositions that come along with a recognized brand name are maintained as long as possible.</li>
<li>A strong return policy will be put in place.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Projection</strong></p><p>In the long run, the potential for regional and/or national expansion will be explored further. Some concrete goals, which must be attained before an expansion can be considered, are to penetrate and raise awareness in 30% of the targeted consumer market, build a customer base and mailing list and become a profitable business with expansion potential within a maximum of three years.</p><p>The first major milestones will be securing funds and setting up the business. This is the main focus right now. In five years, Sacred Medicine will have established itself within the community and within the industry and set up overseas sourcing and manufacturing operations (most likely in US, China or Vietnam). It will become the leading brand in contemporary Boho Chic apparel. In addition, the Motorcycle Chic line will be the the perfect blend between cutting edge, high-tech protective wear and femininity and gender neutral designs. Sacred Medicine will make an impact globally through initiatives built into the company structure, supporting employees and communities around the world.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Consulting</strong>:Sacred Medicine will employ the services of the various consulting firms and freelancers in its first few years of business. The services that Sacred Medicine will employ are to aid the founder to acquire important know how and business acumen to help her achieve the ambitious goals she set for the company.</li>
<li>Sacred Medicine will hire a marketing PR company that will help manage the setting up of the brand, including a great variety of services such as logo design, clothing label design, brand book, web design, market intelligence gathering, marketing testing and copy-writing among others.</li>
<li>
<strong>Price Strategy: </strong>Sacred Medicine will set prices that will underscore the high quality of the products. With very high design and production costs, the price must be set to ensure that the break even can be reached in a reasonable time. Therefore Sacred Medicine will also use its price strategy to stay true to its target group focus, which is primly made up of educated women of the upper two quartiles on the income scale.</li>
<li>The following positions will be contracted out: Marketing Director and Design and Branding Director, there are several positions that are yet to be filled. However, Los Angeles has enough budding designers and hungry job applicants that finding qualified employees will not be an issue. Our administrative assistant and manager will be paid an hourly wage, plus commission. Bonuses will be provided with each year of service following an annual review to encourage employee retention.</li>
</ul><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Phase II (Next 12 Months)</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Explore possibility of brick-and-mortar operations through testing pop-up stores in Los Angeles counties and Southern California regions.</li>
<li>Either take profits made, or run another crowd funding campaign to raise $55,000 just to finish production of the remaining designs not produced in Phase 1. That does not include all the other costs.</li>
<li>Create strategic partnerships with local fashion boutiques in LA and New York for distribution in the area</li>
<li>Scope out local manufacturers in Los Angeles area for quality production with aim of opening operations for denim jackets as the next product line and increased delivery within region</li>
<li>Establish partnerships with non profit organizations that Oriah Mirza feels a connection to regarding Human Rights, equality and Sex Trafficking.</li>
</ul><p><strong>FINANCIAL PLAN</strong></p><p>Our company will earn revenue from our customers’ purchases of our products if funded with $80,000 in this crowdsource funding. If only 100 units are sold in retail stores in 2019, per design, with the current collection and price points that will be 2400 units totaling gross revenue of $2,760,000. Sacred Medicine’s first-year income is estimated to be a profit margin of 90%, and an estimated net income of: $2,484,000 before taxes.  Our company will generate revenue from the sale of clothing and other merchandise to retail stores. We will achieve month-to-month profitability within the first year.</p><p><strong>Communication &amp; Marketing Strategy</strong></p><p>Oriah Mirza has a strong sales and marketing background and recognizes the significance of effective marketing. Additionally, she will take the services of a branding and marketing consulting firm for the initial setting up of her branding (logo, corporate colors, brand book, etc.). She will seek to implement a variety of marketing measures including PR-Strategy and of course also all the conventional methods such as print-ads, trade shows and researching and contacting potential clients. In order to not overstretch the tight resources available during the initial start-up phase, the marketing budget for ongoing expenses is to be kept to no more than 5% of gross annual sales.</p><p>The marketing message, logo and slogans will revolve around the idea of All Genders can enjoy Boho Chic and Boho Gypsy attire. All Genders can have artistic and Boho Chic women motorcycle attire and be riders of beautiful trendsetters motorcycle jackets. Shamanic and Conscious artistic/musical adventure seekers and All Gender ground-breakers are the target market audience. Sacred Medicine initial marketing efforts will remain local until a presence in the International Boho Chic community is established. These initial efforts will rely heavily on local print and broadcast social media coverage, traditional advertising, signage, a direct mail marketing campaign and networking. A significant portion of the advertising budget will be allocated to print and social and broadcast media.</p><p>A very important focus is placed on Sacred Medicine’s consistent presence at trade shows, industry networking events and fairs for fashion designers. The US hosts more fashion events than any other country in the world. The industry is well supported by private financiers that promote emerging designers and host regional fashion shows. However, unlike other developed countries, most of the large fashion events in the US were only launched in the last few years, the surge is extraordinary. In 2008, the US hosted at least 44 large-scale fashion events versus only 11 events in 2004. France and Italy for example had fewer events (2 and 4 respectively in both 2004 and 2008). The sponsors/financiers in the fashion industry act as key drivers by promoting designers and regional fashion events. Therefore it will be very important for Sacred Medicine to be present at all these events and continually build a network in the industry.</p><p>Marketing opportunities will be continually utilized as Sacred Medicine expands its business and customer numbers grow. Measures such as bonuses for recommendations will increase sales as the effects of word of mouth propaganda become more apparent. To this end the website of sacred Medicine will serve the multitude of different purposes. The domain names <a href=""http://sacredmedicinewear.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sacredmedicinewear.com</a> has been reserved and more site development will begin as funds become available.</p><p>Foremost, the website is to showcase the brand Sacred Medicine and it’s collections and provide customers with the ability to purchase items online (and retailers to order sample products). As the site progresses, features such as fashion advice, a blog, designer interviews, newsletters, and Internet-only specials will become available. Eventually, the internet activities will establish and nurture an online social community where Boho Chic and motorcycle chic -enthusiastic All Gender clientele can gather and discuss topics of the day, network and share experiences.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549672248/mufjzm80yecwxnwpunoa.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Future Fashion Industry Forecast</strong></p><p>E-Commerce will make up 17% of all US retail sales by 2022 – and one company is the main reason</p><p>Forrester Research Inc predicts that online sales will account for 17% of all US retail sales by 2022, up from a projected 12.7% in 2017, according to Forrester's new Online Retail Forecast as cited by Digital Commerce 360. The report also expects US online sales to grow 13% YoY in 2017, which is five times faster than projected offline sales growth, and in line with the National Retail Federation's estimates.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Amazon is expected to be a major driver of this online sales growth. The report states that 83% of US online adults bought something on Amazon in 2016, and 55% of them used Amazon as a research tool before making a purchase.</p><p><strong>Competition</strong></p><p>Competition in the fashion industry is always a big factor. Even though Sacred Medicine is operating in a growing in popularity niche, there will be still a wide array of competitors, whose business operations partially overlap the business model of Sacred Medicine. To each brand of competitor Sacred Medicine will have the right answer to differentiate itself and perform well even in a very competitive business environment.</p><p>Sacred Medicine will differentiate itself with the more exclusive and limited collection of Boho Chic and artistic wear clothes. In addition, will offer a very feminine, elegant and sexy Boho Chic Motorcycle Chic style which sets it apart from overall brand image of companies like Harley-Davidson, Triumph, River Road or Vanson Leathers. Small stores can often compete very effectively with large ones by targeting their products at different customers, even though they have less infrastructure at their disposal and can often not undercut big competitors price-wise.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_395/v1549672339/zbf8izsdfu1oondfjnho.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Target Group</p><p>Sacred Medicine is a business-to-consumer retail company. All Gender Boho Chic, world adventure seekers, travelers, social media influencers, festival goers, and spiritual/ shamanic believers, artists and musicians and alternative emerging new designer couture customers are the target audience. All Gender motorcycle riders ages 25-55 are also the target customers. The target customers are trailblazers and trendsetters. They value uniqueness, convenience, service and quality.</p><p>To reach the target group, Sacred Medicine will target the retailing chains, where the target customer usually buys. Originally it was thought to sell to high-end retailers such as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, etc., at first that have a celebrity and wealthy clientele. After considering the target customer properties and price point of Sacred Medicine products, Oriah Mirza considers entering into high end boutique retail. After it is established among the Boho Chic community, the brand shall have a cult following beyond Boho Chic enthusiasts.</p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1549673044/ffoksey9gqvbpcg0m4cv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Risk Analysis</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>1</strong></p><ul>
<li>Our small team is diligent and thorough, and with our Indie GoGo investment, will hire a management team to run our financials, orders and fulfillment. In conjunction with working closely with our manufacturer Indie Source, we will advance quickly. The rearrangement of team members or loss of services of the members of management may have an adverse effect on Sacred Medicine. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining other personnel that will help us grow successfully.</li>
<li>As a young startup in the highly competitive fashion industry and dealing with very high product development, manufacturing and logistics costs, Sacred Medicine is confronted with a large quantity of relevant risks. By starting out with a Boho Chic Spring and Summer collection the startup-costs and risks are reduced. There will be more time to forge business relationships and Indie Source and Oriah Mirza will be able to identify the best-priced raw material suppliers, pattern-makers and other partners involved in the realization of the business goal.</li>
<li>There are certain risks that the company will not be able to influence, such as market risk. These systemic risks, which also include political and currency exchange risks (these will become relevant as soon a overseas suppliers or customers become involved), cannot be avoided by anyone in the industry. A farsighted and liquidity-conscious management should be able to maintain a reasonable degree of financial flexibility to deal with any negative impacts from the overall economy. The impact of currency exchange risks is considered to be quite low in the first few years of operation as it is not planned to generate substantial revenue through overseas sales. Likewise on the buying side the currency exchange risks are not deemed overly significant, even though it is considered to import certain amounts of fabric from China and/or Europe and conduct overseas manufacturing at later stages.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>2</strong></p><p>Sacred Medicine may never receive a future equity financing or elect to convert the Securities upon such future financing. In addition, Sacred Medicine may never undergo a liquidity event such as a sale of the Company or an IPO. If neither the conversion of the Securities nor a liquidity event occurs, the Purchasers could be left holding the Securities in perpetuity. The Securities have numerous transfer restrictions and will likely be highly liquid, with no secondary market on which to sell them. The Securities are not equity interests, have no ownership rights, have no rights to the Company’s assets or profits and have no voting rights or ability to direct the Company or its actions.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>3</strong></p><p>We cannot assure investors that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. We can provide no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not provide products or services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving industry or market trends. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>4</strong></p><p>The operational hazards that the Company will be confronting are of a very different nature. To begin with, it is very unlikely that the prototyping and manufacturing will be smooth and flawless from the very beginning. A lot of scrap will be produced until the production process is perfected, which will lead to high production costs. Other unforeseen costs are going to be incurred at least in the first two years of operation. Even though by the selection of experienced and well-reputed partners some uncertainty might be eliminated, it would be too optimistic to assume that everything will work right from the beginning.</p><p>With the wrong partners in overseas manufacturing there is a very high risk of designs being knocked off and copied, which reduces the value of the brand and can in some cases even hurt sales. These risks of theft of intellectual property can be minimized by the generous use of contracts and NDAs, the diligent management of critical data, choosing partners with great care and using certain copyright best practices such as Pauper’s copyright on top of getting each season’s designs protected by the US copyright office.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>5</strong></p><p>Our growth depends on our ability to retain and attract new customers. If we do not continue to do this, our business may not succeed.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>6</strong></p><p>We rely on third parties to supply the garments. If any of these partnerships end, this may be a concern to investors. It is also advised that the high risk of damage to products during the warehousing or transport as well as all other material risks (damage, theft, etc.) concerning the office infrastructure and health risks of the founder and eventually the staff team should be covered to maximum extent by adequate insurance. Especially with a very tight cash base, the impact of any mishap in the warehouse can be devastating and lead to the ruin of the company, so maximum insurance coverage will be purchased.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>6</strong></p><p>Our LLC, Red Eagle Universal LLC has not authorized any Units yet. Investors investing in this SAFE agreement, are investing with an understanding that Preferred Units have not yet been authorized.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Business Organization</strong></p><p>LEGAL ENTITY &amp; OWNERSHIP</p><p>Sacred Medicine will be a Limited Liability Corporation as of May 2019, and formally organized in Sacred Medicine Los Angeles, CA.

All Jackets and any gear that is meant to protect from abrasion and impact while riding a motorcycle will be tested and CE certified.</p><p> </p><p><strong>EXIT STRATEGY</strong></p><p>Oriah Mirza intends to launch and grow Sacred Medicine for many years into the future. In the event that investors require repayment of their initial investments, plus a large return on their investments, we will seek a partner to buyout the investors’ shares. Another alternative is a management buyout, which will be agreed upon in advance.</p><p>In the long term, Sacred Medicine, as a profitable business, will become an appealing acquisition for large retail chains. Investors usually wait until a company goes public or is acquired. If you invest through a Indie GoGo, you may also hold interests in the fund for a very long time, but Indie GoGo will decide how and when to sell the stock, then distribute any proceeds to the investors in the fund.</p><p><strong>Equity.</strong> Investors buy shares or units in the company in exchange for ownership.

</div><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p></div>","Sacred Medicine is designed by Shaman Oriah Mirza, who with her husband Riz has spent the last ten years helping countless people find personal freedom, endless love, and self mastery. Their visits to many countries around the world impacted her and has inspired her to create original and authentic boho chic shamanic art you can wear.Sacred Medicine is a new brand for the Boho chic lifestylers. Designer Oriah Mirza started Oct 2018 to blend and showcase the power of art, healing sacred medicine, adventure and travel into a physical warm hug you can wear. Sounds too bohemian? Not according to fast growing new clients of Sacred Medicine. The feel the difference. ‘It’s like getting hugged’, they have said. ‘I feel like a super-hero’ even Gary Clark Jr wore a custom design jacket for a full concert in Hollywood, CA Nov 2018 and said he loved it. What makes her jackets so special?The designer Oriah Mirza, is a shaman and life coach and has been actively operating a healing center out of their Malibu canyon Red Eagle Ranch for the last 10 consecutive years, helping countless people heal from trauma, addiction, loss, mental illness and more. “People who are on the edge of losing it all, their minds, their families, their life...come to us as a last resort and it works’, said Oriah, mother of five children. Her husband psychic Medium Riz Mirza has been hosting weekly trance channeling gatherings out of their historic home, but also internationally. “Our years of traveling to events and hosting healing retreats around the world two to four times a year, and sometimes more, has given me an invaluable access to touch people's lives around the world in ways I never thought possible. I have taken away with me a deep soul connection to humanity that is worth every second of intensive work I have done with my husband to help people regain their peace and self love.” Looking for a way to connect to people other than verbally and in the healing aspects she has done, Oriah wanted something more tangible to touch the hearts of people through feeling good about what they wear.“It is like I send a piece of me with them when they leave with my jacket, it makes me very happy. I never considered myself a designer before, I am a storyteller, and these jackets evoke a sense of socialization, when you are out people just innately want to stop you and ask about your jacket and where you got it from.”The painstaking detail is partially hand stitched with sturdy fibers and the use of exotic materials is hand selected from around the world, each one telling a story. Some materials are faux and some are not. “I believe we all came to the planet to experience being together and experiencing life together, there is always evolution happening. But I choose to use all the fibers and materials of the world that are within reason of being humanely collected and manufactured and developed with the highest standards.”  Oriah Mirza, a decades long acrylic painter and now an emerging designer found a way to ‘paint with fabric’. “I have endless designs that come to me, many futuristic, that are coming in the collections to come. I wanted to start out with the most bohemian and elegant collection because this is where my heart is now, but I cannot wait for what is to come.” She has plans to bring futuristic AI designs married with the earthy bohemian lust for life. “It can be done, because that is where we are going as a society. I believe clothing is a way to speak back to society about where we are.”“I love life, and every aspect about it. I have a huge story, my life being a survivor of domestic violence, and all that trauma brings with it for decades”. She found healing through the work she has been doing. “As soon as I started to feel better, I started helping anyone I could, especially my own children. I didn't need a certification to share my love, I just started talking about how I transcended violence."" Her oldest son is a NASA origami engineer, her late grandfather, an inventor. Her oldest daughter was inspired to open her own line too and her other children are full of expression.  She says, “If you are not expressing, then what are you doing?”  Her work and personal journey has inspired many thousands and her many-years-in-development new Sacred Medicine fashion line is the wave of the future. “It is what Alexander McQueen accomplished, and I know it may sound cliche to bring him up right now, but he is one of my biggest inspirations. Just tell the story, no matter what. That is my motto.” These wonderfully and carefully constructed ‘story-telling’ jackets are a new wave of conscious clothing.“Connecting with people has always been my goal and my mission on this planet. Finding a way to help them see their worth, bringing a Shamanistic approach to your day through what you wear that attracts attention and helps bridge the isolation gap, helps people converse with each other, which feels good to both parties.”Who would have ever thought a garment can feel so good? “This is the new way” Oriah says, “it is limitless freedom of creativity and expression through communication in high end, street-wear garments.” (To learn about about the Global Outreach, scroll to the bottom.)Why you may want to invest 1PROVEN SALES: Since Oct 2018 with a soft launch and only word-of-mouth, Sacred Medicine has reached 5k in sales since it's inception Oct 2018, three months by word of mouth and hand delivered after weeks of creating each piece herself.PROVEN PROFITABILITY: Net income positive 3 consecutive months since launch in Oct 2018.MARKET ADVANTAGE: Ashley Knierim wrote 01/03/19 in TheSpruce.com, ‘Boho Is Back...in 2019 we expect it to come back with a bang. Designers Caroline Grant and Dolores Suarez of Dekar Design say that ""the boho vibe is back, but with a vintage modern twist and curved lines.” There is a huge proven market for boho chic garments, but adding a twist of the conscious shamanic aspect’ is a perfect match both to be worn in lifestyle and in the festival world.FINANCIAL PLAN2SOURCES & USE OF FUNDSSacred Medicine requires a minimum of $80,00 in this campaign to launch successfully for the six months to a year.Sacred Medicine is on track for over $ 3 million in sales over the next 2 years.REQUIREMENTSSacred Medicine will need $80,000 to get our business off the ground. We are currently seeking funding from outside investors and business loans. ASSUMPTIONS3 Our projections are based on the assumption that the economy, consumer spending habits and population growth in Los Angeles, CA will continue for the foreseeable future. We must also assume that our future buyers will continue to buy inventory from us at prices that allow us to maintain our present margins. It is also important that we are able to hire reliable employees at reasonable wages.GROWTH POTENTIAL4 AUTHORITATIVE BRAND: Founders partnered with Indie Source for manufacturing and development. Indie Source founders Zack Hurley and Jesse Dombrowiak were recently named to Forbes’ “30 Under 30,” the publication’s annual list of rising stars under 30 years old in a host of industries. AUTHENTICITY: Company is aligned to build in conscious corporate transparency. OUR AMBITION5 To become a well-known global brand that provides leadership for women, participates in international non profit activity for sex trafficked human beings and help empower young people to their full potential. Healing through clothing, and communication through art in garments is the Sacred Medicine’s long term goal.Plans for expansion include setting up distribution and manufacturing relationships in Los Angeles, New York, UK, and Japan fashion centric goldmines where the company aims to gain greater market penetration.THE PLAN6Primary means of marketing will be in physical retail stores and online through analytic-driven approaches like SEO and paid search, in addition to capitalizing on social channels like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest.  User generated content and engagement will be key as product pages will include Instagram photos and promote consumer pride in our products. Funding will be sought in stages. Stage one will be calculated to include start-up costs through prototyping and gaining initial orders. This includes and is not limited to: material costs for prototypes, patternmaking costs, shipping and taxes of materials. Stage two will be calculated to include all costs needed after orders are made. These costs will be much higher as we will be now going into full production.We are currently seeking additional funding from outside angel investors and business loans. Start-up funds will be used for manufacturing the line, materials to create the line, creating prototypes of the next season and operating expenses such as rent, utilities and payroll. Further, our initial investment will also be used to purchase equipment and inventory software – all of which will produce future benefits for the company. Business plan contests, IndieGoGo are methods that will be employed to gain capital for start up. OUR STORY7Art Inspired Bohemian ClothingFrom Oriah Mirza’s international travels and life as a shaman, she has derived a unique, one of a kind jacket line that showcases the journey within.

The patterns and textures are so intricate and beautiful. Each item she has worked over carries a perfect balance to the size ,shape, and texture of the original fabric. And each piece holds such a beautiful vibration, to own one of her pieces is to magnify your light with something that matches your vibration! And if you don’t resonate with what she’s already made, she will custom design a piece intended just for you! ? Deonna B, Santa Monica, CA""Scared Medicine Wear creations are truly unique. I hired Oriah to design a custom vest for a high profile photo shoot. Her creation was not only beautiful but meaningful. It is above and beyond what I expected and something I will cherish always. I since have ordered another design and her second creation was even more special. I have photographed in her designs all over the world. I am even more privileged to collaborate with this line doing makeup artistry. Scared Medicine wear is inspiring, and stylish yet down to earth. I look forward to more.""Robyn N, 29 Palms, CA THE OPPORTUNITY THE DEMAND-WHAT THEY ARE SAYINGELLE magazine sited the trend for 2019, “Designers took an escapist turn with the season’s Neo Boho trend. The look is long, languid and sensual, saturated in warm desert and sunset hues at Chloé and Loewe or clashing carpet and tile prints, as at Paco Rabanne and Philip Lim.”Vogue said for Spring/ Summer Fashion Trends to Follow for 2019; Fashion is looking to hippy feel-good vibes this season with hallucinogenic prints.

Excerpts from David Bloom Contributor , Forbes 2019As brands and agencies become more at ease with influencer marketing, they’re getting more sophisticated at integrating influencers into their broader digital campaigns, said Steve Ellis, CEO of WhoSay.com that Viacom bought a year ago.Going NanoNo 2018 trend got more attention than the rise of the micro influencer and then, the nano influencer, very roughly defined as someone with a few thousand followers in a well-defined sector. Fees are less, the talent more pliable, and if one of them does something stupid, it won’t metastasize into a brand-damaging P.R. debacle.“Now there's an opportunity to build an influencer network across thousands,” said Neil Patil, Chief Commercial Officer for Tubular Labs, which tracks 5 billion videos and 13 million creators on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. ”In the next few years, our predictions are that that's really where the new war is, in the culmination of these influencer networks.”Going LongAs companies and agencies become more adept at influencer marketing, they've also begun  looking for longer-term relationships. Many influencers want that too, if it fits their own personal brand and the audience they've built over years.""This way, influencers can convey a consistent message and grow their audience with the brand as opposed to one-off sponsorships,"" said Michelle Merino, a Los Angeles influencer-marketing consultant. ""Lately, I've experienced an increase in brand requests for influencers to co-brand new product lines or introduce new brands altogether by being the face of the company.""""Because it's first party, you know the idea of true reach or true engagement rate has really become more accessible to brands and brand marketers,"" said CreatorIQ’s Nate Harris. ""That is finally putting influencer marketing at parity with other digital marketing channels that have been measurable to their true merits from the very beginning.""Brands also are relying far less on pure reach as a metric. It's essentially a leftover of TV’s CPM measurement, counting total possible viewers who might have seen a post. More brands and agencies now know to rely on more sophisticated metrics, such as cost-per-engagement, that can be tied more directly to their return on investment.  MOREForbes The Influencer Marketing Trends That Will Explode In 2019Business2community.com Why 2019 Will Be the Year of Influencer MarketingWe will hire an Influencer Marketing Agency25 Leading Influencer Marketing Agencies PROBLEMS & SOLUTIONS THE PROBLEMThe World Economic Forum www.weforum.orgWhy 2018 must be the year for women to thrive. The economic facts speak for themselves: raising women’s labour force participation to that of men can boost GDP, for example, by as much as 9% in Japan and 27% in India. IMF research has uncovered myriad of macroeconomic benefits, one of which: and tackling gender inequality can reduce income inequality, which, in turn, can drive more sustainable growth. Some of the barriers holding women back are universal, too. Astonishingly, almost 90% of countries have one or more gender-based legal restrictions. In some countries, for example, women have limited property rights, while in others, husbands have the right to prevent their wives from working. Women in countries in fragile situations are at particular risk of discrimination and exclusion. Besides legal obstacles, there are barriers related to combining work and family life, education, access to finance, and pressures from society.By empower female owned business, in turn we can help other women entrepreneurs in developing their potential in the marketplace.THE SOLUTIONFacts and Figures: Women's Economic EmpowermentWomen’s economic empowerment is central to realizing women’s rights and gender equality. Women’s economic empowerment includes women’s ability to participate equally in existing markets; their access to and control over productive resources, access to decent work, control over their own time, lives and bodies; and increased voice, agency and meaningful participation in economic decision-making at all levels from the household to international institutions.Empowering women in the economy and closing gender gaps in the world of work are key to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 5, to achieve gender equality, and Goal 8, to promote full and productive employment and decent work for all; also Goal 1 on ending poverty, Goal 2 on food security, Goal 3 on ensuring health and Goal 10 on reducing inequalities.When more women work, economies grow. Women’s economic empowerment boosts productivity, increases economic diversification and income equality in addition to other positive development outcomes. For example, increasing the female employment rates in OECD countries to match that of Sweden, could boost GDP by over USD 6 trillion, recognizing, however, that. growth does not automatically lead to a reduction in gender-based inequality. Conversely, it is estimated that gender gaps cost the economy some 15 percent of GDP.Women empowering Women, When Women Rise, Families Thrive. BRAND IDENTITYWith the help of your investment, Sacred Medicine can launch a full PR campaign and in turn bring much needed attention to the world crisis of the Women’s Empowerment Movement.

They have worked with over 250+ brands. They made over 415,499 ethically made units. 99.98% Successful delivery rate.ACCREDITED CINTAS SOCIAL COMPLIANCEAs outlined in the Cintas Corporation’s Code of Conduct, the code requires vendors to comply to standards outlined in the code: 1.General Ethical Standards 2.Customs Compliance 3.Drug Interdiction 4.Wages and Hours 5.Child Labor 6.Prison/Forced Labor 7.Discrimination 8.Health and Safety 9.Working Conditions 10.Right to Organize and Workplace Freedom 11.Subcontractors.To achieve their vision, the Company is committed to providing the best in class customer service in addition to working with only the most detail oriented local manufacturers and promoting eco-friendly fashion to the mainstream.Current Company StatusSacred Medicine was incorporated in June, 2018 under Red Eagle Universal, and will be moving to its own LLC status within 2 months of Feb 2019. It will be operating as a Member-Manager status in Oriah’s legal name, Barbara Miller. All company shares are held by the founder. Since sourcing, manufacturing, and selling out of Oriah’s bedroom to friends and family at first, and then to a studio in the heart of downtown Los Angeles, Fashion District, her goal is to sell through local and regional boutiques, and eventually international retailers. The Company has grown to have it’s own online store, relationships with suppliers and manufacturers such as Indie Source in it’s short duration it has existed. With the manufacturer being located in Los Angeles, the sourcing is local and also indigenous countries are responsible for the embroidery and trim.Operational ProceduresAt the point that Sacred Medicine requires other employees to work in-house, a separate live or work space might be necessary. Presently, Sacred Medicine does not have a bricks-and-mortar retail location. All prototype construction and manufacturing will be done off-site at a seamstress’ shop and at the chosen manufacturing facility. Marketing can be done in-house or at marketing consultant office space.In the next three years of projected operation, the company will be producing in the USA and outsource manufacturing to dedicated service providers. Oriah Mirza will do the designing work herself and through her well-connected business relationships, she will be able to take care of many of the firm’s vital functions of marketing, such as public relations, marketing and other communications-related activities.The company will set up a professional supply chain management to be able to cut costs and deliver flexibly and punctually at the same time. Supply chain management is of prime importance for young fashion and design firms. Good supply chain management entails close communication with suppliers, warehouses, logistics firms and the client, Indie Source and Oriah Mirza herself will be supplying this. Diligent research and comparison of shipment options and building relationships with key personnel within logistics providers’ facilities will help Sacred Medicine stay on top of its supply chain management. Due to the small-scale nature in the beginning of the business it will be relatively easy to coordinate the inflow of fabric and outflow of product. Ground transportation with UPS will be utilized in most cases. In the case that international shipments are needed, air transportation will also be an element of the logistics organization of Sacred Medicine. No products will be shipped on consignment basis, consignment will be avoided altogether, due to the risky nature of working on consignment. Sacred Medicine will have a dedicated sales representative who will search out potential buyers.The company will secure showrooms in Los Angeles, New York City, London and Japan. Purchasing from Sacred Medicine, buyers receive product displays and promotional materials with purchase. Additionally, Sacred Medicine will work closely with regional sales representative and also of motorcycle apparel manufacturers and buyers. Oriah Mirza will also attend relevant pre-season fashion trade shows and have all the necessary equipment at her disposal.Unique Selling PropositionsThe company will have a set of unique features, which will differentiate it from competition. The most important unique selling proposition of Sacred Medicine is to be found in the capabilities of the founder herself. The owner of Sacred Medicine, Oriah Mirza, being very experienced in graphic design and project management and maintaining impeccable contacts in the marketing and fashion industry, will invest all of her personal time and expertise into the startup. The fashion and retail industry tends to be overly youth and small size focused. In addition, many female motorcycle riders are forced to wear men’s clothing which denies their femininity and makes them wardrobe-wary when riding out for a social occasion. However, by closely following high fashion trends as well as customers’ purchasing preferences, Sacred Medicine will tailor styles to meet the specific needs of the clientele. The key feature of Sacred Medicine is its commitment to providing women with unique quality, stylish clothing options. Because the primary concern is ensuring that consumers are happy with the fit and style of their purchase, Sacred Medicine will have a strong impact on the Boho Chic fashion and All Gender motorcyclist communities and earn strong word-of-mouth endorsements from happy clients.When it comes to the material of their clothes, nearly 72  percent of survey respondents say that natural fibers are better for the environment than synthetics, with 51 percent of consumers willing to pay more for them. Such trends are driving global brands like Gucci, Timberland, and others to focus on making their products and supply chain more environmentally friendly.Location of HeadquartersThe business is being founded in Downtown Los Angeles, the Fashion Headquarters and District which has a long tradition of being a hub for fashion design and up-and-coming innovative business model. Although it is an expensive headquarters location both in daily operation costs and initial start-up costs, the unique advantages that the location offers outweigh the disadvantage of these elevated costs.Very good infrastructure, numerous potential business partners, ease of travel in and out of the city, high-quality materials available, a variety of relevant industry events and an ample supply of highly qualified labor were all factors which persuaded the choice towards Downtown Los Angeles. Also the founder is personally bonded to the area as she is a native Los Angeles and has been living in Southern California her whole life.Sacred Medicine’s ObjectivesThe Company is currently selling garments online through its Shopify e-commerce store shipping primarily within Southern California with market penetration in Los Angeles,  southern California regions and New York. The company is laser-focused on growing its sales and operations as broken down in the two phases listed below: Phase I (Next 6 Months)
Increase online sales by 20 percent by end of year through influencer and social media marketing tactics
Pay $11,040.00 to Indie Source, for only one base jacket design, and 3 unique designs. There are total 24 designs in the Spring 2019 collection. Total will be $88,000 if I put 24 designs into production. Instead, I will launch 6 unique designs with two jacket styles, for a total of $22,080 to begin production for retail stores and online inventory.
Continue providing exceptional on-location editorial photoshoots for new and emerging collections with highly sought after models and photographers matching the bohemian theme and any futuristic aesthetic
Partner with 3 additional local high-end fashion boutiques with shared values as distribution channels
Increase online social presence on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest by 30 percent
Right from the start, it is planned to develop and make expert use of an online presence. This is a very important part of the business undertaking, as the web presence will enable Sacred Medicine to showcase its products, establish the brand and raise awareness in the industry. It is likewise thinkable that the first customers of Sacred Medicine will actually buy the product from an integrated webshop. From these early revenues the company will be able to generate a higher cash flow, benefiting from ways to make itself depend less solely on high volume contracts with the retailers and wholesale clients.
Continue designing more fashionable certified armor motorcycle jackets designed by local motorcycle manufacturing company with the highest quality leather cut and rip-proof and can last for decades men's and women's jackets.  The “Boho Motorcycle Chic” line is supposed to fill a niche in the motorcycle apparel market, which makes the emphasis on fashion also a part of the company’s USP in contrast to the usual sports racing/Americana look that is traditionally produced by competitors. They will continue to be crafted in styles that appeal to motorcycle-enthusiastic women and will combine functionality and robustness with clean, aesthetic design. Since Sacred Medicine creates clothing that people can wear on and off the bike, the clothes have removable and/or very flexible padding. When designing the clothing, Oriah Mirza focuses on designs that are able to unify function and beauty. All Jackets and any gear that is meant to protect from abrasion and impact while riding a motorcycle are tested and CE certified, with removable CE EN1621-1 approved back, shoulder, and elbow armour.
The goal is to create pieces that are exactly what an urban, individualistic woman is looking for, something that she would wear even if she is not going to ride a motorcycle. Therefore the clothing has to be serving two needs at the same time, just like for example Nautica that caters to the needs of marine sports enthusiasts but has developed such a cult that its clothing is worn in daily life (also Surface to Air produces beautifully crafted riding jacket that might serve as an inspiration for : www.surfacetoair.com/store-us/?pg=style&amp;col...).
Sacred Medicine will give special attention to the styles, colors and fits to flatter all sizes. The niche specialty will be fitting gender neutral, men and women sizes 6-14, although some clothing will range in sizes 0-14.
Sacred Medicine will have a dedicated sales representative who will search out potential buyers.
To control costs, track inventory and manage stock levels at the later stages of business operation, an inventory control system will be set in place. This will include the standard bar code with its related equipment and software. Eventually, staff will conduct annual inventory audits and hire outside auditors when necessary. All accounting and finances will be maintained using in state-of-the-art software.
The goal is to implement a superior customer service system. The well-trained personnel will provide an edge in the competition and the brand will quickly become acknowledged broadly. Protecting the brand and its good reputation will become a key part of the strategy to ensure that the unique selling propositions that come along with a recognized brand name are maintained as long as possible.
A strong return policy will be put in place.
ProjectionIn the long run, the potential for regional and/or national expansion will be explored further. Some concrete goals, which must be attained before an expansion can be considered, are to penetrate and raise awareness in 30% of the targeted consumer market, build a customer base and mailing list and become a profitable business with expansion potential within a maximum of three years.The first major milestones will be securing funds and setting up the business. This is the main focus right now. In five years, Sacred Medicine will have established itself within the community and within the industry and set up overseas sourcing and manufacturing operations (most likely in US, China or Vietnam). It will become the leading brand in contemporary Boho Chic apparel. In addition, the Motorcycle Chic line will be the the perfect blend between cutting edge, high-tech protective wear and femininity and gender neutral designs. Sacred Medicine will make an impact globally through initiatives built into the company structure, supporting employees and communities around the world.

Consulting:Sacred Medicine will employ the services of the various consulting firms and freelancers in its first few years of business. The services that Sacred Medicine will employ are to aid the founder to acquire important know how and business acumen to help her achieve the ambitious goals she set for the company.
Sacred Medicine will hire a marketing PR company that will help manage the setting up of the brand, including a great variety of services such as logo design, clothing label design, brand book, web design, market intelligence gathering, marketing testing and copy-writing among others.

Price Strategy: Sacred Medicine will set prices that will underscore the high quality of the products. With very high design and production costs, the price must be set to ensure that the break even can be reached in a reasonable time. Therefore Sacred Medicine will also use its price strategy to stay true to its target group focus, which is primly made up of educated women of the upper two quartiles on the income scale.
The following positions will be contracted out: Marketing Director and Design and Branding Director, there are several positions that are yet to be filled. However, Los Angeles has enough budding designers and hungry job applicants that finding qualified employees will not be an issue. Our administrative assistant and manager will be paid an hourly wage, plus commission. Bonuses will be provided with each year of service following an annual review to encourage employee retention.
Phase II (Next 12 Months)
Explore possibility of brick-and-mortar operations through testing pop-up stores in Los Angeles counties and Southern California regions.
Either take profits made, or run another crowd funding campaign to raise $55,000 just to finish production of the remaining designs not produced in Phase 1. That does not include all the other costs.
Create strategic partnerships with local fashion boutiques in LA and New York for distribution in the area
Scope out local manufacturers in Los Angeles area for quality production with aim of opening operations for denim jackets as the next product line and increased delivery within region
Establish partnerships with non profit organizations that Oriah Mirza feels a connection to regarding Human Rights, equality and Sex Trafficking.
FINANCIAL PLANOur company will earn revenue from our customers’ purchases of our products if funded with $80,000 in this crowdsource funding. If only 100 units are sold in retail stores in 2019, per design, with the current collection and price points that will be 2400 units totaling gross revenue of $2,760,000. Sacred Medicine’s first-year income is estimated to be a profit margin of 90%, and an estimated net income of: $2,484,000 before taxes.  Our company will generate revenue from the sale of clothing and other merchandise to retail stores. We will achieve month-to-month profitability within the first year.Communication & Marketing StrategyOriah Mirza has a strong sales and marketing background and recognizes the significance of effective marketing. Additionally, she will take the services of a branding and marketing consulting firm for the initial setting up of her branding (logo, corporate colors, brand book, etc.). She will seek to implement a variety of marketing measures including PR-Strategy and of course also all the conventional methods such as print-ads, trade shows and researching and contacting potential clients. In order to not overstretch the tight resources available during the initial start-up phase, the marketing budget for ongoing expenses is to be kept to no more than 5% of gross annual sales.The marketing message, logo and slogans will revolve around the idea of All Genders can enjoy Boho Chic and Boho Gypsy attire. All Genders can have artistic and Boho Chic women motorcycle attire and be riders of beautiful trendsetters motorcycle jackets. Shamanic and Conscious artistic/musical adventure seekers and All Gender ground-breakers are the target market audience. Sacred Medicine initial marketing efforts will remain local until a presence in the International Boho Chic community is established. These initial efforts will rely heavily on local print and broadcast social media coverage, traditional advertising, signage, a direct mail marketing campaign and networking. A significant portion of the advertising budget will be allocated to print and social and broadcast media.A very important focus is placed on Sacred Medicine’s consistent presence at trade shows, industry networking events and fairs for fashion designers. The US hosts more fashion events than any other country in the world. The industry is well supported by private financiers that promote emerging designers and host regional fashion shows. However, unlike other developed countries, most of the large fashion events in the US were only launched in the last few years, the surge is extraordinary. In 2008, the US hosted at least 44 large-scale fashion events versus only 11 events in 2004. France and Italy for example had fewer events (2 and 4 respectively in both 2004 and 2008). The sponsors/financiers in the fashion industry act as key drivers by promoting designers and regional fashion events. Therefore it will be very important for Sacred Medicine to be present at all these events and continually build a network in the industry.Marketing opportunities will be continually utilized as Sacred Medicine expands its business and customer numbers grow. Measures such as bonuses for recommendations will increase sales as the effects of word of mouth propaganda become more apparent. To this end the website of sacred Medicine will serve the multitude of different purposes. The domain names http://sacredmedicinewear.com has been reserved and more site development will begin as funds become available.Foremost, the website is to showcase the brand Sacred Medicine and it’s collections and provide customers with the ability to purchase items online (and retailers to order sample products). As the site progresses, features such as fashion advice, a blog, designer interviews, newsletters, and Internet-only specials will become available. Eventually, the internet activities will establish and nurture an online social community where Boho Chic and motorcycle chic -enthusiastic All Gender clientele can gather and discuss topics of the day, network and share experiences.Future Fashion Industry ForecastE-Commerce will make up 17% of all US retail sales by 2022 – and one company is the main reasonForrester Research Inc predicts that online sales will account for 17% of all US retail sales by 2022, up from a projected 12.7% in 2017, according to Forrester's new Online Retail Forecast as cited by Digital Commerce 360. The report also expects US online sales to grow 13% YoY in 2017, which is five times faster than projected offline sales growth, and in line with the National Retail Federation's estimates.Unsurprisingly, Amazon is expected to be a major driver of this online sales growth. The report states that 83% of US online adults bought something on Amazon in 2016, and 55% of them used Amazon as a research tool before making a purchase.CompetitionCompetition in the fashion industry is always a big factor. Even though Sacred Medicine is operating in a growing in popularity niche, there will be still a wide array of competitors, whose business operations partially overlap the business model of Sacred Medicine. To each brand of competitor Sacred Medicine will have the right answer to differentiate itself and perform well even in a very competitive business environment.Sacred Medicine will differentiate itself with the more exclusive and limited collection of Boho Chic and artistic wear clothes. In addition, will offer a very feminine, elegant and sexy Boho Chic Motorcycle Chic style which sets it apart from overall brand image of companies like Harley-Davidson, Triumph, River Road or Vanson Leathers. Small stores can often compete very effectively with large ones by targeting their products at different customers, even though they have less infrastructure at their disposal and can often not undercut big competitors price-wise.Target GroupSacred Medicine is a business-to-consumer retail company. All Gender Boho Chic, world adventure seekers, travelers, social media influencers, festival goers, and spiritual/ shamanic believers, artists and musicians and alternative emerging new designer couture customers are the target audience. All Gender motorcycle riders ages 25-55 are also the target customers. The target customers are trailblazers and trendsetters. They value uniqueness, convenience, service and quality.To reach the target group, Sacred Medicine will target the retailing chains, where the target customer usually buys. Originally it was thought to sell to high-end retailers such as Neiman Marcus, Nordstrom, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, etc., at first that have a celebrity and wealthy clientele. After considering the target customer properties and price point of Sacred Medicine products, Oriah Mirza considers entering into high end boutique retail. After it is established among the Boho Chic community, the brand shall have a cult following beyond Boho Chic enthusiasts.Risk Analysis1
Our small team is diligent and thorough, and with our Indie GoGo investment, will hire a management team to run our financials, orders and fulfillment. In conjunction with working closely with our manufacturer Indie Source, we will advance quickly. The rearrangement of team members or loss of services of the members of management may have an adverse effect on Sacred Medicine. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining other personnel that will help us grow successfully.
As a young startup in the highly competitive fashion industry and dealing with very high product development, manufacturing and logistics costs, Sacred Medicine is confronted with a large quantity of relevant risks. By starting out with a Boho Chic Spring and Summer collection the startup-costs and risks are reduced. There will be more time to forge business relationships and Indie Source and Oriah Mirza will be able to identify the best-priced raw material suppliers, pattern-makers and other partners involved in the realization of the business goal.
There are certain risks that the company will not be able to influence, such as market risk. These systemic risks, which also include political and currency exchange risks (these will become relevant as soon a overseas suppliers or customers become involved), cannot be avoided by anyone in the industry. A farsighted and liquidity-conscious management should be able to maintain a reasonable degree of financial flexibility to deal with any negative impacts from the overall economy. The impact of currency exchange risks is considered to be quite low in the first few years of operation as it is not planned to generate substantial revenue through overseas sales. Likewise on the buying side the currency exchange risks are not deemed overly significant, even though it is considered to import certain amounts of fabric from China and/or Europe and conduct overseas manufacturing at later stages.
 2Sacred Medicine may never receive a future equity financing or elect to convert the Securities upon such future financing. In addition, Sacred Medicine may never undergo a liquidity event such as a sale of the Company or an IPO. If neither the conversion of the Securities nor a liquidity event occurs, the Purchasers could be left holding the Securities in perpetuity. The Securities have numerous transfer restrictions and will likely be highly liquid, with no secondary market on which to sell them. The Securities are not equity interests, have no ownership rights, have no rights to the Company’s assets or profits and have no voting rights or ability to direct the Company or its actions.3We cannot assure investors that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors. We can provide no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not provide products or services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving industry or market trends. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.4The operational hazards that the Company will be confronting are of a very different nature. To begin with, it is very unlikely that the prototyping and manufacturing will be smooth and flawless from the very beginning. A lot of scrap will be produced until the production process is perfected, which will lead to high production costs. Other unforeseen costs are going to be incurred at least in the first two years of operation. Even though by the selection of experienced and well-reputed partners some uncertainty might be eliminated, it would be too optimistic to assume that everything will work right from the beginning.With the wrong partners in overseas manufacturing there is a very high risk of designs being knocked off and copied, which reduces the value of the brand and can in some cases even hurt sales. These risks of theft of intellectual property can be minimized by the generous use of contracts and NDAs, the diligent management of critical data, choosing partners with great care and using certain copyright best practices such as Pauper’s copyright on top of getting each season’s designs protected by the US copyright office.5Our growth depends on our ability to retain and attract new customers. If we do not continue to do this, our business may not succeed.6We rely on third parties to supply the garments. If any of these partnerships end, this may be a concern to investors. It is also advised that the high risk of damage to products during the warehousing or transport as well as all other material risks (damage, theft, etc.) concerning the office infrastructure and health risks of the founder and eventually the staff team should be covered to maximum extent by adequate insurance. Especially with a very tight cash base, the impact of any mishap in the warehouse can be devastating and lead to the ruin of the company, so maximum insurance coverage will be purchased.6Our LLC, Red Eagle Universal LLC has not authorized any Units yet. Investors investing in this SAFE agreement, are investing with an understanding that Preferred Units have not yet been authorized. Business OrganizationLEGAL ENTITY & OWNERSHIPSacred Medicine will be a Limited Liability Corporation as of May 2019, and formally organized in Sacred Medicine Los Angeles, CA. Mrs. Oriah Mirza is the company’s principal owner.The business operates within the fashion design industry and is classified under NAICS code 541490 – fashion design services. All Jackets and any gear that is meant to protect from abrasion and impact while riding a motorcycle will be tested and CE certified. EXIT STRATEGYOriah Mirza intends to launch and grow Sacred Medicine for many years into the future. In the event that investors require repayment of their initial investments, plus a large return on their investments, we will seek a partner to buyout the investors’ shares. Another alternative is a management buyout, which will be agreed upon in advance.In the long term, Sacred Medicine, as a profitable business, will become an appealing acquisition for large retail chains. Investors usually wait until a company goes public or is acquired. If you invest through a Indie GoGo, you may also hold interests in the fund for a very long time, but Indie GoGo will decide how and when to sell the stock, then distribute any proceeds to the investors in the fund.Equity.

<p>Thanks to advances in life-saving surgery  the number of persons who, like me,  undergo an ostomy surgery due to cancer or chronic inflammatory bowel disease is significantly increasing while the age at which patients have stomas continues to drop. <strong> Living with my permanent ileostomy</strong>,  I experienced that, with appropriate supports, the stomabag related issues can be significantly reduced to improve the quality of life. A few months after my surgery, assisted by experienced professionals,  I  designed my  personal skin-friendly and functional garments: a special <strong><i>underwear</i></strong> made with the best  <i><strong>natural fabrics for skin protection</strong></i> and <strong><i>swimsuits</i></strong> that guarantee <i><strong>skin breathability</strong></i>,  <strong><i>reduce  discomfort from sweat infiltration around ostomy and enable to easily manage  the stomabag everywhere. </i></strong>A year later, I brought together my social research competencies, my entrepreneurial skills, my creative abilities, my new condition and  I created <strong>oStomyPRIDE Lingerie.</strong></p>

Those who want to act now.We present the first sandal in the market made from recycled plastics, mainly from waste collected from the beaches of Brazil.Our commitment and accountability have been set in motion.Would you like to join us? 
A revolutionary innovation in the footwear industry.Ocean CleanUp™ presents the first collection of sandals Made in Brazil, entirely manufactured from recycled and recyclable materials, using a new and revolutionary fibre, made from plastics collected from the oceans and beaches: SEAPLASTEC®Seaplastec’s design is based on the structure of marine sponge, sharing its properties of impact absorbing, lightness and resistance.Seaplastec® represents a revolutionary innovation in the footwear industry. It allows us to manufacture soft, comfortable, light, non-slip, bacteria resistant shoes and at the same time actively help with the devastating problem of plastics in our Oceans.
 Colour Range:Ocean CleanUp™ flip-flops and slides come in a range of 12 colours in male and female sizes! Made in Brazil - an example of sustainability.Brazil is a country of beaches, wildlife, nature and of course flip-flops, where recent generations have developed an ecological conscience through the awareness that their country plays a huge role in being “the lungs of the planet”.This awareness has been heightened by the knowledge that everything that happens in Brazil’s ecosystem has an effect on the rest of the world with the Amazon Rainforest deforestation as a clear example.This responsibility, coupled with a greater sensitivity towards everything related to the environment, has made these generations become market leaders in the use of ecological, recycled and recyclable products. The Brazilians lead the global concern for environmental problems by more than 30 percentage points above the international average. This high awareness translates into a majority that values environmental protection over economic growth.Clear evidence of this was the creation in 1990 of Conservation International, a non-profit organization, whose objective is to ensure a healthy and productive planet for everyone and which currently has local offices in over 16 countries.Examples of international success can also be found in Brazil. Brands such as Osklen and Veja have projects and products linked to the world of fashion all manufactured in Brazil with a deep ethical commitment to sustainability.Commitment to the environment.In addition to using plastics from the rubbish found on beaches, Ocean CleanUp™, is committed to actively defending and cleaning our oceans, through solid collaborations with companies and organizations which fight for this same objective.Ocean CleanUp™ will allocate US$1 for each pair manufactured and the final amount of each season will be distributed amongst the following companies who are committed to protecting the Oceans and eliminating plastic*:Ocean CleanUp™ promises through its marketing, collaborations and ambassadors, to actively promote and spread the fundamental reasons for environmental preservation, the correct use of plastics and the need for cleaning and care of beaches and oceans.* Certified by Public Notary.

<h3><strong>ABOUT US</strong></h3>
<p>You know that one pair of shoes you own, they're chic, they’re hot, they completely reflect who you are, and they make your feet scream for something more comfortable after 30 minutes? We’ve all been there and unfortunately, when you think “fashion”, you automatically think of painful high heels.  </p>
<p>Well, we  want you to enjoy that moment of shoe bliss for more than just a moment.  We thought, if people can send a man to the moon, we can deliver a shoe that is cozy on the inside AND reflects your personality on the outside.  Sexy! Quirky! Classy! You name it – We bring it! </p>
<p>Born in the edgy and fashionable New York City, EC was created with one goal in mind, to create the next generation of foot-friendly, comfortable and edgy women's shoes,</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: DEFINING THE PROBLEM</strong></h3>
<p>We spent over two years studying the pain points created by poor footwear: the burning balls of the feet, the strained arches, the pained heels, the bruised knuckles and painful bunions caused by the constant chafing of a narrow toe box.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: DESIGNING THE EC SOLUTION TO EASE THE PAIN</strong></h3>
<p>For our heels, we created a unique pillow top insole with 3 layers of foam comfort that runs from the tip of the toe to the back of the heel, the feel of which is noticeable from the very first wear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have also created a wider toe box, so that your toes have room to move and breathe. And for the ladies suffering with bunions, we made sure to design a shoe that covers the bone, not cut into it.  Last but not least, there won't be any slipping or sliding in these heels, and no need to buy any anti slip pads or scuff them up yourself as we use a rubber outsole that looks just like leather. </p>
<p>Our sneakers are made with an orthotic arch support insole.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: DEVELOPING THE LOOK</strong></h3>
<p>Our designs move beyond the basic black, brown, and beige of most comfort shoes, utilizing more exciting leathers.  You’re not plain, so your shoes shouldn’t be either.</p>
<p>Our Indiegogo collection consists of 4 styles. </p>
<p><u><strong>Our 3 inch pump</strong></u></p>
<p><u><strong>2 - Our 3 inch d'orsay</strong></u></p>
<p><u><strong>3 - Our 2 inch kitten heel</strong></u></p>
<p><u><strong>4 - Our low top sneaker</strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: DECIDING ON WHERE TO MANUFACTURE AND OUR TOP PRIORITIES AS A BRAND</strong></h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>When we set out to create a leading comfort shoe, we knew we had to work with the best craftsmen and use the best materials, which led us straight to Portugal.  The Portuguese have grown in prominence as one of the best shoemakers in the world.  With a rich history and tradition of quality craftsmanship, our manufacturers provide the latest in technique, materials and some of the most unique leathers around.</span></p>
<p><i><u><strong>Our priorities:</strong></u></i></p>

<p><strong>- Unique Materials:</strong> We bring you the unexpected, with most of our materials coming from Portugal and Italy</p>
<h3><strong>Step 5: PRODUCTION - This is where we need you</strong></h3>

<p><strong>PaceMasters is a brand of racing-inspired watches</strong>, which was founded by a 32 years old motorsport fan and watch enthusiast. He has built up a small team of the watch and car designers from New York, Berlin, Istanbul, and Zurich, who draw inspiration from motorsports and Formula 1 particularly. In the last 20 months, the team has been working hard on creating the concept from scratch, starting from sketches, building several prototypes and fine-tuning them, and finally having the actual product on the wrist today.</p>
<p>With Paddock Chronograph on the wrist, we have traveled the world and visited Formula 1 Grand Prix, European Le Mans Series (ELMS) and GT-series races to collect feedback from professional racing drivers directly.

Paddock Chronograph is the first timepiece from the racing-inspired collection.


Racing has always been a part of our lives and having a spirit of competition we are starting this year to fight through the peloton of automotive-inspired watch brands targeting to get the podium one day.

<p>If a loved one or someone you care for tends to walk off when you’re out and about (one minute they’re there, the next they’ve disappeared), Proximity could be just the answer. Whether your in the house or at a busy supermarket, the Proximity Button can alert you to your loved one walking off far quicker than if they weren't wearing it.</p>
<p>If you're outdoors in a big open space the Button will alert you at about 65 feet (20 metres). If you're inside, for example in a busy supermarket, the alarm will go off a lot quicker because walls and people will get in the way of the signal and block it far sooner – around 32 feet (10 metres).</p>

<p>Crowdfunding is used by start-ups like us to raise the funds they need to get their product to market. </p>
<p>There are two different types of crowdfunding: donation-based, where people give money out of goodwill; and reward crowdfunding, where donators contributions are exchanged for current or future products – the most popular type at this time.</p>
<p>Our crowdfunding campaign is both. You can either donate or purchase the Proximity Button. Each early adopter who contributes $65 (£40) will receive one Proximity Button to use with the free app. Two Buttons will cost you $99 (£68).</p>
<p>The 'perks' are to the right of this page and are how you buy your Button. <b>If you purchase the Proximity Button or donate today, you will bring our product to market and get it to those who need it most.</b></p>

<p><b>Autism</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Almost half of children with an ASD attempt to elope from a
safe environment. It’s reported that wandering is ranked one of the most
stressful ASD behaviours by parents of wanderers. Terrifyingly, in 2009, 2010
and 2011, accidental drowning accounted for 91% of U.S. deaths reported in children
with an ASD ages 14 and younger due to wandering/elopement.</p>
<p>Statistics like these truly demonstrate why there is such a need for more products on the market to help families struggling with this problem.</p>
<p><b>Dementia</b></p>
<p>Dementia now effects 44 million people worldwide and this number is going to double in the next 20 years. With no cure yet, it's vital that we find solutions in order to offer a better quality of life.</p>
<p>One of the biggest problems a carer of someone with dementia will face is wandering. More than 60% of those with dementia will wander and if they're not found within 24 hours up to half of individuals can end up seriously injured and in some instances have a fatal accident. </p>
<p>Please watch our video below to hear firsthand from carers, just how terrifying wandering can be:</p>

<p><b><u>FAQs</u></b></p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p><b>Is the Proximity Button only for people with
dementia and autism?</b></p>
<p>No, the Button’s use can be
extended to anyone who needs protecting. It’s stylish and small design means it
is suitable for all. If you need advice please don’t hesitate to contact us,
we’d be happy to help.</p>
<p><b>Do I need a certain phone model to be able to
use the Button?</b></p>
<p>Yes, unfortunately not all phones support low energy
Bluetooth. In order for the product to work you must have one of the following
<a href=""http://www.proximitycare.co.uk/compatible-phones"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.proximitycare.co.uk/compatible-phones"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">phones</a>.</p>
<p><b>How long will the Button battery last?</b></p>
<p>If you leave the Button on, we estimate that the
battery will need changing every 6 months. To help conserve battery life we
recommend turning it off when not in use – remember, this is not done through
the app but by clicking the Button until you see a red light.</p>
<p><b>Will my phone’s battery life be affected by
the use of Bluetooth?</b></p>
<p>Good news – the app uses low energy Bluetooth that
requires very little power so you shouldn’t notice a difference in your phone’s
battery life.</p>
<p>However, if you have an iPhone, the app has to use
location services – this can reduce battery life so it’s a good idea to close
the app when you aren’t using it.</p>
<p><b>Can I change the volume and sound for the
alerts?</b></p>
<p>For both Android and iOS we recommend leaving your
phone on loud and turning the volume up to the max.</p>
<p>For Android phones you can change the alarm sound in
your settings. </p>
<p>On iOS you cannot change the alarm, but we’ve hand-picked
a sound that is very noticeable.</p>
<p><b>Is the Button reliable?</b></p>
<p>Yes, the Button is reliable. However, like all
technology it can have it’s hiccups. The Button is simply an aid – a person’s
safety should not be placed entirely into its hands.</p>
<p><b>Is the Button water resistant?</b></p>
<p>The device is splash proof so won’t be damaged by the rain.
But it isn’t waterproof, so avoid putting it through the washing machine.</p>
<p><b>What is low energy Bluetooth?</b></p>
<p>Bluetooth low energy (Bluetooth LE, BLE, marketed as
Bluetooth Smart) is a wireless personal area network technology designed and
marketed by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group aimed at novel applications in
the healthcare, fitness, beacons, security, and home entertainment industries.</p>
<p><b>How long will I have to wait for my Button
once I have pledged?</b></p>
<p>Based on our timing plan, we estimate we will ship our first
batch of Buttons in September 2016.</p>
<p>Once we have
all the funds and our campaign ends we will be able to go into production very
quickly. The only thing that could slow this down is the product certification
– this is a legal requirement needed before a product can be sold to the
public.</p>
<p><b>Where are you shipping to?</b></p>
<p>We ship
worldwide.</p>
<p><b>I’m having trouble making a payment. Who can
help me</b>?</p>
<p>We’re sorry to hear that! If you’re having trouble
making a payment, please contact Indiegogo’s Customer Happiness Team at
support@indiegogo.com. One of their payments specialists will be able to assist
you within 24 hours.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why are payments being taken in US Dollars
when you’re a British company?</b></p>
<p>Dementia and autism are global issues, US Dollars tends to be a
familiar currency worldwide - we hope you don’t mind!</p>

</div></div>","The Proximity Button is a small magnetic badge that is worn by your loved one. It's a simple device that will allow you to worry less and relax more.Connected to your iPhone or Android device, Proximity alerts you when the Button wearer wanders too far from your side. Proximity is a simple way to keep your loved ones out of harms way. 






If a loved one or someone you care for tends to walk off when you’re out and about (one minute they’re there, the next they’ve disappeared), Proximity could be just the answer. Whether your in the house or at a busy supermarket, the Proximity Button can alert you to your loved one walking off far quicker than if they weren't wearing it.
If you're outdoors in a big open space the Button will alert you at about 65 feet (20 metres). If you're inside, for example in a busy supermarket, the alarm will go off a lot quicker because walls and people will get in the way of the signal and block it far sooner – around 32 feet (10 metres).




'Any technological solutions that make the lives of carers easier, will mean less stress and more time spent on delivering quality care.' - The Guardian


'An affordable solution to guard against wandering' - Good News Network
'Proximity is an affordable way to protect people with dementia' - Inhabitat
'The upcoming Proximity Button, invented by the daughter of a dementia carer, is designed to be an effective and affordable way to keep loved ones safe without intrusive tracking.' - TechRadar
'A unique device to help people living with dementia' - Amazyble
'I’m excited about Proximity because it’s unlike other products out there' - Unforgettable




Crowdfunding is used by start-ups like us to raise the funds they need to get their product to market. 
There are two different types of crowdfunding: donation-based, where people give money out of goodwill; and reward crowdfunding, where donators contributions are exchanged for current or future products – the most popular type at this time.
Our crowdfunding campaign is both. You can either donate or purchase the Proximity Button. Each early adopter who contributes $65 (£40) will receive one Proximity Button to use with the free app. Two Buttons will cost you $99 (£68).
The 'perks' are to the right of this page and are how you buy your Button. If you purchase the Proximity Button or donate today, you will bring our product to market and get it to those who need it most.


The Proximity Button is a smart sensor that connects to your mobile device. The Button quickly sends alerts to your phone when your loved one wearing it wanders too far from you.






The Proximity Button is an elegant wearable sensor that is worn by your loved ones. It's delicate design means it can be easily placed on all types of clothing. The strong magnet fixture holds it securely in place and there's also a strap for added security.


The Button's simple magnetic design means it's extremely easy to put onto the person you're caring for. It's so small and light that it can even be attached safely to the collar of a shirt. The Button can also easily be placed on the back of a shirt, t-shirt, blouse or top should you be worried about a loved one noticing the Button and removing it.



We believe that everyone should have the ability to protect the people they care about the most. We approached the product and user experience of Proximity with the following principles in mind: 




Protecting your loved ones shouldn't be difficult.This is why we designed the Button and the Proximity app to be as easy to use as possible. We didn't want to pack it full of features that would over complicate it. Our sole aim with the Button is to warn carer's to wandering. If a loved one is wearing the Button and they leave your side, you will know about it far quicker than if they weren't wearing it. Simple.
Traditional devices to prevent wandering will come in the form of a bracelet or a pendant. We realised in our early-prototype phase that these would not be suitable for our customers. People with dementia and autism can often become upset by things that they aren't familiar with. The Button is so small and light that the wearer will barely notice it therefore avoiding the issue of upset and removal.


We want everyone to be able to keep their loved ones safer. Therefore we ensured our product remained affordable for all. The Button is not a tracking device and therefore doesn't rely on expensive technology. 









The app has been carefully designed to suit all ages. Connecting to your Button takes a matter of minutes with handy images to guide you through the setup.

We've also included a tutorial for that extra bit of help. 



Still worried about whether you're 'tech-savvy' enough to use our app?
Hear what a few other people have to say about it in our video below...






Autism


Almost half of children with an ASD attempt to elope from a
safe environment. It’s reported that wandering is ranked one of the most
stressful ASD behaviours by parents of wanderers. Terrifyingly, in 2009, 2010
and 2011, accidental drowning accounted for 91% of U.S. deaths reported in children
with an ASD ages 14 and younger due to wandering/elopement.
Statistics like these truly demonstrate why there is such a need for more products on the market to help families struggling with this problem.
Dementia
Dementia now effects 44 million people worldwide and this number is going to double in the next 20 years. With no cure yet, it's vital that we find solutions in order to offer a better quality of life.
One of the biggest problems a carer of someone with dementia will face is wandering. More than 60% of those with dementia will wander and if they're not found within 24 hours up to half of individuals can end up seriously injured and in some instances have a fatal accident. 
Please watch our video below to hear firsthand from carers, just how terrifying wandering can be:
      
We want to help people like Paula and James protect their loved ones. We want to give them that much needed peace of mind.

Here is what customers of Proximity had to say about us:

""I'm a father with a child with Autism and he loves to wander off. My wife and I would get worried if we opened the front door...in case he would try to get out...I looked all over the internet to see what could be used to keep an close eye on him. One day I was on Indiegogo and saw your product and I said ""this is exactly was I need for my son""  Thank you for your idea and I wish you all the success with the Proximity product.""  - Ralph
""My mum would wander all the time. What really excites me is that it is unlike anything else out there... Proximity allows you to keep your loved ones safer at a much more affordable price point"" - James
""What a great product - i really could have done with one of these when i was caring for my mum"" - Paula




Watch our short animation to find out exactly how the Proximity Button works!

Watch our full animation on the Proximity story further down this page!




Inside the Button is a small piece of technology known as a beacon. Put simply, a beacon is a transmitter that sends out a Bluetooth signal to communicate to an app in your phone. The great thing about Bluetooth is that it doesn't rely on satellite connections, so works in all environments. The Proximity app prompts the user to switch their Bluetooth on when the app is launched.

The beacon in your Button is powered by a coin cell battery. The battery will last up to 6 months. We also recommend turning the Button off when it's not in use - to do this you simply press on the main body of the Button as pictured below. 






We now have a brilliant working prototype. Once we've reached our goal, we will have a fast production time. We aim to have your Button with you by September 2016. We will keep you updated throughout the process! 










Here's a breakdown of the perks you can choose from when you support this campaign (select your perk from the sidebar at the top of this page). Please note the Proximity app is free to download, you only have to purchase the Button.








Proximity was founded in 2014 by Natalie. Natalie's mum has cared for people with dementia for the past 15 years.


It's her experiences and stories that inspired Natalie to create a simple, affordable product that will keep people living with dementia safer. Natalie was later made aware of what an issue wandering is for autistic children and so began reaching out to this community too.

<h3> </h3>
<p>    My name is Brenda Gallander and I am a 52 year old mother of four and Nana to 8 awesome grandchildren.   A year and a half ago I became  single after  18 years.  My youngest daughter choice to live with her farther. So for the first time in my life I was living alone. </p>
<p>    I started making sterling silver and gold jewelry about 17  years ago.  I put it down for 10 years to raise my now 15 year old daughter.    When I divorced her father  I set myself up a jewelry bench and started making jewelry again.  I was determined to go after my dream of making jewelry.</p>
<p>      Around a year ago  a friend gave me some copper wire to make  jewelry with. When I annealed a piece I notice it changed colors. So I began to  research this color change and  discovered it is called Flame Painting Copper.  I watched all the videos I could find online and learned all I could  about flame painting copper. Another  friend  gave me a 3' x 3' sheet of copper to play with and I became hooked.  After a year of teaching myself I have developed a new  Technique for  Flame Painting Copper. </p>
<p>    I started selling jewelry components on a Facebook group in November of 2017. In December I  posted a collage of some of my components on one of my Jewelry Groups and had 125 comment in 48 hours.  A lot of people wanted to know if I had a Tutorial. Which was a big surprise being I had not been Flame painting long.  I started my own group in January,  Flame Painted Copper Jewelry  with  442  members and growing fast.  In Feb. I opened an  Etsy store and I  have had 20 plus  sales.   In May  I started another group for selling  my components and jewelry on  and I  have 182  members or buyers.    A few weeks ago I posted another collage in the same  group on Facebook and I received over  70  friend request from members wanting to learn my technique.   Now  I have a growing list of around 100  plus  potential Students wanting to learn my technique of Flame Painting.</p>
<p>    My component and jewelry business is now full blown and I can't keep enough copper blanks on hand for everyone.  Plus,   I have a following of potential students wanting me to Teach On-line Classes, do video chat classes and to make  Tutorials.</p>
<p>   I have been teaching myself how to teach others for 6 months.  I finally  feel confident that I can teach others my technique of Flame Painting Copper.</p>
<p>    I have been researching Classroom platforms to set up on-line classes that supports live classes. I also need  quality video  equipment for making  video Tutorials and conduct Live Video Classes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">How the money will be used</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>   You have heard the phrase it takes money to make money. Well it is so true. The cooper  blanks cost from .45 to 3.50 and the cost of them add up quickly. A $200.00 order goes pretty quick. It takes up to 16  days to get a shipment so it's hard to keep blanks on hand. I have MTO, made to order, orders  piling up. This is  due to not being able to make a larger  order of banks due to their  cost.   So I would like to be able to stock up on copper blanks and sterling silver findings for making jewelry.  I also need the funds for  quality video equipment for making video tutorials  and to start  a  Live Online classroom.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">     Risk on your investment </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>   There is no risk on your investment. All Gift Certificate perks for merchandise will be available within 2 weeks of the campaign ending. I have two locations to purchase from.  All perks for Live one on one Classes  will be available  by appointment at the end of campaign. Full Online  Classes could be 2 to 3 weeks. I  hope to have beginner tutorials available by the end of the campaign, but I do not want to make that commitment . </p>

<h2><strong>Our Story</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>A Beautiful Journey</strong></h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Ethan and together with my partner Chloe, we founded Sun and Bamboo. Like many other college students and young millenials, we decided to set on a journey to discover ourselves right after we graduate. Our destination? The beautiful Far East: Japan.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541947537/dmb1nsob1exkmquieyok.jpg"" src=""""/><h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Calming Nature, Stressful Culture</strong></h3>

A Beautiful Journey
Hello, my name is Ethan and together with my partner Chloe, we founded Sun and Bamboo. Like many other college students and young millenials, we decided to set on a journey to discover ourselves right after we graduate. Our destination? The beautiful Far East: Japan.
 
Calming Nature, Stressful Culture
On a beautiful morning, we managed to catch the sunrise in a young and quiet bamboo forest. We saw the sunshine fill every gap of the bamboo plants, casting a beautiful glow all around us, both calming and soothing. However, as we travelled to the urban areas of major cities, we felt that the surroundings were stressful and tense. We even learnt that there is this phenomenon called karoshi, which loosely translates to death by overwork. So we asked ourselves, why is this so? Why can’t we stop overworking?
Why can’t we stop glorifying the culture of overwork?
Why can’t we stop karoshi? Or can we?  
After some research, we found that other than the workers in Japan, workers in the United States and many developed countries are overworked as well. Overworking is harmful to the mental, spiritual and emotional health. What alarmed and angered us even more was there is virtually no one dealing with this issue. Hence, we were inspired to set out on a mission to change the culture of overwork.
Against Overworking, Against Karoshi
Many other wood watches brands out there are on a mission to plant trees and save the Earth. We believe that is a very noble cause. And we want to build upon that. We want to save workers from overworking.
So that they can appreciate the beauty of Mother Nature. We are on a mission to change the culture of overwork. To save workers from overworking. To save them from karoshi. Will you join us in this mission? 
Why Wood Watches and Positive Emotions?
Traditional watches are made from boring materials and have quirky names that are not relatable. We are the first to change that and we create wood watches that are named after positive emotions. Firstly, we believe that wearing our wood watches and owning a piece of nature will bring positive vibes into your lives.
Secondly, we want to remind you that time is precious and not to overwork yourself.
Lastly, we believe that wearing a wood watch to your workplace is the best way to spark a conversation about the culture of overwork. The Bold CollectionFor our bold collection, we are offering FIVE different models to choose from.

<b><br/></b><h3><b>THE PROBLEM</b></h3>There's nothing more heartbreaking and more frustrating than the scream of a hungry baby. It's even worse knowing you could've prevented the screams.

<b>HOW IT CAME TO BE</b>
</h3>Nokï was born around the same time as my first son.  In 2011, when
 I was a new mom, I took my son with me to run a few errands.  By the 
time we arrived at our second stop, my son was crying for his bottle, and I 
quickly discovered that I'd forgotten to pack it.  As his cries got 
louder, I was faced with a difficult choice.  I could either abandon all my 
errands and go home, or I could buy an entire can of formula, a new baby
 bottle and a water bottle in order to feed my hungry child. Home was over half an hour away, and I knew I couldn't listen to my baby suffer for that long. He was 
heartbreakingly distraught, so I bought a new can of formula, a water bottle, and a baby bottle to feed him faster.<br/>

Tom Cridland's premium organic cotton crewneck sweatshirts have been acclaimed by everyone from the BBC to THE INDEPENDENT to THE HUFFINGTON POST, which makes us very confident we can deliver you the world's perfect pair of chinos.
We have spent the past two years meticulously developing The Timeless Chino and, as FAST COMPANY summed up what Tom Cridland menswear offers, ""...there's now more choices for people who want ethical, relatively affordable clothes that are built to last"".It's ok to pay for luxury, just don't pay too much.

How do you select your size and color of preference?
As soon as the funding period is over, we will send out a survey to each and every one of you to collect your size and colour of preference, as well as your address. We’ll then get straight to work in Portugal hand-making your chinos.
Washing Instructions
You can machine wash or dry clean The Timeless Chino.
Exchanges
Once we’ve shipped everyone’s Timeless Chinos, if you’ve mistakenly chosen a size that doesn’t fit well we will be able to exchange yours for a different size. You’ll simply send your chinos to us and we’ll cover the return postage of your new one.
UK & US Shipping 
You did read correctly that Free Shipping to the UK and US is included in your pledge. We know this means that, even if we do make our target and reach the minimum order we need to get production started, we won’t really make money on The Timeless Chino. We don’t care though. This is a creative project and a labour of love.
EU Shipping
We doing secure EU Shipping with FedEx, which is just an extra £15.
International Shipping
We are also doing secure International Shipping anywhere in the world with FedEx, which is just an extra £15.
Terms of the Lifetime of Free Repairs Guarantee
There aren’t many T&Cs! The Timeless Chino is built to last a lifetime but, if anything happens to it, send it to us and we will mend it and post it back to you. That means the cost of repair is on us. Please note that we are unable to fix stains or items that have been shrunk through negligence!",25.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>In this video you can see the production process
of purse Load Gun. And also in this video we tried to convey
the atmosphere of our workshop. We hope you will be inspired with it!</p>
<p>We have been in this industry for 6 years! It's really
a good period for development. And now we are proud to say that our level goes
up every day including a well-established feedback from our customers. The most
important thing for me is to be grateful to any useful advice and experience.
Because the purchase itself does not stop communication! Some time later we ask
every customer if the item is handy. And we refine and improve it if it is
needed. In the end I highlighted the most successful models of purses. And I'm
glad to introduce them to you!</p>
<p>Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself:
if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?</p>

<p>All new moms have been there.  We receive all the nursery gears to make taking care of our new baby days easier. However, we can't deny that often times too much of the necessary can become an unnecessary burden. It's no different with the diaper bag. Most diaper bags lack in function, and needless to say, are bulky and contain large pockets to carry 'everything'.  Because so much space is available, most new moms tend to over pack the diaper bags for a quick outing and continue to do so although they usually use 10% or less of the items in the diaper bag during one outing.</p>
<p>That's where the mommy clutch comes in. Madisson Lily developed the mommy clutch with the new mommy in mind, in order to allow her to take a quick trip with confidence and with agility. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490930728/vxgx4klv5bcduwsc1jmo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Our mommy clutches are made with only the best fabric that gives room for elegance and function. A variety of styles and colors are available for individual preference.                                                       </p>
<p> </p>

<p>Did you know that thousands of new moms in USA will have only one-week of new clothes for their new born, while everything else such as diaper bags and strollers will be worn out hand-me-downs? Some moms even resort to utilizing older siblings' used backpacks as carry-on bags for their new babies. That's why Madisson Lily's goal is to give a mommy clutch to hospitals for new moms in need for every mommy clutch sold. Why 1:1, you ask? Why not sell 5 and give 1? At Madisson Lily we hold new moms, especially those who have a baby in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), very close to our hearts, as we have personal experience with this situation and understand the pain a lot of new moms have to overcome.  </p>

<p>At Madisson Lily, we embrace every mom from every nation.

</div></div>","All new moms have been there.  We receive all the nursery gears to make taking care of our new baby days easier. However, we can't deny that often times too much of the necessary can become an unnecessary burden. It's no different with the diaper bag. Most diaper bags lack in function, and needless to say, are bulky and contain large pockets to carry 'everything'.  Because so much space is available, most new moms tend to over pack the diaper bags for a quick outing and continue to do so although they usually use 10% or less of the items in the diaper bag during one outing.
That's where the mommy clutch comes in. Madisson Lily developed the mommy clutch with the new mommy in mind, in order to allow her to take a quick trip with confidence and with agility. 


Our mommy clutches are made with only the best fabric that gives room for elegance and function. A variety of styles and colors are available for individual preference.                                                       
 

Did you know that thousands of new moms in USA will have only one-week of new clothes for their new born, while everything else such as diaper bags and strollers will be worn out hand-me-downs? Some moms even resort to utilizing older siblings' used backpacks as carry-on bags for their new babies. That's why Madisson Lily's goal is to give a mommy clutch to hospitals for new moms in need for every mommy clutch sold. Why 1:1, you ask? Why not sell 5 and give 1? At Madisson Lily we hold new moms, especially those who have a baby in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), very close to our hearts, as we have personal experience with this situation and understand the pain a lot of new moms have to overcome.  




 

 

Please help us reach our goal so we can make more of our mommy clutches available to more moms and to a population in need.




At Madisson Lily, we embrace every mom from every nation. We love the American mom, the Norwegian mom, the Indian mom, the Nigerian mom, the Australian mom, the Brazilian mom, and all of the other moms. That's why our additional goal is to feature a culture-rich line highlighting cultural styles from each continent, using fabrics from the selected countries to design our cultural mommy clutches.
                                    

Your contribution will definitely support production in the United States. We are proud to say that we currently work only with manufacturers within the United States that share the same human right values we do. We are in dire need to manufacture more mommy clutches and raising capital with you will help us accomplish that goal.

<p><strong>THE STORY BEHIND THE BRAND</strong></p>
<p><i>Fashion design as an artistic medium</i></p>
<p>The brand <i>Henrica Langh </i>was born from a dual love of design and art, and a desire to create fashion with a heart. By combining fashion design with artistic expression, I create unique ready-to-wear statement pieces and art projects that inspire and support each other.</p>
<p>The ready-to-wear is created for the ""conscious femme fatale"" who values quality and cares about how and where her fashion is made. All ready-to-wear items are designed with respect to the world around us and sustainability is considered in every little detail, such as thread and buttons.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496911950/bzs0n9u1qwlkqqgwpcgb.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>

<p><strong>THE COLLECTION</strong></p>
<p><i>Mortal fashion</i></p>
<p>The <i>Memento Mori /Agliophobia r-t-w</i> collection was inspired by my graduate collection, which explores fashion as an artistic medium. The collection consists of two layers. The first layer symbolises our fragile inside; our deepest, most inner thoughts and feelings. The second layer represents our everyday armour; all the things we protect ourselves with.</p>
<p>The collection is designed to be mortal, meaning that once the garments eventually reach the end of their life cycle, they are easy to take apart to recycle or dispose of. All fabrics used in the collection are made from natural fibres and most of them are GOTS or OEKO-Tex certified. The fabrics are amazingly soft and were carefully chosen to feel good against your skin. All <i>Memento Mori </i>and <i>Agliophobia</i> items are manufactured by small Estonian companies in Tallinn, with high attention to detail and quality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496386241/nxe1godlmntybv7m0obj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This a collection of timeless classics with a twist, meant to become long-lasting love stories in your wardrobe. With sophisticated yet interesting design details, comfortable fabrics, and quality construction, these items were designed for longevity.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
<p><i>What is needed and what you get in return</i></p>
<p>€4500 is needed to cover the cost of manufacturing a small amount of Agliophobia items. This cost includes the making of final production samples and the manufacturing cost of 10 pieces of the following Agliophobia items: the button-up blouse, double-sleeved shirt, wide trousers, and the trench coat. The amount also includes all campaign-related costs and fees.</p>
<p>If the campaign is successful and we exceed the original funding amount, the rest of the contributions will be used to develop a Memento Mori T-shirt for all you conscious hommes out there.</p>
<p>You will receive the perk you choose from the selection of ready-to-wear pieces and limited-edition items. There are both small and large investments to fit different types of taste and budget. The shipping is included and all clothes will be shipped with a tracked courier service.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Exchanging items</i></p>
<p>If you end up with an item that is not a good fit, you will be able to exchange it for another size. If we don’t have the right size in stock, we will work on making you a new one in the correct size as quickly as possible. However, please take your measurements very carefully to make sure you get a fit that is just right for you.

Our innovative design focuses on combining the NFC technology with hand-crafted wooden accessories. The combination of high quality wood and NFC Tags which do not require power, makes our yolks durable and long-lasting.",14.0,4,"1 Campaign

</div><p> </p></div>","The purpose of Design X Social Responsibility has always been about giving back to the community through garnering, raising & bringing forth talents, innovations and design creativities. In this particular project, with the help from PLAN International, a non-profit organization, and together with a group of young designers & underprivileged children, we are very proud to have created a collection of designer watches that is beautifully crafted with a meaningful philosophy. We have named our three watches Freedom, Pride, and Change respectively.The three patterns in the collection symbolize the desire for opportunity, dignity and transformation respectively. The highlight of the dial design is the one graphic that stands out in particular and differentiates itself from the others. This concept comes from the realization that we all need to have opportunities to be seen and heard. Inspired by French philosopher Henri Lefebvre who first introduced the concept of “Design Participation” in the 1970s. The idea is to involve both the professionals (designers) and the people (users) in the total design process. Such a concept is truly inspirational, and its evolved form – “working with the professionals and collaborating with the people in need” – has become the bedrock of our project. Leveraging our knowledge in design and business, together with you and our community, we would like to create awareness and garner support for the Design X Social Responsibility project.The goal is to build a platform connecting groups of professionals – predominantly designers from various businesses – and underprivileged individuals from a specific segment in the community. As a result, all parties involved in the project will benefit from the experiences & the rewards that lead to the establishment of an on-going self-sustainable program. Having said that, we have taken a quite different approach on design creativities in this project.
Watch Dial : Through interacting with a group of young designers & underprivileged individuals, we believe in each person potential to succeed. We wanted to reinforce our belief that each one of us is born with different gifts and talents. Inspired by the drawings from the children, the watercolor stroke treatment doesn’t only bring the watch to life – its varied forms done by hand have also made each dial one-of-a-kind.Watch Case : A sci-fi inspired round case was designed to complement the Cyan “secu-cell” button. It comes with a massive dome crystal lens that boldly shows off the graphic pattern, while paring with a lug-less design, the overall look and feel is clean & modern.Thanks to the thinness of the Swiss Ronda 762 Movement, together with our savoir faire in both watch making and design creative, the streamlined case’s rim and the under-cut layering design make the watch look thin & crisp with a solid feeling.Watch Strap : We have gone for a smooth natural leather strap with folded edge construction and to maintain the thinness of the case, a soft but stiff Italian cowhide leather was chosen to achieve a 2.5mm thickness. The strap also comes in different colors on both sides. Furthermore, the message pattern embossed on the strap echoes with the design of the watch dials, which helps to deliver the overall design identity.Beside delivering a clean & modern look and working along with the lug-less case and the Cyan “secu-cell” button, our hang-n-lock designed strap also meets the ergonomics of our wrist curvature and lets the watch sit on various wrist sizes comfortably.The production is licensed by the fashion brand “Cyan” (cyan-ide.com). 1. Collaborating with people in need :Our philosophy is to actively engage those with needs in our project. In this project, we got the idea from the drawings of the children in the activity we co-organized with Plan International. Each dial of our watches features a final touch – a hand-painted vibrant watercolor stroke that highlights the spirit of our design process.2. Differentiation from mainstream watch dial production process :We have adopted letterpress printing – an age-old artisan technique that reigns over respect in the realm of graphic design today. As this craft is much less commonly seen nowadays, the sense of nostalgia it engenders is one-of-a-kind, reflecting an irreplaceable past and at the same time, an iridescent future.Letterpress printing requires meticulous attention to detail; a subtle relief effect adds a unique touch to the graphic. Such craft is pure allurement, and our watch dials might very well be the one and only in the market that adopt letterpress printing as the production methodology. Using the supreme Crane's Lettra 100% pure cotton paper, the pigment shows off vividly and graciously.3. Unique user experience with the watch case :The “secu-cell” construction on the case back is an exceptional design of the Cyan watches. Not only does it serve as the opening for battery replacement; the way it sits in a shiny circle with slanted edge creates a harmony between the function and the aesthetics.  Pledge your support and truly enjoy the watch with its individuality, premium quality & the sense of fashion it carries.   In terms of packaging, we have gone for a clean and simple style. Each watch comes in a metal tin, which can be reused for storing your bits and bobs.  Upon conclusion of the Indiegogo campaign, we will send out surveys where you can indicate the details for shipping. We ship our product worldwide. Both the watch components & the complete watches have to pass a rigorous quality control procedure before assembly & shipping to the backers. 
At Design X Social Responsibility, we always have a heart for the young generation and believing in each person’s potential to succeed. Having the purpose to contribute back to the community through nurturing talents, we founded Design X Social Responsibility Project by end of 2015 with a goal to establish an on-going self-sustainable platform that brings forth more meaningful projects.
Our team comprises young professionals in design & business from various industries who share the same passion for making an impact through innovation, meaningful collaboration and self-sustainability.

Merchant on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, <b>Australia</b>. Throughout my
years of selling Himalayan salt it became very clear that there were no shakers
available on the market that adequately dispense Himalayan salt. This is due to unrefined
salts not having the addition of anti-caking agents such as sodium ferrocyanide
which prevent the salt crystals from clumping and forming salt cakes. With the growing exposure of <b>Himalayan Salt</b> worldwide there is now a market
for a specialised shaker which subsequently dispenses unrefined salt, pepper, herbs and
spices.</span><br/></p>

<p>Cubby Rebound Shakers are the only patent protected inner-funnel dispenser designed specifically for commercial use, to use with unrefined <b>salt, pepper, dried herbs and spices</b>.</p>
<p>Cubby Rebound Shakers work differently. They fill from the top, pouring your choice of condiment around a unique inner funnel. Then just shake up and down. The contents rebound off the top of the lid, and dispense through the funnel and out of the bottom of the shaker. Cubby shakers are easy to use, moisture proof and look classy on any table setting. <b>No more clogging, no tricky grinding mechanisms</b>.</p>

<p><b>Did
you know Salt and Water is a conductor of Electricity?</b></p>
<p>I love this information
from the Home Science Tool. - Inspired learning website:</p>
<p>Did you know that you can use
salt water to make a light bulb shine? It sounds crazy, but it's true! This is
because salt water is a good conductor of electricity.</p>
<p>Salt molecules are made of sodium ions and chlorine ions. (An<em>ion</em>is an atom that has an electrical
charge because it has either gained or lost an electron.) When you put salt in
water, the water molecules pull the sodium and chlorine ions apart so they are
floating freely. These ions are what carry electricity through water.</p>
<p>To prove it, try this simple experiment.</p>

</div></div>","My name is Sharyn Cook, for the past 11 years I have been a Himalayan Salt
Merchant on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, Australia. Throughout my
years of selling Himalayan salt it became very clear that there were no shakers
available on the market that adequately dispense Himalayan salt. This is due to unrefined
salts not having the addition of anti-caking agents such as sodium ferrocyanide
which prevent the salt crystals from clumping and forming salt cakes. With the growing exposure of Himalayan Salt worldwide there is now a market
for a specialised shaker which subsequently dispenses unrefined salt, pepper, herbs and
spices.






The designing is done, the Cubby Rebound Shaker moulds are made. I have the first shot of completed prototypes and have placed, and covered the cost of my first order of 10.000 Cubby Shakers so your orders are safe. We expect to commence dispatch of Ingiegogo orders in November 2016. My sales target through Indiegogo is $30,000 AUD.  With your backing through presales, the injection of money will allow me to order a second larger quantity of Cubby Rebound Shakers. to maintain a consistent flow of stock to supply growth in demand to Australia and Internationally.






Cubby Rebound Shakers are the only patent protected inner-funnel dispenser designed specifically for commercial use, to use with unrefined salt, pepper, dried herbs and spices.
Cubby Rebound Shakers work differently. They fill from the top, pouring your choice of condiment around a unique inner funnel. Then just shake up and down. The contents rebound off the top of the lid, and dispense through the funnel and out of the bottom of the shaker. Cubby shakers are easy to use, moisture proof and look classy on any table setting. No more clogging, no tricky grinding mechanisms.

  The real benefit for you is:
· They are easy to fill
· They have no challenging or expensive grinding mechanism
· There are no holes at the top, so no moisture can get in to clog up the flow.
· They sit flat on the table so no insects can crawl in. 
·  Most importantly, they are easy to use. Child and elderly friendly.

Cubby Shakers are Easy to Use



           



       



           

Cubby Rebound Shakers are made with BPA-Free Tritan™, engineered to be better. Better than glass. Better than stainless. Better than any other plastic. And Tritan doesn’t contain BPA, BPS or any other bisphenols. Products made with Tritan plastic are clear, durable, safe and stylish.

My intention behind the idea, and my invention, to make Cubby Shakers,
was to find a dispenser to put healthy unrefined salt on everybody’s dining
table. Whether it be at home, or at a restaurant. Cubby Rebound Shakers offer
that solution. NOW…my mission is to make them available to everyone and educate
people on the benefits of consuming a healthy unrefined salt with clean water.
It may be just a little salt shaker, but I  have a passion with a global vision to make Cubby Rebound Shakers available to everyone to fill with healthy,mineral rich, energetic, unrefined table salt.  
By eating Unrefined Salt your body absorbs pure unrefined minerals and sun energy, which is revitalising and energising to the body.





""With the help of Cubby Rebound Shakers, it is my mission to quite literally light up the world with Crystal Salt, one shake at a time.""

Did
you know Salt and Water is a conductor of Electricity?
I love this information
from the Home Science Tool. - Inspired learning website:
Did you know that you can use
salt water to make a light bulb shine? It sounds crazy, but it's true! This is
because salt water is a good conductor of electricity.
Salt molecules are made of sodium ions and chlorine ions. (Anionis an atom that has an electrical
charge because it has either gained or lost an electron.) When you put salt in
water, the water molecules pull the sodium and chlorine ions apart so they are
floating freely. These ions are what carry electricity through water.
To prove it, try this simple experiment.

You are what you eat! I promote eating Unrefined Salt and drinking clean Water every day to maintain good health and help your body heal.

I often wonder why companies are allowed to process salt to the point of toxic waste, and worse than that, Doctors tell us not to eat salt???If you're having a bad day and you're told to lighten up, go and drink salt & water. It literally does lighten you up! And now...back to Cubby Shakers.

When we leave on holiday and it’s time to prepare the suitcases, we would like to take all of our sandals with us, but in order to save space, we need to make a selection and leave some behind .  My dream was to design a pair of sandals that goes with all the outfits to resolve these type of problems.  One sandal but  infinitive models. After two years of hard work, my dream has become a reality: I designed CLOS! </p><p>The main goal, that we had from the beginning, was to create a product with the emphasis on both simplicity and rapidity.

When we leave on holiday and it’s time to prepare the suitcases, we would like to take all of our sandals with us, but in order to save space, we need to make a selection and leave some behind .  My dream was to design a pair of sandals that goes with all the outfits to resolve these type of problems.  One sandal but  infinitive models. After two years of hard work, my dream has become a reality: I designed CLOS! The main goal, that we had from the beginning, was to create a product with the emphasis on both simplicity and rapidity. The interchangeable magnetic accessories made this possible. In fact our magnetic hook system allows to go from one model to the other whenever you want and without losing time. By interchanging the accessories, the aesthetic of the sandal will  change completely, going from a casual model to a more elegant one.                So far, we have designed two models of sandals and around twenty accessories, but it's not enough. We want to create many more.                                                                      Now, we need your help to realise our ultimate goal and see CLOS on the feet of girls around the world.  We hope that you love CLOS as much as we do.Thanks so much, CLOS Team!                                                                                                  I wanted it to look like a normal sandal.

 Another important goal was to make sure that Clos looked like a classic sandal which we can use with or without accessories.You can choose between two types of sandals: The Artemis model that has a  more sportive look or Aphrodite, which is more elegant.   Here you can find all the accessories we have made until now.  Each of them has a different price but for our backers they cost the same!  Choose your favorites!The majority of the accessories can be used for both models.

The aim is to design unique prints that follow on from our last collection by bringing together bold colours and quirky illustrations of animals.Our collection will be a new selection of bold street style t-shirts, cushions and makeup bags as well as working with a local designer to release a unique limited edition knitwear range. FUNDINGOur goal of raising £5000 is specifically to help us with the manufacturing of the Autumn / Winter Collection. So far we have managed to fund the brand ourselves with no loans or grants. This has been a challenge and meant we have built ourselves up slowly using only the income we make to update our stock. We are motivated and believe in our venture so much we have put every penny into the business but to expand we require help to take us to the next level. We will use the money to produce a large amount of stock and branch out to other retailers, events and markets. This will also contribute to our studio and equipment fees. We will be able to release collaborations with other designers to produce limited edition products that you can have first choice at thanks to your contribution. Every pledge will take us a step closer to what we believe Studio Five can achieve and allow us to promote our ethical and sustainable message while keeping up with customer demand.   Find us on:https://www.studiofiveuk.comhttps://www.instagram.com/studio_five_uk/https://www.facebook.com/studiofiveuk/?ref=book...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Bone
Conduction + Open Ear = Healthy
+ Safe
Bone conduction headphones have many benefits. User can avoid hearing damage from prolong usage of the headphone as bone conduction bypasses the eardrum. Furthermore, with the open ear design, user can observe the surrounding while using the headphone.




Conventional headphones can easily reach >100dB
Continuous exposure to 100dB sound has negative impact on hearing (source: WHO)
Don't forget to protect your ears while listening to music!
(source: WHO)
Despite the benefits, bone conduction earphones have never been the mainstream headphone in the market. We found that bone conduction headphones today have similar problems:


          1. Compromised sound quality


          2. Expensive (~$90 to $280)
          3. Not suitable for noisy environment


          4. Awfully Uncomfortable



Our Promise:


Affordable + Healthy Listening Experience for the General Public


We strive to re-invent a listening gadget with great sound quality, minimalist design, while maintaining an affordable price loved by all!


Since the beginning of 2014, we have spent our best effort in improving, optimizing, and testing numerous prototypes.  


Through the months of hard work, our R&D team re-invented what we believe to be one of the most efficient transducers. More than 20 music experts have come together to iterate the best possible sound quality of a bone conduction headphone.  All these technologies are beautifully put together by our Red Dot Design Award winning designer to achieve the truly minimalist masterpiece we have today.

We are on verge of bringing a wonderful innovation to live, but without your help, there's a limit to we can do...




Y-BoneTouch: Design for You
1. Design for Comfort
Ergonomic design, highly elastic & slim headband, sunglasses ready contour.


Well balanced, no electronics at the back. Maximum comfort.





Easy access control, all buttons at front.





2. Design for Finesse


The decoration cover uses recyclable aluminum precisely machined to the highest dimensional accuracy, which is then
treated with micro-brushing, anti-corrosion coating and laser
engraving. This produces one of the finest craftsmanship you can find on any bone conduction headphones today.
          



3. Design for Sound


High Efficiency + Wide Bandwidth = Proprietary VibeDirect Transducer



Two modes of listening suitable for different environments.


Open ear: Full bass without sacrificing mid-high frequencies and clarity. Allow you to listen music
and make calls with awareness of surrounding, no matter where you are and what
you are doing, such as at home, in office, walking, jogging and cycling etc.



Close ear: further enhance bass performance, the thirst for bass. Allows you to listen to music and make calls with full
isolation of background noise, no matter where you are and what you are doing,
such as on the train, in the airplane, at the construction
site, traveling, motorcycling etc.

3. Design for Functionality



For music and phone calls with built-in microphone.


Bluetooth 4.0 seamless wireless connectivity with blue indicator. 


Up to 6 hours of play time when fully charged.

Convenient carrier case




Wired version also available (no battery required, sounds just as great!)

          


Wide Applications, Amazing Experience








Our Appeal & Offer
 




The development of the Y-BoneTouch is completed, and we have a fully working prototype waiting to go into production. Production and shipping of the first Y-BoneTouch is planned for Early Summer 2016.  Given the chance, and with encouragement from all our supporters, we will reach our funding goal quickly and perhaps be able to improve on this delivery date. 
There are several ways which you can help, and we are offering some really awesome perks for your participation in this project. When funding a perk you will be one of the first to have this ground-breaking product at a special price. Even if we don't reach our full goal, we will still produce the Y-BoneTouch and deliver them to backers.

  Risks & Challenges 
The product's comfort and functionality have already been widely tested, and feedback has been amazing in every sense. All the wonderful user experience feedback, great survey results, interest of stakeholders and already received public and private funding for R&D ensure that Y-BoneTouch production will continue and won't disappear after the Indiegogo funding campaign has ended.


There is the possibility that delivery  to our backers maybe delayed due to unforeseen issues with international shipping and logistics, such as any political or economic issues that may cause delay. 
Shipments may be subject to import duties and other local taxes.
Any changes that may occur will be fully communicated to all backers in a timely manner

I worked with Michael Kors personally for over six years and through that experience gained a wealth of insider knowledge. Michael was a wonderful mentor and I cherish the experience I gained with the company.My fashion design experience is vast and includes: 
Gathering concepts and inspiration
Directing print, fabric, and embroidery research
Designing seasonal prints, patterns, and corresponding colorways
Sourcing and developing unique embellishment materials and techniques
Engineering embroideries and prints around the body
Executing highly detailed technical packets for overseas factories
Overseeing foreign mills by issuing comments and approvals on colors and embellishments
Sketching by hand and digitally
Actualizing samples to the final runway show and then production
Fitting garments
Pricing and negotiating for strong margins
Building relationships with vendors domestically and overseas
Merchandising
Directing embellished garment care and repairs
I was recently laid off due to Covid-19’s devastating effect on the world of fashion and am using this opportunity to finally 'dive in’ (pun intended!) to my long-time dream - creating a luxury swimwear and lifestyle empire. Having had an insider's view of the effects of waste and the consequences of mass production on the environment, I am delighted to use my skills to create a luxury swimwear line that reflects the change consumers want to see. Through ISAMEL my goal is to create more jobs for other talented but otherwise unemployed persons in this current economy, especially creating new opportunities for women, minorities, and persons of color.The name ISAMEL is a wordplay and dedication to my beloved best friend Melissa who tragically passed away alongside her boyfriend Carl two years ago.Melissa inspired me and many others to always be your true self, love nature, go for your dreams, dance and sunbathe whenever you can, and embrace new experiences - especially travel!Your support of this campaign will go towards:
Purchasing of fabric
Development of custom embroideries
The first production run of swimwear inventory, which includes the international shipping cost and U.S. Customs duties and fees
Purchase of custom garment labels
Initial digital marketing campaigns
Photoshoot productions of the first collection drop which includes models, photographers, and retouching fees for our e-commerce website
The launch of our e-commerce website
Packaging supplies for shipping our products to customers (recycled boxes, labels, tissue paper, marketing materials, etc.)
Consulting fees for legal and tax experts
Overhead like office supplies, software, and platform fees

<p>My
name is Christopher Peter Van der Essen, a music producer, black light artist, and clothing designer. For the past few years I have set up the Peace Catcher,
a fluorescent art installation based on the weave of a dream catcher, where I used its webs to hold
folds in place on a shirt and use water based spray acrylic to paint clothing
while it was being worn.</p>
<p> As I travelled
from festival to festival all over the northeastern United States with the Peace Catcher, I have learned much and honed
my craft. Now it is the time for me to utilize my skills and pursue clothing
design full time as a business. With your help I can make this dream a reality.<br/>
<br/>
<span><span>I have a studio where I will be working, but we are in need
of getting blank shirts as well as paint in bulk to get this endeavor off the
ground. In order to maintain quality and provide consistency, we will need to
install the proper ventilation and build other equipment needed to produce the
clothing in mass quantities. This includes building a spray booth and creating custom
painting frames so multiple shirts can be painted at the same time. I also need
to construct the proper black light displays for my art, so the public can see
my work in normal as well as black light. With your help I will be able to provide
for my family, provide jobs as well as leave a legacy for my son.<br/>

</div></div>","My
name is Christopher Peter Van der Essen, a music producer, black light artist, and clothing designer. For the past few years I have set up the Peace Catcher,
a fluorescent art installation based on the weave of a dream catcher, where I used its webs to hold
folds in place on a shirt and use water based spray acrylic to paint clothing
while it was being worn.
 As I travelled
from festival to festival all over the northeastern United States with the Peace Catcher, I have learned much and honed
my craft. Now it is the time for me to utilize my skills and pursue clothing
design full time as a business. With your help I can make this dream a reality.

I have a studio where I will be working, but we are in need
of getting blank shirts as well as paint in bulk to get this endeavor off the
ground. In order to maintain quality and provide consistency, we will need to
install the proper ventilation and build other equipment needed to produce the
clothing in mass quantities. This includes building a spray booth and creating custom
painting frames so multiple shirts can be painted at the same time. I also need
to construct the proper black light displays for my art, so the public can see
my work in normal as well as black light. With your help I will be able to provide
for my family, provide jobs as well as leave a legacy for my son.
As a personal thank you for everyone that contributes to my
campaign, you will receive:

<p>After completing university and entering the workforce, we  are now ready to bring Tianblue back, and we need your help! We are aiming to  re-launch Tianblue with a fully operational online boutique style website in October 2015 offering polo shirts and T shirts to begin with. Our goal is to raise US$25,000 to help fund our 2015 Autumn Range  of Polo Shirts that will include women's, men's and children's shirts in a  variety of different colours and designs. We will then expand the range to  Rugby Shirts in January 2016 (we’ve got some awesome designs ready and  waiting) before launching Tianblue Hoodies and Jeans with our full 2016 Spring Collection.  </p>
<p>What happens if our goal is not reached? That won't stop us!  Not for one second. Tianblue is a brand we hold close to our hearts and we will  continue to strive to reach our goal. Whatever money is raised through this  campaign (even if it falls under our target of US$25,000.00) will go towards  our efforts to re-establish Tianblue as a trusted fashion label (we’ll just  have to re-work some of our launch numbers) And all contributors will of course  still receive their Tianblue shirts :) <br/></p>

Both the girls now live in China (Alice in  Beijing and Louisa in Shanghai), and the Chinese language is something they  have both become quite passionate for.

Our goal is to raise US$25,000 to help fund our 2015 Autumn Range  of Polo Shirts that will include women's, men's and children's shirts in a  variety of different colours and designs. We will then expand the range to  Rugby Shirts in January 2016 (we’ve got some awesome designs ready and  waiting) before launching Tianblue Hoodies and Jeans with our full 2016 Spring Collection.  
What happens if our goal is not reached? That won't stop us!  Not for one second. Tianblue is a brand we hold close to our hearts and we will  continue to strive to reach our goal. Whatever money is raised through this  campaign (even if it falls under our target of US$25,000.00) will go towards  our efforts to re-establish Tianblue as a trusted fashion label (we’ll just  have to re-work some of our launch numbers) And all contributors will of course  still receive their Tianblue shirts :) 




 















 
We will be re-launching with 4 Ladies Polo Shirt's, 3 Men's Polo Shirt's and 4 Children's Polo Shirts. You can either view the full range by clicking on the link to our catalogue below, or view each design individually.

The Tianblue logo was designed around the Chinese character  'Tian', meaning sky. The two polo playing girls represent twin sisters Alice  and Louisa playing polo. This polo girl has been a central design in many of  the shirt designs, and has become a symbol in which many female polo players  have come to love and relate to. Both the girls now live in China (Alice in  Beijing and Louisa in Shanghai), and the Chinese language is something they  have both become quite passionate for. A few of the very popular Tianblue shirt  designs are designed with a Chinese influence. One of the favorites is a shirt  with the popular polo quote 'King of Games' written in Chinese. You can see one  of these designs in the picture below.








 





         




Tianblue prides itself on designing and manufacturing not  just apparel of the highest quality and best fits, but also vibrant and fun  designs. 
In addition to polo shirts, Tianblue will also produce a wide range of  other clothing items and accessories including hoodies, vests, jeans, caps, and  much more. 















And of course many more polo shirt designs ... ;) 



 







 



We know some of you out there may want to support the  Tianblue brand but are unable to support financially at this time. That’s ok,  we’re happy for all the support we can get be it financial or not. If you want  to help in other ways, the best way would be to share this campaign with all of  your contacts in an effort to help us secure more contributors and get us  closer to our goal. You can do so by sharing this link: http://www.indiegogo.com/project/preview/659bcfdd

</p><p>Over the past three years, the Senegalese ready-to-wear brand, Bélya, has grown from a small, home-based business to an internationally-recognized brand, known for its high-quality, hand-made products using West African textiles and leather. With a successful online e-shop and a Dakar-based boutique, the brand has reached a critical point. Bélya seeks to adapt its business model by engaging with women in rural areas in the production of its fabric. We hope to build a workspace in the village of Lompoul in Northern Senegal, where we will train and employ at least twenty local women to dye and sew fabric, while earning fair wages to support their families and communities. Additionally, this workspace will double as a classroom where employees will learn how to read and write as part of our literacy initiative. At Bélya, we strongly believe that Africa's development depends on the full and fair economic inclusion of women. Your support will enable us to make a positive contribution towards this goal in Senegal.</p><p></p><div>

</div>
<p>
</p><p>With
this Indiegogo campaign, we plan to raise the money necessary to: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>hire
	workers to build the workshop; 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>hire
	instructors to conduct continuous professional skills training in
	fabric dying and sewing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pay
	the salaries of the workshop staff;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>purchase
	sewing machines, workstations, dyes, stamps, wax, cotton fabric, and
	other materials; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pay
	for operational costs including transport between Dakar and Lompoul.</p>
</li>
<li><p> pay literacy teacher<br/></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p>In
order for our local workshop model to become fully functional and
self-sustaining, we will need around $50,000.  The $20,000 for which
we are asking  through the current campaign will lay the foundations
for the future growth of Bélya .  The remaining $30,000 will be
raised through sales and offline fundraising events. Within the next
year, we hope to be in the position to expand our production
activities to other villages outside of Lompoul.  
</p><p></p><p><b>Impact</b></p><p>Women living in Lompoul and throughout rural Senegal face compounding challenges that make their daily lives difficult and limit their personal aspirations. Young girls are typically not encouraged to think for themselves or to gain skills they could use to build brighter futures for themselves and their families. Rather, they are taught that their role in the community is limited to being a good wife and completing domestic duties. Bélya hopes that by establishing a safe and dynamic workspace where women will gain skills and confidence, girls and women will realize that they are able to fill many different roles in their communities, and people will see that investing in women is worthwhile. This includes language instruction for women, most of whom are illiterate. Furthermore, Northern Senegal is part of the Sahel region, a semi-arid band south of the Sahara Desert that suffers from chronic food insecurity as a result of climate change. Teaching a trade to community members improves their resilience against these hardships.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1318016/files/20150323071459-IMG_2528.JPG?1427120099"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>
</p><p>In
rural West Africa, businesses and NGOs too often misinterpret the
needs of the people they are trying to support.  When projects are
not in line with community goals and aspirations, they are highly
unlikely to be sustainable in the long run. Communities come to
distrust outside actors who implement projects in their villages and
fail to follow-up once they have left.  We expect that building
community trust will be an important challenge for us to overcome. 
For this reason, Bélya's founder has selected Lompoul, a village in which she has strong familial ties, to pilot the first of many
workshops.  Bélya has already done the groundwork of meeting with
key community members in Lompoul and of identifying women eager to
participate in this initiative.  Since Lompoul is only a 4-hour drive
from Dakar, the Bélya team will able to keep in close contact with
those operating the workshop on a daily basis.  This proximity will
also enable those in Lompoul to participate in the creative evolution
of Bélya.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>100%
of Bélya's products are hand-made.  Already, this requires a
significant commitment of time and resources.  With the opening of
its Lompoul workspace, Bélya is now shifting from its previous
model, which included exlusively buying ready-made textiles, to
overseeing the production of its own fabrics.  Such a transition will
slow down textile production, especially in the earlier stages of the
workshop.  This is another reason why Bélya stresses the importance
of long-term investment in communities. Through continuous training,
the women working for Bélya in Lompoul will become more
knowledgeable and efficient.  Trainings on sewing will be led by
Bélya's primary tailor, a trusted professional with much experience
training people new to the field.

</p><p></p><p></p></div>","Over the past three years, the Senegalese ready-to-wear brand, Bélya, has grown from a small, home-based business to an internationally-recognized brand, known for its high-quality, hand-made products using West African textiles and leather. With a successful online e-shop and a Dakar-based boutique, the brand has reached a critical point. Bélya seeks to adapt its business model by engaging with women in rural areas in the production of its fabric. We hope to build a workspace in the village of Lompoul in Northern Senegal, where we will train and employ at least twenty local women to dye and sew fabric, while earning fair wages to support their families and communities. Additionally, this workspace will double as a classroom where employees will learn how to read and write as part of our literacy initiative. At Bélya, we strongly believe that Africa's development depends on the full and fair economic inclusion of women. Your support will enable us to make a positive contribution towards this goal in Senegal.
Needs


With
this Indiegogo campaign, we plan to raise the money necessary to: 



hire
	workers to build the workshop; 
	


hire
	instructors to conduct continuous professional skills training in
	fabric dying and sewing;


pay
	the salaries of the workshop staff;


purchase
	sewing machines, workstations, dyes, stamps, wax, cotton fabric, and
	other materials; and


pay
	for operational costs including transport between Dakar and Lompoul.

 pay literacy teacher


In
order for our local workshop model to become fully functional and
self-sustaining, we will need around $50,000.  The $20,000 for which
we are asking  through the current campaign will lay the foundations
for the future growth of Bélya .  The remaining $30,000 will be
raised through sales and offline fundraising events. Within the next
year, we hope to be in the position to expand our production
activities to other villages outside of Lompoul.  
ImpactWomen living in Lompoul and throughout rural Senegal face compounding challenges that make their daily lives difficult and limit their personal aspirations. Young girls are typically not encouraged to think for themselves or to gain skills they could use to build brighter futures for themselves and their families. Rather, they are taught that their role in the community is limited to being a good wife and completing domestic duties. Bélya hopes that by establishing a safe and dynamic workspace where women will gain skills and confidence, girls and women will realize that they are able to fill many different roles in their communities, and people will see that investing in women is worthwhile. This includes language instruction for women, most of whom are illiterate. Furthermore, Northern Senegal is part of the Sahel region, a semi-arid band south of the Sahara Desert that suffers from chronic food insecurity as a result of climate change. Teaching a trade to community members improves their resilience against these hardships.

All of those who donate at
least $10 will have their names engraved on the first wall
constructed of our Lompoul workshop. To thank you for your financial contributions, Bélya will offer  and send you any of the following items from its newest collection that match the amount you donated. Feel free to claim the item of your choice.

</div></div>","What is the SnapDrive?The SnapDrive is a modular distortion/overdrive/fuzz pedal which allows you to design effects in minutes, using modules that can be swapped out and arranged in any order, each one with it's own function and flavor. Using this concept, you can mix and match different modules and achieve a fully custom setup & a tone all your own!What makes it different?The SnapDrive is cost effective and easy to use. You don't need to be an engineer to start tinkering and creating. Within minutes, you can dial in the tone you've always wanted.Open Source?SnapDrive is built around an open source concept. We plan on allowing other manufacturers to design & offer their own modules, allowing consumers to get exactly what they envision, block by block. Want an EQ model from your favorite company and an Overdrive module from us? The SnapDrive brings this to reality!Features
Analog Sound
SnapDrive is a fully analog effects system. Its modules are based on popular, vintage stompboxes.
Easy to Use
SnapDrive blocks can be easily removed and placed in different positions and combinations by the use of specially-designed magnetic connectors.

Cost Effective
By what you need and want!

Robust Enough for Live Performance
SnapDrive is constructed out of solid sheet metal, and it's as durable as any stompboxes out there, even for live performance!



Studio QualitySnapDrive offers many routing options, and with the help of gold-plated, specially-designed pogo pin connectors, your sound is transferred without any signal loss or quality degradation. This makes the SnapDrive on par with any boutique pedal!
Ability to Incorporate Other Effects/Stompboxes
Don't leave your favorite pedals behind! SnapDrive offers a high quality loop that can be placed anywhere in the circuit. Connecting your pedals to the loop gives you the ability to tinker with them by adding different blocks in different positions in the signal chain.



True Bypass
SnapDrive offers true bypass! Each module has a circuit which prevents signal degradation.
Expandable
Not only will we be offering new modules in the future, but with the use of our open source philosophy, you'll be able to purchase modules from your favorite manufacturers!
Block Compatibility on Future Platforms
Future products, like SnapRack and SnapCombo, will support all pre-existing modules.
9-volt Output Supply
SnapDrive has a highly-filtrated 9V output power supply that can be used to power your external stompboxes.
Modules Sold Separately According to Needs
You can buy as many modules as you want separately!Featured onHow You Can HelpThe SnapDrive is at the proof-of-concept phase right now. We have to make a pre-production prototype before kickstarting the product. This initial funding will help us build a polished prototype, which will then get us to the next stage of production and so we can get the SnapDrive out to market.



The Money

The estimated cost of 3 prototypes is $6,000 USD, which includes the design and production of the enclosure and coverage of the MOQ, or minimum order quantity, for some of the parts (connectors and potentiometers).


Spread the Word

Along with contributing, letting people know about the SnapDrive goes a long way. It costs nothing to share this campaign on social networks, and we'd really appreciate the help!


Our Approach: Crowdsourcing

We want to make sure people are happy with the design of our product. Send us your thoughts and ideas, and let's build the SnapDrive you want.

The Team
We are enthusiasts that started this project with almost no budget. However, we are professionals. We have completed many R&D projects and have prepared production for other companies we have worked for. We also have a passion for music. Combining these traits, we strive to bring about innovation and a world of musical possibilities with the SnapDrive.




What you get



The T-Shirt







The Picks





Questions and answers
Why do you
offer t-shirts and picks instead of the SnapDrive?

SnapDrive is at proof-of-concept stage. We have to do a lot of work on
design and tuning before going to production. So we need to build decent
prototypes which are hard to finance in this early stage without venture
capital. We decided to raise money to finance this early stage by offering T-shirt and guitar picks as a thank you for helping us bring the SnapDrive to market.
When do you
plan to complete the project?
This is a tough question. Prototyping is not fast and neither is the production. We also can't give a 100% guarantee that there won't be any hiccups, and from our experience, there usually are. If we meet our campaign goal, we plan to have working prototypes in June and be ready for production in September, provided there are no major setbacks. We're aiming to have the product ready by December 2015.
What does
the SnapDrive include?
Actually, we're still working on that. There are new ideas coming in everyday, but we have 10-15 basic modules designed. The starter kit will include a
mainboard which will support 6 modules and a set of 12 modules or so. This will allow the user to have access to a massive variety of combinations and sounds.
Can I buy
modules separately?
Of course! You can buy as many as you want.
Do you plan

Yes. This is the basic concept of the SnapDrive. There will also be variations of the platform with more block support and 2- or 3-channel switching. We are also developing ideas such as SnapAmp and SnapCombo.
Can I reuse
my modules on future SnapDrive platforms?
We will do our best to offer backward compatibility.
Is there
something that can help you produce the SnapDrive faster?
Yes. There are 3
things: Money, money & more money. Having enough financial support will allow us to focus solely on the SnapDrive project. The goal of the campaign is $6k, but if it
raises $20k or more, it will be a complete game changer.

The fashion industry is very competitive, this is a challenge within itself that we are willing to take on. We believe our new clothing line will stand out among  competitors, giving consumers great quality and unique styles that are affordable.    Other Ways You Can Help

<p>The Pepper Jacques Stella IIII Sunglasses, started as a random design, on a sketch depicting a swimsuit.  Drawing oversized accessories as a design element always occurs naturally for us.  It’s usually the first design feature that comes to mind, when creating clothing designs. 
One day while discussing the details on the L’WREN swimsuit sketch, the
discussion resurfaced on how fabulous the sunglasses were.  We decided to find a way to bring them to life.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p>

<p>Pepper
Jacques’ goal with our clothing
has always been to use the best materials and techniques to create an
effortless merger of art and function. 
So our team set out to create our Stella IIII Sunglasses
with the same level of refinement.  We
started researching the elements that made a pair of sunglasses the most
effective and introduced those elements into the design.  Next, we sought out the highest quality
materials with a focus on utilizing renewable elements.  Finally, we pursued the world’s best
craftsmen to take the sunglasses off the page. In the end our team produced the
Stella IIII Sunglasses, a merger of sophistication with the best in optical
technology.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>The
Stella IIII Sunglasses are available in four colors: Smoke Midnight,
Dawn, Grey Skye and Pink Horizon.  We are
especially proud of Pink Horizon because 100% of the proceeds from the sale of
these sunglasses
will
go toward helping
breast cancer patients
and
survivors.  This
was especially important to us as we watched our mother fight breast cancer.
We knew
that we had a responsibility to help the fight towards eradicating cancer.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Developing
our sunglasses has been an incredible journey and now we are ready for the next
step, which is to bring the Stella IIII Sunglasses to you.  In order to cover the up front production
cost, we will need your help.</p>

</div></div>","Stella IIII Sunglasses Story
The Pepper Jacques Stella IIII Sunglasses, started as a random design, on a sketch depicting a swimsuit.  Drawing oversized accessories as a design element always occurs naturally for us.  It’s usually the first design feature that comes to mind, when creating clothing designs. 
One day while discussing the details on the L’WREN swimsuit sketch, the
discussion resurfaced on how fabulous the sunglasses were.  We decided to find a way to bring them to life. 





Pepper
Jacques’ goal with our clothing
has always been to use the best materials and techniques to create an
effortless merger of art and function. 
So our team set out to create our Stella IIII Sunglasses
with the same level of refinement.  We
started researching the elements that made a pair of sunglasses the most
effective and introduced those elements into the design.  Next, we sought out the highest quality
materials with a focus on utilizing renewable elements.  Finally, we pursued the world’s best
craftsmen to take the sunglasses off the page. In the end our team produced the
Stella IIII Sunglasses, a merger of sophistication with the best in optical
technology.  

The
Stella IIII Sunglasses are available in four colors: Smoke Midnight,
Dawn, Grey Skye and Pink Horizon.  We are
especially proud of Pink Horizon because 100% of the proceeds from the sale of
these sunglasses
will
go toward helping
breast cancer patients
and
survivors.  This
was especially important to us as we watched our mother fight breast cancer.
We knew
that we had a responsibility to help the fight towards eradicating cancer.



Developing
our sunglasses has been an incredible journey and now we are ready for the next
step, which is to bring the Stella IIII Sunglasses to you.  In order to cover the up front production
cost, we will need your help.

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Subtle Eccentricity was birthed in 2013 as I transitioned my jewelry-making from a hobby into a business. In a world of flashing lights and ""bigger is better"" ideals, Subtle Eccentricity is all about understated designs. My statement pieces aren't necessarily big and bold, but they carry meaning. In the midst of truly modest origins, each piece is carefully <span style=""background-color: initial;"">handcrafted...usually as I lie on the floor of my</span><strike style=""background-color: initial;""> bedroom </strike><span style=""background-color: initial;""> Dallas studio.</span></p>
<h4>Relaunch</h4>
<p>After doing some research, finding my niche, and hearing from God (as well as family, friend and some of the fellas), I'm ready to take things to the next level! Subtle Eccentricity is expanding and will relaunch in the fall of 2015. This project will include:</p>

</div></div>","My Story
Background
Subtle Eccentricity was birthed in 2013 as I transitioned my jewelry-making from a hobby into a business. In a world of flashing lights and ""bigger is better"" ideals, Subtle Eccentricity is all about understated designs. My statement pieces aren't necessarily big and bold, but they carry meaning. In the midst of truly modest origins, each piece is carefully handcrafted...usually as I lie on the floor of my bedroom  Dallas studio.
Relaunch
After doing some research, finding my niche, and hearing from God (as well as family, friend and some of the fellas), I'm ready to take things to the next level! Subtle Eccentricity is expanding and will relaunch in the fall of 2015. This project will include:


Expanded, cohesive product lines,
A complete accessories collection for the gentleman, 
A complete collection of Biblically-inspired products, and

A collection inspired by my journey through a personal illness and created from donated jewelry. (As Subtle Eccentricity is dedicated to giving back, the proceeds from this particular collection will be donated to local non-profit organizations. Learn more here.)


  What I Need & What You Get

Here's where YOU come in. So far, I have been able to fund all Subtle Eccentricity functions, but with adding more products and projects, I need your help! Through this campaign I am hoping to raise $3,000 for:




Part-time personnel: because teamwork makes the dream work!


Production costs & equipment: more products = more materials


Marketing costs: promotional tools & maintenance


The work has already begun to make Subtle Eccentricity's expansion happen. Your contribution will serve as a springboard to ensure the success of this project.

Now, to the good stuff! Here's what's in it for you: In exchange for your contribution, you will receive a handcrafted Subtle Eccentricity item from the Fall 2015 campaign prior to its debut. Based on your donation, you will receive one of the corresponding perks listed below.

Start your very own Subtle Eccentricity collection! Choose from any of the $10-$75 perks (up to $100).
What If I Don't Reach the Goal?
I have faith in you and in this project, so I don't see this happening. However, in the event that the goal is not reached, any funds raised will still go towards the expansion plan, which will be scaled accordingly.
What If The Goal is Exceeded?
That would blow my mind! I have a stretch goal of $5000, as I am interested in leasing studio space. Any additional funds will go towards space, as well as the overall enhancement of products and the customer experience.
    The Impact

""People don't buy what you do. They buy why you do it."" -Simon Senek

 As stated in the video and on the SE blog, Subtle Eccentricity is much bigger than jewelry. It's all about having a Kingdom mindset and making a social impact. The modus operandi for this just so happens to be handcrafted accessories.
The mission of Subtle Eccentricity is to:



Share and exemplify Jesus,


Provide quality products and a captivating customer experience, and


Give, serve, and foster positive social influence.


With your help, Subtle Eccentricity's mission will be furthered and more lives will be impacted!

<p>In the spring of last year our team conducted a survey on the side effects of wearing closed-toe shoes for an extended period of time. The results were inspiring and became the starting point of our current project. Participants unanimously pointed out that, despite the various attempts of shoe manufacturers, no one actually succeeded in recreating the fresh feeling of being barefoot.</p>
<p>We believe that we are the first to overcome this obstacle. uGALE is a high-tech insole, which we have designed to address this kind of problem.</p>
<p>Our initial brainstorming lead to a few ideas. The first one included the use of an external fan; unfortunately we soon came across some problems, such as strong vibrations, noises, high power consumption and inefficiency.</p>
<p>Thus, we tried our next option, which was implementing an air pump into the heels of shoes. The air flow would be created simply by walking around, but this also meant that the air flow would stop from the moment we stood still or sat down.</p>
<p>Though these experiments were unsuccessful they inspired us to create something completely new, while using the latest technology: in October 2014 began the construction and testing of the uGALE prototype. And now, we are pleased to announce a fully working product.</p>

<p><b>As we all know, it's easier and much cheaper to prevent a disease than threating it!</b></p>
<p>Shoes are one of the main reasons why people suffer from fungal and bacterial foot conditions. When sweat from your feet evaporates, it takes away the heat, while cooling down the feet. But this is impossible when you are wearing closed-in shoes. Wearing shoes prevents natural perspiration, which causes overheating of the feet and high humidity of the skin.</p>
<p>A warm and moist skin becomes a breeding ground for fungal skin infections, which causes deseases such as mycosis, athlete’s foot, dermatophytosis, plantar wart or intertrigo. At the same time warm and moist skin also promotes the growth of bacteria that produce an unpleasant odor.  </p>

</div></div>","uGALE is an unique app-controlled insole designed to keep your feet cool, ventilated and odor-free. It can warm up your feet too.
Are you suffering from warm and sweaty feet? Cheesy foot odour? Or having icy toes? uGALE-insole is your remedy! 





As featured on:




Imagine how great it would be if you could wear your favorite shoes at any time of the year without having to worry about  warm, cold or smelly and sweaty feet..


During summers or (sport)activities they would keep your feet cool, fresh and dry. 



The same shoes would keep your feet warm and comfortable in the cold outdoors. 


Or odor-free at any given occasions






Wouldn't  it be a nice pair of shoes? With uGALE it now has become a reality!







In the spring of last year our team conducted a survey on the side effects of wearing closed-toe shoes for an extended period of time. The results were inspiring and became the starting point of our current project. Participants unanimously pointed out that, despite the various attempts of shoe manufacturers, no one actually succeeded in recreating the fresh feeling of being barefoot.
We believe that we are the first to overcome this obstacle. uGALE is a high-tech insole, which we have designed to address this kind of problem.
Our initial brainstorming lead to a few ideas. The first one included the use of an external fan; unfortunately we soon came across some problems, such as strong vibrations, noises, high power consumption and inefficiency.
Thus, we tried our next option, which was implementing an air pump into the heels of shoes. The air flow would be created simply by walking around, but this also meant that the air flow would stop from the moment we stood still or sat down.
Though these experiments were unsuccessful they inspired us to create something completely new, while using the latest technology: in October 2014 began the construction and testing of the uGALE prototype. And now, we are pleased to announce a fully working product.
The combination of power and freshness of a gale (very strong wind) with compact, easy fit insoles - uGALE!









""What's that cheesy smell?!""


As we all know, it's easier and much cheaper to prevent a disease than threating it!
Shoes are one of the main reasons why people suffer from fungal and bacterial foot conditions. When sweat from your feet evaporates, it takes away the heat, while cooling down the feet. But this is impossible when you are wearing closed-in shoes. Wearing shoes prevents natural perspiration, which causes overheating of the feet and high humidity of the skin.
A warm and moist skin becomes a breeding ground for fungal skin infections, which causes deseases such as mycosis, athlete’s foot, dermatophytosis, plantar wart or intertrigo. At the same time warm and moist skin also promotes the growth of bacteria that produce an unpleasant odor.  
Using uGALE you can fundamentally eliminate the root cause of all ills - the lack of air circulation inside your shoes.




Ventilation
The main part of uGALE is the ductwork which distributes the injected air by micro a compressor to the most inaccessible areas of the foot. The size and shape of the duct is designed in such a manner that it evenly covers the entire sweaty area.




Heating
By connecting uGALE insoles with the dedicated app, you can warm up the insoles up to 40°C - 104°F separately. The temperature is adjustable to your own preferences.


Wearing comfort
The underlying principle of the design of uGALE is the unpretentiousness for everyday use. By using the finest materials we made the insoles light and comfortable to wear. We took into account all physiological characteristics of the feet in the development, making uGale comfortable and safe to wear:




 Wireless charging
Further we added wireless charging station by default, giving uGALE owners additional using convenience. We used inductive charging technology and increased the transmitting distance up to 30mm to make uGALE hassle-free in daily life. Users dont need to take the insoles out of shoes anymore, just put the shoes on the charging station for instant charge.






iOS/Android app
Also has been fully thought of control system. It combines a full automatic operation or manual control via smartphone using bluetooth 4.0.








Step 1:                                                                                   
Once you’ve got your insoles download the uGALE control app on your smartphone. Switch the on/off button of the insole, launch the app and connect it with your smartphone by using bluetooth.
Step 3:
Put the uGALE insoles in your shoes
Step 2:
Adjust the temperature(heat) or the airflow rate to your desire.
Step 4:
Check and monitor your battery level on the uGALE app.

<p><i>Kids Prize Pack</i> is focused on helping children all over the country build a strong love and desire to read. Studies have shown that a large percentage of kids who claim to “Hate” reading say it is because they can’t find anything interesting to read. Our goal at <i>Kids Prize Pack</i> is to provide a Unique and Fun solution to this problem. </p>
<p>Every <i>Kids Prize Pack</i> will include an Age and Gender appropriate Book, Toys, Games, and an assortment of other items. We choose a New Theme each month and base all included items on it. Our thoughts are that if a child enjoys playing with the Amazing Toys and Games, than they will also want to read the Book on the same subject. This means your child will be reading more often and will quickly learn to love reading. </p>

</div>","Kids Prize Pack is focused on helping children all over the country build a strong love and desire to read. Studies have shown that a large percentage of kids who claim to “Hate” reading say it is because they can’t find anything interesting to read. Our goal at Kids Prize Pack is to provide a Unique and Fun solution to this problem. 
Every Kids Prize Pack will include an Age and Gender appropriate Book, Toys, Games, and an assortment of other items. We choose a New Theme each month and base all included items on it. Our thoughts are that if a child enjoys playing with the Amazing Toys and Games, than they will also want to read the Book on the same subject. This means your child will be reading more often and will quickly learn to love reading.

To launch our product, we need to design custom shipping boxes that will be able to hold all of the included items and feature our brand. This requires significant upfront investments to get everything designed, produced, and available for use.We will also use a portion of the Funding to acquire some great items from Non-Partner Companies. We are dedicated to providing the best and highest quality items and sometimes that means leaving our comfort zone to find them. As our Company grows so will the products we have in inventory. This means we will need additional team members to help source and ship all of our Kids Prize Packs.Finally we will need to get more Artwork and Professional Photography done to help us Advertise our products. We have an Amazing In House Artist but he needs food and tools to keep creating his Masterpieces.   Other Ways You Can Help Tell your Friends about US! Word of mouth is a powerful tool and can help us hit our Subscription Goals! Send E-Mails, Texts, Pick up the Phone, we even advocate Shouting it from the Rooftops!

Risks:
As a subscription box service our risks remain very Low. We have taken every precaution to ensure that we will be able to produce a high quality and long lasting service. Other than the unpredictable Random Acts of God we will be here for you come rain or shine.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Because the fast-paced rhythm of modern life conditions us! It so happens that, among thousand of things to do, slow down and enjoy our life, becomes a luxury. </p>
<p>Quotus is proud to bring that luxury back.</p>
<p>It can help you, discretely and constantly, to grab and keep noteworthy emotions, thoughts, ideas, events and people.</p>
<p>Rediscovering the ancient pleasure of writing by hand, the small space of a sheet becomes a place where we can express ourselves, find ourselves, feel emotions, leaving traces of what really counts.</p>

</div></div>","Who is Quotus?We are an independent label that produces handcrafted stationery. We were bored of seeing the shop shelves full of the same brands, products, colors and design, therefore we have decided to create by ourselves different products capable of satisfying tastes and needs of those who are looking for something new.We realize sketchbooks, notebooks and block-notes covered with genuine leather, made with fine laid paper and a wide range of themes and colors. Anyway, we are not here to talk about what we’ve done…We are here to talk about our latest creation, NovusBook.What is NovusBook? Our latest creation is a sketchbook that mixes genuine leather with the amazing technology of carbon fiber, the material of the future. The word Novus means New in latin, the language spoken in Ancient Rome by poets and emperors, which has influenced many European languages. It is a New notebook that has its roots in the past and wants to help us rediscover the pleasure of writing with our own hand, leaving for a while our digital lives, writing with our unique and inimitable calligraphy a simple sentence, a thought, an emotion.Suitable for all those people who want to stand out from the crowd, possessing something unique and special that reflect their personality.It is the perfect accessory for businessmen, for career women and for young novelty lovers who want to be one step ahead of their peers. An object that will not cut a poor figure next to our tablet or smartphone, and will remind us the importance of  writing, in our own hand, what really matters in our life.   We want to bring this project to your attention because no one ever realized nothing like this in the world of stationery, a particular field where innovation rarely finds space, since the materials and the techniques used, are always the same. We took a risk choosing carbon fiber, a material that is normally used for luxury cars, sport bicycles, planes or space missions, but that no one would think to use with an ancient and classical object made of paper and leather like a notebook. The challenge was right here, trying to combine two world so far apart, proving that it is possible to introduce new materials without losing elegance and class! To realize this goal, Quotus needs you too!!!How we create a NovusBook?NovusBook is an high-quality product, for those who want to stand out in a simple but refined way...... in every detail.This is why we pay attention to all the details during the production, from the selection of high-value materials to the manufacturing activities, in order to give you a 100% Made in Italy object which is:

Beautiful - NovusBook is a perfect balance between linearity and elegance, realized by Italian master artisans according to the inimitable Made in Italy style.


Strong – Great leather thickness, good grammage, perfect binding and the best quality of carbon fiber, guarantee solidity and durability to each product.


Handy – An essential and meticulous cutting, with the choice of smooth and uniform textured leather, emphasizes the natural qualities and simplicity of the product. This allows you to use it with ease in a several different situations, every day, both in free time and in formal occasions, where it will look really good near the common organizer of your boss!



To realize NovusBook we have choosen:
Only the best quality of genuine leather
Only 100 gr/m2 of ivory laid paper uncoated  
Only carbon fiber from certified companies with the necessary patents for its production and processing.
We want each NovusBook to be the result of a careful study and will be the best witness of the passion for our work.  The love, the care and the rigor used for creating NovusBook, are the same that we have used in the past in the realization of all our traditional creations: notebooks, sketchbooks and block-notes covered with genuine leather, to be chosen from dozen of colors and themes, in order to satisfy every taste. Come to discover all our collections on the website quotus.it, in the meantime, this short video will introduce you in our world, in which our artisans works every day with professionalism and passion.
Why Indiegogo? Because we firmly believe in this project and we made many sacrifices to realize it! Carbon small notebook are only the first step and we would like to expand our horizon increasing the carbon fiber collection. We believe that it will be possible to discover new solutions, using the skills and the experience of our artisans and thanks to the famous italian ability to find innovative solutions by reusing materials that had been never applied in a particular field. To make this possible, we need your help!Working the carbon fiber is very expensive  and we need  sophisticated machineries. We have invested a lot of our resources and energies for this first stage of research and experimentation, as well as the production of the first examples. In order to continue to produce NovusBook we should buy larger quantities of carbon fiber, appropriate machineries  and an advertisement that reaches the highest number of people, because we are sure that this product can please everyone, without differences.With this campaign, we are offering all the first samples of NovusBook at a special price, that we will not propose again in the future because of the high material and processing costs. This is a chance for you to help us and, at the same time, buy a new and innovative product that will certainly be more expensive.

Why Quotus has been created?

Because the fast-paced rhythm of modern life conditions us! It so happens that, among thousand of things to do, slow down and enjoy our life, becomes a luxury. 
Quotus is proud to bring that luxury back.
It can help you, discretely and constantly, to grab and keep noteworthy emotions, thoughts, ideas, events and people.
Rediscovering the ancient pleasure of writing by hand, the small space of a sheet becomes a place where we can express ourselves, find ourselves, feel emotions, leaving traces of what really counts.

<div>We have women of all sizes coming in our store every single day that are so tired of what the department stores are offering.

They also want beautiful, flattering dresses in styles that will not become obsolete in a year or two. We want to help!

<div>There are always challenges with any new endeavor, and clothing design and manufacturing are no different. We have done our homework and found a fantastic manufacturer and partner in design that works out of Texas, we flew to Los Angeles and found many beautiful high quality fabrics, and we have many fantastic designs. Now we need two more things:  time and money. Once we reach our funding goals the process is a bit long in approving samples and manufacturing. Because of this our timetable for fulfilling your pledges is open ended. We envision having several of our styles in by the end of the year. We have over 22 pieces designed and in the works. Getting all of them up and in the manufacturing process will take us into the middle of 2017. </div>

</div></div>","Adelaide Apparel 
Are you tired of not feeling comfortable in the clothing offered at your local department stores? Tired of dresses that hit mid-thigh,
too-low necklines and too-high slits? Do you wish you could find comfortable
yet stylish fashions that keep you and your lifestyle in mind? We do too!
We own a women’s modest clothing boutique in Logan, Utah, and a lack of
stylish yet beautiful, functional and modest clothing in the fashion world lead
us to the conclusion that we needed to design and manufacture our own clothing. That’s why
we are developing Adelaide Apparel.  We will
feature junior and women's clothing in sizes XS to 3XL (0 to 20) made from
comfortable yet durable fabrics in timeless and vintage inspired cuts to give you many years of
enjoyment. We have future plans to manufacture maternity/nursing and girls clothing sizes 8 to 14 as well.

<p>The greatest challenge I face, and the main reason for doing this Indiegogo Campaign, is to raise awareness and bring my dream to life.  Having a child with special needs has kept me from working a mainstream job.  I developed this idea so I would be able to work from home and support my children.  </p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>When do I get my PERK?</b>  Many campaigns make you wait months for your perk.  I will send your perk right after the campaign closes and your color choice is confirmed.  Sorry, but for obvious reasons custom perks will take a bit longer.  Those who back the project early in the campaign and indicate color preference and size will get their perk the fastest.</li>
<li>
<b>How do I choose a color and size?</b>  The current three color choices and a size chart for the four sizes are pictured.  There are instructions on how to measure your purse.  The most common sizes are Medium or Large.</li>
<li>
<b>How do I add multiple PERKS?</b> This can only be done one at a time. Therefore you add the first PERK go through all the steps of logging in and then go back to the campaigns main page select another PERK and check out again. You can do this as many times as necessary. </li>

You spend good money on your purses and bags. The last thing you need is to accidentally put it down in a sticky mess. Wrapurse™ solves the problem. An on-the-go, quick on, quick off, lightweight wrap for any size purse: Wrapurse covers small purses to diaper bags. 

According to statistics at Statista.com, in 2013, women in the US spent 8.7 Billion Dollars on handbags.  Many women resell their designer handbags and get a lot of money for them.  They could get even more if the the handbag looks new. 

The Story
 

I’m
a single mom of two very active and athletic boys.  I’ve sat on bleachers, benches and fields
cheering on my kids’ teams.  Many times
I’ve had to go to games with my purse.  I
won’t leave it in the car, but who wants to hold it in their lap the entire time?  So….. I eventually had to put it down.  Yuck!  

After ruining several expensive bags with mud,
rust and unknown sticky gooey stuff stuck to the bottom (not to mention all the
gross germs), I thought what can I do to protect the bottom of my favorite bags?  The solution is Wrapurse. 


Germs. Grime.  Rust.  Goo.  Things we all want to keep off the bottom of our purses and diaper bags. We all want to carry a purse that is clean and looks new, after all it's a fashion statement. 
And, I don't want to bring germs into my home.  Moms with diaper bags - you know what I'm talking about!  You go to change your baby at a public venue and 9 times out of 10 there is nowhere to put your diaper bag down except directly on a disgusting restroom floor!  Then you bring the bag home and put it on your  floor where your baby is crawling.  
Where do you put your purse down?  Doctors' office floors, shopping carts, bathrooms with no hooks, movie theaters, the list goes on and on.  Women put their purses down every day and the bottom of their bags do not just contain germs but are also getting ruined and detract from the look of the bag.

Charity Begins at Home
I'm a single mom and one of the reasons I created Wrapurse was so that I could stay home with my kids.  I have a son with special needs who has struggled for years.  Fortunately, he is doing much better now, but educationally, we still have a long road ahead ahead of us.  But then, I recently stumbled upon an organization called Understood.org.

This hit home with me - finally an online community I could use to help my son, Colton.  I wish I would have found it years ago!  It was at that point I decided 
to give back so that Understood could continue to help others.  I will be donating $1 for every bag sold in this campaign to Understood.org. 
At the end of the campaign, all the money collected for charity, will be given directly to the non-profit organization.



What I Need & What You Get 




With your help, I will be able to help establish a brand for Wrapurse as well as get them into major retailers. We have a strong following on Facebook but need to get the word out and the need established. It's a new product category, and it's taking more time and money to bring it to top of mind. 
If we surpass our funding, we could also offer additional color choices, patterns and sizes! Who knows?!

The greatest challenge I face, and the main reason for doing this Indiegogo Campaign, is to raise awareness and bring my dream to life.  Having a child with special needs has kept me from working a mainstream job.  I developed this idea so I would be able to work from home and support my children.  
FAQ





When do I get my PERK?  Many campaigns make you wait months for your perk.  I will send your perk right after the campaign closes and your color choice is confirmed.  Sorry, but for obvious reasons custom perks will take a bit longer.  Those who back the project early in the campaign and indicate color preference and size will get their perk the fastest.

How do I choose a color and size?  The current three color choices and a size chart for the four sizes are pictured.  There are instructions on how to measure your purse.  The most common sizes are Medium or Large.

How do I add multiple PERKS? This can only be done one at a time. Therefore you add the first PERK go through all the steps of logging in and then go back to the campaigns main page select another PERK and check out again. You can do this as many times as necessary. 

How can I upgrade my PERK after I already purchased one? Find the answer here.

<p>Hello World! My Name is Anthony ""Nathaniel"" Wilson, I'm 21 years old, and I am the Founder of Ori Huu, The world's First line of Healing Crystal/Mineral Infused Durags. Ori Huu is inspired by the Ifa &amp; Orisa spiritual system of the Yoruba peoples of Nigeria. In this spiritual tradition, the most essential aspect of one's being is their Ori which means head. According to Ifa Priest Solagbade Popoola,"" In simple Yoruba language, the word ""Ori,"" which has many meanings, means head. It also means the apex of all things, the highest of any endeavor. For instance, the head is the highest and most important in the human body. It houses the brain, which controls the whole body. The leader or boss in an organization is called the ""Olori,"" the head. The head is the topmost part of anything. There is nothing on Earth that does not have its own Ori. The roof is the Ori of a building; the leaves and branches form the Ori of a tree; the lid is the Ori of a container; the cork is the Ori of a bottle; and so on. The moment something has its own Ori, such a thing will assume its own identity. However, the concept of Ori to the Yoruba people goes beyond the ordinary meaning of the head as the apex or container that houses the brain. Ifa states that Ori is the symbol and extension of Olodumare(God) in every being. It is also regarded as ""Eledaa,"" the creator and comprises both dynamic and cosmic forces that determine the uniqueness of every individual. This means in essence that whatever a person becomes in life is attributed to her/his Ori."" It is so refreshing to know that Our very own head is the ultimate expression of The Supreme Being within us. Ori, which is your head, is a divinity all by itself. Ori Huu is here to honor the Divinity within You! Now, Huu is an onomatopoeia for big, huge, mighty, and Marvelous! So Ori Huu can be translated as Marvelous head/destiny/ life path/ deity. So, the message of Ori Huu is that you, your life, destiny, and Your Head is Marvelous (stop being Nasty!lol!) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                   How does this relate to Durags and Why?</p>
<p>African peoples have a long and documented history of wearing headwraps, Crowns, and jewels to adorn the head. Many times these Head accessories signified Social status, sensuality, Marriage, Queenship, Kingship, Ancestry, Protection, and Spiritual well-being. In the African Diaspora, this tradition still lives on, and one of the carriers of this tradition is the Durag. Though the Durag is mainly used for aesthetic purposes, it also is a signature of one's identity, mood, and self-care. Since The Durag goes on one's head(Ori), it is an optimal garment for healing and energetic transformation. Also, Ori Huu is dedicated to providing the most optimal experience for those that wear our Durags. Thus we only use the finest silks so that the basic need for the Durag is still met, while the crystals are for the inner head(Ori Inu). Ori Huu merges outer beauty with inner beauty.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                               Why Healing Crystals/Minerals in Durags?</p>
<p>Healing Crystals are a popular ""alternative"" healing modality amongst modern-day people. Most of us approach this healing modality through a Western ""New Age"" lens but fail to realize that Healing Crystals are an ancient healing method. Interestingly, in many ancient African cultures healing crystals were of great use, and many of the most popular healing crystals today can only be found in African countries. In totality, Healing crystals can help you to manage your emotions, ease internal and external tensions, find stability, attract abundance and prosperity, and much more! </p>
<p>I do want to make it clear that Healing Crystals are not a part of traditional Ifa&amp;Orisa spirituality. But, the Brand is inspired by the philosophy of Ifa, and we will be using chromotherapy to connect to spiritual energies through crystals. But, to honor traditional Isese, we will be creating different Durags using items used in traditional Orisa worship, such as a river rock-infused Durag for Osun, and a silver-infused Durag for Obatala, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                                       What We Need</p>
<p>We need to raise $15,000. $5,000 will be used to produce a professional High-Quality storytelling video where I will promote the fundraiser by sharing more information about the Durags and an ancient sacred story about Ori. $10,000 will be used to cover the cost of Marketing the fundraiser via a Fundraising agency. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                                           What do You get?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot offer physical perks at this time. However, Backers who donate $500+ will have the opportunity to join our Pilot Program, where they will be the first to receive a Healing Crystal/ Mineral infused Durag.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                           What If We Do Not Reach Our Goal?</p>
<p>In the Unfortunate Case that we do not reach our goal, funds will be used to produce any part of the fundraiser that we can. Whether it be a short 1-minute video and a limited marketing budget, we still will make it happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                                                     The Impact</p>
<p>First and Foremost, Ori Huu gives people of all backgrounds the opportunity to connect with the healing wisdom of Ancient African/ Indigenous wisdom without feeling like they have to convert to a new spiritual practice or a spiritual practice at all. Secondly, Ori Huu is what I like to call ""Spiritual Ingenuity"" because, in practice, it is modern, stylish, and cool. But, in ideation and origin, it uses ancient wisdom to help empower and nourish the lives and minds of everyday people. Lastly, the big picture behind Ori Huu is to control, change, and redefine the narrative around Black people and Headwear. Black people have been labeled as ""Ghetto"" and ""Criminal"" for wearing Durags, Headwraps, Bonnetts, Hats, and Hoodies, in public and this label has gotten many Black people murdered and arrested. So, Ori Huu intends to show the world that Durags and Headwear for many African descendants is a representation and affirmation of Beauty, sensuality, Divinity, Protection, and Status.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                            Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>With any new endeavor, there is always a host of Risks and challenges. The Main challenge for Ori Huu is its originality. Because Crystal Infused Durags are new, it will be challenging to get people to connect to the mission and philosophy of the Brand. But, I understand that this hurdle can be overcome through education on this particular modality, which we will offer via monthly workshops, and videos.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                       Other ways you can help.</p>
<p>Please share with your network and please feel free to contribute any ideas and feedback.</p>

<h3>Our Story &amp; Our Mission</h3>
<p>We are a team of volunteers that started <a href=""https://www.HopeOutfitters.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hope Outfitters</a> back in 2012. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538878021/ht12wcwol9dskluvgf5f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have poured everything into this company, not taking a penny of the profit along the way.  Since we started our clothing brand we have given back over $220,000 to the causes we have partnered with.  We started it because Jesus gave up everything to love us and we, in a small way, want to do the same.  So here's how it works: we design and sell apparel and give all of the profits away.  Every year we partner with a new charity, work to create awareness for it and donate 100% of the profits from the sale of our clothing back to its cause.  </p>
<p>It may seem small to buy a T-shirt, but it matters.  Mother Teresa said, ""...Do small things with great love.""   When all of us work together, our small acts can add up to make a big difference.  From the sale of our T-shirts we have healed the sick, sheltered the homeless, rescued girls out of human trafficking, provided clean water, granted money to adopting families, and so much more...all because of your purchases.  Together we are changing our world for Christ.  Together we are making a difference that will last for all eternity.</p>
<h3>Our Campaign (What We Need)</h3>
<p>We have exciting news to share--we have decided to open up a new store in downtown Spokane, WA at River Park Square Mall.  We know it's time to take that next big step of faith to expand our mission and message. </p>
<ul></ul>
<p>So here's where you come in!  God's been faithful to grow our company in the last 5 years, debt free!  Because He has used people like you to help us every step of the way.  When you invest in this project it will go toward three things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remodeling the existing store (see video for pictures).  This is a huge job: new electrical, drywall, paint, signage, and furniture; cost is $45,000 (We'll try to do as much of the work ourselves to keep the cost down as much as possible.)</li>
<li>Designing, developing and manufacturing our new fall clothing line to include tees, hats, dresses, and pants; cost is $55,000.</li>
<li>All new inventory to fill up the new shop; cost is $60,000.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Total Investment Needed: $150,000</strong></p>
<p>Here is a pic of the store that needs remodeling work:</p>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>We are so grateful for anything you can give, but every person who gives over $100 will receive a $40 gift card.  This will allow you to buy any sweatshirt, T-shirt, or hat of your choice.  (The gift card will be sent to your email by March 2019.)

<p><b>Initial goal</b>: </p>
<p>Our goal covers the production of 11 exclusive new designs (five peacock prints and six other patterns) in a new, high-quality poly-spandex fabric. </p>
<p>This allows us to offer</p>
<p></p>
<ul>

<p>These prints will be available in headbands (one size), baby sizes (newborn to 5T) kid sizes (4/5- 14/16), and adult sizes (XS-5X) in Capri, Ankle, and Mid Foot lengths. </p>
<p>What do you get out of this? A TON of perks! Not only will our perks be limited edition, but we've priced nearly everything BELOW our usual prices. We are also shipping all perks over $125 for free!</p>

<p>Essentially, this campaign is the same quality Lineagewear that you know and love - except it's new, the designs are exclusive, much of it is on sale, and since it's a pre-order, nothing is out of stock! What's not to love?</p>

<p>HOW TO ORDER: Simply select the perk you're interested in, and check out. You will receive a backers survey shortly after the end of the campaign (after May 8th) where you can indicate size, length, and print preferences. Yes, you can split a perk with a friend and order two different sizes! </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a low risk campaign! Lineagewear has been in business for two years now. We've run two successful pre-order sales last year- each raised close to 30k. We have an established supply chain and good working relationship with our printer and our factories. Running this sale as a crowdfunding campaign will help us better organize and manage logistics, as well as help us manage customer expectations.</p>
<p>Fabric printing is estimated to take 4 weeks, and manufacturing is estimated to take 4-8 weeks. Packing and shipping is estimated to take 1-2 weeks. </p>

<p></p>
<b>Stretch Goals</b>:</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p><b>$50k</b>: This project plus expanded inventory on other prints (no more waiting for restock!), and an expanded charity program. Each Peacock design will have a designated charity that a portion of proceeds benefits!</p>
<p><b>$70k</b>: This project plus expanded inventory, expanded charity program, plus development of new products (sizes up to 6x, more maternity, petite, sports bras, shorts, mens leggings and shorts, mat bag, jogger pants, that sort of thing).</p>

<h3>Our philosophy- Ethical, Sustainable, and Inclusive.</h3>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Ethical</b><br/></p>Our leggings are handmade in New York City's renowned Fashion District. The employees at our shops are paid a living wage, work realistic hours, and are given frequent breaks and holidays. We believe it is vital to build our products in a fair, sustainable way, never using child or slave labor. In order to ensure this, we build our products locally, where we can regularly tour production facilities. </div><div>This occasionally increases production time and cost, but we feel like it's worth it. </div><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458583905/pp9wqexybbrsltx4opgm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>We don't do seasons. We release new prints as we find/produce them. A beautiful, well made garment should be timeless, and we believe our designs are attractive enough to be worn -- and released -- all year round. Just because the calendar changes does not mean the value of our products do. </p>
<p>More importantly, seasons and micro-seasons are part of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_fashion"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fast fashion</a>, and often result in shoddy workmanship, low quality materials, questionable labor practices, and excessive waste. SO not our bag! </p>

<br/><p><b>Sustainable</b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Every step of the process is American made, with an emphasis on a small carbon footprint. Our shops are family owned and operated. Our tags, labels, and packaging are all sourced using American companies. Our mailers are made from 88% recycled materials, and are recyclable. Most of our tops are American Apparel. Our other tops, totes, accessories, and jewelry are created by partnering with independently owned American businesses.</p>Our leggings are printed on imported fabric using sublimination (heat-transfer) printing. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Sublimation Printing is a process in which designs are transferred from pre-printed paper onto fabric by contact heat, of which the dyes are absorbed by the fabric. It is great way to produce high-clarity, well-defined designs. </span>
</div><div>
<p>Sublimation printing has always been a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly process than dyeing fabrics. Whether it be single- or double-sided printing, sublimation uses less water and less energy to “color” the fabric, without emitting hazardous gases.</p>

We believe in vibrant, colorful activewear that is also ethical, sustainable, and inclusive.
Lineagewear's unique fit was developed using concepts learned in Broadway costuming. Features include a flat front, elastic-free, high waistband, and unique seams contoured to hug a woman's curves. Our reviews speak for themselves! 


What We Need & What You Get 
Initial goal: 
Our goal covers the production of 11 exclusive new designs (five peacock prints and six other patterns) in a new, high-quality poly-spandex fabric. 
This allows us to offer


Consistent sizing
Squat-proof back printing
Excellent fit and feel
A new 5X size!






These prints will be available in headbands (one size), baby sizes (newborn to 5T) kid sizes (4/5- 14/16), and adult sizes (XS-5X) in Capri, Ankle, and Mid Foot lengths. 
What do you get out of this? A TON of perks! Not only will our perks be limited edition, but we've priced nearly everything BELOW our usual prices. We are also shipping all perks over $125 for free!

 
Essentially, this campaign is the same quality Lineagewear that you know and love - except it's new, the designs are exclusive, much of it is on sale, and since it's a pre-order, nothing is out of stock! What's not to love?



HOW TO ORDER: Simply select the perk you're interested in, and check out. You will receive a backers survey shortly after the end of the campaign (after May 8th) where you can indicate size, length, and print preferences. Yes, you can split a perk with a friend and order two different sizes! 
Risks & Challenges
This is a low risk campaign! Lineagewear has been in business for two years now. We've run two successful pre-order sales last year- each raised close to 30k. We have an established supply chain and good working relationship with our printer and our factories. Running this sale as a crowdfunding campaign will help us better organize and manage logistics, as well as help us manage customer expectations.
Fabric printing is estimated to take 4 weeks, and manufacturing is estimated to take 4-8 weeks. Packing and shipping is estimated to take 1-2 weeks. 


Stretch Goals:
$50k: This project plus expanded inventory on other prints (no more waiting for restock!), and an expanded charity program. Each Peacock design will have a designated charity that a portion of proceeds benefits!
$70k: This project plus expanded inventory, expanded charity program, plus development of new products (sizes up to 6x, more maternity, petite, sports bras, shorts, mens leggings and shorts, mat bag, jogger pants, that sort of thing).
$100k: All of the above, plus the relaunch of our wholesale program!



   Who We Are
After building costumes on Broadway for a decade, Katie Pippin was fully versed in what it takes to make a stretch garment withstand the rigors of a sweaty performer abusing it on stage for eight shows a week. She started Lineagewear in March 2014 in her living room. Since then, Lineagewear has developed a huge following, and has grown to be one of the leaders of the curvy fit athleticwear industry.
We've been spotted in:




Our philosophy- Ethical, Sustainable, and Inclusive.
EthicalOur leggings are handmade in New York City's renowned Fashion District. The employees at our shops are paid a living wage, work realistic hours, and are given frequent breaks and holidays. We believe it is vital to build our products in a fair, sustainable way, never using child or slave labor. In order to ensure this, we build our products locally, where we can regularly tour production facilities. This occasionally increases production time and cost, but we feel like it's worth it. 


We don't do seasons. We release new prints as we find/produce them. A beautiful, well made garment should be timeless, and we believe our designs are attractive enough to be worn -- and released -- all year round. Just because the calendar changes does not mean the value of our products do. 
More importantly, seasons and micro-seasons are part of fast fashion, and often result in shoddy workmanship, low quality materials, questionable labor practices, and excessive waste. SO not our bag! 




Sustainable


Every step of the process is American made, with an emphasis on a small carbon footprint. Our shops are family owned and operated. Our tags, labels, and packaging are all sourced using American companies. Our mailers are made from 88% recycled materials, and are recyclable. Most of our tops are American Apparel. Our other tops, totes, accessories, and jewelry are created by partnering with independently owned American businesses.Our leggings are printed on imported fabric using sublimination (heat-transfer) printing. Sublimation Printing is a process in which designs are transferred from pre-printed paper onto fabric by contact heat, of which the dyes are absorbed by the fabric. It is great way to produce high-clarity, well-defined designs. 

Sublimation printing has always been a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly process than dyeing fabrics. Whether it be single- or double-sided printing, sublimation uses less water and less energy to “color” the fabric, without emitting hazardous gases.
Our printing facility is further committed to sustainability in a number of ways:

Using water-based inks in our pigment printing operation with no solvents added (which emit harmful VOCs)
Operating an in-house waste water treatment system that cleans and filters our water to remove dye particles
Recycling our exhausted transfer paper to other markets
Collecting our waste fabric to be recycled to other markets


Inclusive
We don't add surcharges to certain sizes.
We don't have separate sections for ""straight"" and ""plus"" sizes.
We support the HAES (Health At Every Size) community.
Body shaming is not our bag.
All bodies are gorgeous, and all bodies are to be celebrated for their unique abilities.
We practice radical self-love.
We are adding new sizes on a regular basis, and will continue to do so.
We want every woman, no matter where they are on their fitness journey, to feel OHMazing in Lineagewear. 
Lineagewear doesn't believe in ""one size fits all"".

<p>I'm building an iconic looking, solidly made, modern tool watch, that references the design cues of the classics that started it all. Importantly, I'm doing this at a sensible and accessible price point. </p>
<p>True vintage dive watches are awesome. Nothing can come close to the look and feel of a classic. Unfortunately they are also awesomely rare, extremely expensive, and lack the reliability and modern manufacturing standards of their younger siblings. Modern dive watches have largely sacrificed the elegant design cues and tool aesthetic of their forebears in order to stay 'fresh' and appeal to more modern tastes. </p>
<p>I think they're wrong, and I'm producing a modern, well built automatic dive watch that looks the way it should. A perfectly sized 40mm case, rated water-resistant to 300m that you can actually use for diving, be it the stormy North Sea off the coast of Scotland, the sunny Maldives, or indeed your desk at work!

<p>I am originally from Scotland, and I've been an avid watch collector (read: geek) for years.  During a decade living and working in Asia I added scuba diving to my list of hobbies. </p>
<p>I moved to Dubai in 2014 in order to further my training and experience in diving, while working in my day job in international trade. </p>
<p>PROTOS has been my passion project for the past 3 years, where through my contacts on 3 continents I have been planning, researching, sketching, perfecting, and now finally producing, the PROTOS automatic dive watch.</p>

Thoroughly tested and proven as extremely reliable, the NH35A has 24 jewels, beats at 21,600 bph and has 41 hours power reserve. The most up to date of the 3 most widely used micro brand movements (the others being the Swiss ETA 2824 and Miyota 9015 movements), the NH35a is from the family of robust, reliable  movements made famous by Seiko over decades. Unlike the in-house movements of many Swiss 'luxury' manufacturers, the Japanese NH35A will demand little (if any), maintenance for the lifetime of your watch, ensuring years of accurate, reliable service.</p>

<p><b>CERAMIC BEZEL</b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466588251/image_j9hqz1.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In recent years many luxury watch brands have made the shift from aluminium to ceramic bezels. Engineered ceramic, as used in watch making, has the benefit of being lightweight yet extremely hard, and does not age like other materials when exposed to salt water. Four times harder than stainless steel, ceramic bezels will not scratch or fade, preserving the pristine look of PROTOS for years to come and placing PROTOS in the same class as many high end luxury divers.</p>

This is functional as well as aesthetic, providing less reflection and improved readability under water. Domed crystals were traditionally used to withstand high pressures at depth.<br/><br/> <p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>316L MARINE GRADE STAINLESS STEEL CASE AND BRACELET</b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469691443/back_stand_ohdygo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span>The preferred steel for use in harsh marine environments and widely used in diving (and surgical), equipment due to its properties, 316L stainless steel is the industry standard for extreme corrosion resistance, and is essentially unaffected by seawater. Both the case and bracelet have a brushed matte finish, with polished case sides and end links, for a stunning contrast on the wrist.</span></p>

<p>Manufactured in Switzerland, the SuperLuminova brand supplies lume to many of the world’s leading watch brands. C3 is their strongest grade, ensuring a bright and even glow. PROTOS uses C3 SuperLuminova mixed with a specific Pantone colour formula which gives it a vintage patina appearance in natural light, without comprising on the powerful and lasting green luminescence for functionality.</p>

CONCEPT
 
I'm building an iconic looking, solidly made, modern tool watch, that references the design cues of the classics that started it all. Importantly, I'm doing this at a sensible and accessible price point. 
True vintage dive watches are awesome. Nothing can come close to the look and feel of a classic. Unfortunately they are also awesomely rare, extremely expensive, and lack the reliability and modern manufacturing standards of their younger siblings. Modern dive watches have largely sacrificed the elegant design cues and tool aesthetic of their forebears in order to stay 'fresh' and appeal to more modern tastes. 
I think they're wrong, and I'm producing a modern, well built automatic dive watch that looks the way it should. A perfectly sized 40mm case, rated water-resistant to 300m that you can actually use for diving, be it the stormy North Sea off the coast of Scotland, the sunny Maldives, or indeed your desk at work! A dive watch with a movement that you can set and forget and don't need to worry about. A grail watch we can all afford.

Quiero crear instalaciones de trabajo, para desarrollar su trabajo y llevarlo a todo el mundo, ademas de producir diseños modernos. Por el momento solo contamos con pocos diseños modernos, por no tenemos las licencias. Espero que en el transcurso de la recaudación se unan mas youtubers, Streamers, compañías.Gracias Trick2g por apoyarnos.With your contribution we will invest in

<h3>OUR STORY... </h3>
<p><strong>THE WHY</strong><br/>After visiting several shops, looking into a couple of brands and shopping in different outlets, we've discovered that there are very few real attractive and cool WALLETS at a good price. So we decided to develop our own brand. We are convinced that we can offer much better WALLETS than what's on the market today!</p>
<p><strong>THE FACTS</strong><br/><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>We can almost guarantee that one of this two things has happened to you.  Either you find an amazing really fancy brand WALLET that you love that costs $ 200 USD or you actually find a $ 20 USD ordinary black of brown WALLET with absolutely no design. </span></p>
<p>Having said that  we proudly present the…… <strong>BARTOLOMÉ &amp; BELMONTE WALLET COLLECTION!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>THE VISION</strong><br/>Our purpose is to have a completely new approach to the world of WALLETS. We want to change the rules and make wallets suitable for every occasion. </p>
<p><strong>WE NEED YOUR HELP</strong><br/>We hope you liked our project, we invite you to support us! The money we are asking for is needed to start producing the first model of the BARTOLOMÉ &amp; BELMONTE WALLET Collection in mass volume!</p>

<p>Elefant Apparel was started by three friends with a passion for giving back and wanting to make a change. After brainstorming a way to reach as many people as possible to help us, we decided that creating a brand people can be proud to wear and a logo that is simple yet stands out for a cause was the perfect opportunity to bring the two worlds together.</p>
<p>Many fashion brands have used animals as a part of their materials to add prestige and value to clothing, we wanted to do the opposite. We think the living animal is the most important and prestigious aspect and decided to use fashion to help save them instead. We landed on the Elephant because of what it stands for and the situation it is in. Elephant numbers have dropped 62% over the past decade and it is estimated 100 are killed each day in Africa by poachers leaving only 400,000 in the wild.</p>
<p>Our company is looking to source $7500 to cover the costs of inventory. We need to acquire a few of every size for every piece on our website so we can cut delivery times from 21 days to 2, Thus allowing us to use the profit generated to restock inventory, cover the costs to further market our product and donate to savetheelephants.org as well as other charitable organizations.</p>
<p>Locally we are working with the Hera Mission Of Canada by designing a limited edition ELE shirt for them in which 25% of all proceeds will be donated towards their amazing cause which you can read about at <a href=""http://www.heramission.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.heramission.org</a></p>
<p>On a worldwide scale and back to our passion we will be donating 10% of all sales from our webstore to savetheelephants.org an amazing organization dedicated to protecting this beautiful animal from poachers and sustaining its natural habitat so it can be admired for generations to come. We urge you to go to their website and educate yourself on just how much all of our help is needed.</p>

What’s more, they’re made to accommodate your prescription, if you have one.The sensors inside a pair of Specs are small enough to be unnoticable, but robust enough to track your heart rate, activities and focus level.When combined with the computer vision technology in the frames, your Specs can tell exactly what you’re focused on—and whether or not it’s what you should be focused on, based on your personalized settings.Productivity apps that limit screen time can be helpful, but the technology in Specs takes it to a whole new level by providing activity tracking both on and off screen. Most distractionsdon’t occur on one device alone, and Specs were built to give you control over your entire day, whether you’re looking to spend more time reading, or cut down the amount of time you spend socializing in person. Specs can even detect subcategories of activities, so you’ll have no problem focusing on reading an article on your computer while keeping away from Facebook.You’re in complete control of your data privacy and encryption with Specs. Unlike other hardware products (ie. phones), all of the sensor data captured by Specs is securely processed on your phone’s hardware, and discarded immediately after processing. No external servers are needed for data processing, so your sensor data never actually leaves your device. In fact, it would be physically impossible for anyone else to access your data without physically breaking into your phone and decrypting itSpecs uses proven psychological methodologies, such as mindfulness training, positive reinforcement, gamification, and mental conditioning, to ensure that you're always getting the most out of your day.The Auctify Specs companion app lets you set your own preferences for each of these strategies, so that you get a truly personalized experience. If you need to cut out specific sites like Netflix or Facebook to keep you on track, you can. If you work best when you plan your day ahead of time, you can. If you need to spend half the day in meetings, then a few hours researching online, and then some more time writing, you can. You can set the app up to your unique specifications and preferences, making it a tool that’s tailored to your needs in every way.Specs aren’t just for work. Specs are there to help you get the most out of your day, whether that means spending more time reading the book you’ve been meaning to get to, engaging your creative spirit in ways you couldn’t before, or even allocating more time for the exercise that you previously couldn’t fit into your day.Improve your quality of work by eliminating procrastination. When you get distracted, it takes over 23 minutes to get fully back on task. If you get distracted multiple times a day, your work ends up getting rushed so you can complete it on time. People rarely do their best work under that kind of stress, but with Specs to help you get into a flow, you’ll get things done faster and better than ever before.Whether it’s spending time with your family, watching a movie with friends, or going on vacation, Specs will help you finish your work so you can do the things you really want to do. What’s keeping your productivity high means that your stress will be lower, so you’ll be able to more fully enjoy the important things in your life.Our version zero prototype could track your focus & activities, measure your heart rate, and play music. But we've come a long way since then. We've taken all this hardware, and packed it into a sleek frame that looks completely indistinguishable from a regular pair of glasses.Here, you'll see just how far we've come with our machine learning models. Specs can track most common activities such as eating, reading, socializing, using your phone, and a lot more. As we continue training our machine learning models in the coming months, we'll be able to improve our accuracy even further, and add more activities to our database.

We started New Movements with one simple goal: walk with impact Our first fashion collection: Model NM is made to last a long time. These sneakers remove ocean waste equal to 80 plastic bottles for every pair. We use natural & recycled materials and the best part, you don’t compromise on comfort or design. Model NM comes in 7 colors and fit both men and women.         The footwear industry often overlooks natural and recycled materials for cheaper synthetic options. We do not think this way is neither responsible or sustainable so we set out to make better shoes in a different way. 
 


There is more micro-plastic in the ocean than there are stars in the Milky Way and If nothing is done, there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans by 2050.

In New Movements, we are aware of this massive problem that our planet is suffering. That is the reason why we collaborate with the plastic waste movement Empower. For every pair of shoes you pre-order, we clean 1 kg (equal to 80 plastic bottles) of ocean plastic around the world. Together we help local communities, providing jobs and save the environment.

Currently, 90% of the sneakers made today are produced in Asia, often under poor working conditions and with a fast fashion approach.  Model NM is ethically made in Portugal which is considered to have the best shoemakers in the world. 

We want to push the limits by offering you high-end sneakers and contribute positively to the environment.

was created on the foundation of living out a dream and leaving a legacy.  Nine21 has a regal meaning for the both of us. Several years ago we lost two individuals who have inspired us to become a union and design a brand which will inspire others. Jenae Pickering, born
9/21/1976 was taken from this world at the early age of 16 and Demetrice Harper born 9/1/1979 departed 2 months prior to her 21<sup>st</sup> birthday.  Since neither of them were able to live out
their dreams, we felt this was a way to do it. As you can see, starting the
Nine21 brand will keep their memory alive for years to come.  Fashion has always been on the forefront of

</div></div>","I’m Emily Bell, clothing designer and founder of EMILY VS BEAR, a luxury women’s wear company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  I started this line because I wanted to make it easier for fashion-conscious women to be more responsible consumers. We strive for quality over quantity and slow fashion mentalities with a hope to create a new consumer mindset. 

EMILY VS BEAR was founded and structured around my belief that we need to become better consumers. Companies need to be held accountable and we all need to start taking a closer look at where, how and by whom the products in our lives are being made. This is why EMILY VS BEAR strives to bring you American made clothing using natural and sustainable fibers that can be returned to the environment once they have lived out their lives as luxury staple items in your closet.  




WHY SUSTAINABLE?




We live in a consumer driven society with very little regard for what is actually happening behind the scenes. What chemicals go into the product, where those chemicals end up, who is making the product and under what conditions and what overall impact these practices have on our well-being and health of the planet. 









WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET 


This is all a good start, but we want more. Up until now we have done small production runs, learning the ropes along the way. We’ve finally decided to launch a full line.  

That's where you come in:
Funding this campaign will make it possible for us to move forward with production.  Not just this season, but for many seasons to come. It will give us the freedom to create our coming collections while sourcing the best materials and craftsmanship. 
Giving to this campaign will support small business, artisan craftsmanship, the slow fashion mindset, and the American economy. 

Production alone is expensive and when you add in marketing, wholesaling, and a web store, those expenses get out of control very quickly. 
As a benefit for funding this project you'll have the opportunity to get some awesome incentives like signature pieces, exclusive IndieGoGo items and even a few one-of-a-kind pieces!

<p>    Hi, my name
is Daniel and I’m an architect who can’t efficiently work on architecture due
the problems that construction industry encountered in my country. So I
temporarily abandoned the architecture and decided to implement my old product
design ideas. The idea that I will introduce to you now is the one I wanted to
create since the time I was a kid.</p>
<p>    So, the
sunglasses. For me, as for many others, wearing the sunglasses has always been
associated with problems such as: their constant slipping down the nose,
painful red marks left by the bridge and nose pads. And I asked myself: why the
sunglasses can’t exist without the bridge and nose pads in a first place? And
an obvious solution for design of the <b>EyeCrabs</b> appeared. Headband that pushes
structure of sunglasses to the temples. And the pressure from the headband to
the temples turned out to be not so great because of large size of the <b>EyeCrabs</b>
temporal pads.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>    At this
point the design could be completed. But wait. In fact the lenses now have no
role to keep the sunglasses on a head and this means that now I can do
anything with them. That’s how the function of hiding the lenses appeared.</p>

pipe compared with cigars.</p>
<p></p>
<p>   I hope that with Your help <b>EyeCrabs</b> will
take their place in the world as the traditional and recognizable
accessory. And

<p>    It may
sound cynical - but only real obstacles for me are money and time. I can't control the speed of the production of parts and delays in logistics. As well as I can't start the production without your contribution. </p>
<p>    I will say honestly - the main risk is that if this campaign will not achieve the goal  I will not be able to start production in time. In that case, I can only promise that you will get your perks but later than planned. And I'm very sorry for that. Flexible funding - is  not my decision, it's just the only possible opportunity for me due to the PayPal limits.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>    Any other
possible production problems are not so complicated for me. After my experience in
construction management - production of accessories is not so big deal.</p> </div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>

percentage of profit from the sales as well as will be listed as a EyeCrabs co-designer on the EyeCrabs website and as ""designed by"" on specific model EyeCrabs package).




   If the campaign attains at least three times more funds than
planned - each set of EyeCrabs will be supplemented by two pairs of replaceable
rims with lenses of alternative design.
(* - read Risks & Challenges)
   The Impact 
    Impact of
the EyeCrabs - is to give the world a comfortable alternative to the
traditional sunglasses. In some
sense EyeCrabs are not glasses at all - they are something different, as a smoking
pipe compared with cigars.

   I hope that with Your help EyeCrabs will
take their place in the world as the traditional and recognizable
accessory. And
if it happens - I will not stop on the EyeCrabs, and will continue to create comfortable
alternatives to other casual accessories.   Risks & Challenges  
    It may
sound cynical - but only real obstacles for me are money and time. I can't control the speed of the production of parts and delays in logistics. As well as I can't start the production without your contribution. 
    I will say honestly - the main risk is that if this campaign will not achieve the goal  I will not be able to start production in time. In that case, I can only promise that you will get your perks but later than planned. And I'm very sorry for that. Flexible funding - is  not my decision, it's just the only possible opportunity for me due to the PayPal limits.
    Any other
possible production problems are not so complicated for me. After my experience in
construction management - production of accessories is not so big deal.   Other Ways You Can Help 
    If you can't fund EyeCrabs, but you would like to see them become a reality - please just show them to your friends. It is important for me. 
    EyeCrabs is a good idea, and it deserves to take its place in the world of accessories. 
    Thank you. And may the crab be with you.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign
