<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Ability Innovation</i> gives information about innovation in housing for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.<br/><br/>My name is Astri Doub and I am the author of Ability Innovation. I wrote this book because my family is currently looking for a housing option appropriate for my brother, and I wanted to educate myself and others on the positive approaches which can be used to create someone’s ideal housing option.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the vast variety of innovative approaches in the disability housing sector and how they are being implemented to benefit people with special needs. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for innovation in the disability sector. Ultimately I hope you will see this book as a tool to help you either in the process of finding or developing a housing plan or supporting someone who is looking for a home.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about empathy-fueled innovation in the disability housing sector:<p>How finding someone who understood the need for improved disability housing development options helped Pam Blanton revolutionize finding a roommate in Washington state.</p>
<p>Why by challenging the very notion of caregiver/resident relationships, L’Arche sustains inclusive housing options.</p>
<p>What makes the live/work/play communities designed by LTO Ventures financially sustainable.</p> You will love this book not only if you have a family member or friend with IDDs who is currently or will eventually live in an assisted living setting, but also if you are an social innovator who wants to learn about opportunity in a market considered synonymous with crisis.<br/>Ability Innovation is a non-fiction book that speaks to families of people with IDDs and disability entrepreneurs who are looking at innovation in housing and the process of developing a housing plan for the first time.<br/> <h2>The Book - Ability Innovation</h2>
<br/>The book is written in 4 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and Chapters 1-4. In the introduction, I will discuss my experience with the disability housing industry and lay out the terms I use throughout the book. Then I will share a brief history of disability housing in the US, and the process of looking for housing / developing a housing plan.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 5-7. It lays out unique uses of physical and procedural design to increase quality of life in group homes.<br/><br/>Part 3 focuses on relationships. Chapters 8-10 center around employee/resident relationships and positive techniques for finding and maintaining quality staff.<br/><br/>Part 4 focuses on community. Chapters 11-13 focus on how homes engage and utilize the wider community to improve their homes as a whole.<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>

I knew that I needed to understand how I could ensure the best experience possible for my brother, so I set out looking for the best approaches in the country which I will share with you all in this book.<br/><br/>Outside of working on this book, I’m singing along to bluegrass music with my brothers in the car, watching Spanish dramas (highly recommend El Internado and El Barco), and practicing Norwegian whenever I get the chance!<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with me via email at astridoub@live.com or LinkedIn at <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/astri-doub-46729116a/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/astri-doub-46729116a/</a>.</p>

<h3>Campaign Overview</h3>
<p>The book provides ways to better understand China, it diffuses the common perception of China through angles of International Relations, recent topics of controversy and personal experiences. I wrote it because certain inaccuracies exist in the popular understanding of China as well as a growing narrative of fear in recent discourse. Through better understanding China and what is “lost in translation,” cooperation with China can be more easily achieved. My book will publish in February 2020.</p>
<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Empathize with China</i> provides ways to better understand China, it diffuses the common perception of China through angles of International Relations, recent topics of controversy and personal experiences. Through better understanding China and what is “lost in translation,” cooperation with China can be more easily achieved.</p>
<p>My name is Annie Ye and I am the author of <i>Empathize with China.</i> I wrote this book because I found there is a general difficulty to acknowledge deep cultural, societal differences that China has with the Western world. And I think this difficulty leads to some uninformed foreign policies and media strategies vis-a-vis China.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover some common themes in the West’s perception of China, without the full cultural and societal picture, can be misleading and counterproductive. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for open-mindedness in learning about different cultures, societies, and places. Ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you not only understand China better, but also be more critical (nonetheless curious) about news events, and lastly be able to cooperate with others despite vast differences.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>“media war” - the “war” phenomenon on Western and Chinese media</li>
<li>the notion of China as a civilization-state - how China’s history continues to shape China today. (Why is “human rights” a problem in China. hint: it’s a different concept)</li>
<li>youth in dialogue - how to approach “difficult” topics? Dialogue is the first step to mutual understanding and cooperation. It requires respect and open minds. </li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you like a different perspective on China, if you’d like to know more about current global issues surrounding China’s rise, and want to know what the future will be in relation to world politics and events that will actually affect our daily life.</p>
<p><i>Empathize with China</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to people are interested in China, people who can see opportunities in the future working with China and are willing to refresh their view on China. </p>
<h3>The Book - Empathize with China</h3>
<p><br/>The book is written in three Parts....</p>
<p>Part 1 contains the introduction + 2 chapters, it covers how events in China’s modern memory shaped the Chinese mentality of itself. An abrupt tragic ending to the long historical imperial order and the Communist modern state made China seem truncated from its glorious past and a much-degraded civilization. Personal stories tell insight into some realities of the 1970s and 80s, private business of the 2000s, and how the younger Chinese generation think of their country’s democracy and future.</p>
<p>Part 2 contains Chapters 3-5, which examine conceptual “areas of conflict” China has with Western liberal beliefs and an example of a scholarly perception of China that gives more justice. I draw upon my own experiences to make a case for cross-cultural cooperation and via learning others' lessons. For a past that I remember, US-China relationship was much more friendly, by contrast making the current trend of this relationship worrisome.</p>
<p>Part 3 contains Chapters 6-8, that provides different reactions to cross-cultural difficulties (if you would bear it with me seeing US-China relationship as one big difficult cross-cultural interaction with interests of money, power, and status.) Should we run away from misunderstandings and difficulties? Should we try to have dialogue and cooperate? At the same time, we will still compete with each other? Again, I bring in personal experiences to show how cooperation may be difficult but nonetheless indispensable.</p>

<p><strong>This is a charity event to benefit the </strong><a href=""http://www.errc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>European Roma Rights Centre</strong></a><strong> (<em>ERRC</em>), a vital Roma human rights NGO too little-known outside their sphere of advocacy.</strong></p>
<p>Since 1996, the <strong><em>ERRC</em></strong> has helped Roma communities combat discrimination and seek equal access to justice, education, housing, health care and public services, and has won numerous awards for its work advancing human rights for Roma.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Goals and context</h3>
<p>Our aim with this event is to foster appreciation of new Romani writing, foreground social issues and raise regard of Romani contributions in the wider European community.</p>
<p>In spite of more than a decade of EU-funded initiatives, the context in several EU states has become less tolerant and more discriminatory in recent years. At the same time, economic depression has hit the poorest members of society – disproportionately represented by Roma – harder than anyone else. Consequently, the need to protect basic human rights for Romani people has become more pressing.</p>
<p>At the same time, Roma and related groups form the largest minority in Europe, with a rich literary and cultural heritage that is continually evolving and very little known.</p>
<p>Showcasing great Roma literature and how it fits in the family of European cultures can be a powerful aid in helping reshape public perception and push the dialogue in a more joyful and accepting direction.</p>
<p>In addition to new literature, our roundtable discussion will examine Roma identity and the social context behind the works presented.</p>
<p>We are hoping to attract English-language publishers to some of these great Roma writers, and we plan to make a DVD of the event with additional educational material, as a tool for advocacy and outreach to policy-makers.</p>

<p><strong><em>Please help us support Roma rights in Europe with this event!</em></strong></p>

<p>Now, here is a little about us…</p>
<h3><strong>Trafika Europe: a new space for European writing</strong></h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.trafikaeurope.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Trafika Europe</a> wants to help you find some of the best new writing from across Europe in fresh English translation, and to make a literate, creative space where writers, publishers, translators and readers can meet, share their work and interact, free of borders in the shared medium of English language.</p>
<p>We aim to introduce new voices, foster collaborations and create a kind of ""community of communities"" for European writing.</p>
<h3><strong>Trafika has a wonderful history. . .</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Trafika Europe</strong> is the successor to Trafika Press, Inc. We published the quarterly print journal <em>Trafika, </em>out of Prague and New York, of new fiction and poetry from around the world in fresh English translation in the 1990s. All work was published for the first time in English, and special emphasis was placed on introducing the work of writers who were unknown or little-known to an English-language readership.</p>
<p>In seven issues, <em>Trafika</em> published the work of over 120 authors writing in over 30 languages. Contributors included: Czeslaw Milosz, Tomaz Salamun, Natasza Goerke, Don DeLillo, Mohammed Choukri, Ales Debeljak, Anna Swir, Gyorgy Konrad, Peter Nadas, Denis Johnson, Uche Nduka, Eleni Sikelianos, Yusef Komunyakaa, Martin M. Simecka, Hanoch Levin, Tor Ulven, Ilona Lackova, and Javiar Marias.</p>
<p><em>Trafika</em> received glowing reviews in over 30 major newspapers, magazines and related media, including the <em>New York Times</em> and an interview on NBC nightly news with Tom Brokaw. <em>The Washington Post</em> wrote: ""If magazines still exist 20 years from now, you can bet a lot more of them will be international. And the literary ones are likely to resemble an attractive new quarterly out of Prague called <em>Trafika</em>.""</p>
<h3><strong>...and now an exciting new chapter is beginning!</strong></h3>
<p>So here it is 20 years later, and we’re putting a frame of Europe around <em>Trafika</em> and moving the conversation wholly online. We want to contribute this space where people can explore all the many wonderful cultures, issues, perspectives and voices which go toward making a European identity in literature.</p>
<p>Key features of the new <strong>Trafika Europe</strong> will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>new writing in translation, reviews and essays in our online journal;</li>
<li>literary news, festival coverage and event listings from around Europe;</li>
<li>recommended reads, with links for purchasing works online,</li>
<li>…and introducing a great new innovation, Europe’s first online literary radio station!</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Trafika Europe Radio</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Trafika Europe</strong> will stream literary interviews and performances as well as play “literary” music from all over, cover events, and host listener- and partner-produced shows. Listen to your favourite authors, catch up on events around Europe, and tune in for some of the best new writing and literary discussion from across the continent!</p>
<h3><strong>Please help us get started by hosting this Romani literature event!</strong></h3>
<p>We really need help with our June 16th Romani literature event (both before and after the event!) in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>pay our Roma translators, writers, musicians and artists;</li>
<li>transport and acccommodate talent in London;</li>
<li>pay for the venue and related costs;</li>
<li>rent equipment and tech support for the performance and HD recording, and</li>
<li>make a DVD of the event with additional menu-driven educational material.</li>
</ul><p>We know what’s possible – we have some great experience presenting quality fiction and poetry in English translation, – but we sure do need help in making this new initiative a reality. Please help us take the former <em>Trafika</em> to the next level with this pre-launch event, toward creating this new space online, exploring quality new literature and literary identity in Europe.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>We can also use your help in other ways!</strong></h3>
<p>It’s difficult to be a new start-up, and we’re certainly happy for your help in getting the word out.</p>

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>The year, 2012. May to be exact. I had just graduated from NYU with my M.S. in publishing, where I had spent the last two years studying the digital trends. My family came to visit me from California for the ceremony.</p>
<p>On their last day, my mom pulled me aside. ""Now just remember, you need to come home for December 21. If the world ends, I want my family to be with me.""</p>
<p>I thought this was silly. But then I started getting scared. <em>What if the world ends this year?</em> I thought. <em>Where would I want to be?</em> I tried to shake it off. <em>Nah, that's ridiculous. I can't let fear dictate how I live.</em></p>
<p>Then the idea hit me. Maybe I could write a book about the Mayans and their end of the world prediction. It could be a thriller, and it might be a comforting way to deal with the doubts and fears. With any luck, people would read it and be reassured that the world will not actually end this year.</p>
<p>But how to go about it? Well, 2012 is a time of rapid change in the publishing industry, between creating new genres, to publishing digital shorts, to trying out new business models. Personally I love experimenting. Last year I co-founded a digital publishing company just so I could say I tried. For the 2012 ebook, I decided I wanted to try agile publishing. </p>
<p>Agile publishing comes from the idea of agile software. In the startup world, entrepreneurs use the agile structure to quickly and effectively evolve to meet their customers needs, without wasting time or money. Some publishers, such as SourceBooks, are now using agile publishing to write books they know customers will want to read. </p>
<p>For the 2012 ebook, I have created a website, <a href=""http://the2012ebook.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://the2012ebook.com</a>. On this site, I plan to regularly post chapters of my book. Hopefully people will read the chapters and give me feedback in the comments. The more detailed feedback, the better! I want to incorporate the feedback as I go along, shaping the story into something I and other people would want to read.</p>
<h3>The Video</h3>
<p>Everything about the project is explained in the video, but there's also a little extra. I really love dinosaurs--if I could do it all over I think I would study palentology instead of communication/writing/publishing (though I do love that too...). So my friends and I made a short video involving some dinosaur hand puppets I got for Christmas. If you want to just watch that part of the video, skip ahead to the 1:38 mark. Enjoy!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What the 2012 EBook Needs &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Sometimes self-publishing gets a bad rap. This is because some people publish too early, without enough editing, or because they don't have the funds to effectively market, so not enough people see their work.</p>
<p>For the 2012 ebook to be successful, I will need funding for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing.To make a high quality ebook, I will need to hire a high quality editor.</li>
<li>Marketing. It takes money to be successful. I will need to reach out to bloggers and reviewers, place ads, and more.</li>
<li>Cover Design. I'm not an artist, so ideally I'd like to hire someone to create my cover.</li>
<li>Miscellaneous. This includes registering copyright, researching metadata, etc. (Read more about self-publishing on my blog, <a href=""http://digitalpubbing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://digitalpubbing.com</a>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>If, unfortunately, I don't meet my goal, then the funds I do get will be used for editing. I want to write the best book possible for readers to enjoy.</p>
<p>So what's in it for you? Well, a lot!</p>
<p>Depending on which perk you pick, you can get free marketing/advertising, discounts for restaurants, and even ebook conversions. If you're a writer, this is a great deal. Automatic ebook conversions often come out sloppy and jumbled, which will make readers angry. Angry readers means negative reviews, negative reviews means fewer sales, and it becomes a viscious cycle. I used to be an ebook developer at Simon &amp; Schuster, and I'm the co-founder and publisher of FictionBrigade, where I produced flash fiction ebooks. Work with me and I'll ensure your ebook looks good.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you like my project but can't contribute, no worries there are other ways you can help!</p>

<li>Get the word out about the 2012 ebook. Tell your friends, share the link, and make some noise!</li>

<h3></h3>
<p>I've been writing poetry and playing violin since I was 5. Till now, music has been my main focus and professional life, with poetry reserved for lovers, family and close friends... This year, as part of the culmination of many years of deep spiritual practice, I began writing a poem every day, and posting it on Facebook. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with many requests for a book. The book is now complete, and ready for publication, through Balboa Press. This is a ""Self-publishing"" company, and requires cash outlay for the hard copy. </p>
<p>I hear music inside all the time, that goes with the poetry. The Companion CD is an expression of this inner music, to gently accompany and give an ambience to the reading of the poems. Recording has begun, and a thousand copies will be ready for release with the publication of the book.</p>
<p>I'm offering discounted packages as a way to get this project funded and to get the poetry and music out to people. The book will retail for $23.99 and the CD for $15. For a $30 donation I'll send the combination with free shipping. This is a $15 discount...</p>
<p>It's my sincere belief that this poetry and music have the potential to heal and uplift any spirit. Thanks for your support, and may your journey be filled with love and joy! </p>

<div><strong><span style=""color: #0099cc;"">The Magazine!</span></strong></div>
<p>Lamplighter is an alternative music &amp; culture magazine, to be published quarterly. Focusing on New Jersey, the magazine intends to create a heading under which local music, art, poetry, and all alternative culture can collect and collaborate, for the purpose of supporting and expanding the scene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #0099cc;"">The Staff!</span></strong></p>
<p>We, the staff of Lamplighter Magazine, are a group of plucky graduates from William Paterson University, who has undertaken this project; we believe in its value, though it stands in the face of a difficult economic time. Starting simply as a website, we are expanding our operation into this quarterly publication.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style=""color: #3399cc;""><strong>The First Issue!</strong></span></p>
<p>This first issue carries great value to us, because, unlike running a website, the print magazine will give people something to carry themselves. Being able to put pictures and articles, the words of local writers, and interesting stories into your hands is the most direct experience in which we can engage the community outside of bringing you to an art gallery or a poetry reading.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your contribution, you will allow us to have this experience a thousand times! Your support will provide us with the funding to print 1000 copies of the first issue. This support will also extend itself into further issues as we begin to seek out advertisers, who want to know the community believes in our endeavor.</p>

<h3>What is <i>Strange Horizons</i>? </h3>
<p><i>Strange Horizons</i> is a weekly online magazine of and about speculative fiction—science fiction, fantasy, horror, slipstream, and all other flavors of imaginative fiction—and related non-fiction. Since September 2000, we have been publishing new issues every Monday, including fiction, poetry, reviews, essays, and interviews. </p>
<p>We're entirely funded by voluntary contributions. We pay all our contributors fair market rates for their work, but our (frankly enormous) volunteer editorial team does it out of love.</p>
<h3><strong>Why support Strange Horizons?</strong></h3>
<p>Because we believe that in the twenty-first century, speculative fiction must be an open, global tradition. For over fifteen years we have showcased work that challenges us and delights us, by new and established writers from diverse backgrounds and with diverse concerns. <br/><br/>Because we have a record of finding and supporting exciting new voices in SF: writers who got their start in Strange Horizons include N. K. Jemisin (""Cloud Dragon Skies,"" from 2005), Justine Larbalestier ("" The Cruel Brother,"" from 2001), Ken Liu (""The Algorithms for Love,"" from 2004), Nnedi Okorafor (""The Palm Tree Bandit,"" from 2000), and John Scalzi (""Alien Animal Encounters,"" from 2001).<br/><br/>Because we're a multiple Hugo-shortlisted magazine and we've published stories that have been shortlisted for or won Hugo, Nebula, James Tiptree Jr., Theodore Sturgeon, and World Fantasy Awards.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need to raise:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need $16,000 to fund the basic running costs of the magazine for 1 year</li>
<li>If we get to $17,000 we'll run a special issue packed with Arabic SFF</li>
<li>At $17,500 we'll create a rolling guest-edited column on the subject of resistance</li>
<li>At $20,000 we'll be running a special issue on SFF from the Southeastern USA</li>
<li>If we hit $21,500 we'll unlock the first of 2 super secret stretch goals</li>
<li>At $23,000 we'll unlock the other super secret goal!</li>

Strange Horizons is a weekly online magazine of and about speculative fiction—science fiction, fantasy, horror, slipstream, and all other flavors of imaginative fiction—and related non-fiction. Since September 2000, we have been publishing new issues every Monday, including fiction, poetry, reviews, essays, and interviews. 
We're entirely funded by voluntary contributions. We pay all our contributors fair market rates for their work, but our (frankly enormous) volunteer editorial team does it out of love.
Why support Strange Horizons?
Because we believe that in the twenty-first century, speculative fiction must be an open, global tradition. For over fifteen years we have showcased work that challenges us and delights us, by new and established writers from diverse backgrounds and with diverse concerns. Because we have a record of finding and supporting exciting new voices in SF: writers who got their start in Strange Horizons include N. K. Jemisin (""Cloud Dragon Skies,"" from 2005), Justine Larbalestier ("" The Cruel Brother,"" from 2001), Ken Liu (""The Algorithms for Love,"" from 2004), Nnedi Okorafor (""The Palm Tree Bandit,"" from 2000), and John Scalzi (""Alien Animal Encounters,"" from 2001).Because we're a multiple Hugo-shortlisted magazine and we've published stories that have been shortlisted for or won Hugo, Nebula, James Tiptree Jr., Theodore Sturgeon, and World Fantasy Awards.

<p><i><strong>The Journey is the Destination: The Case for Holistic, Restorative Education</strong></i> is my storied take on how education must transform in order to meet the needs of young people in today’s globalized and precarious world. Rather than being mired in test scores and returns-on-investment, education has to recognize the forces which threaten civilization itself: global inequality and climate change. In response to these macro-trends, education must center the whole student and prepare them to be problem-solvers, change makers, and responsible citizens of the modern world. Unfortunately, there is no more time to waste.<br/><br/>I drew inspiration to write this book from my journey through public, private, charter, and magnet schools. After attending high school in Las Vegas, I went to Georgetown University, and this transition put me face-to-face with the scope of economic inequality in the modern United States. My high school was surrounded by convenience stores, liquor stores, and apartment complexes, whereas my college was a billion-dollar school in the nation’s capital with towering stone and brick buildings.<br/><br/>I had reached the promised land my parents had wished for me; with a Georgetown degree, I would probably never struggle to find work. And yet, despite earning a high GPA, I struggled with loneliness, anxiety, and depression throughout college. I was a Gilded Student; golden grades and a golden smile enabled me to hide my struggle from my peers and professors.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I studied the ails of society in the classroom—from climate change to global racism—thereby adding an existential twinge to my daily stresses. Eventually, I came to realize that my struggles with mental health, my façade resume, and the problems facing the world were all engaged in a tragic and dissonant dance. Although my reckoning with the education system may seem melodramatic, it is common for many struggling with mental health issues—especially in the age of social media, which is linked to rising depression and anxiety rates. Each of us is introduced to the path to personal excellence, wealth, and social status—all while knowing that global forces threaten our future.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I believe that changing our core educational framework can provide leverage for change in the rest of society. By prioritizing both student-flourishing and community wellbeing education can evolve into a training ground for democracy, a hub for innovative solutions, and a bastion for equality.<br/><br/>In these pages, we’ll explore how we can cultivate a new form of education which channels the individual talents of young people into careers and lifestyles that will lead to both personal fulfillment and global problem-solving. Specifically, we’ll see:</p>
<ul>
<li>How project-based learning might help revive our democracy.</li>
<li>How social media and climate change is turning Gen Z (those born between 1997 and 2012) into the “Doomer Generation.”</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve ever questioned the point of education, or believe in its power as a transformative force for good, you will definitely like this book. Regardless of your beliefs, my biggest hope is that you’ll feel a newfound appreciation for education, learning, and growth.</p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>
<p>New Degree Press will be publishing my book. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the publishing costs. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<p>The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</p>
<p>The launch &amp; promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this Spring.</p>
<p>As soon as I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I’ll publish a paperback and ebook. At 150 copies, I’ll publish a hardcover. At 200, I’ll publish a hardcover and an audiobook.<br/><br/>If you pre-order I’ll give you a huge thanks and these added perks!</p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Michael Pasimio is a Las Vegas native and attends Georgetown University, where he studies in the School of Foreign Service. He works at The Hub for Equity and Innovation in Higher Education and serves as Co-Chair of the Student Experience Committee. Throughout his time at Georgetown, he’s worked closely to organize and promote equity and diversity initiatives. He’s also partnered with various organizations around education and youth development, including Gentlemen By Choice and the International Youth Foundation.<br/><br/>His passion for education comes from his personal journey through private, public, magnet, and charter schools in Las Vegas, which are consistently at the bottom of national rankings. In 2018, Michael enrolled in Georgetown, and in his first year, the school made national news during the 2019 college admissions bribery scandal, but he learned firsthand how the scandal only scratched the surface of the faults within the education system. He took it upon himself to find solutions to these problems by providing college counseling to students from his high school at no cost and promoting educational equity among the student body. Michael also joined The Pivotal Network at Georgetown to help make college more affordable and accessible to first-generation and lower-income students.<br/><br/>In his free time, Michael reads, watches anime, walks his dogs, and hosts education brainstorming sessions with his friends. He always finds ways to attend events and meet new people, and he loves it when other people share their stories.<br/><br/>You can connect with Michael at mvp36@georgetown.edu and follow him on Instagram @mic.pasimio.</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest risk of publishing a book is mailing a physical copy to my supporters. Fortunately, I’ve included the cost of mailing and shipping into my pre-order goals, so we don’t have to worry.<br/><br/>This risk itself depends a lot on the publisher, but New Degree Press is extremely reliable in making sure that all the perks of pre-order are delivered ASAP. I’ll keep all my supporters in the loop on my book publishing date, and you’ll know when you can expect the physical book to be in your hands.</p>

<h3>About:</h3>
<p><i><strong>Sometimes Blue Daddi-O </strong></i>was written for young readers who have loved ones that struggle with mental illness, anxiety, or depression.  Children will be empowered as they are assured that the illness and its effects are not their fault, nor should they feel pressure to adopt the surrounding emotions and behaviors as their own.  Families are encouraged and freed to create a powerful environment of hope, joy, and thankfulness.</p>
<p>This is a story about a sweet family of three birds whose joyful song is woven throughout their daily lives.  The beloved father’s reoccurring blue moods threaten that song and the young daughter becomes hurt and confused, not knowing how to cope.  Her mother must make an important choice about how to rescue their melody.  </p>
<p>This storyline was inspired by my childhood, as my father has struggled with mental illness and depression the majority of his life.  I wrote it to honor my family and to encourage others who are encountering the same battle.  I believe this book will encourage discussion and bring support to many kids who also have loved ones who suffer from a mental illness.  Thank you for partnering with me and making this book a reality!  </p>

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p>A Bump in the Road is about me and my family’s battle with a rare genetic cancer called Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. In my book I talk about what it took mentally and physically to overcome my illness, and the growth I achieved along the way. </p>
<p><br/>My name is Michael Caprio and I am the author of A Bump In The Road. I wrote this book because I feel it is important to share my story with the world so that others in similar circumstances don’t have to feel like they are alone. In reading this book, you will learn more about my rare condition and similar digestive diseases, as well as the importance of overcoming adversity. My hope is to share with you the mental tools that I have learned along the way which helped me overcome the obstacles within my life. I aim to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I now have for my health, both mentally and physically. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you overcome adversity, not just health issues. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the ugliness of hitting rock bottom and dealing with depression. You will see ways to help you navigate depression with more balance, as well as find the importance of having good people around you, a positive attitude, and being patient with yourself. You'll hear stories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>My eleven days in the hospital after my first nine-hour operation, and my battle to deal with the raw emotions that came with my drastically different reality.</li>
<li>How my depression affected my loved ones, not just myself, and when I realized the exact moment where I had to pull it together so that I didn’t hurt my family.</li>
<li>How my positive attitude changed my moms life, and the lives of those around me.</li>
</ul>

A Bump in the Road is about me and my family’s battle with a rare genetic cancer called Familial Adenomatous Polyposis. In my book I talk about what it took mentally and physically to overcome my illness, and the growth I achieved along the way. 
My name is Michael Caprio and I am the author of A Bump In The Road. I wrote this book because I feel it is important to share my story with the world so that others in similar circumstances don’t have to feel like they are alone. In reading this book, you will learn more about my rare condition and similar digestive diseases, as well as the importance of overcoming adversity. My hope is to share with you the mental tools that I have learned along the way which helped me overcome the obstacles within my life. I aim to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I now have for my health, both mentally and physically. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you overcome adversity, not just health issues. In this book, you'll learn about the ugliness of hitting rock bottom and dealing with depression. You will see ways to help you navigate depression with more balance, as well as find the importance of having good people around you, a positive attitude, and being patient with yourself. You'll hear stories such as:

My eleven days in the hospital after my first nine-hour operation, and my battle to deal with the raw emotions that came with my drastically different reality.
How my depression affected my loved ones, not just myself, and when I realized the exact moment where I had to pull it together so that I didn’t hurt my family.
How my positive attitude changed my moms life, and the lives of those around me.

A Bump in the Road pertains to anyone who is struggling to overcome a challenge and will appeal to those with health issues but can be applied to any life struggles. This book will be a welcome addition to anyone’s library who is interested in rare diseases, stories of overcoming adversity, and journey’s about the human condition. A Bump in the Road is a nonfiction book that speaks to people dealing with adversity and people who like comeback stories with perspective on mental health and perseverance.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Living with 2020 Vision: The Mental Health Awakening in the Black Community is a book that highlights how the compounding traumatic events of 2020 ultimately sparked a mental health awakening in the Black community. <br/><br/>My name is Tiara Johnson, and I am the author of Living with 2020 Vision: The Mental Health Awakening in the Black Community. I wrote this book because there is an obvious mental health crisis happening in the African American community. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, regardless of race, you will discover a more empathetic view toward mental health experiences in the Black community. In this book, I also hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for mental health awareness and education. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better empathize with the mental health experiences of the African American community and other minorities. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about various vulnerable and even traumatic experiences from brave members of the Black community and how it affected their mental health in 2020. You'll hear stories such as the following...</p>
<ul>
<li>The “Black Male Trauma” chapter is a vulnerable story that rarely gets heard because of the stigmas attached to Black males feel about mental health. One man details his experience and trauma after witnessing the violence against George Floyd. </li>
<li>The “Coping” chapter tells a feel-good story of college friends who met in the 80s and reconnect in 2020. Due to the isolation caused by the pandemic, they decided to reconnect through Zoom and ultimately were able to help one another cope with their personal mental health issues. Even though they were many miles away, Zoom allowed them to support each other through their struggles with mental health in 2020. </li>
<li>The “Election Anxiety” chapter, details the pressure I felt as a Black woman living in Georgia during the 2020 elections. The Trump era, particularly in 2020, had a definite effect on the mental health of the Black community. I didn’t realize it in the moment, but I was dealing with election anxiety, which I described as nervousness and uncertainty about the outcome of the election. </li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are interested in the current mental health crisis, if you’re curious about the complex relationship between the Black community and mental health awareness, and if you’ve ever had to address any mental health issues. <br/><br/>Living with 2020 Vision: The Mental Health Awakening in the Black Community is a nonfiction book that speaks to the Black community and mental health professionals who want to look at the mental health crisis and awareness in a new light and begin to take a realistic approach to finding a better path forward for all of us. When one part of our community struggles, we all struggle.</p>
<p><strong>The Book - <i>Living with 2020 Vision: The Mental Health Awakening in the Black Community</i></strong><br/>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 2-3. In these sections, the reader will receive foundational knowledge about the history of trauma in the Black community and the science behind empathy. I want readers, regardless of race, to walk away with a more empathetic view of the Black community, so it is important to understand what empathy truly is and how it can be taught to others. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-9. In this section, each chapter tells a different but unique experience of various African Americans in 2020. You will read about how COVID and virtual learning had an effect on Black public school teachers and students and about how racism in 2020 had an advance effect on the Black trans community. The five chapters within this section are set up so they can be read and learned from individually. <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 10-12. The last section is dedicated to providing the reader with expert insight about the various mental health themes discussed in the earlier chapters. It was important for me to interview experts within the the mental health space. I talked to Alison Malmon, CEO and Founder of Active Minds, 2021 American Psychological Association (APA) President, Dr. Jennifer Kelly, and Georgetown crisis communications professor, Matthew Charles, among other local experts. </p>

Raised in the rural West Virginia Appalachian region, he now lives in Knoxville TN with his wonderful partner, and their dog Athena. Six months ago while Dave and Branden were at an event with friends and his now publisher Douglas McDaniel of Storyhaus media, Dave was inspired to work on this book, Cooking with Magic: The Psilocybin Cookbook. The book is a comprehensive recipe and how-to guide for cooking with and preparing food and drink using psilocybin mushrooms.</p><p style=""margin-left:80px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572984089/qpqtj1ygr8ywpggb1hoo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>David's main inspiration for this book was and is Psilocybin's positive impact in his life, and how adopting this powerful fungal ally into his weekly routine may have literally saved Dave's life. When he separated from the US Air Force in late 2016 David entered a civilian world that he was not prepared for. Plagued by depression, anxiety, and PTSD, David found himself on a series of anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications that did him little good.  So he began to look for alternatives.</p><p>This is where Branden comes into this mushroom-filled picture. Branden introduced Dave to psilocybin for the first time, and after a few months of supervised theraputic use, and frequent guided trips Dave found himself in an entirely different and significantly healthier mental state. Now the pair spend their days concocting new and interesting ways to incorporate magic mushroom into their diet.</p><h3>So what's this book all about?  </h3><p>As all mushroom fans k<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573164809/bdovvtudigbhfmwomyyr.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>now, eating little fun-guys, as Dave and his partner Branden and I like to call them, can be a trying experience. As much as we love and appreciate them, neither of them enjoys the sensation of chewing on dried out, fibrous fungi stalks.  Our experiences learning to integrate small, measured quantities of shrooms into food and drink inspired us to collaborate in our kitchen on this definitive guide to cooking with psilocybin contaiing mushrooms. </p><p>They hope that this book helps you experience your fun-guys in new, healthful and meaningful ways. With that in mind, they have decided to make all the recipes as health-conscious as possible—while still being delicious and a little indulgent from time to time. You’ll find that everything here has no added sugars and is lactose-free; we have also included gluten-free substitutions throughout.  Happy cooking, and many best wishes as you embark on your journey with food and fungi!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572988122/wehokfq4knmt9ylb9cc1.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p><h3>What's up with cooking with Magic Mushrooms?</h3><p>The main way Dave explores and uses Magic Mushrooms is through food. He believes that by connecting psilocybin usage to cooking, we deepen the spiritual and emotional aspects of using this potent psychedelic. This is backed up by history itself. For at least as long as we have had fire, man has consumed Magic Mushrooms in various forms, whether it was Dionysian wines, brewed teas, or other ways lost to the ages.</p><p>It makes sense that we should take the act of feeding yourself, your friends, and your family, something that for thousands of years was not only an act of necessity, but of love and sharing with your community, and bind our use of psychedelics to the purely human ritual of cooking and sharing food. In fact, Branden and Dave have grown quite fond of adapting their daily microdosing routine into the creation of pies, main dishes, drinks, and more. I have selected a handful of these recipes to share with the hope that it will inspire others to do the same.</p><h3>Why launch a crowdfund for the book?</h3><p>To put it simply, getting a book published is expensive, especially one with as many illustrations, and with as much color as this particular tome. So Dave is asking for your help.

Raised in the rural West Virginia Appalachian region, he now lives in Knoxville TN with his wonderful partner, and their dog Athena. Six months ago while Dave and Branden were at an event with friends and his now publisher Douglas McDaniel of Storyhaus media, Dave was inspired to work on this book, Cooking with Magic: The Psilocybin Cookbook. The book is a comprehensive recipe and how-to guide for cooking with and preparing food and drink using psilocybin mushrooms.David's main inspiration for this book was and is Psilocybin's positive impact in his life, and how adopting this powerful fungal ally into his weekly routine may have literally saved Dave's life. When he separated from the US Air Force in late 2016 David entered a civilian world that he was not prepared for. Plagued by depression, anxiety, and PTSD, David found himself on a series of anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications that did him little good.  So he began to look for alternatives.This is where Branden comes into this mushroom-filled picture. Branden introduced Dave to psilocybin for the first time, and after a few months of supervised theraputic use, and frequent guided trips Dave found himself in an entirely different and significantly healthier mental state. Now the pair spend their days concocting new and interesting ways to incorporate magic mushroom into their diet.So what's this book all about?  As all mushroom fans know, eating little fun-guys, as Dave and his partner Branden and I like to call them, can be a trying experience. As much as we love and appreciate them, neither of them enjoys the sensation of chewing on dried out, fibrous fungi stalks.  Our experiences learning to integrate small, measured quantities of shrooms into food and drink inspired us to collaborate in our kitchen on this definitive guide to cooking with psilocybin contaiing mushrooms. They hope that this book helps you experience your fun-guys in new, healthful and meaningful ways. With that in mind, they have decided to make all the recipes as health-conscious as possible—while still being delicious and a little indulgent from time to time. You’ll find that everything here has no added sugars and is lactose-free; we have also included gluten-free substitutions throughout.  Happy cooking, and many best wishes as you embark on your journey with food and fungi!What's up with cooking with Magic Mushrooms?The main way Dave explores and uses Magic Mushrooms is through food. He believes that by connecting psilocybin usage to cooking, we deepen the spiritual and emotional aspects of using this potent psychedelic. This is backed up by history itself. For at least as long as we have had fire, man has consumed Magic Mushrooms in various forms, whether it was Dionysian wines, brewed teas, or other ways lost to the ages.It makes sense that we should take the act of feeding yourself, your friends, and your family, something that for thousands of years was not only an act of necessity, but of love and sharing with your community, and bind our use of psychedelics to the purely human ritual of cooking and sharing food. In fact, Branden and Dave have grown quite fond of adapting their daily microdosing routine into the creation of pies, main dishes, drinks, and more. I have selected a handful of these recipes to share with the hope that it will inspire others to do the same.Why launch a crowdfund for the book?To put it simply, getting a book published is expensive, especially one with as many illustrations, and with as much color as this particular tome. So Dave is asking for your help. If you're interested in learning more about magic mushrooms, and how to prepare them in various dishes, drinks, concoctions, and cocktails then this is the book for you.

<p><strong>The Subtopic of Daughter and Father Relationships</strong></p>
<p><i>Ever wonder why single women or women in unfulfilling and even abusive relationships usually have abandonment or abusive issues with their father or male role model? </i></p>
<p>Studies have shown that well-fathered daughters are more likely to have relationships with men that are emotionally intimate and fulfilling whereas daughters of inadequate fathers tend to attract men like their fathers---unavailable or verbally/emotionally and sometimes even physically abusive.  Not only do fathers have great impact on their daughters’ relationships with men, but they generally have more impact than mothers do. Research also shows that dads may shape their daughters’ mental health and relationships in adulthood.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Notice &amp; Wonder</i> is a non-fiction book that explores the intersection of feedback and resilience. It provides insights into the layers and characteristics of effective feedback spaces and conversations in order to connect intention with impact and action. <br/><br/>My name is Mark Joy and I am the author of <i>Notice &amp; Wonder</i>. I wrote this book because when I was growing up, I often found myself in situations where I needed to give or receive feedback but I never learned how to do so effectively. Over the years, I've gathered useful tools and tactics from hands on experience and I now want to share and name what I’ve found to be aspects that support effective feedback conversations.<br/><br/>We all know feedback is important for growth and improvement. However, we’ve all been in situations where we felt overwhelmed by needing to give it, or experienced the uncomfortable pit in your stomach when receiving it. <i>Notice &amp; Wonder</i> is rooted in a resilient-based approach to engaging feedback.<br/><br/>Resilient-based feedback is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expansive in approach and thinking</li>
<li>Persistent in conversation and communication</li>
<li>Inclusive by design which ensures a sense of belonging</li>
<li>Compassionate in how listening happens</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new perspective and angle on how to navigate moments of giving or receiving feedback. In this book, I hope to share with you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for meaningful and effective communication. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you explore the ripple effects of feedback.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about resilient-based feedback, a framework for collaboration and community that stretches boundaries of creative possibility and strengthens the ability to adapt when giving or receiving input. It’s crucial to design with this framework in mind to ensure feedback spaces are rooted in expansive thinking, persistent conversation, inclusion and awareness, and compassionate listening.<br/><br/>You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>How an expert in child-friendly cities engages and empowers children in the designing of public spaces.</li>
<li>How an executive coaching thought leader intentionally creates contexts based on shared understanding of definitions and expectations.</li>
<li>How a mentor of mine infuses accountability and awareness in feedback spaces, and connects intention with impact.</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>You will love this book if you want to explore the neurological and psychological reactions associated with engaging feedback, to build awareness and capacity to expand your boundaries in these moments, and to gain insight into how resilient-based feedback gets its power from community and collaboration.<br/><br/><i>Notice &amp; Wonder</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to early career professionals and educators who want to look at building up their feedback muscles and exploring what makes for effective input, in a new way.<br/> </p>
<h3>The Book - <i>Notice &amp; Wonder</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. Part 1 explores why feedback often times is ineffective, how my experience with workplace bullying connects to feedback, and how taking a resilient-based approach to feedback can deepen the impact of it. Readers will learn about feedback’s history, barriers, and a framework to overcome these barriers.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 4-7. Part 2 explores the layers and characteristics of what go into meaningful and actionable input. Readers will gain insight into the resilient-based framework, and how the framework characteristics fit together and compliment one another.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 8-9. Part 3 focuses on how to apply resilient-based practices. Students/early career professionals will learn how to build up their feedback muscles, and educators/managers will learn how to ensure alignment between feedback intention and impact.</p>

Notice & Wonder is a non-fiction book that explores the intersection of feedback and resilience. It provides insights into the layers and characteristics of effective feedback spaces and conversations in order to connect intention with impact and action. My name is Mark Joy and I am the author of Notice & Wonder. I wrote this book because when I was growing up, I often found myself in situations where I needed to give or receive feedback but I never learned how to do so effectively. Over the years, I've gathered useful tools and tactics from hands on experience and I now want to share and name what I’ve found to be aspects that support effective feedback conversations.We all know feedback is important for growth and improvement. However, we’ve all been in situations where we felt overwhelmed by needing to give it, or experienced the uncomfortable pit in your stomach when receiving it. Notice & Wonder is rooted in a resilient-based approach to engaging feedback.Resilient-based feedback is:

Expansive in approach and thinking
Persistent in conversation and communication
Inclusive by design which ensures a sense of belonging
Compassionate in how listening happens

My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover a new perspective and angle on how to navigate moments of giving or receiving feedback. In this book, I hope to share with you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for meaningful and effective communication. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you explore the ripple effects of feedback.In this book, you'll learn about resilient-based feedback, a framework for collaboration and community that stretches boundaries of creative possibility and strengthens the ability to adapt when giving or receiving input. It’s crucial to design with this framework in mind to ensure feedback spaces are rooted in expansive thinking, persistent conversation, inclusion and awareness, and compassionate listening.You'll hear stories such as...

How an expert in child-friendly cities engages and empowers children in the designing of public spaces.
How an executive coaching thought leader intentionally creates contexts based on shared understanding of definitions and expectations.
How a mentor of mine infuses accountability and awareness in feedback spaces, and connects intention with impact.

You will love this book if you want to explore the neurological and psychological reactions associated with engaging feedback, to build awareness and capacity to expand your boundaries in these moments, and to gain insight into how resilient-based feedback gets its power from community and collaboration.Notice & Wonder is a nonfiction book that speaks to early career professionals and educators who want to look at building up their feedback muscles and exploring what makes for effective input, in a new way. 
The Book - Notice & Wonder

The book is written in 3 parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. Part 1 explores why feedback often times is ineffective, how my experience with workplace bullying connects to feedback, and how taking a resilient-based approach to feedback can deepen the impact of it. Readers will learn about feedback’s history, barriers, and a framework to overcome these barriers.Part 2 contains chapters 4-7. Part 2 explores the layers and characteristics of what go into meaningful and actionable input. Readers will gain insight into the resilient-based framework, and how the framework characteristics fit together and compliment one another.Part 3 contains chapters 8-9. Part 3 focuses on how to apply resilient-based practices. Students/early career professionals will learn how to build up their feedback muscles, and educators/managers will learn how to ensure alignment between feedback intention and impact.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Be the DJ of Your Career is a book that walks the reader through a series of interview-style conversations with random people about what they are doing to manage their careers. The reference to DJs is my fascination and belief that they, for the most part, seem to live, breathe, sleep, and re-awaken with relentless ingenuity, grit, and resourcefulness in a way that grows and compounds success in their career, and this book touches upon that during the myriad of random conversations.<br/><br/>My name is Rodney Jenkins and I am the author of Be the DJ of Your Career. I wrote this book because I have been inspired by the amazing, creative, positive, and resourceful wizardry of DJs and other people that I have interviewed to manage their careers successfully while being true to their values. As a volunteer career coach for many years, I feel that there is a great need for more inspiring and creative stories to awaken the “working“ reader to the reality that they have more power than they realize to transform, energize, and move their career forward or move it into a new direction.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that you control the music, you have the ability to influence others (DJ's would say move the crowd), and you have the power to move your career in new directions. It is the creative, resourceful, gritty, “out of box” thinker, aka “the inner DJ”, that needs to take residence in your mind and soul to help you reach deeper into yourself to guide you on taking the right steps to manage your career. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to be a fly on the wall so that you can witness purpose-driven conversations about managing careers with many fascinating people, escape the mundane of what you know, and let’s learn something from a few DJs and other engaging personalities that you will be able to learn alongside as you read the book to gain important career advice.<br/> </p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Journey of an Expat</i> focuses on the trials and triumphs of living abroad. It takes you through the adventures and misadventures of life as a foreigner and helps you truly understand what it means to be a global citizen in today’s world. <br/><br/>My name is Daisy Bugarin and I am the author of <i>Journey of an Expat</i>. I wrote this book because I found that the struggles I faced living abroad were not unique to me. The more people I connected with, the more common I realized these problems were and the more I wondered why no one ever talks about them. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what it means to be a well-rounded member of the global community. Through this guide, I wish to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for cross-cultural exploration and understanding. Ultimately, I hope that you will learn from us—the people who have lived abroad for years or even decades. We want you to learn from our experiences so that you don’t end up making the same mistakes.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the insider mindset and how to connect to your new community in a meaningful way. <i><strong>You'll hear stories such as...</strong></i><ul>
<li>Connecting with a veteran from the Japanese Imperial Army. </li>
<li>Raising third-culture kids in the horn of Africa</li>
<li>Discovering life off of autopilot in Chinese Venice. </li>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span class=""agtext""><span lang=""EN-US"">Tom Hurndall, a young
British photojournalist and peace worker, was shot in the head in Gaza in April
2003 whilst carrying a small group of stranded Palestinian children to safety. He died nine months later
in a London hospital. This book follows his journals and begins on 15th February 2003 in London, where the huge demonstration by millions in
the run up to the Iraq war had given 21-year-old Tom an increased curiosity and
desire to journey to the Middle East. Soon afterwards, initially as an
observer alongside the Human Shields, he left with a passion to make a
difference, to record and photograph the truth for himself.</span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""""><span class=""agtext""><span lang=""EN-US"">We follow his journey
first from Baghdad, then to Amman and the Al-Rweished refugee camp in Jordan,
to Jerusalem, and finally on to the town of Rafah in southern Gaza close to the Egyptian
border, where US peaceworker Rachel Corrie had been killed just weeks
previously. On April 11th, unarmed and wearing an internationally recognizable
orange peacekeeper jacket, he was severely wounded, never to regain
consciousness.</span></span></p><p></p><p></p>

family, and the Publication Date of the book will be April 2011, to coincide with the eighth anniversary of the shooting.<span style="""">  </span>Tom’s story has touched many, and the important publication

risk taker and I think we learn so much from risk takers.</span></p><p></p>

about it. Photography and journalism, going out there and recording and
bringing back the story was something that he thought was going to be his
future.....</span><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">The way he reacted was not 
just as a photojournalist but as a human being. The
very fact that his last moment of consciousness was as a human being 
responding
to the needs of a child in desperate danger is so telling, and so much 
at the
heart of Tom and at the heart of this book. </span></p>

photographers in the world
have been war photographers and photojournalists and I think Tom 
probably set
out in some way to follow in those footsteps and it’s something which is
honoured in the book. And I think that what’s unique about this is 
you’re not
just buying a book you’re kind of investing in the continuation of

the work done with text. We met with the parents of Tom 3 or 4 years
ago, and we’ve been working on this for a long time. Unfortunately effectively
what happens is that as you can imagine these are not best-sellers, and they are
the most difficult niche of books to produce and make it happen in terms of
cost; printing in four colours its not just a book of text in one colour. But when
I came across this material and Tom’s story I felt really obliged to get in
touch and do my best.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-style: italic;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 11pt;"">Gigi Giannuzzi</span><br/><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""font-size: 11pt;""></span></p><p></p><p></p>

Trolley Books received a special commendation from the Kraszna-Krausz Book
Awards for its outstanding contribution to photography book publishing. This
year Alixandra Fazzina, the author of Trolley's most recent publication 'A

Tom Hurndall, a young
British photojournalist and peace worker, was shot in the head in Gaza in April
2003 whilst carrying a small group of stranded Palestinian children to safety. He died nine months later
in a London hospital. This book follows his journals and begins on 15th February 2003 in London, where the huge demonstration by millions in
the run up to the Iraq war had given 21-year-old Tom an increased curiosity and
desire to journey to the Middle East. Soon afterwards, initially as an
observer alongside the Human Shields, he left with a passion to make a
difference, to record and photograph the truth for himself.
 
We follow his journey
first from Baghdad, then to Amman and the Al-Rweished refugee camp in Jordan,
to Jerusalem, and finally on to the town of Rafah in southern Gaza close to the Egyptian
border, where US peaceworker Rachel Corrie had been killed just weeks
previously. On April 11th, unarmed and wearing an internationally recognizable
orange peacekeeper jacket, he was severely wounded, never to regain
consciousness.
 
The book we are publishing follows Tom’s life and thoughts in the final weeks leading up to the shooting, through his photographs and extracts from his diary, emails and poems. It is realised through collaboration with the Hurndall
family, and the Publication Date of the book will be April 2011, to coincide with the eighth anniversary of the shooting.  Tom’s story has touched many, and the important publication
of his journals also follows the BAFTA-nominated 2008 Channel 4
film-documentary ‘The Shooting of Thomas Hurndall’. His work has also been published in the international press including the Guardian, The Independent and the Times.
 
The esteemed writer on
the Middle East Robert Fisk has already written the preface to the book, which
was published in The Independent newspaper in 2009. Read HERE

WHAT WE HAVE DONE SO FAR
On Friday 26th
November 2010, the day before what would have been Tom’s 29th birthday, we organised a panel talk at the
Arab British Chamber of Commerce in London, to discuss Tom's work and the
importance of publishing his book.The panel included:• Jocelyn Hurndall – Tom’s mother• John Sweeney (chair) -
BBC Panorama journalist of 2003 documentary ‘When Killing is Easy’ and
The Independent article Silenced
Witnesses• Anthony Hurndall – Tom’s father• Mohammed Qeshta - who was
with Tom when we was shot and worked for the International Solidarity Movement in Gaza• Rowan Joffe and Simon Block - Director and Screenwriter of Channel 4 BAFTA-nominated film
documentary The
Shooting of Thomas Hurndall• Gigi Giannuzzi - publisher and founder of Trolley Books

this way of looking at things, this way of understanding things and he set out
to observe, to look at something - but to understand it in a truthful way....Tom was an unusual person 
and he was a
risk taker and I think we learn so much from risk takers. 
I’ve learnt so
much through looking through Tom’s eyes, and I hope other people who 
aren’t so
familiar with the situation in the Middle East will try to look through 
Tom’s
eyes.Jocelyn Hurndall
 
Tom started on this journey to be a photojournalist, and he was really excited
about it. Photography and journalism, going out there and recording and
bringing back the story was something that he thought was going to be his
future.....The way he reacted was not 
just as a photojournalist but as a human being. The
very fact that his last moment of consciousness was as a human being 
responding
to the needs of a child in desperate danger is so telling, and so much 
at the
heart of Tom and at the heart of this book. 
Anthony Hurndall
As
filmmakers, what’s uniquely inspiring to me about books of this ilk is that
they are real people, in real moments, and significant moments, moments of
suffering, or moments of injustice, moments that are crying out to be recorded.....Some of the greatest 
photographers in the world
have been war photographers and photojournalists and I think Tom 
probably set
out in some way to follow in those footsteps and it’s something which is
honoured in the book. And I think that what’s unique about this is 
you’re not
just buying a book you’re kind of investing in the continuation of
photoreportage, and I think that’s a 
fantastically
important thing to do.Rowan Joffe
 
This is an almost rare pearl in terms of how integrated the photography is with
the work done with text. We met with the parents of Tom 3 or 4 years
ago, and we’ve been working on this for a long time. Unfortunately effectively
what happens is that as you can imagine these are not best-sellers, and they are
the most difficult niche of books to produce and make it happen in terms of
cost; printing in four colours its not just a book of text in one colour. But when
I came across this material and Tom’s story I felt really obliged to get in
touch and do my best.Gigi Giannuzzi

THE BOOK: 
ISBN: 978-1-904563-51-8Photography / Current AffairsHardback, 196 pp190
 x 260 mm, 7.48 x 10.24 in.100 colour and b/wDesign: Fruitmachine£24.99
 / $40 / €29.95Publication Date April 2011Here is a dummy of the book so far (designed by our designers Martin and Wai at Fruitmachine). Nothing is final, it's just to give you an idea... WHO ARE TROLLEY BOOKS? 
Trolley Books have
worked with some of the most respected photojournalists in the world, often
focusing on underexposed issues and abuses of power around the world, from
conflicts to unique stories in photojournalism. Most notably Trolley has published books by Philip Jones Griffiths, famous for his work in Viet Nam and on Agent Orange in particular, and other
Magnum photographers Alex
Majoli, Paolo Pellegrin, Thomas Dworzak, Carl de Keyzer, as well as Stanley Greene, Tom Stoddart, and Nina Berman and others. In 2005
Trolley Books received a special commendation from the Kraszna-Krausz Book
Awards for its outstanding contribution to photography book publishing. This
year Alixandra Fazzina, the author of Trolley's most recent publication 'A
Million Shillings - Escape from Somalia', was awarded the UNHCR Nansen Award,
the highest accolade they award for work with refugees and the first time it
has ever been given to a journalist or photographer.

 
FINANCES
The campaign will
receive pledges in US dollars but Indiegogo is a completely international platform
so that people from anywhere around the world can campaign and pledge, you do not need to have a US bank account. All pledges will then be converted into British Pounds in our Paypal account. Trolley
has set up a dedicated UK bank account specifically for this campaign, which
will receive all the pledges made on this page securely via Paypal, so you know that every single
penny and dollar will be put towards making this book happen.
 
Thank for your
support so far, with your help we can completely raise the $34,000 
 needed to
cover the cost of printing 3000 copies of the book. If we don’t reach this
target then the book will not be able to go into these next stages of
production, so please pledge all you can, but if we do not reach our target we will aim to print less copies and keep looking for funds to print the book. For example 2000 copies can be printed with $27,840 1000 copies can be printed with $22,170However the less copies that are made the more expensive per book it becomes, as well as significantly reducing the number of copies that can enter worldwide distribution. 3000 copies is our target! Should we raise more than this, as well as any small profit made from the book sales once it is in the shops, we will donate the money to the Trolley Charitable Trust, our charity which supports long-term photojournalistic projects and helps the development of photographers such as Tom.
 
We have some fantastic
pledges for everyone, so please watch out for more updates for the campaign, and please start pledging and see the rewards
involved in becoming part of this important book.
Many thanks!Gigi Giannuzzi, Publisher and Founder& Hannah Watson, Managing Editorand everyone at Trolley BooksWWW.TROLLEYBOOKS.COMFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK TROLLEY BOOKSTHE MIDDLE EAST JOURNALS OF TOM HURNDALLAND TWITTER

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! </p>
<p>I'm Jennifer Young, Andy's step-daughter, (Jacci's oldest). I have been driving myself crazy trying to think of some way to help my mom and Andy out while they are going through this very hard time, emotionally, mentally, physically, and financially. That's when I stumbled across this website and thought to myself, ""HEY! Maybe this will be my answer! I'll give it a try!""</p>
<p>For those of you that aren't familiar with my mom and Andy's predicament here is an overview:</p>
<p>Andy had a massive heart attack at my mom's side of the family family reunion at a State Park outside of Atlanta in a cabin in the woods. Needless to say they hardly had any phone reception and had an awful time tring to explain to the 911 dispatcher exactly where they were. They dispatched a helicopter to get him to the ER faster but at the time Andy weighed too much to fly. When they finally got to the ER he was already dead but the AMAZING ER staff at Emory managed to bring him back to us. Once they had his heart pumping again he was in a coma for 16 days and Doctor's didn't expect him to live through the night.. About a month later he came home and was doing better. This was 4 years ago. </p>
<p>Since then he has had several problems, including a few more heart attacks and a few strokes. Just recently they put him on the waiting list for a heart after a 4 year wait. Two months ago they put a LVAD in to pump his heart for him. Last week, he had a few small strokes so the Doctor's decided yesterday (9/5/13) to bump him up to the top of the list for a heart. </p>
<p>Seeing how they live in Savannah and have to travel to Atlanta often; their funds are pretty much exasperated since my mom obviously can't work a steady job because she has be with him and they only get so much a month from his Military retirement. </p>

I wrote this book because I was a college student who decided that I wasn’t passionate about what I was studying anymore, which was healthcare. Lost in the sea of possibilities I tried many different industries and finally stumbled into marketing. I loved the industry and was instantly hooked on the massive impact that I could have. However, I couldn't find any practical resource that broke down marketing into easily understandable basics. I decided if this doesn’t exist, then I have to create that what I needed. The more I explored, I stumbled a set of principles that have made the top marketers successful.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that there are a set of principles that anyone can apply to become a successful marketer. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for marketing in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you market more effectively and comfortably online.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about marketing and branding in the modern digital ecosystem:</p><p>The way that VaynerMedia’s CCO finds a brands role in culture.</p><p>How to use analytical storytelling from world renowned digital marketer Dennis Yu.</p><p>Utilizing practical philosophy to achieve your key performance indicators from Wendy Stevens.</p><p><br/>You will love this book if you have been curious on how to leverage digital media to amplify your brand, movement or company but have been deadlocked because of not knowing where to start.<br/><br/>We're all Marketers is a non-fiction book that speaks to entrepreneurs and new marketers who are searching for the tools to enable them to successfully market and brand for the first time.</p><p> </p><p>The Book - We're All Marketers</p>The book is written in 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + additional chapters.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>When The Going Gets Tough</i>: A framework to help medical error survivors make their voice heard in the Patient Safety community and empowers them to move the healthcare system towards a future with less medical errors.<br/><br/>My name is Berenda Sayadof and I am the author of When The Going Gets Tough. I wrote it because I’m very passionate about improving healthcare for patients and I strongly believe that patients can be part of the solution to lessening medical errors in the system. I’m a firm believer that the healthcare system and patients can work together to create a better tomorrow and the stories I cover in my book are testimonies to do just that.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that one person can change the fate of a complex system simply with determination. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for Patient Safety in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you make the change you want in the healthcare system so that the next person after you that goes into the system won’t fall victim to the same medical error.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how the system and patients can work in unison for a more improved reality of patient safety, and how other individuals thrived in different types of hardships to get them to a place of peace and closure. You'll read many interesting stories including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donna Penner - A patient from Manitoba, Canada, shows us how her determination after a traumatic medical error helped her get through barriers that were holding down her maximum potential in making a change in the system, eventually breaking through the barriers and finding her own voice in Patient Safety.</li>
<li>Dr. Amy Nakajima - This physician from Ontario, Canada failed to recognize a rare condition that a new mother who had just given birth had, and the death of that patient almost led Dr. Nakajima to give up the entire career ahead of her. Instead, Dr. Nakajima spoke up on the fear and stigma associated with healthcare providers admitting to mistakes and now is an advocate for Patient Safety and is encouraging more discussions on medical error.</li>
<li>Sue Sheridan - A mother from Idaho, U.S., endured the loss of her husband due to a late cancer diagnosis and witnessed her newborn son develop cerebral palsy after constant negligence from healthcare providers about her concerns. These onsets of medical errors didn’t stop Sue from forming a community of mothers with similar cases and testifying before the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, demanding better testing of newborns for symptoms leading up to cerebral palsy. Her fierceness and passion is worth noting and looking up to for inspiration on your own unique situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you have a story to put out there and want to do something about it! <i>When The Going Gets Tough</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to medical error survivors and fellow Patient Safety advocates who are looking at finding a voice in healthcare and making a dent in the system for the first time. The key, however, is remembering to work with the system and not against it, and this book will explain just how to do that.</p>
<h2>The Book - When the Going Gets Tough</h2>The book is written in 3 Parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction and chapters 1 to 4. This section introduces my reasons for wanting to raise more awareness on patient safety among patients as well as breaks down common misconceptions that patients can have before they start their advocating journeys. As well, I explain theories and research that has been going on behind patient safety in the last 40 years so you can be prepped with as much knowledge about the nuts and bolts of the healthcare system and Patient Safety as a whole.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains Chapters 5-8. This section introduces the patient portion of Patient Safety and is where you’ll start hearing about patient stories. The stories found here revolve around grief, and the different forms of grief that I’ve found to linger after medical error. You will have the opportunity to not only learn about how patients got through their own types of grief after the medical error they experienced, but you’ll also recognize the space within yourself to grow and take action based on your <i>own</i> grief and other feelings that came about after your medical error experience. Forgiveness, strength and acceptance are some of the many takeaways from this section, and each chapters offers an entire experience of healing.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains Chapters 9-11. This part of the book is where exciting transformations are already beginning to take place! By this point you will have a new and improved outlook on the healthcare system and you’ll learn about ways in which you can take part in advocating for Patient Safety. This empowering section talks about the importance of vulnerability and how to embrace your medical error experience in a way that can charge you to move forward. I highlight the importance of having faith in the system even after a negative experience with it, so that this newfound faith will open doors for you to become an advocate and leader in Patient Safety.<br/> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> <ul>

<h2>About The Author</h2>
<p><strong>Berenda Sayadof</strong> is a graduate from Queen’s University with a Bachelor of Science in Biology but she is a writer and advocate for Patient Safety at heart. She is looking to extend her studies into a Master’s for Quality Improvement to broaden her knowledge on Patient Safety and use it as a tool to make a deeper, positive impact in hospitals and medical settings nation-wide. Berenda is always looking for ways to raise awareness on the world of Patient Safety and loves to discuss different perspectives in the field, so if you have a couple of hours at hand and a knack for quality improvement, reach out to her and be part of the discussion!<br/><br/>Berenda wrote this book initially out of frustration as to why she hadn’t heard about Patient Safety much earlier than she did. She then vowed to raise more awareness about it. Her main source of inspiration was <i>To Err Is Human: A Patient Safety Documentary</i>, a documentary highlighting Sue Sheridan’s story, a mother who lost her husband and endured the journey of her son developing cerebral palsy all due to preventative medical errors. What started off simply as Berenda hoping that someone out there would write a book raising awareness on more patient stories, ended up being her own passion project that she’s been working on since January 2019.<br/><br/>If she’s not talking about ways to lessen medical error in hospitals and medicine, Berenda is most likely talking about the the Global Fisheries Crisis, the beauty of sloths, or her toy poodle, Pumpkin: Berenda’s pride and joy. She is a writer at heart and truly believes in the power of words. One of the best experiences she had on her journey of publishing this book was the opportunity to combine her passions of writing and patient safety to create something that has the power to impact people’s lives for the better.<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Berenda at bsayadof@gmail.com and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/berendas-001/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/berendas-001/</a>.</p>

About The Author
Berenda Sayadof is a graduate from Queen’s University with a Bachelor of Science in Biology but she is a writer and advocate for Patient Safety at heart. She is looking to extend her studies into a Master’s for Quality Improvement to broaden her knowledge on Patient Safety and use it as a tool to make a deeper, positive impact in hospitals and medical settings nation-wide. Berenda is always looking for ways to raise awareness on the world of Patient Safety and loves to discuss different perspectives in the field, so if you have a couple of hours at hand and a knack for quality improvement, reach out to her and be part of the discussion!Berenda wrote this book initially out of frustration as to why she hadn’t heard about Patient Safety much earlier than she did. She then vowed to raise more awareness about it. Her main source of inspiration was To Err Is Human: A Patient Safety Documentary, a documentary highlighting Sue Sheridan’s story, a mother who lost her husband and endured the journey of her son developing cerebral palsy all due to preventative medical errors. What started off simply as Berenda hoping that someone out there would write a book raising awareness on more patient stories, ended up being her own passion project that she’s been working on since January 2019.If she’s not talking about ways to lessen medical error in hospitals and medicine, Berenda is most likely talking about the the Global Fisheries Crisis, the beauty of sloths, or her toy poodle, Pumpkin: Berenda’s pride and joy. She is a writer at heart and truly believes in the power of words. One of the best experiences she had on her journey of publishing this book was the opportunity to combine her passions of writing and patient safety to create something that has the power to impact people’s lives for the better.For more information you can connect with Berenda at bsayadof@gmail.com and https://www.linkedin.com/in/berendas-001/.
Risks & Challenges The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
Please Share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family and network. Please use #WhenTheGoingGetsTough and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press so we can help amplify your efforts.
You can easily share my Pre-Sale Campaign Page via Indiegogo at the top of the page
Please share my book to 5 friends, family members, or co-workers who you think would enjoy it. Please do this as a text message or Direct Message on social media.

Thank you so much of all of your love and support!Thanks again,Berenda Sayadof",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

I was the formal blogger for that conference, meaning I attended the event and did my best to cover as much of the goings on as I could. I'm very honored to have been invited <i>back</i> by the folks from Meta Integral to blog ITC 2015: ""<a href=""https://foundation.metaintegral.org/ITC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Using Integrative Meta Theories to Catalyze Effective Change</a>."" </p>

<p>I research things like the modern consciousness culture, integral theories, and the evolution of consciousness.</p>
<p>I'm also passionate about the idea of a ""<b>planetary culture</b>.""

<p>I've found myself personally invested in the notion of a ""trans-lineage"" integral worldview – building on the Kosmopolitan theme from ITC 2013 – exploring the meaning of ""integral"" in the writings of Sri Aurobindo, Jean Gebser, Ken Wilber and further in writers like William Irwin Thompson, Haridas Chauduri and the Jesuit theologian Teilhard de Chardin. I believe in the philosophical, spiritual and imaginative possibilities of an ""integral"" consciousness. Yet, I also believe such an emergent worldview mustn't be assimilative, but an <i>assemblage</i>. It must shine forth. Show itself in the disparate parts as a rhizome. My hunch, if you could call it that, is that an ""integral worldview"" is traceable in the moments of utmost fluidity and ""in-betweenness.""</p>
<p>The folks at Meta Integral are using this conference as an opportunity to call into question the notion of a ""meta theory,"" proper. That's why I'm very excited to be blogging ITC 2015 once again, and you can see my inaugural post, ""<a href=""http://jeremydanieljohnson.com/2015/05/11/the-unthinkable-present-blogging-at-itc2015/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Unthinkable Present: Blogging at ITC 2015</a>."" </p>

I met a lot of brilliant, shining folks at ITC2013 – especially through my fundraising campaign. I intend to thank everyone who assists in whatever way they feel is right. But, I see this as an opportunity to connect with you. So...

<h2>SO WHAT IS FREEWAY?</h2>
<p>Freeway is an innovative small group study (workbook and DVD) that helps you encounter God's radical grace in your life.</p>
<p>Unlike any other small group study, Freeway is unique in how you learn about yourself and the love of God. The workbook and DVD delivers creative excercises, experiential activities, spiritual assessments, and a engaging group study you do every week with your small group.</p>
<p>Freeway is hard hitting, deep soul searching work made simple. It's not academic, complicated or self-help mumbo jumbo. It's premise is simple: through admitting our hurts and struggles, God can make us whole and free.   </p>
<h2>LEARN HOW TO...</h2>
<p><em>-Kick perfectionism to the curb and learn to be OK with being OK.<br/></em></p>
<p><em>-Decide to let your identity and value be shaped by a loving God.<br/></em></p>
<p><em>-Stop focusing on your hurt and embrace your opportunity to give back.</em></p>
<p><em>-Break cycles of shame and feeling like you're ""never enough.""</em></p>
<p><em>-Discover how pain, fear and our hurts hijack our God story.</em></p>
<p><em>-Finally allow yourself to be loved by the one who loves you most.</em></p><p><em></em></p><p><em><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/363296/files/20140211093930-Screen_Shot_2013-07-19_at_4.55.24_PM.png?1392140370"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p><p></p><p><em></em></p><p><em><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/363290/files/20140211093720-Screen_Shot_2014-01-29_at_10.38.59_AM.png?1392140240"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p><p><em><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/363292/files/20140211093738-Screen_Shot_2014-01-29_at_10.39.18_AM.png?1392140258"" src="""" style=""""/></em></p><em><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/363294/files/20140211093817-Screen_Shot_2014-01-29_at_10.39.43_AM.png?1392140297"" src="""" style=""""/></p></em><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><br/></p>
<h2>1 WORKBOOK</h2>
<p>We've blown up the typical, boring small group study guide and created something fresh and fun. Inside the Freeway workbook is everything you need to do the 6 week study. Unlike any other workbook, this 100 page, full color guide leads you through each session and will be filled with your thoughts and words and personal discoveries. Filled with <strong>innovative exercises, simple personal assessments, engaging small group questions</strong>, and a space to journal, scribble and draw your discoveries.</p>
<h2>6 SHORT TEACHING VIDEOS</h2>
<p>Mike Foster kicks off your small group gathering in a relaxed and chill way. Forget the typical religious expert and Mr. know-it-all stuff, Mike shares some simple ideas and stories from his Freeway group to get the conversation flowing. Filmed in San Diego, CA by <strong>Prolifik Films</strong> with music by Grammy award winner <strong>David Hodges </strong><em>(Evanescence, Kelli Clarkson, Christina Perri)</em><strong>  and Ryan O'Neal from Sleeping At Last </strong><em>(Twilight)</em></p>

For more information People of the Second Chance, click here.
SO WHAT IS FREEWAY?
Freeway is an innovative small group study (workbook and DVD) that helps you encounter God's radical grace in your life.
Unlike any other small group study, Freeway is unique in how you learn about yourself and the love of God. The workbook and DVD delivers creative excercises, experiential activities, spiritual assessments, and a engaging group study you do every week with your small group.
Freeway is hard hitting, deep soul searching work made simple. It's not academic, complicated or self-help mumbo jumbo. It's premise is simple: through admitting our hurts and struggles, God can make us whole and free.   
LEARN HOW TO...
-Kick perfectionism to the curb and learn to be OK with being OK.
-Decide to let your identity and value be shaped by a loving God.
-Stop focusing on your hurt and embrace your opportunity to give back.
-Break cycles of shame and feeling like you're ""never enough.""
-Discover how pain, fear and our hurts hijack our God story.
-Finally allow yourself to be loved by the one who loves you most. 
1 WORKBOOK
We've blown up the typical, boring small group study guide and created something fresh and fun. Inside the Freeway workbook is everything you need to do the 6 week study. Unlike any other workbook, this 100 page, full color guide leads you through each session and will be filled with your thoughts and words and personal discoveries. Filled with innovative exercises, simple personal assessments, engaging small group questions, and a space to journal, scribble and draw your discoveries.
6 SHORT TEACHING VIDEOS
Mike Foster kicks off your small group gathering in a relaxed and chill way. Forget the typical religious expert and Mr. know-it-all stuff, Mike shares some simple ideas and stories from his Freeway group to get the conversation flowing. Filmed in San Diego, CA by Prolifik Films with music by Grammy award winner David Hodges (Evanescence, Kelli Clarkson, Christina Perri)  and Ryan O'Neal from Sleeping At Last (Twilight)

<h3>My name is Angie and I'm a author!</h3>
<p>Hello, everyone my name is Angela Peters I am the author of Heavenly poems books and memorbillia.  I was born with cerebral palsy and through a series of challenging events I was temporarily left broken and unmotivated to try to succeede but God had a bigger plan for me and the he awakend the desire to find success and happiness in my life.  It is through God that I have gained the drive and been blessed with people who have eagerly supported me and my endevarors that I now have hope for a better future. I now run a micro business where I create and publish my own books, I sell heavenly poem related merchandise and I travel throughout the community reading my heavenly poems poetry in hopes that I may effect the lives of those I meet in such a uplifiting fashion as those who have worked with and blessed me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I do:</p>
<p>It's been a difficult joureny but after learning to believe in myself and the potenential that I possess, I have, with the help of loved ones, created my own micro business called Heavenly Poems.  Through Heavenly Poems I am able to reach out to many people with my poetry books, motivational book marks and other prouducts.  Creating Heavenly Poems has taught me that my life is just as valuable as anyone eles's and I can achieve happiness despite any physical limitations.  This is a belief that I hope to protray in all my poetry, books etc.  I want others to know that they can have a purpose driven life and not a life of mediocrity based on any pre-condition or attitude.  The ability to change is in you!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Goal: </p>
<p>Traveling with cerebral palsy is very challenging and traveling in an average vehicle is impossible for me, so I travel via ""Your Ride"" or handicap accessible vehicle's that can hold me and my chair.  Sometimes I can also get the assitance for traveling out of the city with the help of the local ambulance service but that too is very costly.  Costing around $60.00 per trip!  Needless to say, I need my goal to be reched in order to travel to various locations to both read my poetry and sell my Heavenly Poems prodcuts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Printing-on-demand.</p>
<p>Aside from traveling exspenses I also need to raise funds to publish and print my books, book marks and other various products I've created.  I work with an independent Print-on-demand company and I pay everything out of my own personal finances which is very limited. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Expenses:</p>
<p>Handicap accessible vehicles: $60-100 per transport.</p>
<p>printing cost: $50 to cover cost for supplies and printing cost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prizes:</p>
<p>I created a variety of prizes to let you know that what you donate is appreciated.  I can't continue my dream without the support of great people like you. So please donate from the heart and check out the great prizes listed! I'm looking forward to sending out the rewards!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note:  Due to my lack of my mobility I will require the assitance of my loved ones and staff to assist me in printing and mailing the prizes once the fundraising is complete. So please be patient with me.</p>

<p>My partner, Dr. Diego Giubertoni, and I more than a year ago, made a website (<strong>Writing’s Home</strong>) where people can download for free e-books fallen into the Public domain through the expiration of the terms of authorial protection, as well as the e-books uploaded by users (the uploader must be the author). Actually, <a href=""http://www.writingshome.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">we</a> allow people to publish everything they have written: first of all people have to create a Writing's Home account then they can publish online all their writings so everyone can read them all over the world. In case there are some writings particularly interesting both for <strong>Writing’s Home</strong> and for other users of the site we will offer to the author a publishing contract, so he can earn money doing what he likes. This is how it works: anyone interested has the opportunity to put their ad in the users' writings, in this way the most successful writers will have the opportunity to make money thanks to the advertisement that will be inserted inside their works.</p>
<p><strong>WRITING’S HOME PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p>As you understand, the purpose of <strong>Writing’s Home</strong> is to allow anyone to publish his writings for free and allow readers to download and read for free all the files uploaded on the website.</p>
<p><strong>WRITING’S HOME DATA</strong></p>
<p>Now, on our website we have more than 400 e-books, (half in English and half in Italian), most of them are classics fallen into the Public domain (for example we have all Shakespeare’s literary works), but the e-books uploaded by the user are growing, in effect we are working hard to discover new talent to publish their writings. The accesses to <strong>Writing’s Home</strong> are rising day by day (in January 1412 single users visited <a href=""http://www.writingshome.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.writingshome.com</a>, accesses in February increased by 30% compared to January and in March accesses are increasing by 30% compared to February), so we decided to improve the website.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO IMPROVE WRITING’S HOME</strong></p>
<p>We would like to do over the layout. We believe the accesses and the uploads will increase if the site is graphically more beautiful. For these reasons we need to hire a web designer (we are not able to make better graphic), we chose Mrs. Laura Gargiulo who made these websites: (i) <a href=""http://www.vetrotec.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.vetrotec.com/</a>; (ii) <a href=""http://www.neurostemcell.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.neurostemcell.org/</a>; and much more.</p>
<p>This work is very expensive and we don’t have enough money to pay the web designer, so if you believe in our project and if you would like to contribute to increase the accesses, therefore people upload a lot of e-book and you can read for free new e-books, please make a donation, we appreciate your amazing act!</p>
<p>If we raise extra money we will use them to buy ad on Google and on Facebook, consequently Writing’s Home will be more popular and there will be a lot of e-books to download and to read for free.</p>
<p>For further details please visit <strong><a href=""http://www.writingshome.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.writingshome.com</a></strong>!</p></div>","WHO WE ARE
My partner, Dr. Diego Giubertoni, and I more than a year ago, made a website (Writing’s Home) where people can download for free e-books fallen into the Public domain through the expiration of the terms of authorial protection, as well as the e-books uploaded by users (the uploader must be the author). Actually, we allow people to publish everything they have written: first of all people have to create a Writing's Home account then they can publish online all their writings so everyone can read them all over the world. In case there are some writings particularly interesting both for Writing’s Home and for other users of the site we will offer to the author a publishing contract, so he can earn money doing what he likes. This is how it works: anyone interested has the opportunity to put their ad in the users' writings, in this way the most successful writers will have the opportunity to make money thanks to the advertisement that will be inserted inside their works.
WRITING’S HOME PURPOSE
As you understand, the purpose of Writing’s Home is to allow anyone to publish his writings for free and allow readers to download and read for free all the files uploaded on the website.
WRITING’S HOME DATA
Now, on our website we have more than 400 e-books, (half in English and half in Italian), most of them are classics fallen into the Public domain (for example we have all Shakespeare’s literary works), but the e-books uploaded by the user are growing, in effect we are working hard to discover new talent to publish their writings. The accesses to Writing’s Home are rising day by day (in January 1412 single users visited www.writingshome.com, accesses in February increased by 30% compared to January and in March accesses are increasing by 30% compared to February), so we decided to improve the website.
HOW TO IMPROVE WRITING’S HOME
We would like to do over the layout. We believe the accesses and the uploads will increase if the site is graphically more beautiful. For these reasons we need to hire a web designer (we are not able to make better graphic), we chose Mrs. Laura Gargiulo who made these websites: (i) http://www.vetrotec.com/; (ii) http://www.neurostemcell.org/; and much more.
This work is very expensive and we don’t have enough money to pay the web designer, so if you believe in our project and if you would like to contribute to increase the accesses, therefore people upload a lot of e-book and you can read for free new e-books, please make a donation, we appreciate your amazing act!
If we raise extra money we will use them to buy ad on Google and on Facebook, consequently Writing’s Home will be more popular and there will be a lot of e-books to download and to read for free.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><strong>Pendulum</strong> is a magnificent composition of stories about heritage and character.  This book explores the human heritage of thought, viewing how extreme ideals glorify violence. It exposes our discomfort with the inevitable, inviting us to live in momentum accord with our complex world and lives. By uniquely aligning stories of African descendants, Pendulum calls for a consciously humane bond of character, not form. In this book, we learn courage from leaders, purpose from freedom fighters, humility from people we call heroes and resilience from rebels who become the change they seek. Pendulum is for lovers of poetry, history, psychology, philosophy, entrepreneurship, and self-help books about causing good trouble. <br/><br/><strong>My name is Bruce Sakindi</strong> and I am the author of Pendulum. I wrote this book to bridge the lives of Africans everywhere by demonstrating how both Africa and Africans have always been uncontestedly valuable to humanity. The entire world indwells in a destructive loot psychology that Africa is secondary and by default, as so are its descendants. This sentiment is exhaustively untrue and shall stand no more.<br/><br/><strong>My hope is </strong>that, in reading this book that we assume the responsibility to do better and be better, by any means necessary.<br/><br/><strong>I want you</strong> to see this book as an opportunity to engage with your conscious forms of egoic and caste superiority. I wish for you to escape from your mundane conscious negligence about the oneness in our being and to learn alongside the heroic revolutionaries and freedom fighters of our times. Pendulum is about awakening and emboldening an inner space within us that is earthshaking, ego killing, and spiritually transforming our human bond into a deeply uniting, truthful, and fruitful being.</p>
<p><strong>In this book</strong>, you'll also join in me using language to render distinct aspects of the lessons beyond through poems like:</p>
<p><u>T.e.t.h.e.r.e.d. Canvas ""We sink our kin in pieces for peace."" </u></p>
<ul><li>Tethered canvas is about the space where our being is split between the known which is more pleasurable than the pain of and the unknown.  It feels for the broken parts of ourselves that we hate the most. The parts which we cannot show to the world. It is about our desire to what is near and familial. It is about how desperately we hold onto that peace of certainty, so much so that if a piece of it splits, the fear within us, sinks us.</li></ul>
<p><u>Isano Ku Isonga "" Being African and human is finding a balance between fantasy and reality""</u></p>
<ul><li>This poem is about the bridge between seeking validation of African worth and actually realizing its irrepressible existence. In Kinyarwanda, 'Isano Ku Isonga' translates to 'Oneness at Peak'.</li></ul>
<p><u>Poetry "" A foul tool and a fine remedy""</u></p>
<ul><li>How can one thing also be two different things? Much alike Tethered Canvas and Isano Ku Isonga, Poetry illustrates how the known can coexist with the unknown or how the dark can coexist the light. The analogy of Pendulum telling about an unshaken momentum between two dual and extreme opposites. </li></ul>
<p><u><strong>​FOR ALL:</strong></u></p>
<p>You will love this book if you are a student of the universe, passionate about understanding the legacy contribution of the African Continent and its descendants towards global revolutions. Pendulum is for every person willing to shift into a conscious sharing of pain with the aim to find oneness within vulnerable and uncomfortable truths. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that [Pendulum] inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who am I worthy to become?</li>
<li> Why is my world also your world? And how do we find a bipartisanship in our being and living?</li>
<li>Where are we now, how did we get here, and where are we going?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing [collusive normalcy, unconscious conformity, and identity reconstruction ] will change us all for the better.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - [Pendulum]</h3>
<p><br/>The book is written in 2 Parts....<br/><br/>Part [1] contains the introduction + additional chapters about the mediocre normalcy from which identities are constructed. Pendulum begins by leading an explosive discovery into the Eugenicist Psychology which emphasizes on biological superiority of certain human kinds. As a trajectory to purifying humanity, methods of religious doctrines, scientific human experiments, social, economic, and political motives subsequently result in a traumatic ""us against them"". This education legacy of passing on human trauma is copped with by a conscious conformity to structures of in-group identities. And by abiding to this collusive obedience, their is an outright righteously justified destruction of out-groups.<br/><br/>Part [2] contains Chapters where readers will learn to read in between the lines of the known and the unknown. This is the part about awakening to our worth and becoming. It leads the pendulum swing of thought into how to coexist together and find balance between the pain and pleasure  through stories about leaders and people we all call rebellious heroes. Conclusively, this part in rebelling heresy invites readers into a momentum of non-resistance within all that exists.</p>
<p><strong>This book will be published </strong>with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<br/> </p>

<h2>About the Author</h2>
<p>Bruce Sakindi is the founder of Grow Up Smart Organization, a Non-Governmental Organization focused on building the potential of vulnerable youth in Rwanda, a Degree holder in Industrial and Organizational Psychology at Barry University in Miami, Florida, an avid world traveler and student of the universe.<br/><br/>He wrote this book because he is curious about the diversity of stories.  He wanted to explore how we embrace extremely opposite dualities as we meet the gift to choose. Choosing the title Pendulum is an imagery of the momentum swing of pendulum, going left to right, mirroring the that we know, we don't know. <br/><br/>In his 22 years on this earth, Bruce has lived in Rwanda, Connecticut, Rome, and Miami. In between the third world, first world, modern worlds, and ancient worlds, he uncovered several thoughts about worth and way of being in our world. Bruce Sakindi is son to a liberation soldier and a genocide survivor, warriors of the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi. He is also the eldest brother to 2 sisters and 1 brother. He hopes writing Pendulum is an opportunity for others to share their journey of worth and living, as he quotes "" between the world and me.""<br/><br/>For more information you can connect with Bruce at [syrbrucesakindi@gmail.com] and [Linkedin: Bruce Sakindi, Twitter: Bsakindi, Instagram:syrbrucesakindi].</p>

And by abiding to this collusive obedience, their is an outright righteously justified destruction of out-groups.Part [2] contains Chapters where readers will learn to read in between the lines of the known and the unknown. This is the part about awakening to our worth and becoming. It leads the pendulum swing of thought into how to coexist together and find balance between the pain and pleasure  through stories about leaders and people we all call rebellious heroes. Conclusively, this part in rebelling heresy invites readers into a momentum of non-resistance within all that exists.
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following: 
The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in [December, 2020]
The Cover Design of my Book - the mockups you see currently are a placeholder!
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (Physical Copy, Ebook Formats)
The Copyediting for My Book - to make help polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book - when I ultimately publish this [Fall 2020]
When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.

About the Author
Bruce Sakindi is the founder of Grow Up Smart Organization, a Non-Governmental Organization focused on building the potential of vulnerable youth in Rwanda, a Degree holder in Industrial and Organizational Psychology at Barry University in Miami, Florida, an avid world traveler and student of the universe.He wrote this book because he is curious about the diversity of stories.  He wanted to explore how we embrace extremely opposite dualities as we meet the gift to choose. Choosing the title Pendulum is an imagery of the momentum swing of pendulum, going left to right, mirroring the that we know, we don't know. In his 22 years on this earth, Bruce has lived in Rwanda, Connecticut, Rome, and Miami. In between the third world, first world, modern worlds, and ancient worlds, he uncovered several thoughts about worth and way of being in our world. Bruce Sakindi is son to a liberation soldier and a genocide survivor, warriors of the 1994 Genocide Against the Tutsi. He is also the eldest brother to 2 sisters and 1 brother. He hopes writing Pendulum is an opportunity for others to share their journey of worth and living, as he quotes "" between the world and me.""For more information you can connect with Bruce at [syrbrucesakindi@gmail.com] and [Linkedin: Bruce Sakindi, Twitter: Bsakindi, Instagram:syrbrucesakindi].
 
Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Let’s talk about representation and being heard as individuals! As Asian Americans who grew up in the Bay Area, we saw a gap in the way our stories are packaged and shared with the rest of the world. In a society where “Crazy Rich Asians,” a wonderful film that we love, is deemed a pivotal moment that brought the Asian experience to the rest of the world, we can’t help but feel like there’s still much more to be done and many more stories to tell. We have to keep the momentum going. To be Asian is so many things and it can look so many different ways. Our community cannot be painted with one broad stroke. Since modern society moves slowly to address gaps in representation, we decided to create and tell the stories we’ve been missing. We want to foster deeper connections with the people around us. We’re committed to changing our narrative - one story at a time. Our visual storytelling platform aims to highlight the different perspectives, cultures and individual experiences that go beyond a label of our identities. We invite you to join the conversation.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The founders of More Than Asian need additional funds to compensate some of the creatives that will be instrumental in bringing this project to life: photographers (shooting &amp; post-production), stylists, illustrators/graphic designers, copywriting editors, UX consultants.</p>

</p><p>Hello,
my name is Taylor Rhodes. I am nineteen years old living in Central Virginia,
tucked in between robin's egg blue mountains and swirling rivers. I photograph everything. I write as if
my veins produce ink. I’m a hippie at heart and the Blue Ridge Mountains are my
idols. And all I want out of life is happiness and a hard copy of my book in
people’s delicate hands. <span><span>I began writing these bits of craziness on Facebook
using the “Note” feature, since my blog on MySpace was dead and I was bored
with scribbling in journals. They begin one hundred and fifty-six days since I
last self-harmed on January twenty-fourth, two thousand and ten. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>  </span></span></p>
<p><span>I thought “Hey,
what the heck? Why not write an online blog? All the cool kids are doing it!”
*poke nudge wink wink* I get to put my thoughts and such out there, into this
wacky world of ours, and maybe be able to be there for others. And then it
turned into this book. Regardless of how it pans out, I haven’t figured out the
secret formula for happiness. I’ve matured and realized that love is a
difficult commodity to come by and <b>not everyone loves as deeply as you do</b>.
I’ve experienced moments that feel the way chocolate tastes and I’ve suffered
through the not so great gritty bits. I’m able to look back on my life and see
the transformation from wobbly spud to flow and flitter. This is my teeny tiny
life in your teeny tiny fingers and we are now connected in this teeny tiny
world. This is how it happened, with these people and these songs and these
tissue paper apologies and these mornings cloaked in star matter. </span>This book
will explore and expose my life, day by day. It's a mess of brutal honesty and
heart wrenching emotion. I've twisted my way through the turmoil and have come
here to share my story with you all, in the hopes that I will be able to reach
out to at least one delicate being in this teeny tiny world and make them feel
understood and loved and oh so whole. I just… I want to be there and be heard.
I need to. </p>
<p><b>What
I Need and What You Get</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>I
need help with funds. I’m going to self-publish since I don’t have tens of
thousands of dollars to send in manuscripts via agent and hope they are
accepted. This is my only option. I will spend the money on creating copies
through Lulu Publishing and on promotion. Each book will be about twenty-three dollars apiece to produce. I’d like to order a nice bulk order to sell

<br/><p></p></div>","Hello,
my name is Taylor Rhodes. I am nineteen years old living in Central Virginia,
tucked in between robin's egg blue mountains and swirling rivers. I photograph everything. I write as if
my veins produce ink. I’m a hippie at heart and the Blue Ridge Mountains are my
idols. And all I want out of life is happiness and a hard copy of my book in
people’s delicate hands. I began writing these bits of craziness on Facebook
using the “Note” feature, since my blog on MySpace was dead and I was bored
with scribbling in journals. They begin one hundred and fifty-six days since I
last self-harmed on January twenty-fourth, two thousand and ten. 
  
I thought “Hey,
what the heck? Why not write an online blog? All the cool kids are doing it!”
*poke nudge wink wink* I get to put my thoughts and such out there, into this
wacky world of ours, and maybe be able to be there for others. And then it
turned into this book. Regardless of how it pans out, I haven’t figured out the
secret formula for happiness. I’ve matured and realized that love is a
difficult commodity to come by and not everyone loves as deeply as you do.
I’ve experienced moments that feel the way chocolate tastes and I’ve suffered
through the not so great gritty bits. I’m able to look back on my life and see
the transformation from wobbly spud to flow and flitter. This is my teeny tiny
life in your teeny tiny fingers and we are now connected in this teeny tiny
world. This is how it happened, with these people and these songs and these
tissue paper apologies and these mornings cloaked in star matter. This book
will explore and expose my life, day by day. It's a mess of brutal honesty and
heart wrenching emotion. I've twisted my way through the turmoil and have come
here to share my story with you all, in the hopes that I will be able to reach
out to at least one delicate being in this teeny tiny world and make them feel
understood and loved and oh so whole. I just… I want to be there and be heard.
I need to. 
What
I Need and What You Get

I
need help with funds. I’m going to self-publish since I don’t have tens of
thousands of dollars to send in manuscripts via agent and hope they are
accepted. This is my only option. I will spend the money on creating copies
through Lulu Publishing and on promotion. Each book will be about twenty-three dollars apiece to produce. I’d like to order a nice bulk order to sell
myself, and have money to buy more and use for shipping costs. I also have to factor in the percentage Indiegogo will take from this. Even if the goal
isn’t met, ALL donations will be used for this project and this project only.
Scout’s honor. I’m much too invested to be a sneaky witch.
PERKS! 

A donation of twenty-five USD will get you a personalized copy of the book.
A donation of sixty USD will get a mention in my book and a personalized copy. [MENTION IS NOW GONE DUE TO REVISIONS BEING FINISHED. YOU CAN STILL DONATE, BUT THE MENTION IS NOT AVAILABLE]

<p>The Faerie King has entered into a

enslaved by demons, and Caol'nir, a warrior sworn to defend the king. <br/><br/>
When Asherah, stripped of both her memory and her dignity, learns that King
Sahlgren is responsible for her captivity, she leads her fellow slaves in a
daring escape and burns their prison to the ground. Then she learns that there
are many more prisons across Parthalan, and embarks upon a campaign to free
every last faerie. <br/><br/>
In stark contrast to Asherah's struggles, Caol'nir lives the comfortable life
of a temple guard. He is sworn to serve and defend the king, as his ancestors
have done since time immemorial. Now a priestess has been murdered, and
Caol'nir learns that Sahlgren's scheming is to blame. Determined to thwart the king,
sacred oath or no, Caol'nir joins Asherah's rebellion. What Caol'nir doesn't
know is that Sahlgren has promised the demon lord a woman of rare and singular
beauty, a woman who is rumored to be the sun god's daughter. She also happens
to be Caol'nir's mate. </p><p>The following five titles are:</p><p></p><p>The Virgin Queen</p><p>Latera’s Song</p><p>Rise of the Deva’shi</p><p>Golem</p><p>Elfsong</p><p></p>

The little creature raised its beak as if to sing and uncurling a pair of tiny blue, leathery wings, only slightly sticky with a glistening slime, it unfurled a minute club ended tail too, that waved about like that flag on the House of Commons. In the Class A, organic egg box, Gareth Marks was suddenly looking down at a real, live dragon in the post. ""</p><p><b>NOW READ ON AS THE AUTHOR WRITES IT</b>: Don't forget that there is much more of the adventure already up on <a href=""http://www.wattpad.com/51779081-dragon-in-the-post"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wattpad</a> .  This project is genuinely being hatched as it happens, so the story will be written only if we achieve our goal. Help us do that now.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>THE PROJECT IN GREATER DEPTH:</b></p><p></p><h3></h3><p><b>HELP MAKE A BOOK AND BECOME A DRAGON!</b></p><p>This is a very personal indie publishing project by best selling British fantasy author David Clement-Davies to bring out a specific signed First Edition book and story <b>""Dragon In The Post""</b>, with your name in the front,that you can read part of right now by clicking the blue link to<b> <a href=""http://www.wattpad.com/51779081-dragon-in-the-post"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wattpad</a></b>.  </p><p>It tells the tale of Gareth Marks, a troubled 12 year old who one day gets an Organic egg box in the post from his Godfather Pendelion Pumfrey's farm and out of it hatches a Firecutter, a little blue she Dragon, whose fiery breath cuts a doorway into another world, filled with Dragons, magic, mystery and adventure, as well as some very strange Dragon Chefs!   The mission is to finish that partly blogged story and turn it into a real book, not just a souless Ebook, and send it out to you and others, in the post.</p><br/><p></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>THE MISSION AND VISION BEYOND JUST ONE BOOK - PHOENIX ARK PRESS AND HATCHING A REALLY ORGANIC PUBLISHER?</b></p><p><b>Dragon In The Post </b>will be our very first hard copy book under the label <b>Phoenix Ark Press</b>, which is guided by the spirit of animal stories and already has an established cultural blog, also publishing David's printed novels as eBooks.  But there and here we also want to spread the word and start a grass roots fire, in a reaction to much of the awfulness of the internet and online too, so forging a new path in crowd funded publishing and real books. Partly using the medium of Social Media to talk through its own empty noise and reach real people again.  There is a place for eBooks but essentially we want to get back to  real books, sent to you in the post! So why not contribute what you can, at Perk levels or more and <i>""Join the story and become part of the adventure</i>""?  </p><p>The bigger your support for <b>Dragon In The Post</b> though, the more likely you will help open a magic door on a whole publisher and several thrilling projects beyond Gareth's fable:  From David's epic polar bear fantasy <b>Light of The White Bear</b>, to a beautiful book on the Carol <b>The 12 Days of Christmas</b> to unique non-fiction work on London in the 16th Century and William Shakespeare's unknown brother Edmund, who died in 1607 in mysterious circumstances, called <b>Looking For Edmund</b>.  They are all David's own ideas and projects waiting in the wings, hoping to lead the field in trying to then draw in other writers and artists and build a new model in grass roots publishing.</p><p>If we hit our target on the Dragon then it will also guarantee that we will start to roll out other crowd funded efforts, so your interest and support are vital, as a younger person or older reader and whether interested in great fiction or  in factual books. To justify a Flexible Funding model too at Indiegogo, which means money is definitely drawn down, rather than having to cross a finish line, and as part of this project  itself David's classic fantasy <b>Fire Bringer </b>will be brought back into hard copy print, after 12 years publishing success with Macmillan in the UK. He does not believe it should have been taken out of print. Perhaps his younger ebook fantasy <b>The Terror Time Spies</b> will be printed too, for the very first time. That means your money will definitely go to Phoenix Ark Press and be well spent, so <b>every penny helps and counts</b>! </p><p>As for <b>Flexible Funding</b>, if an all or nothing model gives an important psychological incentive  to 'cross a finishing line', so not risking your contributions either, please understand that here the psychology of hitting that target is vital too, because this is not asking for hand outs, but passion and engagement.  Meanwhile we need to see that a model can really work in trying to establish a new way of 'paying it forward' and protecting committed artists.  Publishers take commercial gambles by investing in writers with advances, big or small, as well as production costs, but we are asking readers and the public to do that instead.  Editors' rewards are both the artistic satisfaction, and jobs and profits inside firms, while yours is the artistic satisfaction, if you think the Dragon good, but also the perks that we are offering and being part of a grass roots movement too.  Meanwhile the Indiegogo model means that it is important to hit that 4.5k target too, because only if we do so will Indiegogo take a 5% rather than a 9% cut of the total raised. </p><p>David has also put in a special <b>Opt Out</b> clause though,  as a mark of honour, which means if we don't get very close indeed to the goal David will personally refund your money, if you want, although he hopes you understand that Indiegogo takes a % operating cut.   Here there is great ambition  for Phoenix Ark Press too, which is is why, although we have set a very modest goal of 4.5k, to give David some money as he finishes the story of Dragon In The Post, create the print run, find an editor, pay a great illustrator properly and then to send it out to you in the post, along with the other perks, we have set <b>an unofficial target too of 6k-10k</b> to help us really fly. In this real life publishing story then the more raised really is the key to more and more creativity. Here we're bursting with ideas and creative projects and want to make David's label at Phoenix Ark Press '<i>your publisher</i>', so that you will be part of something truly organic.</p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/677154/files/20140626110018-10339019_668889433158974_1049793211_n.jpg?1403805618"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b></b></p><p>Steph's brilliant creation for the Dragon In The Post,  both a fan and part of a great Street Team that you can join now on Facebook.  Go to David's page there, Like the page ""<b>Stories in The Post - The Dragon Tries Again</b>' or ask to join the Phoenix Ark Press group.<b> </b></p><p>We have many plans to make Phoenix Ark a successful little business too, from a <b>Friends of Phoenix Ark </b>scheme offering future benefits and discounts, to plans for beautifully designed <b>PA sweatshirts,</b> inspired by <b>The Poet's Sweatshop</b> blogging poetry online, with your favourite quotes on them and where you can literally '<i>wear your art on your sleeve</i>', to very unique perks too: like joining a Phoenix Ark crowd funding hall of fame, to hooking up with a passionate fan-base, speaking directly with  authors, or coming to launch parties in London.

First to guarantee and build the fan base around this specific novel, blogged in part on line, then for a personalised publisher itself and the other books Phoenix  and you will make together.  That first book will be retailed to the general public as well, so treat a contribution as a kind of pre-order for a novel, a thing to have and cherish, that you helped to make and with your name inside. </p><p>We are ambitious though and the more money raised the more we can open the door on other real books too.  We hope to grow and grow then, breaking new ground by using a direct and intimate crowd funding model on many occasions,  so helping other artists and illustrators too, in future - by acting as inspiration, pathfinder, support and quality control, in other directly financed publishing projects, while also publishing much as a conventional publisher might into the market place.  Ultimately your backing is helping a small business flourish too.</p><h3><b>Why We Are Different</b></h3><p>Phoenix Ark Press is different firstly because, a bit like Curly Tail Press inside the story of Dragon In The Post , it represents writers and artists doing it for themselves,  fighting back with the direct help of readers, and not just dictated by  editors jockeying for jobs inside big houses. Secondly because the guiding spirit of Phoenix Ark Press, which is also an on-line blog, is  defined by the neglected genre of great animal storytelling and also by aspects of environmental and issue based journalism.  You can read blogs, poems, travel articles and cultural essays free now at <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/dragon-in-the-post/www.PhoenixArkPress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PhoenixArkPress</a></p><h3><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h3><p>The risk and challenges are that Phoenix Ark cannot survive in the highly competitive and cut throat world of modern publishing and that David's stories will die out.  The benefit of crowd funding  is that it will help a highly committed author earn and so continue his life work, even if a book's initial fan base is not that large, although all the better if it is.   David has no issue with finishing a story like Dragon In The Post and making it shine, he has a remarkable track record, has won brilliant reviews in the UK and US, like '<i>a Master of Animal Fantasy</i>' from Booklist and  '<i>one of the best anthropomorphic novels known to me</i>' from Richard Adams author of Watership Down.  He does have a problem with being denied the voice he earned over many years, as contracts were disrespected and seeing a culture of real books by inspiring authors wiped out in this mass media world, where there is no decent half way house between mass created ebooks and the all consuming global phenomena, so often little room for work not done to formula.</p><h3><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></h3><p>A contribution of £15 will secure you that basic fact, more than any perk, of a signed copy of Dragon In The Post, at effectively little more than the price of a hardback in a shop today, but in this case with special perks too.  Larger pledges bring a chance to consider yourself crucial to a valuable indie publisher and perhaps to discuss future investment opportunities too. Even the smallest contributions add to a vital spirit though, allow you to join a publishing adventure and  make a difference, just as much as your  sharing the story and a new grass roots publishing word. So Join the Story with a contribution and become part of the adventure. Thank you.</p><h3><b>Giving Readers and Backers the Last Word!</b></h3><p>David's books have been described as '<i>A masterpiece' 'A hurtling ride</i>' and '<i>too cool for words</i>', while his novels have been Family Award winners and Book 76 Selections in the US, achieving over 7000 reviews on Goodreads.  But it is to people who got involved with the first attempt to crowd fund that we give the final word:</p><p><b><b><i>Charlotte C:</i></b></b></p><p><i>I'm sure my sentiments will be echoed by others when I say how impressive it is for you to be making a stand for your work and how glad I am to help in what small way I can.

Where all those funny people met, MPs or PMs, or something, to talk and fight and do whatever they do. It rose there, with its boldly waving flag, the Union Jack, and its funny, pointy turrets. To Gareth Marks, gazing sadly through the grimy little window, it looked almost medieval, like that dumb book he'd seen..."" So, since we like our authors organic, that Egg box arrives, except that one of the eggs is larger than the others and strangely blue, out of which hatches something very remarkable indeed-""Gareth Marks could have fallen over, when the thing seemed to burp, a little puff of black-grey smoke came out of its beak, and then, as if it was swelling, it shrugged off its casing, in a shower of breaking egg shell and stood up in the brown egg box and the remains of its broken home. The little creature raised its beak as if to sing and uncurling a pair of tiny blue, leathery wings, only slightly sticky with a glistening slime, it unfurled a minute club ended tail too, that waved about like that flag on the House of Commons. In the Class A, organic egg box, Gareth Marks was suddenly looking down at a real, live dragon in the post. ""NOW READ ON AS THE AUTHOR WRITES IT: Don't forget that there is much more of the adventure already up on Wattpad .  This project is genuinely being hatched as it happens, so the story will be written only if we achieve our goal. Help us do that now.THE PROJECT IN GREATER DEPTH:HELP MAKE A BOOK AND BECOME A DRAGON!This is a very personal indie publishing project by best selling British fantasy author David Clement-Davies to bring out a specific signed First Edition book and story ""Dragon In The Post"", with your name in the front,that you can read part of right now by clicking the blue link to Wattpad.  It tells the tale of Gareth Marks, a troubled 12 year old who one day gets an Organic egg box in the post from his Godfather Pendelion Pumfrey's farm and out of it hatches a Firecutter, a little blue she Dragon, whose fiery breath cuts a doorway into another world, filled with Dragons, magic, mystery and adventure, as well as some very strange Dragon Chefs!   The mission is to finish that partly blogged story and turn it into a real book, not just a souless Ebook, and send it out to you and others, in the post.THE MISSION AND VISION BEYOND JUST ONE BOOK - PHOENIX ARK PRESS AND HATCHING A REALLY ORGANIC PUBLISHER?Dragon In The Post will be our very first hard copy book under the label Phoenix Ark Press, which is guided by the spirit of animal stories and already has an established cultural blog, also publishing David's printed novels as eBooks.  But there and here we also want to spread the word and start a grass roots fire, in a reaction to much of the awfulness of the internet and online too, so forging a new path in crowd funded publishing and real books. Partly using the medium of Social Media to talk through its own empty noise and reach real people again.  There is a place for eBooks but essentially we want to get back to  real books, sent to you in the post! So why not contribute what you can, at Perk levels or more and ""Join the story and become part of the adventure""?  The bigger your support for Dragon In The Post though, the more likely you will help open a magic door on a whole publisher and several thrilling projects beyond Gareth's fable:  From David's epic polar bear fantasy Light of The White Bear, to a beautiful book on the Carol The 12 Days of Christmas to unique non-fiction work on London in the 16th Century and William Shakespeare's unknown brother Edmund, who died in 1607 in mysterious circumstances, called Looking For Edmund.  They are all David's own ideas and projects waiting in the wings, hoping to lead the field in trying to then draw in other writers and artists and build a new model in grass roots publishing.If we hit our target on the Dragon then it will also guarantee that we will start to roll out other crowd funded efforts, so your interest and support are vital, as a younger person or older reader and whether interested in great fiction or  in factual books. To justify a Flexible Funding model too at Indiegogo, which means money is definitely drawn down, rather than having to cross a finish line, and as part of this project  itself David's classic fantasy Fire Bringer will be brought back into hard copy print, after 12 years publishing success with Macmillan in the UK. He does not believe it should have been taken out of print. Perhaps his younger ebook fantasy The Terror Time Spies will be printed too, for the very first time. That means your money will definitely go to Phoenix Ark Press and be well spent, so every penny helps and counts! As for Flexible Funding, if an all or nothing model gives an important psychological incentive  to 'cross a finishing line', so not risking your contributions either, please understand that here the psychology of hitting that target is vital too, because this is not asking for hand outs, but passion and engagement.  Meanwhile we need to see that a model can really work in trying to establish a new way of 'paying it forward' and protecting committed artists.  Publishers take commercial gambles by investing in writers with advances, big or small, as well as production costs, but we are asking readers and the public to do that instead.  Editors' rewards are both the artistic satisfaction, and jobs and profits inside firms, while yours is the artistic satisfaction, if you think the Dragon good, but also the perks that we are offering and being part of a grass roots movement too.  Meanwhile the Indiegogo model means that it is important to hit that 4.5k target too, because only if we do so will Indiegogo take a 5% rather than a 9% cut of the total raised. David has also put in a special Opt Out clause though,  as a mark of honour, which means if we don't get very close indeed to the goal David will personally refund your money, if you want, although he hopes you understand that Indiegogo takes a % operating cut.   Here there is great ambition  for Phoenix Ark Press too, which is is why, although we have set a very modest goal of 4.5k, to give David some money as he finishes the story of Dragon In The Post, create the print run, find an editor, pay a great illustrator properly and then to send it out to you in the post, along with the other perks, we have set an unofficial target too of 6k-10k to help us really fly. In this real life publishing story then the more raised really is the key to more and more creativity. Here we're bursting with ideas and creative projects and want to make David's label at Phoenix Ark Press 'your publisher', so that you will be part of something truly organic.Steph's brilliant creation for the Dragon In The Post,  both a fan and part of a great Street Team that you can join now on Facebook.  Go to David's page there, Like the page ""Stories in The Post - The Dragon Tries Again' or ask to join the Phoenix Ark Press group. We have many plans to make Phoenix Ark a successful little business too, from a Friends of Phoenix Ark scheme offering future benefits and discounts, to plans for beautifully designed PA sweatshirts, inspired by The Poet's Sweatshop blogging poetry online, with your favourite quotes on them and where you can literally 'wear your art on your sleeve', to very unique perks too: like joining a Phoenix Ark crowd funding hall of fame, to hooking up with a passionate fan-base, speaking directly with  authors, or coming to launch parties in London. With the highest pledges, start to consider yourself as a Dragon investor to highly creative people then and see how you can directly participate.  During the campaign new pictures and videos will be put up as well and more of the story blogged online.THE PERSONAL PUBLISHING STORYThis is a very personal fight for David too, who saw a highly successful career blocked and effectively wrecked in very particular circumstances in New York and who is deeply uncomfortable with much online and the shifting publishing landscape of the Internet and ebooks, all becoming such a challenge to the written word and to a whole reading culture.  So, as we all know, such a threat to musicians, writers and artists everywhere. The truth of big business and mass marketing nowadays too means that editors are often far more interested in fighting for their own jobs and riding particular successes, than they are in standing up for books of cultural value or the authors who make them.   So why not help build a publisher created by writers and artists themselves - Phoenix Ark Press?  The Phoenix is of course that mythical bird that rises from the ashes and the Ark a symbol both of journeying and protection, so help one committed author challenge the system too and get his voice back.  Then see a small and passionate publisher back his stories and cross support many publishing ideas, as it strikes a blow for real books again, on the shelves and in the post!A still from the animation of the eggbox from Pumfrey Farm.

<p>Isabel is offered an artistic residency on the colony planet of New Canada, but beginning again on a new world proves difficult. Unexpectedly invited to a lavish society event by the taciturn Serge, she is swept off her feet under an unfamiliar sky. As Isabel and Serge dance in a sci-fi minuet around their feelings, they face the full force of the young planet's rigid social expectations.</p>

<p>I have always wanted to write science fiction. Growing up on a steady stream of Star Trek, Star Wars, and all the sci-fi novels I could find, I dreamed of robots and droids and galaxy clusters. But I also devoured Jane Austen's classics and played piano while picturing Regency dances. </p>
<p>One day in early 2015 I woke up and began to write. The words poured out of me unabated. I then composed an entire album based on this story. I have been working on this project for the past two years, pouring all my heart into its creation. Now the final versions of both are almost ready. Launch is imminent.</p>
<p><strong>f l i g h t   t e s t   s u c c e s s f u l</strong></p>
<p>I performed an early version of the musical cycle in several Canadian and European cities throughout 2015. In January 2016, short films by Canadian visual artist Hali Rey, created specifically for my project, were premiered at the <a href=""http://2highfestival.com.au/session/gravity-wing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2high Festival</a> in Brisbane, Australia, as I performed my compositions live. Here I was joined by violinist dea.nice, who also performs on the album. I got some great reviews: <i>I care if you listen</i> called my songs ""intelligent and inspired.""</p>

<p>When you contribute to this campaign, you help me achieve my lifelong dream of publishing a book. You also help me achieve another lifelong dream: that of making the soundtrack to that book! This project encapsulates my creative spirit. I hope it captures your imagination too.</p>
<p>I'll do a book launch tour in the first half of 2017 through a series of readings+concerts in Canada and internationally. In the spring and summer I will put on smaller scale performances and readings. Some larger-scale musical collaborations for the second half of 2017 are already in the works. </p>
<p><strong>d e t a i l s </strong></p>
<p>Gravity Wing will be released as an illustrated e-book in early 2017. A digital musical album will also be released at the same time, providing the soundtrack for the novel. The decision between print and digital publishing was a difficult one, but I finally settled on digital for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is my first novel and I'm self-publishing, meaning I'm managing the entire operation. Forgive me for comparing it to running a planet.  E-publishing allows me to turn it into more of a planetoid, something more manageable.</li>
<li>E-books are convenient! There's no shipping cost or shipping time. They can be beamed right across the galaxy, so you can order one from anywhere.</li>
<li>An e-book lets me share Hali Rey's beautiful illustrations with you in a format that is infinitely more visually appealing than it could appear in black-and-white print.</li>

<p>I'm looking to raise $5000 CAD to help cover some of the many costs associated in self-publishing a novel in e-book format, as well as self-producing and recording a musical album. I've already worked very hard to produce most of the book and album at low cost. For example, I recorded and produced the album myself using my own computer and equipment. I am doing a lot of my own layout for the book. The cost breakdown will be approximately as follows (in Canadian Dollars):</p>
<p><strong>ca. $1500 book launch series, Canada</strong> - setup, equipment, all sorts of Terran conveyances like planes and trains and automobiles... your contribution would help offset some of these expenses. At present, I plan to read and perform in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Quebec City, with more cities added as soon as the opportunity arises (Calgary and Vancouver are in the works!) </p>
<p><strong>ca. $500 promotional costs</strong> - print materials such download cards and story cards, posters, prints of the artwork for shows, online promotion</p>
<p><strong>ca. $1000 audio</strong> - final equipment + software costs, mastering (note: some of the audio budget may be allocated to the launch series, if necessary.)</p>
<p><strong>ca. $2000 additional costs </strong>- though I strive to be as fiercely independent as possible, I can't do every single thing alone. I anticipate costs to come up for design+visual, editing, distribution, administration, etc. This part of the budget would enable me to flexibly deal with challenges in the production process that I can't deal with myself. I would pool this and the audio budget, to allot funds where they are most needed. </p>

Isabel is offered an artistic residency on the colony planet of New Canada, but beginning again on a new world proves difficult. Unexpectedly invited to a lavish society event by the taciturn Serge, she is swept off her feet under an unfamiliar sky. As Isabel and Serge dance in a sci-fi minuet around their feelings, they face the full force of the young planet's rigid social expectations.
a   w o r k   o f   h e a r t
I have always wanted to write science fiction. Growing up on a steady stream of Star Trek, Star Wars, and all the sci-fi novels I could find, I dreamed of robots and droids and galaxy clusters. But I also devoured Jane Austen's classics and played piano while picturing Regency dances. 
One day in early 2015 I woke up and began to write. The words poured out of me unabated. I then composed an entire album based on this story. I have been working on this project for the past two years, pouring all my heart into its creation. Now the final versions of both are almost ready. Launch is imminent.
f l i g h t   t e s t   s u c c e s s f u l
I performed an early version of the musical cycle in several Canadian and European cities throughout 2015. In January 2016, short films by Canadian visual artist Hali Rey, created specifically for my project, were premiered at the 2high Festival in Brisbane, Australia, as I performed my compositions live. Here I was joined by violinist dea.nice, who also performs on the album. I got some great reviews: I care if you listen called my songs ""intelligent and inspired.""
h e l p   m e   f l y
When you contribute to this campaign, you help me achieve my lifelong dream of publishing a book. You also help me achieve another lifelong dream: that of making the soundtrack to that book! This project encapsulates my creative spirit. I hope it captures your imagination too.
I'll do a book launch tour in the first half of 2017 through a series of readings+concerts in Canada and internationally. In the spring and summer I will put on smaller scale performances and readings. Some larger-scale musical collaborations for the second half of 2017 are already in the works. 
d e t a i l s 
Gravity Wing will be released as an illustrated e-book in early 2017. A digital musical album will also be released at the same time, providing the soundtrack for the novel. The decision between print and digital publishing was a difficult one, but I finally settled on digital for the following reasons:

This is my first novel and I'm self-publishing, meaning I'm managing the entire operation. Forgive me for comparing it to running a planet.  E-publishing allows me to turn it into more of a planetoid, something more manageable.
E-books are convenient! There's no shipping cost or shipping time. They can be beamed right across the galaxy, so you can order one from anywhere.
An e-book lets me share Hali Rey's beautiful illustrations with you in a format that is infinitely more visually appealing than it could appear in black-and-white print.


c o s t   b r e a k d o w n
I'm looking to raise $5000 CAD to help cover some of the many costs associated in self-publishing a novel in e-book format, as well as self-producing and recording a musical album. I've already worked very hard to produce most of the book and album at low cost. For example, I recorded and produced the album myself using my own computer and equipment. I am doing a lot of my own layout for the book. The cost breakdown will be approximately as follows (in Canadian Dollars):
ca. $1500 book launch series, Canada - setup, equipment, all sorts of Terran conveyances like planes and trains and automobiles... your contribution would help offset some of these expenses.

ca. $1000 audio - final equipment + software costs, mastering (note: some of the audio budget may be allocated to the launch series, if necessary.)
ca. $2000 additional costs - though I strive to be as fiercely independent as possible, I can't do every single thing alone. I anticipate costs to come up for design+visual, editing, distribution, administration, etc. This part of the budget would enable me to flexibly deal with challenges in the production process that I can't deal with myself.

I believe too many organizations struggle with productivity, retention, and employee engagement and exceptional leadership and organizational culture is the key to long term success. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how to win by leveraging leadership and culture. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for leadership and entrepreneurship in you.

You'll read about some inspiring stories like:</p><p><i>The $6,000 Egg</i> - A story about how poor leadership and culture can lead to poor performance. </p><p>Stefan Larsson - How the former CEO of Ralph Lauren was able to turn around apparel brand Old Navy</p><p>Lee Cockerell - Former Disney executive Lee Cockerell and what he believes are the secrets to the iconic brand’s continued success. </p><p>You will love this book if you are a leader, entrepreneur or small business owner. <br/><i>The Circle of Leadership</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to leaders and entrepreneurs who are interested in leadership development and organizational culture.</p><p><br/><strong>The book is written in 3 Parts....</strong><br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + Cultivating Culture, Leveraging Culture, Finding Purpose (Mission), and Vision &amp; Values.

This section will clarify why a strong organizational culture leads to higher performance while outlining practical steps you can take to win in an organizational setting. The 80/20 principle is also highlighted in this part as a tool to help leaders be intentional with spending a portion of their time focused on building a culture that will lead to a competitive advantage. Examples of firms such as Google and Intuit are mentioned for their commitment to what Google refers to as “20% time”. <br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters on Hiring, Diversity &amp; Inclusion, and Retention. The reader will learn how to strategically slow down the hiring process to get to know candidates better. The reader will also learn the importance of having a diverse and inclusive culture while striving to retain top talent through the art of appreciation. Through a story told by former CEO of Yum! Brands, Inc. David Novak, we will discuss the impact that recognition can have on your people and your overall performance. <br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters on Training &amp; Development, Delegation, and Accountability. These chapters showcase how to effectively train and develop others so you can feel confident in delegating tasks to test their comprehension and improve productivity and engagement. We will discuss the impact of trust when it comes to delegation and firm performance through content shared from a book titled Leaders Eat Last by Simon Sinek.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>All the Little Things</i> is a collection of short stories about the way people connect with the environment and the way nature can affect and reflect us, both in tragedy and times of love.<br/><br/>My name is Lissa Sangree-Calabrese and I am the author of All the Little Things. I wrote this book because of my deep love for the environment and my belief that through expanding on and enriching our connection with nature we as a people will be able to find a more sustainable future. I wrote this book for all the flowers that go unnoticed, for all the winds that howl lonely, and for all the animals silently going extinct. I wrote it in the hopes that somewhere someone who didn’t before will now stand up and take notice.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the ways in which nature has woven itself into your life. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the environment in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you reconnect with the world around you.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about a varied cast of characters and see snippets of their lives as they start to understand, explore, and come to terms with harsh climate realities:<ul>
<li>The way microplastics have infiltrated our food chain, the way they slip into even innocuous family dinners.</li>
<li>The intensity of natural disasters as they grow and change and become more and more prominent.</li>
<li>The way species distributions and occurrences are changing, the way climate change can trickle down to even the smallest things.</li>

<p>I wrote this book because to me, the environmental issues of our time are of the utmost importance. However, for many people, it is hard to connect to the issues deeply because they seem far away. I wanted to explore the ways people can form these connections in their homes and in their everyday lives.

</div></div>","Story of My Book
All the Little Things is a collection of short stories about the way people connect with the environment and the way nature can affect and reflect us, both in tragedy and times of love.My name is Lissa Sangree-Calabrese and I am the author of All the Little Things. I wrote this book because of my deep love for the environment and my belief that through expanding on and enriching our connection with nature we as a people will be able to find a more sustainable future. I wrote this book for all the flowers that go unnoticed, for all the winds that howl lonely, and for all the animals silently going extinct. I wrote it in the hopes that somewhere someone who didn’t before will now stand up and take notice.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the ways in which nature has woven itself into your life. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the environment in you. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you reconnect with the world around you.In this book, you'll learn about a varied cast of characters and see snippets of their lives as they start to understand, explore, and come to terms with harsh climate realities:
The way microplastics have infiltrated our food chain, the way they slip into even innocuous family dinners.
The intensity of natural disasters as they grow and change and become more and more prominent.
The way species distributions and occurrences are changing, the way climate change can trickle down to even the smallest things.
The footprint we leave behind and what remains (both the good and the bad).
 You will love this book if you love the little things, the connections we make with each other and in turn the connections we make with the world and environment within which we live.All the Little Things is a fiction book that speaks to the nature lovers in all of us and those of us who are starting to see the way the world is changing as the climate warms. 
The Book - All the Little ThingsThe book contains 9 short stories:Lorie- A young girl who, after almost swallowing a piece of plastic at a family dinner begins to think about the way we live.

He struggles to find what is causing his home to change and to figure out what he can do to save what he loves.Viviane- A girl who grows up with a little bit of nature in her life, in the form of a tree. As she grows older, she learns about shifting baselines and how the little things add up to a somewhat darker picture.Isabell and her grandmother- A story about memory and what it means to love where you are from amidst destruction and the kind of insidious change that is slow at first and then there all at once.Malika- A woman who contemplates loss, both within her family and at a local lake, while reflecting on what it means to love even in times of strife.Tyron- A young man whose home is destroyed in a flood. He deals with feelings of displacement, both from his home and within his connection to the Mississippi river, as he tries to navigate a new water-logged world.Liam- A boy who discovers the toll that pollution can take when he starts finding dead birds on his local beach every day.

<h3>The Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>1521: Re-Discovering the History of the Philippines</i> tells the forgotten stories of Filipinos in the advent of Spanish colonization, beginning with Magellan’s arrival in the archipelago. This book offers a unique Filipino perspective.  <br/><br/>My name is Judy Robinson and I wrote this book because after revisiting the story of Magellan’s “discovery” of the islands, I learned new information that I didn’t remember reading about in history textbooks growing up in the Philippines. I decided to keep reading about early colonial history. The more I that researched, the more surprises that I found.  <br/><br/>In reading this book, you will discover that precolonial Filipinos had a complex social structure that was more advanced than previously acknowledged.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Trade and commerce flourished in the archipelago even before Magellan’s arrival. </li>
<li>Precolonial Filipinos were expert seafarers with a deep connection to water. </li>
<li>Some of the traditions and practices from precolonial times continue to live on today. </li>
</ul>
<br/>You will love this book if you are interested in learning more about Filipinos’ resilience and adaptability with the introduction of Spanish influences in their culture. Fans of history will enjoy reading about how historical events have shaped culture. Those interested in trade and economics may be surprised in the role the Philippines played in globalization.  <br/><br/>I wrote <i>1521: Re-Discovering the History of the Philippines </i>for the Filipino diaspora, especially the next generation, with the hope that this book will lead to a deeper appreciation of our rich and colorful Filipino heritage.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that this book inspires meaningful dialogue and the opportunity to reflect on questions like: <ul>
<li>How can lessons learned from these forgotten stories of our ancestors shape our identity? </li>
<li>How can this new understanding of our shared past lead to empowerment for Filipino immigrant communities? </li>
<li>How can we build a better appreciation of Filipino heritage for future generations of the diaspora?</li>
</ul>
<p><br/>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.  <strong>My hope is that in re-discovering our history, we learn who we were, who we are, and who we can be.  </strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - 1521: Re-Discovering the History of the Philippines</h3>
<p>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. This includes an overview of the Philippines and origins of precolonial Filipinos. It also looks closely at how our understanding of our own history has been shaped by the biases of the writers of history.  <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-16. Here you will find stories of the push and pull of a variety of influences including geography, religion, and economics to create the rich and colorful tapestry of Filipino culture today. Beginning with a fresh look at Magellan’s journey, this part also includes chapters that explore aspects of Filipino life at the time of conquest.  <br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 17-21. This last section has stories from the diaspora such as the first Filipino community in the US, recorded as early as 1763. It also includes interviews from Filipino diaspora as they share insights from their experiences and on how knowing our history affects our culture and identity.  <br/><br/> </p>

1521: Re-Discovering the History of the Philippines tells the forgotten stories of Filipinos in the advent of Spanish colonization, beginning with Magellan’s arrival in the archipelago. This book offers a unique Filipino perspective.  My name is Judy Robinson and I wrote this book because after revisiting the story of Magellan’s “discovery” of the islands, I learned new information that I didn’t remember reading about in history textbooks growing up in the Philippines. I decided to keep reading about early colonial history. The more I that researched, the more surprises that I found.  In reading this book, you will discover that precolonial Filipinos had a complex social structure that was more advanced than previously acknowledged.  

Trade and commerce flourished in the archipelago even before Magellan’s arrival. 
Precolonial Filipinos were expert seafarers with a deep connection to water. 
Some of the traditions and practices from precolonial times continue to live on today. 

You will love this book if you are interested in learning more about Filipinos’ resilience and adaptability with the introduction of Spanish influences in their culture. Fans of history will enjoy reading about how historical events have shaped culture. Those interested in trade and economics may be surprised in the role the Philippines played in globalization.  I wrote 1521: Re-Discovering the History of the Philippines for the Filipino diaspora, especially the next generation, with the hope that this book will lead to a deeper appreciation of our rich and colorful Filipino heritage.  Ultimately, I hope that this book inspires meaningful dialogue and the opportunity to reflect on questions like: 
How can lessons learned from these forgotten stories of our ancestors shape our identity? 
How can this new understanding of our shared past lead to empowerment for Filipino immigrant communities? 
How can we build a better appreciation of Filipino heritage for future generations of the diaspora?

I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers.  My hope is that in re-discovering our history, we learn who we were, who we are, and who we can be.  
 
The Book - 1521: Re-Discovering the History of the Philippines
The book is written in three parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. This includes an overview of the Philippines and origins of precolonial Filipinos. It also looks closely at how our understanding of our own history has been shaped by the biases of the writers of history.  Part 2 contains chapters 4-16. Here you will find stories of the push and pull of a variety of influences including geography, religion, and economics to create the rich and colorful tapestry of Filipino culture today. Beginning with a fresh look at Magellan’s journey, this part also includes chapters that explore aspects of Filipino life at the time of conquest.  Part 3 contains chapters 17-21. This last section has stories from the diaspora such as the first Filipino community in the US, recorded as early as 1763. It also includes interviews from Filipino diaspora as they share insights from their experiences and on how knowing our history affects our culture and identity.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>My book is about handling the challenges of change during a significant transition period by taking advantage of the right kind of support networks to bring about a better sense of purpose so we can develop a more just society. I put the reader in the shoes of one of my former students to get a better idea of what needs changing in society. As she lives in rural Thailand, she develops a particular perception of how the world works through technology and the media. Because she lives in a bubble, the only way for her to get a better understanding of what goes on in society is by her teachers.<br/> </p><p><i>The Diverging: Searching for Clarity</i> sheds light on how we’re losing trust in many parts of our society and the implications this has on people’s lives. To be able to bring about change, we must able to be resilient, and a good way to do this is by doing something that you least expect, like experiencing another culture.</p><p><br/>My name is Christopher Pinkos and I am the author of <i>The Diverging: Searching for Clarity</i>. I wrote this book because we are in a pivotal transition point and to move forward in a sustainable manner, we must be able to know what is worth our time to help make the world a better place. If humanity wants to progress into the next century, we must work toward solving the most pressing challenges of our current century before we even think about what to do in the next century.  <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that to make society better, we must re-establish trust in our institutions during a time where change is disrupting many people’s lives. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for making the world a better place through finding purpose. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you do something about it and give the next generation a better place to live.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about what our institutions have done to cause us to lose faith in our system and what needs to be done to fix it by giving some possible solutions:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Kunjira’s understanding of the world</strong> - Coming from rural Thailand, Kunjira who is a middle school student develops a particular perception of how the world works. With the rise in technology, she can find out what is going on around her. Still, she isn't familiar with everything she sees, so Kunjira relies on her teachers to fill in the gaps, but her teachers are in a predicament of their own. As her teachers aren't in a suitable position to give Kunjira the education she deserves because of other tasks that require their attention, Thai teachers don't have much choice but to cancel class on some occasions. With limited resources in the classroom, Kunjira realizes that she must do more on her own so she can achieve her goals in life. If there wasn't a foreign teacher to help Kunjira realize her full potential, she would be less prepared to handle the changes of today's economy. The experiences Kunjira goes through is a typical occurrence in many rural places around the world.</li>
<li>
<strong>Understanding why there’s a rise in distrust with many of our institutions around the world</strong> - Just before Kunjira decides to get some sleep, she watches the movie <i>Hachiko Monogatari</i>. As she watches the film, Kunjira falls asleep and dreams about being right in the middle of Hachiko scramble during the evening rush. Since Hachiko Scramble is the busiest intersection in the world, it has to live up to this reputation, which makes it the perfect place to talk about people's concerns. Because the dream was so vivid, Kunjira wants to know more about what she heard. She notices that a lot of people are going through tough times. As the general public becomes more vulnerable to change, it is more important now that our elected officials support the interest of many instead of the few because we are seeing many of us struggling to handle uncertainty.</li>
<li>
<strong>What can be done</strong> - If we want to be able to make the world a better place for Kunjira and the many other people who have a tougher time finding opportunities because of where you come from, you must know that you are not alone. Many of us want to make the world a better place but find it hard to start as getting a job that is worthwhile nowadays isn’t easy. With the right support, you will be able to handle any obstacle that comes your way, plus you will be able to live a better life. By looking at the Hispanic Paradox and the Roseto Effect, people who form tight communities tend to do better and live healthier lives. As a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (RPCV), I have seen that people are better off when you develop more inclusive societies.</li>
</ul><p><br/>You will love this book if you need help finding purpose as you move from one thing to another.<br/><br/><i>The Diverging: Searching for Clarity</i> is a creative non-fiction book that speaks to students and recent graduates who are looking at how they fit in the world and what contributions they can make to better our society for the first time.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Book - <i>The Diverging: Searching for Clarity</i></strong></h3><p><br/>The book is written in 4 Parts:<br/><br/><b>Part 1: Misconceptions</b> contains the Introduction or Prologue + Chapters 1-3. We all go through some form of change in our lives, even when it might be scary. Going through something different is part of life, and we need to be able to cope with transitions. One of the most frightening things anyone can experience is going to another country for an extended period. Going to a new place for the first time can be a terrifying experience, especially when you don’t know much about where you are going.  <br/><br/><b>Part 2: Shatterings</b> contains Chapters 4-8. Now you have adjusted to your new life abroad. But with technology, you can keep track of what is going on back home and you don’t like everything you’re hearing. You go to work and hear people talking about some bad things going on in the United States, and you start to feel bad. You don’t want to start a scene so you bury what you hear, leading you to feel homesick. Instead of staying down, you decide to research the reason we got into this mess. You discover some interesting information, so you choose to write.<br/><br/><b>Part 3: Lenses</b> contain Chapters 9-14. You get the news that one of your friends is abroad but working as a teacher in Thailand. Because he is also working in another country, you decide to reach out, thinking that you can catch up and maybe do some traveling. He contacts you, saying he would love to catch up and possibly travel over a holiday. Since Thailand is a popular tourist destination, you decide to visit him when you have time off. By talking with him, you discover that one of his students is very bright and can do big things, but she doesn't come from a developed area, so her prospects are quite low. Even though she is uncertain about what her future has in store, she still wants to learn as much as possible.  <br/><br/><b>Part 4: Directions</b> contains Chapter 15 (Conclusion). You have completed your work and realize that time has gone by so fast. As you arrive back in the United States, you notice that the friend you met in Thailand is also in the United States and staying not too far from you. You decide to meet up because it has been a year you haven’t seen each other. While talking with him, you get the impression that something’s up, so you ask him what’s on his mind. You find out that he was moved by what his former student had said and wants to make more of a difference in the world. Because you were also abroad, he’s interested in working with you on developing a social enterprise. <br/><br/>I wanted to frame the book around the concept of a diverging lens because we are searching for the right path out of many beams of parallel rays of light. Since we are in a dark moment, we are looking for the best way to provide us with lighter prospects.</p><h3>

I put the reader in the shoes of one of my former students to get a better idea of what needs changing in society. As she lives in rural Thailand, she develops a particular perception of how the world works through technology and the media. Because she lives in a bubble, the only way for her to get a better understanding of what goes on in society is by her teachers. The Diverging: Searching for Clarity sheds light on how we’re losing trust in many parts of our society and the implications this has on people’s lives. To be able to bring about change, we must able to be resilient, and a good way to do this is by doing something that you least expect, like experiencing another culture.My name is Christopher Pinkos and I am the author of The Diverging: Searching for Clarity. I wrote this book because we are in a pivotal transition point and to move forward in a sustainable manner, we must be able to know what is worth our time to help make the world a better place. If humanity wants to progress into the next century, we must work toward solving the most pressing challenges of our current century before we even think about what to do in the next century.  My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that to make society better, we must re-establish trust in our institutions during a time where change is disrupting many people’s lives. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for making the world a better place through finding purpose. And then ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you do something about it and give the next generation a better place to live.In this book, you'll learn about what our institutions have done to cause us to lose faith in our system and what needs to be done to fix it by giving some possible solutions:

Kunjira’s understanding of the world - Coming from rural Thailand, Kunjira who is a middle school student develops a particular perception of how the world works. With the rise in technology, she can find out what is going on around her. Still, she isn't familiar with everything she sees, so Kunjira relies on her teachers to fill in the gaps, but her teachers are in a predicament of their own. As her teachers aren't in a suitable position to give Kunjira the education she deserves because of other tasks that require their attention, Thai teachers don't have much choice but to cancel class on some occasions. With limited resources in the classroom, Kunjira realizes that she must do more on her own so she can achieve her goals in life. If there wasn't a foreign teacher to help Kunjira realize her full potential, she would be less prepared to handle the changes of today's economy. The experiences Kunjira goes through is a typical occurrence in many rural places around the world.

Understanding why there’s a rise in distrust with many of our institutions around the world - Just before Kunjira decides to get some sleep, she watches the movie Hachiko Monogatari. As she watches the film, Kunjira falls asleep and dreams about being right in the middle of Hachiko scramble during the evening rush. Since Hachiko Scramble is the busiest intersection in the world, it has to live up to this reputation, which makes it the perfect place to talk about people's concerns. Because the dream was so vivid, Kunjira wants to know more about what she heard. She notices that a lot of people are going through tough times. As the general public becomes more vulnerable to change, it is more important now that our elected officials support the interest of many instead of the few because we are seeing many of us struggling to handle uncertainty.

What can be done - If we want to be able to make the world a better place for Kunjira and the many other people who have a tougher time finding opportunities because of where you come from, you must know that you are not alone. Many of us want to make the world a better place but find it hard to start as getting a job that is worthwhile nowadays isn’t easy. With the right support, you will be able to handle any obstacle that comes your way, plus you will be able to live a better life. By looking at the Hispanic Paradox and the Roseto Effect, people who form tight communities tend to do better and live healthier lives. As a Returned Peace Corps Volunteer (RPCV), I have seen that people are better off when you develop more inclusive societies.
You will love this book if you need help finding purpose as you move from one thing to another.The Diverging: Searching for Clarity is a creative non-fiction book that speaks to students and recent graduates who are looking at how they fit in the world and what contributions they can make to better our society for the first time. The Book - The Diverging: Searching for ClarityThe book is written in 4 Parts:Part 1: Misconceptions contains the Introduction or Prologue + Chapters 1-3. We all go through some form of change in our lives, even when it might be scary. Going through something different is part of life, and we need to be able to cope with transitions. One of the most frightening things anyone can experience is going to another country for an extended period. Going to a new place for the first time can be a terrifying experience, especially when you don’t know much about where you are going.  Part 2: Shatterings contains Chapters 4-8. Now you have adjusted to your new life abroad. But with technology, you can keep track of what is going on back home and you don’t like everything you’re hearing. You go to work and hear people talking about some bad things going on in the United States, and you start to feel bad. You don’t want to start a scene so you bury what you hear, leading you to feel homesick. Instead of staying down, you decide to research the reason we got into this mess. You discover some interesting information, so you choose to write.Part 3: Lenses contain Chapters 9-14. You get the news that one of your friends is abroad but working as a teacher in Thailand. Because he is also working in another country, you decide to reach out, thinking that you can catch up and maybe do some traveling. He contacts you, saying he would love to catch up and possibly travel over a holiday. Since Thailand is a popular tourist destination, you decide to visit him when you have time off. By talking with him, you discover that one of his students is very bright and can do big things, but she doesn't come from a developed area, so her prospects are quite low. Even though she is uncertain about what her future has in store, she still wants to learn as much as possible.  Part 4: Directions contains Chapter 15 (Conclusion). You have completed your work and realize that time has gone by so fast. As you arrive back in the United States, you notice that the friend you met in Thailand is also in the United States and staying not too far from you. You decide to meet up because it has been a year you haven’t seen each other. While talking with him, you get the impression that something’s up, so you ask him what’s on his mind. You find out that he was moved by what his former student had said and wants to make more of a difference in the world. Because you were also abroad, he’s interested in working with you on developing a social enterprise. I wanted to frame the book around the concept of a diverging lens because we are searching for the right path out of many beams of parallel rays of light. Since we are in a dark moment, we are looking for the best way to provide us with lighter prospects.

<h3>Our Story</h3>We are everyday women that wanted an everyday solution to the mess we called our closets. (and our lives...shhh....) We quickly realized that 99.95678% of women cannot identify with the Rachel Zoe's of the world. While fabulous, I can't spend $900 per designer sock. You know? Reality sunk in and we wanted to inspire the everyday woman to get off the couch, dust off her cheeto sweatpants and make some changes to her wardrobe (and her life...shhh..) Women, we get it...life is hard. You have stress coming at you from every angle, don't let one of those stresses be your appearance. We have developed ""Five Weeks to Fabulous"" - it's a five week no-fail plan to take your appearance from drab to fab! <br/><br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Our book is an inspiration to women of all ages. A preteen can read our book and get the same inspiration from it as a post-menopausal woman. (but we don't talk about menopause because it's made of evil) This book isn't about spending 7 million dollars on a new wardrobe - it's about organizing your life. We truly believe that women need a book like this. A plan that is easy to follow, doesn't cost a lot of money and gives them real world advice is what women have been waiting for. We want to inspire women of all ages to find their confidence and organize their lives so they can tackle the world every single day with the determination to succeed. If our book doesn't get printed, women may continue to wear cheeto sweatpants in public...men, do you really want that to happen? <br/><br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The money will be used for editing, the design of the front and back cover of the book. It will also be used for the inside layout, photography and marketing. Depending on the amount you choose to give you will get some great perks Including dinner with both the author's...and we are awesome so I wouldn't miss out that opportunity. <br/></p>

Ideas would come and go but the discipline to finish things... to 'close the deal' so to speak... was lacking!</p><p>Then... the ultimate incentive came along... on April 25th, 2011.. my son Luka was born... all 9lbs 10oz of him! </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/287803/files/20140102112116-2012-05-11_19.13.45.jpg?1388690476"" src="""" style=""width: 568px; height: 757px;""/></p><br/><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">I had not been exposed as a child to many English children's books (having been raised with Ukrainian as my first language) but of course, with Luka's arrival, I quickly became OVER-EXPOSED to them. After reading what seems like thousands of them, I came to the following realization: </span></p><p></p><p>Some of these are plain TERRIBLE! </p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I started to long for children's stories that had a beginning, middle and an end (for ex. The Gruffalo- excellent book!). Inevitably, a thought came to mind: Wouldn't it be great if I could write a children's story that Luka would be able to read to his child someday? Luka could tell his son or daughter that Grandpa wrote this! How cool would that be!?!</span></p><p>Luckily, I already had an idea courtesy of my 3 year old nephew Maksym. On the way back from the beach in Gimli (a small town along Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba), there is an enormous white adirondack chair by the side of Hwy #8 nestled in front of a pine forest.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/287783/files/20140102111437-big_chair.jpg?1388690077"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p> My nephew was terrified of this chair. He would always ask: 'What giant sits in that chair? Why is he watching me? What does he want?' So of course, I thought it would be a neat little children's story to describe who sits in the chair and why he sits there, all alone,by the side of the road.</p><p>After about a year of writing... deleting... then writing again... I've completed the book and now hope to self-publish it.  The story revolves around a boy who grows so large he is a danger to the people around him (who happen to be 2 feet tall... close to my hobbit-like height!). The villagers build him a home in the woods and a chair by the road where he would wait for his friends to come and play with him.</p><p><br/></p><p>Eventually, he gets quite lonely and is saved by the emergence of a giant dog that befriends him.</p><p><br/></p><p>Here's a short snippet from the story:</p><p>""He had paws much larger t<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">han any regular feet,</span></p><p></p><p>And fur golden brown , l<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">ike an ocean of wheat.</span></p><p>He had big floppy ears. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">His eyes were constantly smiling,</span></p><p>And his tail caused a gale t<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">hat was quite alarming!</span></p><p>He followed Luka everywhere: <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">To his home and through the glen,</span></p><p>To the stream in the woods...<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">And then back again!</span></p><p>They played in the forest t<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">hrough all kinds of weather.</span></p><p>Come rain or come shine, t<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">hey were always together.</span></p><p>Except late every evening, b<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">y the light of the moon,</span></p><p>The dog went away a<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">nd would be back before noon.</span></p><p>Although Luka would worry w<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">hen he left every day,</span></p><p>Once he returned <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Luka would lovingly say:</span></p><p><i>‘I don’t know where you go to, <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I don’t even know your name.</span></i></p><p><i>I don’t know if you’ll stay with me,</i></p><p><i>But I love you just the same!</i></p><p><i>If you ever find yourself </i></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Lost, and not sure where to go,</i></span></p><p><i>I’ll be waiting for you,</i></p><p><i>In my chair by the side of the road.""</i></p><p></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">I commissioned custom illustrations by Natasha Boone, an awesome illustrator I discovered that lives right here within the frigid borders  of Winnipeg (my hometown!).

Ideas would come and go but the discipline to finish things... to 'close the deal' so to speak... was lacking!Then... the ultimate incentive came along... on April 25th, 2011.. my son Luka was born... all 9lbs 10oz of him! I had not been exposed as a child to many English children's books (having been raised with Ukrainian as my first language) but of course, with Luka's arrival, I quickly became OVER-EXPOSED to them. After reading what seems like thousands of them, I came to the following realization: Some of these are plain TERRIBLE! I started to long for children's stories that had a beginning, middle and an end (for ex. The Gruffalo- excellent book!). Inevitably, a thought came to mind: Wouldn't it be great if I could write a children's story that Luka would be able to read to his child someday? Luka could tell his son or daughter that Grandpa wrote this! How cool would that be!?!Luckily, I already had an idea courtesy of my 3 year old nephew Maksym. On the way back from the beach in Gimli (a small town along Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba), there is an enormous white adirondack chair by the side of Hwy #8 nestled in front of a pine forest. My nephew was terrified of this chair. He would always ask: 'What giant sits in that chair? Why is he watching me? What does he want?' So of course, I thought it would be a neat little children's story to describe who sits in the chair and why he sits there, all alone,by the side of the road.After about a year of writing... deleting... then writing again... I've completed the book and now hope to self-publish it.  The story revolves around a boy who grows so large he is a danger to the people around him (who happen to be 2 feet tall... close to my hobbit-like height!). The villagers build him a home in the woods and a chair by the road where he would wait for his friends to come and play with him.Eventually, he gets quite lonely and is saved by the emergence of a giant dog that befriends him.Here's a short snippet from the story:""He had paws much larger than any regular feet,And fur golden brown , like an ocean of wheat.He had big floppy ears. His eyes were constantly smiling,And his tail caused a gale that was quite alarming!He followed Luka everywhere: To his home and through the glen,To the stream in the woods...And then back again!They played in the forest through all kinds of weather.Come rain or come shine, they were always together.Except late every evening, by the light of the moon,The dog went away and would be back before noon.Although Luka would worry when he left every day,Once he returned Luka would lovingly say:‘I don’t know where you go to, I don’t even know your name.I don’t know if you’ll stay with me,But I love you just the same!If you ever find yourself Lost, and not sure where to go,I’ll be waiting for you,In my chair by the side of the road.""I commissioned custom illustrations by Natasha Boone, an awesome illustrator I discovered that lives right here within the frigid borders  of Winnipeg (my hometown!). Here is an example of some of the rough drafts (final copy yet to come):With Natasha's support/great work and the support of my wife Joleen and her good friend Theresa (who has become my publicist... feels surreal even saying that!!!!), I am 75% of the way to my goal: Leaving tangible evidence for my son that Dad wasn't a total idiot!  I am going to try to get the book 'out-there'. I've never done this before but maybe... just maybe... people will like it! I do hope so!What the money will be used forAfter much research and haggling... the costs have 'shaken down' as follows:1) Friesen Press/Publishing/Illustrator(copy edit, layout, publishing- ebook, hardcover, paperback,illustrations etc) plus Illustrator- $6600.003) Marketing- $3000.00I have already paid the illustrator. After the publishing costs have been covered, I would like to market the book as much as possible (any excess funds will go to that end)If you can't contribute:Any word of mouth is helpful.

<p>The idea behind <i>Blue Lips</i> is
to create a collection that tells my personal story around the theme of violence, abuse,
hope and recovery. I believe that this is a universal topic that everyone
around the world can relate to and it has been an integral part of my
storytelling. This campaign will help me offset the cost of getting the
collection published. As an artist, it is hard to create materials without the
proper funding so I am reaching out to the community for support in publishing
the first 150 copies. In the future, I would like to find a sponsor that will pay for the printing of the book and I can donate the books to different venues that battle violence and abuse in the community.</p>

accident in 2009, I reflected upon my life and created a list of my
values.  Essentially by making this list, I was taking an emotional and
spiritual inventory and rekindling my self-love—the third wave of self-love
I’ve experienced in my adult life.   Gradually, I began realigning
myself with those values.      This love became the foundation
for my forthcoming book, <i>Midnight Peaches, Two O’Clock Patience</i>, which is a
collection of essays, poetry, prose, and fiction on themes ranging from
motherhood and ancestral connection to body image and sexuality.  The
title traces its origin to a line from one of my poems,  “Midnight
peaches…two o’clock patience.  That’s all she needed,” referring to my
daughter waking up in the middle of the night to eat peaches and then returning
to sleep. Collectively, these pieces become a story of a woman’s desire to
become reacquainted with herself.   </font></span></p>

self-love that followed that process.  Thanks to your kind donations,
Broken Shackle Publishing, Int'l was born and Crushing Soft Rubies was

San Francisco State University, Santa Rosa Junior College, and Gavilan College
and has led to a number of fabulous opportunities to do readings, performances,
and speaking engagements at various venues across the country.  
Throughout this journey, I have learned about the healing power of words--how a
single person’s story creates the space for others to share their stories,
forming a communal healing circle that knows no boundaries.  Now
through <i>Midnight Peaches, Two O’Clock Patience</i>, I've learned, once again,
how self-love can inspire all of us to create.</font></p><p></p><p></p>

and has led to a number of fabulous opportunities to do readings, performances,
and speaking engagements at various venues across the country.  
Throughout this journey, I have learned about the healing power of words--how a
single person’s story creates the space for others to share their stories,
forming a communal healing circle that knows no boundaries.  Now
through Midnight Peaches, Two O’Clock Patience, I've learned, once again,
how self-love can inspire all of us to create.
To assist with the
publication, promotion, and distribution of Midnight Peaches, Two O’Clock
Patience by January 2012, I am seeking the generous support of donors.   I
know these are difficult economic times, so any help you can provide will be
greatly appreciated.

<div>CJ is a 16 year old boy with Mitochondrial Disease. For CJ everyday is a battle. CJ’s mitochondrial disease presents as fatigue, failure to gain weight, short stature, ptosis, hypotonia, muscle weakness and cramping, irritable bowel syndrome, hearing loss, gastrointestinal problems, dysautonomia, migraines, autistic features, mental retardation, developmental delays, vomiting, and nausea. When <span class=""text_exposed_show"">you have a disease that is not well understood such as mitochondrial disease, it is hard for others to truly understand what you are going through. They may think that you look too healthy to be missing so much school or they misjudge you. You see other kids out playing sports and going to school every day. You wish that you could do that, too, instead of sitting home and resting or taking so many medicines every day. Yet, all you really want to do is be healthy enough to go to school, play outside without getting sick. You're tired of going to the doctors so much and needing to be in the hospital because you don't feel good. CJ’s anxiety makes him uncomfortable entering new situations. Transitions are stressful for him, and he needs extra support for them to be successful. Social situations are also extremely difficult because CJ has trouble interacting with other children and adults.<br/> We are thrilled to have the opportunity for CJ to have a NEADS dog! This dog would help him to feel more secure during transitions, and perhaps be more receptive to new experiences. A NEADs dog can be a constant friend and support during his numerous medical visits. A NEADs dog can be trained to help calm him when he is becoming overwhelmed. CJ’s dog would be his best friend and a comfort to him when he needs to rest instead of doing all those things that most peers and even adults take for granted.<br/> We are trying to raise $9500.00 for this special dog for CJ. We hope that you will help CJ reach his goal.<br/> We would appreciate your support for CJ and Neads and are most grateful for consideration of such.<br/> Thank-You!</span>

<p><strong>CONTEXT  </strong>Traditionally the practice of gleaning was a social activity, typically carried out by poor peasant woman. Together they would carefully and diligently reap the fields of left over food after the harvest. Gleaning was a widely accepted practice, and was conceived as a measure of welfare for those less fortunate. However controversial, as gleaners would make use of food that did not belong to them on land that was not theirs. The attitude of the time was prudent and sensible therefore food must not be wasted and such a practice was thought to be beneficial to everyone.</p>

<div>I've been offered a place on the Clipperton Project, a research and education program, that among other things goes on sailing expeditions with groups of artists across the world.

</div> <p>I will be using this fantastic opportunity to finalize my second poetry collection. This residency will give me unadulterated time away from the internet to work on this.

Not a huge amount in the grand scheme of things, but for 4 weeks that adds up to an £800 I don't have. </p>
<p>Being a freelancer at the moment, this also means not making an income for the month, so I would be really keen to cover the basics of the expedition (not counting the cost of getting up to Scotland etc) so that I can attend it. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What you get</h3> <p>I know this is a lot of money, but  I hope that the rewards are interesting enough to tempt you to pitch in. I can't emphasize enough what a difference this will make to me, and my writing practice.</p>
<p>Anyone who contributes to this fund, whether small or large amounts, will get thanked in my next book and on my website.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Who am I?</h3>-I'm a poet. My first collection <i>The Shipwrecked House, </i>published by Penned in the Margins was longlisted in the Guardian First Book Awards and has been touring the UK as a one-woman show thanks to Arts Council Funding. I also published a pamphlet with Salt called <i>Low-Tide Lottery. </i>My poems have appeared in all sorts of anthologies, newspapers and magazines over the years including <i>Best British Poetry 2012, The Guardian, The Sunday Times, Magma, POETRY (Chicago), The Charnel House, Furies: Poetry of Women Warriors, </i>etc. I've read my poetry in all sorts of places from Paris to (soon) NYC, from the Ledbury Poetry Festival to The Cube Cinema in Bristol.... </div><div>-I'm also an editor. You might know <i>Sabotage Reviews</i>, a website I founded nearly five years ago which reviews indie literature. With Tori Truslow I co-edited Verse Kraken, a hybrid art journal that was created thanks to crowdfunding. I also co-organized <i>Penning Perfumes </i>with Odette Toilette, a creative collaboration between poets and perfumers, which toured the UK and resulted in two anthologies edited by me. I'm currently co-editing with Gareth Prior an anthology called <i>Other Countries: Contemporary Poets Rewiring History.</i>
</div><div>-I have given poetry workshops for a while now, from local writing groups to Verse Kraken residencies, to Poetry School courses. I have lectured in universities (in French, mind you) for half a decade too, so teaching is something that feels quite natural to me.</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't donate anything at the moment, I completely understand, times are hard! It'd be awesome if you could give a shout out on social media!</p>
<h3>Small Print</h3>
<p>In the unlikely event that I raise more than the target, extra money will go towards travel expenses, which are not insubstantial and also covering IndieGoGo fees which take a small percentage of each donation.</p>

Being a freelancer at the moment, this also means not making an income for the month, so I would be really keen to cover the basics of the expedition (not counting the cost of getting up to Scotland etc) so that I can attend it. 

  What you get I know this is a lot of money, but  I hope that the rewards are interesting enough to tempt you to pitch in. I can't emphasize enough what a difference this will make to me, and my writing practice.
Anyone who contributes to this fund, whether small or large amounts, will get thanked in my next book and on my website.

Who am I?-I'm a poet. My first collection The Shipwrecked House, published by Penned in the Margins was longlisted in the Guardian First Book Awards and has been touring the UK as a one-woman show thanks to Arts Council Funding. I also published a pamphlet with Salt called Low-Tide Lottery. My poems have appeared in all sorts of anthologies, newspapers and magazines over the years including Best British Poetry 2012, The Guardian, The Sunday Times, Magma, POETRY (Chicago), The Charnel House, Furies: Poetry of Women Warriors, etc. I've read my poetry in all sorts of places from Paris to (soon) NYC, from the Ledbury Poetry Festival to The Cube Cinema in Bristol.... -I'm also an editor. You might know Sabotage Reviews, a website I founded nearly five years ago which reviews indie literature. With Tori Truslow I co-edited Verse Kraken, a hybrid art journal that was created thanks to crowdfunding. I also co-organized Penning Perfumes with Odette Toilette, a creative collaboration between poets and perfumers, which toured the UK and resulted in two anthologies edited by me. I'm currently co-editing with Gareth Prior an anthology called Other Countries: Contemporary Poets Rewiring History.
-I have given poetry workshops for a while now, from local writing groups to Verse Kraken residencies, to Poetry School courses. I have lectured in universities (in French, mind you) for half a decade too, so teaching is something that feels quite natural to me.  Other Ways You Can Help If you can't donate anything at the moment, I completely understand, times are hard! It'd be awesome if you could give a shout out on social media!

<div><p>This is a heartfelt book comprised of real and raw stories of immigrant experiences with empowering ways to reshape hardships through love and forgiveness. Expected to publish in April 2020.</p></div>
<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>My name is Ha Young Shin and I am the author of <i>Reframing the Hyphen: A Christian Perspective on Immigrant Experiences</i>. About a year ago, I found myself at the hospital for what doctors suspected was an autoimmune disease. It was a couple months after my 25th birthday and I hardly had enough strength to do the bare minimum. When I realized that I could not take health for granted, I felt compelled to write this book because I had always desired to share how the Christian faith has helped me to navigate through many obstacles as an immigrant. However, I thought of it as a long-term goal more than anything. I realized that in life, there probably wasn’t going to be the “perfect time” to write a book. For the things that really mattered to me, I knew I had to carve out the time which is why I’m here today.</p>
<p>Since my immigration, I have experienced many internal and external struggles. Internal struggles such as not knowing where I belonged in the “hyphen” of being Korean-American, as well as not knowing how to filter out the different messages from the two distinctive cultures I was part of. External struggles included facing deportation and trying to navigate and assimilate into a foreign country whose language, culture, and systems I was not familiar with.<br/><br/>The Christian faith has been an integral part in how I was able to navigate through the chaos and the dark times that revolved around my immigrant struggles. I wanted to share with those who may have felt lonely amidst their journey that they are not alone and also encourage them to reshape their minds around their difficult circumstances. My hope is that in reading this book, readers will be able to reflect on their personal journeys and choose to reframe their hardships so that if there are residues of resentment and bitterness left in their hearts, they can choose to forgive and have peace.<br/><br/>Through this book, I hope to instill the power of choice so that you, the reader, are able to reframe your mind around your struggles.<br/><br/>You will likely love this book if you:</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Ha Young Shin is a 1.5 generation Korean-American immigrant and a proud alumna of Georgetown University where she was part of the Georgetown Scholars Program (GSP).

She is also a full-time financial analyst by day and an evening MBA student (at Georgetown) by night.<br/><br/>Ha Young felt compelled to write this book because for the longest time, she felt confused and alone during her immigrant journey and wanted to share her experiences with those who may have felt similarly.

Story of My Book
My name is Ha Young Shin and I am the author of Reframing the Hyphen: A Christian Perspective on Immigrant Experiences. About a year ago, I found myself at the hospital for what doctors suspected was an autoimmune disease. It was a couple months after my 25th birthday and I hardly had enough strength to do the bare minimum. When I realized that I could not take health for granted, I felt compelled to write this book because I had always desired to share how the Christian faith has helped me to navigate through many obstacles as an immigrant. However, I thought of it as a long-term goal more than anything. I realized that in life, there probably wasn’t going to be the “perfect time” to write a book. For the things that really mattered to me, I knew I had to carve out the time which is why I’m here today.
Since my immigration, I have experienced many internal and external struggles. Internal struggles such as not knowing where I belonged in the “hyphen” of being Korean-American, as well as not knowing how to filter out the different messages from the two distinctive cultures I was part of. External struggles included facing deportation and trying to navigate and assimilate into a foreign country whose language, culture, and systems I was not familiar with.The Christian faith has been an integral part in how I was able to navigate through the chaos and the dark times that revolved around my immigrant struggles. I wanted to share with those who may have felt lonely amidst their journey that they are not alone and also encourage them to reshape their minds around their difficult circumstances. My hope is that in reading this book, readers will be able to reflect on their personal journeys and choose to reframe their hardships so that if there are residues of resentment and bitterness left in their hearts, they can choose to forgive and have peace.Through this book, I hope to instill the power of choice so that you, the reader, are able to reframe your mind around your struggles.You will likely love this book if you:

Are an immigrant or your parents/grandparents were immigrants
Want to learn about the struggles that immigrants face through real and authentic stories
Want to see examples of how you can apply Christian principles toward your hardships

Reframing the Hyphen: A Christian Perspective on Immigrant Experiences is a non-fiction book that encourages immigrants and those who want to learn more about immigrant experiences to reframe their obstacles through the Christian faith.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>The book that led us to form a publishing company is the one that we are now turning into an audio book. Four Words by Demetrius O. Davis has been a grand hit with all who have read it and we are taking it to the next level with an audio version so we can reach those many people within our market who prefer audio to the printed word.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our budget for this project is $3900. This includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professional recording at Silver Sound Production in Hatfield, PA.</li>
<li>Reading done by Philadelphia musician Supreem of Supreem and the New Experience.</li>
<li>High quality editing and mastering by Kevin Frank at Silver Sound Production.</li>
<li>Professional quality cd replication and packaging (first 500 units).</li>
</ul>
<p>We will be sharing the finished product with our supporters along with varied levels of related merchandise (ie. Signed copies of the book, signed copies of the audio book, digital downloads, t-shirts that accompany the book, etc). For higher level supporters, co-producer credits and special invitations are also included.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Lazie Horse Publishing has worked hard to provide our authors a high quality product and a top notch experience with a publisher that more closely resembles a traditional publishing situation than a small independent press. We believe in creativity, freedom of expression and in the idea that there are many wonderful stories out there that deserve to be heard. With your help, we can bring this project to another level and get one step closer to being what we’ve envisioned Lazie Horse Publishing to be.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Lazie Horse Publishing is still a fairly new company, and still fairly unknown. We’ve built this company from nothing using money from our own pockets. There have been no bank loans or corporate sponsors, so we’ve been taking very small steps toward our success. If you are unable to help financially, here are some other ideas:</p>

<li>Help us spread the word about this campaign (don’t forget about Indiegogo share tools!)</li>
<li>Help us spread the word about Lazie Horse (<a href=""http://www.LazieHorse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.LazieHorse.com</a>)</li>
<li>If you know anyone who owns a store where they sell books or audio books, send them our way. We have a wholesale program that offers retailers a direct from Lazie Horse price that’s better than you can get from any distributor (even if you only want one copy).</li>
<li>Our authors are available for speaking engagements, book signings and other events. If you know someone who might be interested in this sort of thing, pass the info along.</li>

<h2>About Narrator Magazine<br/>
</h2>
<p>Narrator is a free, online creative writing magazine, released once a quarter. Currently all residents of NSW and ACT can contribute, and we're hoping to launch other statewide editions soon. Professional and emerging writers submit their poems, stories and essays to Narrator, they're judged by a secret guest judge and the writers can win up to $1,000 per quarter. We also have a People's Choice prize. Authors don't have to pay anything to enter, and it's free to read online, so it's open to absolutely anyone with internet access.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our writers are so grateful they have a place to get published, to 
try their hand. We continually get thanks from authors who have found 
Narrator really boosts their confidence. Many people like to buy the print copy of Narrator ($12.95 an issue) yet others are happy to read it free online or download it for free.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h2>Why do we need help?</h2>Unfortunately, right now Narrator is run by a small family business, and the costs are coming out of our own pockets -
 we can't afford to keep it going. We tried to sell advertising the 
normal way to raise money, but we're just not pushy enough, so we're hoping fellow 
creatives will see the value in our project and help us keep it running!<br/><br/>We really don't want to have to wrap up our project just yet. Everyone's so supportive, and so grateful, that we feel we're really onto a good thing - but the design, proofreading, layout and promotional costs are sending us under!<br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h2>Help us keep it running ... in return, we'll promote you.<br/>
</h2>
<p>We hope our goal of $15,000 will be enough to fund Narrator Magazine for another three issues, and invest a little of that into growth and future-proofing.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Your money will help us keep Narrator running, potentially hire a marketing executive to sell advertising space, and the money from that will help us set up an issue for VIC/TAS writers, then QLD writers, then NT/SA/WA writers- eventually, every emerging writer in Australia would have a chance to see themselves in print and win prizes.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>But we aren't asking for cash with nothing in return! Our main call is for 'page sponsors' - businesses and individuals to 'sponsor a page' and fill the advertising gaps.</p>

The Impact
Having books created by special needs children in school libraries, kindergartens etc exposes mainstream kids to the talents and thought processes of these children. Teachers will find them a great insight as well. And autism aside, these books are perfect for young children as regular readers. They're brightly coloured, not too long, and quirky.
The personal impact on Coop himself would be enormous, as autism spectrum kids often struggle with self-esteem and acceptance. Coop is surrounded by nurturing loving folk, but needs an extra step-up to make him see what he can do with his unique art and stories.


What We Need & What You Get
We need $5000 to get the publishing happening. Every cent goes on printing and distribution. If we raise more, we print more. Coop has an impressive back catalogue of work!
Even if the target money is not raised this time, we will start printing what we can and continue to source more funding to further Coop's career as an artist and story teller.

<h2>Financez des recherches au service de l'Eglise.</h2>
<p>Pasteur de l'<a href=""http://www.epbse.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eglise Protestante Baptiste de Saint-Etienne</a>, je me suis lancé en parallèle, dans un doctorat en théologie à l'Université de Strasbourg, depuis un an maintenant.</p>
<p>Je ne me forme pas uniquement par intérêt académique, mais afin d'acquérir les meilleures compétences possibles pour l'enseignement théologique au service des églises évangéliques. Je suis interpellé par les besoins en formation théologique solide, et en particulier dans les pays francophones du sud.   </p>
<h3><strong>Mon projet</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Mon salaire de pasteur permet de pourvoir aux besoins de ma famille, mais il ne permet pas de couvrir les frais liés à mes études. Je n'ai pas pu trouver de financement pour l'année universitaire 2013-2014, et la date limite d'inscription approche. <em>Je fais donc appel à votre générosité !</em></strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Paiement des droits de scolarité : environ 400 €</li>
<li>6 déplacements sur Strasbourg dans l'année (en train) : 6x100 = 600 €</li>
<li>Achat d'un ordinateur portable (mon fidèle netbook a vécu) : 500 €</li>
</ul>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Total des frais indispensables : 1500 € + comission d'Indiegogo (env. 120 €) = 1620 €</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Si le montant récolté dépasse les 1620 €, j'utiliserais l'argent pour acheter des ouvrages théologiques ou des logiciels bibliques : ce qui me facilitera grandement mes recherches et me sera utile pour la suite !</p>

<p><strong>Un engagement ecclésial :</strong></p>
<p>Pasteur de l’<a href=""http://www.epbse.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eglise Protestante Baptiste de Saint-Etienne</a> (FEEBF). Je suis également le président de la pastorale CNEF de l'agglomération stéphanoise.</p>
<p>Je suis membre du Département Formation de ma famille d'églises (<a href=""http://www.eglises-baptistes.fr/Formation/Accueil.html#.UfeUHNLwnaI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fédération des Eglises Evangéliques Baptistes de France</a>).</p>
<h3>Pourquoi un doctorat en théologie ?</h3>
<p><strong>J'ai le désir de me former au plus haut niveau théologique, afin de participer à l'enseignement théologique au service des églises évangéliques.</strong></p>
<p>Je suis particulièrement convaincu de la nécessité d'une formation théologique évangélique de haut niveau au sein des pays les plus pauvres de la francophonie. Le protestantisme évangélique est  souvent bien développé dans ces pays. Pourtant, peu nombreux sont ceux qui bénéficient d'une formation théologique évangélique de niveau universitaire. </p>

J'ai pu m'y rendre à deux reprises pour y donner des cours groupés. L'ISTE souhaiterait que je puisse venir enseigner de façon permanente à Madagascar. Avec un doctorat en poche, je pourrais notamment suivre des doctorants, et éviter ainsi aux étudiants malgaches de devoir aller à l'étranger pour réaliser leur doctorat.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Mon sujet de thèse</strong></h3>
<p>Mes recherches doctorales ont pour titre : ""<strong>La dimension communautaire de la prophétie dans le Nouveau Testament, et ses antécédents éventuels</strong>"".</p>
<p>Le Nouveau Testament évoque l’existence de prophètes au sein du christianisme naissant. Ces prophètes chrétiens interagissent avec l’Église naissante, mais aussi avec la société de leur temps : ils sont parfois écoutés, mais aussi dénoncés, rejetés ou persécutés, à l’image de leur maître, Jésus-Christ. Au-delà de ces figures prophétiques individuelles, plusieurs textes présentent la <em>communauté </em>chrétienne comme ayant une fonction prophétique collective au sein de son environnement.</p>
<p>Mes recherches ont pour but de mettre en évidence la fonction prophétique <em>de</em> la communauté et <em>dans</em> la communauté, à partir des données du Nouveau Testament<a rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[1]</a>. En quoi consiste exactement cette fonction prophétique ? Quels en sont les enjeux ? Quelles en sont les racines éventuelles, dans l’Ancien Testament<a rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[2]</a> ou dans le judaïsme intertestamentaire<a rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[3]</a> ?</p>
<p><strong>Intérêt académique :</strong></p>
<p>Dans le domaine des sciences bibliques, le prophétisme néotestamentaire n’a été que peu étudié. Aucune étude majeure francophone sur le sujet n’a été produite depuis près de quarante ans. De plus, les études existantes – en français, anglais ou allemand – s’intéressent généralement aux prophètes en tant qu’individus. Au cours de mes recherches de Master sur la question du prophétisme néotestamentair, je n’ai pas rencontré de travaux académiques majeurs sur la dimension communautaire du prophétisme néotestamentaire. J’espère que mes recherches pourront contribuer à réparer cet oubli.</p>
<p>D’un point de vue méthodologique, il existe actuellement un débat parmi les exégètes bibliques sur la manière de mettre en rapport les divers écrits bibliques. La Bible chrétienne est un corpus d’écrits rédigés par divers auteurs, dans divers contextes. En même temps, pour le croyant chrétien, la Bible est bien plus qu’une banale anthologie. Il la lit comme un unique canon pour sa foi, comme LA parole de Dieu. Comment donc répondre de manière honnête à la question : « que dit la Bible sur tel sujet » ? En choisissant d’étudier un thème au sein du corpus biblique, j’espère ainsi contribuer au débat méthodologique concernant l’intertextualité – ou l’intratextualité ? – biblique.</p>
<p></p>
<hr align=""left"" size=""1"" width=""33%""/>
<p>
</p>
<p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[1]</a> Je pense notamment aux textes suivants : Matthieu 7.15-23 ; 10.40-42 ; 23-24 ; Actes 1-4 à mettre en parallèle avec Luc 1-4 ;      1 Corinthiens 11-14 ; Ephésiens 2.20-3.6 ; 4.11-16 ; 1 Jean 4.1-6 ; Apocalypse 2-3 ; 11 ; 19-20.</p>

<h2 id=""English-version"">Serving the Church by funding Theological researches</h2>
<p>I am a Baptist minister in <a href=""http://www.epbse.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Saint-Etienne Baptist Church</a>, near Lyon in France. Beside my pastoral ministry, I have started a PhD in Theology, in Strasbourg University, since a year now.</p>
<p>I do not study theology for academic interest but because I want to take part in Theological training for Evangelical churches. I have a burden for helping churches to develop theological training at a higher level, especially in poorest French speaking countries as Madagascar.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>My project</h3>
<p><strong>My pastoral wages cover everyday needs for my family, but they can not cover my PhD costs. I have not find any funding for the 2013-2014 academic year, and I need to pay quickly university fees. So, I am looking for you to help me in funding my studies.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Costs for 2013-2014 academic year :</strong></p>
<p><strong><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/959342/pictures/full/20130731062709-IMAG0243_20130730114005101.jpg?1375277235"" src="""" style=""margin: 5px 25px; float: left;"" title=""Façade du Palais Universitaire - Strasbourg""/></strong></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scholarship fees : about 400 €</li>
<li>Travelling from Saint-Etienne to Strasbourg (350 miles), 6 times a year (by train) : 6x100 = 600 €</li>
<li>Buying a Netbook (my old one is out of order) : 500 €</li>
</ul>
<p>Total costs : 1500 € + commissions (about 120 €) = 1620 €</p>
<p>If I receive more than 1620 €, I will use the money to buy theological books or softwares.</p>

<p><strong>I want to receive the best theological training in order to serve evangelical churches by teaching theology.</strong></p>
<p>I am conscious about the necessity to develop theological training in the poorest French speaking countries.

<h3><strong>My thesis</strong></h3>
<p>My Phd resarches are on: ""<strong>Prophecy in the Community and by the Community, in the New Testament and its background</strong>"".</p>
<p>Prophets are a reality in the Early Church which can be traced to the New Testament. Christian prophets have interactions with the Church but also with society: they may be listened to, but also rejected or persecuted, as their master, Jesus-Christ. New Testament not only speaks of prophetic persons, but some texts evoke the whole christian community as having a collective prophetic office.</p>
<p>My researches will deal with the question of the prophetical office <em>of </em>the community and <em>in </em>the community, from New Testament texts<a rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[1]</a>. What does this prophetic office consist in? What are the issues? What are the roots of thie idea in the Old Testament<a rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[2]</a> or in the intertestamental judaism<a rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[3]</a>? </p>
<p><strong>Academic interest :</strong></p>
<p>In the French speaing academic biblical studies field, there has not been any major study on New Testament prophecy since 40 years. Studies in Eglish generally focus on individual prophets, and I do not know any major study on the community dimension of prophecy. I hope my researches can contribute to this lack.</p>
<p>I also hope to contribute to the methodological debate on the way to deal with Bible, as one inspired book. Bible is a book composed of diverses writings from varied times and contexts. In the same time, it is, for christian believers, much more than an anthology.Christians read it as an unique rule for their faith, as God's Word. So, how honnestly answer to the question : ""What the Bible does say on this or that?"" By chosing to study one theme inside the biblical corpus, I hope to contribute on the methodological debate on biblical intertextuality (or intratextuality?).</p>

Financez des recherches au service de l'Eglise.
Pasteur de l'Eglise Protestante Baptiste de Saint-Etienne, je me suis lancé en parallèle, dans un doctorat en théologie à l'Université de Strasbourg, depuis un an maintenant.
Je ne me forme pas uniquement par intérêt académique, mais afin d'acquérir les meilleures compétences possibles pour l'enseignement théologique au service des églises évangéliques. Je suis interpellé par les besoins en formation théologique solide, et en particulier dans les pays francophones du sud.   
Mon projet
Mon salaire de pasteur permet de pourvoir aux besoins de ma famille, mais il ne permet pas de couvrir les frais liés à mes études. Je n'ai pas pu trouver de financement pour l'année universitaire 2013-2014, et la date limite d'inscription approche. Je fais donc appel à votre générosité !
Mes frais pour l'année 2013-2014 :

Paiement des droits de scolarité : environ 400 €
6 déplacements sur Strasbourg dans l'année (en train) : 6x100 = 600 €
Achat d'un ordinateur portable (mon fidèle netbook a vécu) : 500 €

Total des frais indispensables : 1500 € + comission d'Indiegogo (env. 120 €) = 1620 €
Si le montant récolté dépasse les 1620 €, j'utiliserais l'argent pour acheter des ouvrages théologiques ou des logiciels bibliques : ce qui me facilitera grandement mes recherches et me sera utile pour la suite !
Comment participer ?

En donnant !
En partageant le projet autour de vous : faites suivre le lien à vos amis qui pourraient être intéressés, partagez sur Facebook, parlez-en, etc.

Mon parcours 
Une formation théologique oecuménique :

2002-2007 : License et 1ère année de Master en théologie à la Faculté Libre de Théologie Evangélique de Vaux-sur-Seine.
2009-2012 : Master de recherche en théologie à la Faculté de Théologie de l'Université Catholique de Lyon. 
Septembre 2012 : Début de mes études doctorales, à la Faculté de Théologie Protestante de l'Université de Strasbourg.


Un engagement ecclésial :
Pasteur de l’Eglise Protestante Baptiste de Saint-Etienne (FEEBF). Je suis également le président de la pastorale CNEF de l'agglomération stéphanoise.
Je suis membre du Département Formation de ma famille d'églises (Fédération des Eglises Evangéliques Baptistes de France).
Pourquoi un doctorat en théologie ?
J'ai le désir de me former au plus haut niveau théologique, afin de participer à l'enseignement théologique au service des églises évangéliques.
Je suis particulièrement convaincu de la nécessité d'une formation théologique évangélique de haut niveau au sein des pays les plus pauvres de la francophonie. Le protestantisme évangélique est  souvent bien développé dans ces pays. Pourtant, peu nombreux sont ceux qui bénéficient d'une formation théologique évangélique de niveau universitaire. 
Depuis 2011, j'ai développé un partenariat avec l'Institut Supérieur de Théologie Evangélique (ISTE), à Madagascar. J'ai pu m'y rendre à deux reprises pour y donner des cours groupés. L'ISTE souhaiterait que je puisse venir enseigner de façon permanente à Madagascar. Avec un doctorat en poche, je pourrais notamment suivre des doctorants, et éviter ainsi aux étudiants malgaches de devoir aller à l'étranger pour réaliser leur doctorat.
 
Mon sujet de thèse
Mes recherches doctorales ont pour titre : ""La dimension communautaire de la prophétie dans le Nouveau Testament, et ses antécédents éventuels"".
Le Nouveau Testament évoque l’existence de prophètes au sein du christianisme naissant. Ces prophètes chrétiens interagissent avec l’Église naissante, mais aussi avec la société de leur temps : ils sont parfois écoutés, mais aussi dénoncés, rejetés ou persécutés, à l’image de leur maître, Jésus-Christ. Au-delà de ces figures prophétiques individuelles, plusieurs textes présentent la communauté chrétienne comme ayant une fonction prophétique collective au sein de son environnement.
Mes recherches ont pour but de mettre en évidence la fonction prophétique de la communauté et dans la communauté, à partir des données du Nouveau Testament[1]. En quoi consiste exactement cette fonction prophétique ? Quels en sont les enjeux ? Quelles en sont les racines éventuelles, dans l’Ancien Testament[2] ou dans le judaïsme intertestamentaire[3] ?
Intérêt académique :
Dans le domaine des sciences bibliques, le prophétisme néotestamentaire n’a été que peu étudié. Aucune étude majeure francophone sur le sujet n’a été produite depuis près de quarante ans. De plus, les études existantes – en français, anglais ou allemand – s’intéressent généralement aux prophètes en tant qu’individus. Au cours de mes recherches de Master sur la question du prophétisme néotestamentair, je n’ai pas rencontré de travaux académiques majeurs sur la dimension communautaire du prophétisme néotestamentaire. J’espère que mes recherches pourront contribuer à réparer cet oubli.
D’un point de vue méthodologique, il existe actuellement un débat parmi les exégètes bibliques sur la manière de mettre en rapport les divers écrits bibliques. La Bible chrétienne est un corpus d’écrits rédigés par divers auteurs, dans divers contextes. En même temps, pour le croyant chrétien, la Bible est bien plus qu’une banale anthologie. Il la lit comme un unique canon pour sa foi, comme LA parole de Dieu. Comment donc répondre de manière honnête à la question : « que dit la Bible sur tel sujet » ? En choisissant d’étudier un thème au sein du corpus biblique, j’espère ainsi contribuer au débat méthodologique concernant l’intertextualité – ou l’intratextualité ? – biblique.




[1] Je pense notamment aux textes suivants : Matthieu 7.15-23 ; 10.40-42 ; 23-24 ; Actes 1-4 à mettre en parallèle avec Luc 1-4 ;      1 Corinthiens 11-14 ; Ephésiens 2.20-3.6 ; 4.11-16 ; 1 Jean 4.1-6 ; Apocalypse 2-3 ; 11 ; 19-20.



[2] Je pense par exemple à Nombres 11-12 ; Joël 3.1-2 ; au rôle de la communauté prophétique chez Esaïe ou aux interactions entre Jérémie et ses compatriotes.



[3] Je pense par exemple à la manière dont la communauté de Qumrân s’ « auto-comprend ».

Serving the Church by funding Theological researches
I am a Baptist minister in Saint-Etienne Baptist Church, near Lyon in France. Beside my pastoral ministry, I have started a PhD in Theology, in Strasbourg University, since a year now.
I do not study theology for academic interest but because I want to take part in Theological training for Evangelical churches. I have a burden for helping churches to develop theological training at a higher level, especially in poorest French speaking countries as Madagascar.
 
My project
My pastoral wages cover everyday needs for my family, but they can not cover my PhD costs. I have not find any funding for the 2013-2014 academic year, and I need to pay quickly university fees. So, I am looking for you to help me in funding my studies.
Costs for 2013-2014 academic year :


Scholarship fees : about 400 €
Travelling from Saint-Etienne to Strasbourg (350 miles), 6 times a year (by train) : 6x100 = 600 €
Buying a Netbook (my old one is out of order) : 500 €

Total costs : 1500 € + commissions (about 120 €) = 1620 €
If I receive more than 1620 €, I will use the money to buy theological books or softwares.

<h2>Waking Up Catholic: The Book</h2>
<h3>From Assisi Media</h3>
<p>Evangelization is a common topic in the Catholic Church, but what's the next step?  What are we doing once we have convinced someone to learn more about the Catholic faith?</p>
<p>Enter: <strong><em>Waking Up Catholic</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Just over two years ago, I started a website called WakingUpCatholic.com which covered the basic topics of the Catholic faith.  Now, it's time to take that to the next level with 'Waking Up Catholic' - the book.</p>
<h3>My Journey</h3>
<p>When I first decided to go through RCIA, the formal process for entering the Catholic Church, I had a lot of questions.  When I searched online for answers, I did not know how well I could trust the sources.  When I read Catholic books, many of them read like college-level textbooks.  Where can someone new to Catholicism find resources they can trust in language they can understand?</p>
<p>I made it my goal to provide the resources other Catholic converts would need in their first steps toward the Catholic faith.  It began with WakingUpCatholic.com, and now, I am looking to publish a book on the same subject.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">More About the Book</span></h3>
<p>When teaching kids about math, we do not start with Algebra, Trigonometry, or Calculus; we begin with basic Arithmetic.  We teach our children how to count and that 1 + 1 = 2.  We build a solid foundation for their knowledge of mathematics.</p>
<p>'Waking Up Catholic' strives to do the same thing for Catholicism.  Before we can cover the more advanced topics of faith, we need to begin with the basics.</p>
<p>Each chapter begins with my own background, but instead of simply giving my conversion story, it will highlight specific questions and issues I had with Catholicism - allowing me to connect with the reader.</p>
<p>Next, the chapter continues by sharing what I learned about Catholicism that helped me to overcome my objections.  The goal is to provide these concepts in a way that readers of all levels can understand.</p>
<p>Finally, it is important to take this information and apply it in the real world, and each chapter closes with ways the reader can apply what they've learned in their daily life.</p>
<h3>The Audience</h3>
<p>Who should read 'Waking Up Catholic'?  Who was it written for?</p>
<p>First, it was written for those who have questions about basic Catholic teaching.  Whether they are new to Catholicism, or someone looking to come home again, they can benefit from this book.</p>
<p>For established Catholics, 'Waking Up Catholic' can be a great evangelistic tool.  You will learn how to answer common objections to the Catholic faith - down to their root cause, and you can share this book with anyone you know who may be having questions.</p>
<h3>My Qualifications</h3>
<p>For the past couple of years, I have worked in and near the Catholic publishing industry.  Using that knowledge, I feel that we can successfully launch a new publishing company aimed at providing resources for adults.</p>
<p>My writing ventures include my own site, Waking Up Catholic, as well as regular posts on the New Evangelizers and Catholic Mom's Tech Talk blogs.  Also, I have written articles for other sites, including Catholic Lane.</p>
<p>On the social media front, I have gained a large number of fans on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+, and I was even nominated for Best Catholic Facebook Page by About.com.</p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Publishing a book, unfortunately, is not cheap.  My wife and I are starting our own publishing company, Assisi Media, and our first book will be 'Waking Up Catholic.'  We have already spent a great deal of money on this venture, but we need your help.</p>
<p>The goal is to raise funds for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Editing</li>
<li>Publishing</li>
<li>Distribution</li>
</ul><p>With funds to cover these costs, we feel that we can produce a quality book that will spread the Catholic faith to mainstream society.</p>

Thanks to your support, we were able to successfully raise the money needed to launch Assisi Media.  For more information, go to the Assisi Media website, or follow the link to find out more about the Waking Up Catholic eBook and paperback.

 
Waking Up Catholic: The Book
From Assisi Media
Evangelization is a common topic in the Catholic Church, but what's the next step?  What are we doing once we have convinced someone to learn more about the Catholic faith?
Enter: Waking Up Catholic.
Just over two years ago, I started a website called WakingUpCatholic.com which covered the basic topics of the Catholic faith.  Now, it's time to take that to the next level with 'Waking Up Catholic' - the book.
My Journey
When I first decided to go through RCIA, the formal process for entering the Catholic Church, I had a lot of questions.  When I searched online for answers, I did not know how well I could trust the sources.  When I read Catholic books, many of them read like college-level textbooks.  Where can someone new to Catholicism find resources they can trust in language they can understand?
I made it my goal to provide the resources other Catholic converts would need in their first steps toward the Catholic faith.  It began with WakingUpCatholic.com, and now, I am looking to publish a book on the same subject.
More About the Book
When teaching kids about math, we do not start with Algebra, Trigonometry, or Calculus; we begin with basic Arithmetic.  We teach our children how to count and that 1 + 1 = 2.  We build a solid foundation for their knowledge of mathematics.
'Waking Up Catholic' strives to do the same thing for Catholicism.  Before we can cover the more advanced topics of faith, we need to begin with the basics.
Each chapter begins with my own background, but instead of simply giving my conversion story, it will highlight specific questions and issues I had with Catholicism - allowing me to connect with the reader.
Next, the chapter continues by sharing what I learned about Catholicism that helped me to overcome my objections.  The goal is to provide these concepts in a way that readers of all levels can understand.
Finally, it is important to take this information and apply it in the real world, and each chapter closes with ways the reader can apply what they've learned in their daily life.
The Audience
Who should read 'Waking Up Catholic'?  Who was it written for?
First, it was written for those who have questions about basic Catholic teaching.  Whether they are new to Catholicism, or someone looking to come home again, they can benefit from this book.
For established Catholics, 'Waking Up Catholic' can be a great evangelistic tool.  You will learn how to answer common objections to the Catholic faith - down to their root cause, and you can share this book with anyone you know who may be having questions.
My Qualifications
For the past couple of years, I have worked in and near the Catholic publishing industry.  Using that knowledge, I feel that we can successfully launch a new publishing company aimed at providing resources for adults.
My writing ventures include my own site, Waking Up Catholic, as well as regular posts on the New Evangelizers and Catholic Mom's Tech Talk blogs.  Also, I have written articles for other sites, including Catholic Lane.
On the social media front, I have gained a large number of fans on Facebook, Twitter, and Google+, and I was even nominated for Best Catholic Facebook Page by About.com.
Our Goal
Publishing a book, unfortunately, is not cheap.  My wife and I are starting our own publishing company, Assisi Media, and our first book will be 'Waking Up Catholic.'  We have already spent a great deal of money on this venture, but we need your help.
The goal is to raise funds for the following:

Editing
Publishing
Distribution
With funds to cover these costs, we feel that we can produce a quality book that will spread the Catholic faith to mainstream society.

What We Need & What You Get
Unfortunately, we cannot offer any tax incentives; however, we can offer:

Autographed copies of the book

YOUR NAME mentioned in the acknowledgements
Advertising on WakingUpCatholic.com
The chance to host the book launch

<div>'The name HeadSpace was motivated by the idea that in culture and society, we are not given the time or capacity to express, create and think, that time is money and that you need to buy some 'headspace' you need to be able to afford reflection and reflection and time are essentials to maintaining positive mental health.' <br/>
</div>
<div>HeadSpace is a contributor based magazine focused on the theme of mental health, It is hoped that HeadSpace is broadening the discussion for mental health issues in Ireland and abroad by publishing works of poetry, art, personal experience stories, creative writing and photography on matters of mental health. It is then being distributed to psychiatric hospitals, mental health support centres and colleges throughout Ireland.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It was founded in February 2013 by a group of young individuals who had spent time coping and struggling with mental health difficulties. Some of the founding members had spent time in psychiatric hospitals where they found it evident that there was a significant lack of reading material to which they could relate. HeadSpace was formed and <span style=""background-color: initial;""> the creative magazine currently provides an outlet in times of illness and recovery, helping to promote positive mental health while not ignoring times of extreme pain and difficulty.  The magazine has successfully published three issues, with circulation of 1200 copies to psychiatric hospitals and mental health support centres throughout Ireland and the UK. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Feedback on HeadSpace:</span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><i>‘HeadSpace does exactly what it says on
the tin - as well as being an outrageously welcoming avenue where aspiring
artists can come and ply their trait in an often heartbreaking, always
necessary manner, first and foremost it offers supreme solace to people
suffering with mental health issues, eagerly handing they and their network of
support the absolute right tools for combat.’ </i></p></span></div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div>
<div>To keep HeadSpace alive and keep it funded for a further issue we are asking for €1000.  It costs €899 excluding VAT to publish 400 copies of the magazine at 36 pages per copy. Should there be a remainder after VAT it will go towards the launch of issue four.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<ul></ul>
<div>If we don't reach our goal, then we will continue fundraising for issue four regardless and all funds will go towards the fourth issue.</div>
</div>
<div>Your contribution can keep this magazine alive and continue the invaluable work we are doing! HeadSpace has circulated over 1200 copies throughout Ireland and the UK so far with submissions coming in from all over the world. It has genuinely helped people express themselves in a creative manner in an avenue that was founded just last year. It has received media attention from the Irish Times, Newstalk FM, Near FM, Dublin City FM, Spirit Radio and West Dublin Access Radio as well as regional newspapers, The Laois Nationalist and The Carlow Nationalist. But remember we are a non profit organisation who are asking for your help to keep this venture going!</div>

</div></div>","Summary
'The name HeadSpace was motivated by the idea that in culture and society, we are not given the time or capacity to express, create and think, that time is money and that you need to buy some 'headspace' you need to be able to afford reflection and reflection and time are essentials to maintaining positive mental health.' 

HeadSpace is a contributor based magazine focused on the theme of mental health, It is hoped that HeadSpace is broadening the discussion for mental health issues in Ireland and abroad by publishing works of poetry, art, personal experience stories, creative writing and photography on matters of mental health. It is then being distributed to psychiatric hospitals, mental health support centres and colleges throughout Ireland.

It was founded in February 2013 by a group of young individuals who had spent time coping and struggling with mental health difficulties. Some of the founding members had spent time in psychiatric hospitals where they found it evident that there was a significant lack of reading material to which they could relate. HeadSpace was formed and  the creative magazine currently provides an outlet in times of illness and recovery, helping to promote positive mental health while not ignoring times of extreme pain and difficulty.  The magazine has successfully published three issues, with circulation of 1200 copies to psychiatric hospitals and mental health support centres throughout Ireland and the UK. 


Feedback on HeadSpace:

‘HeadSpace does exactly what it says on
the tin - as well as being an outrageously welcoming avenue where aspiring
artists can come and ply their trait in an often heartbreaking, always
necessary manner, first and foremost it offers supreme solace to people
suffering with mental health issues, eagerly handing they and their network of
support the absolute right tools for combat.’ 


To keep HeadSpace alive and keep it funded for a further issue we are asking for €1000.  It costs €899 excluding VAT to publish 400 copies of the magazine at 36 pages per copy. Should there be a remainder after VAT it will go towards the launch of issue four.



If we don't reach our goal, then we will continue fundraising for issue four regardless and all funds will go towards the fourth issue.

Your contribution can keep this magazine alive and continue the invaluable work we are doing! HeadSpace has circulated over 1200 copies throughout Ireland and the UK so far with submissions coming in from all over the world. It has genuinely helped people express themselves in a creative manner in an avenue that was founded just last year. It has received media attention from the Irish Times, Newstalk FM, Near FM, Dublin City FM, Spirit Radio and West Dublin Access Radio as well as regional newspapers, The Laois Nationalist and The Carlow Nationalist. But remember we are a non profit organisation who are asking for your help to keep this venture going!

Excerpt from HeadSpace (1st Issue):


The Glassy
Diver
Unbelievable… just unbelievable
Don’t know how she does it
One day she’s terribly down
The next she does this!!
Looking at ‘The Glassy Diver’
You’d be hard-pressed to believe this is a
Girl suffering from depression
I remember it
Remember the
time she cried on the bus
All the way back
to hospital
I told her that
everything was alright
That she would
be alright
And I was right
In the artistic
sense anyway
It’s the most
perfect piece of art
I may ever see
I go to watch
her do it too
Inside the craft
room
In a far corner
of the hospital
She
concentrated… concentrated
‘Til the glass
splinters fused
Teacher blown
away
‘’How are you
able to create that when
You’re supposed
to be depressed?’’
Good question,
thought I
But we let her
get on with it
I made a vase
for my sister
But as good as
it may have been
Paled in
significance to ‘’The Glassy Diver’’
It does seem
there are crazy creative streaks running the core
Inside hospital
doors
I just don’t get
it
Don’t get what
part of her asked to be troubled
Here’s hoping
she gets the balance just right
Then maybe
there’ll be a pool full of glassy divers

She the lifeguard

<h3>Invest in research, <span><br/></span>Invest in the lives of Canadian women and girls  </h3>
<p>We want issues of gender justice to be a
campaign issue for the 2015 federal election. 
With your support, the Gender Justice For All! / Pour la justice de genre! research initiative will help make this happen.  </p>
<p>‘We’ are CRIAW-ICREF, the Canadian Research
Institute for the Advancement of Women, a research institute focusing
exclusively on creating feminist research and making it accessible for public
advocacy and education. Our mission is to provide tools that help advocacy organizations
take action on advancing social justice and equality for all women. “Gender justice” means creating laws and policies that support equity for all genders across social positions, including race, class, sexuality, ability and citizenship status.  </p>
<p>In Canada, women continue to comprise the
majority of people living in poverty. 
The gender gap in employment, wages, and workplace promotion continues,
despite our increasing levels of training and education.  Rape culture persists on campuses across the
country.  And violence against women,
including intimate partner violence, sexual assault, and femicide, impact women
from across the social spectrum, with a devastating toll being taken on
Aboriginal women and girls. </p>
Our <b>goal</b> is to produce a publicly available research report that documents Canadians' perspectives, particularly those of women and our feminist allies, on these issues and the progressive policy changes needed to redress the inequities faced by women and girls across the nation. </div><div><br/></div><div>To gather this information, we will be holding focus groups with Canadian women's organizations and allied community associations, including feminist, LGBTQ, indigenous, and anti-racism groups. The focus groups will be facilitated by student moderators trained by faculty from Women's and Gender Studies and other social sciences programs across Canada.  </div><div><br/></div><div>Our <b>objectives</b> include: </div><div><ul>
<li>listening to a diverse range of women and allied groups in each province/territory, including rural and reserve communities;<br/>
</li>
<li>learning what they identify as the key issues currently inhibiting women's and girls' security and success in Canadian society;<br/>
</li>
<li>identifying themes common to these diverse testimonies, as well as the ideas and experiences that are specific to certain affinity groups; <br/>
</li>
<li>building advocacy networks between affinity groups (a solidarity index);<br/>
</li>
<li>writing and distributing a report based on these conversations to advocacy groups and policy-makers.<br/>

My name is Stephanie Shar and I run a blog called The Loudmouth Lifestyle.  But it isn’t just a blog, and I’m not the only 
Loudmouth.   And this isn’t just a campaign, it’s a movement.When I released my first e-book, 7 Steps to Living Loudly: Discover Who You Are, Decide What You Need and Create the Life You Want, it was only a preview of what's to come.  We live in an exciting time where anything is possible, and it's time to take advantage of it.  Women have more power than ever, and I'm ready to use that power for good.  Aren't you?My goal is to provide others with the inspiration and motivation to live and love themselves and their lives to the fullest.  I want to continue helping people, but I need your help in doing so.Your contribution will assist in funding more e-books, e-courses and resources to bring women closer to their dreams; an opportunity to hire a team, which will allow for more unique, killer content; and a kick-ass clothing line so you can show the world how loud you are.  But want to know EXACTLY where your cash is going?  Read on for a breakdown.
What We Need & What You GetIf we reach our goal of $3000, here's where the money will go:
50% towards the hiring of a blog photographer, videographer, office assistant and staff writer

25% towards a Dress Loudly clothing line, starting with hoodies and t-shirts for both women and children

10% towards a second e-book, an interactive e-course, and one-on-one consultations

10% towards website design and maintenance costs

5% towards RAINN, the nation's largest anti-sexual assault organization
On this small budget, we hope to accomplish all of these things by September of next year.  Here's what's in it for you, depending on how much you donate:
A shout-out in my follow-up post about this campaign, linking to your blog or website

A personalized hand-written card in the mail from me
A copy of my first and/or upcoming e-book
A secondhand item from my shop
A t-shirt or hoodie from the new line
A one-on-one consultation focusing on your blog and brand
Free access to the new, interactive e-course
If our goal is not met, we will not be able to accomplish all of the above.  You will still receive the perks that are available.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you're unable to donate, you can still support the Loudmouth movement in other ways!  Here are a few ideas:
Post about this campaign on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest or Instagram.

Visit my blogroll and say hi to other gals who are following their dreams.  Stay active in the blogging community and continue to be an encouraging voice to those around you.
Share your own inspiring story on my blog by shooting a guest post to my email.

<p><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: small;"">I think everyone has heard the statement ""the elephant in the room,"" but what I don't think you know is there is a probably an elephant in your room.

Living in Nashville, every coffee shop you go to you can get your coffee served from someone waiting for their big break. Sadly though, most people have this big dream that they have adopted like a pet elephant and rather than unleash their elephant, they allow it sit around and not do anything. I have seen elephants go to the bathroom. Trust me, you don't want an elephant as a pet! </span></p>

<p><b>Who is Gail Saunders?</b> As a person that was leveled by the death of their loved one I am not unique. But when my husband Frank died at 51, I was determined to not let grief become my new identity. I held to the lifeline Frank gave me when he make me promise to use his death to help others. That vow inspired me to do the deep and painful work of recalibrating myself and my life. I had to reweave the torn tapestry of what was, into a new fabric of being. I tried everything I could find to transform my profound pain into meaningful purpose. Marilyn Grosboll, my grief coach said,</p>
<p> ""Gail is a trailblazer in the transformation of grief. I've worked with grievers for more than twenty-five years and no one has mourned more creatively, soulfully, and completely. I encouraged her to write a book to inspire others."" </p>
<p>Marilyn even took out her purse and paid for the first copy long before the writing began. I made my second promise to her that I would write this book to help others with death and mourning. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>I have written </b><i><b>RESILIENT HEART: Transcending the Death of
Your Loved One</b> </i>and now I need your help to get it into the hands and hearts
of those dealing with the devastating loss of their loved one. You can
contribute to this important and needed mission. <i>Your gift will touch so many
lives and give hope and guidance. </i>You can donate in honor of a loved one you
have lost. This book and online grief course that will be part of this project
will empower people to engage in life again and do it wholeheartedly. I have combined not only my own experiences
with Frank’s, my parents, and close friend’s deaths but also many other
grievers’ stories. I have been a hospice volunteer for more than six years
helping patients and their families cope with dying and grief. <i>RESILIENT HEART </i>shares creative and
enlightened ways to mourn and reconnect with the part of us that is
unbreakable, invincible, and resilient. That unshatterable part of you is your
resilient heart. It is your heart that knows the way to get up and keep going
when your mind hasn’t a clue. In <i>RESILIENT
HEART</i> I give you support, comfort and hope when you are tossed into the
wilderness of grief. It is a rare individual that is left unscathed by loss of
a beloved. Unfortunately most don’t understand grief. I saw a study where people
were asked how long it takes to grief the death of a close loved one. I was
shocked to read that the average answer was two weeks! I and most are still in
shock longer than that. This book is needed. The proposal of Resilient Heart
won an award in a writing competition. I have also coauthored two other books
that are on Amazon. My heart and soul are in this book. <i>I promise you that you
will be proud to be a part of this mission and you will be making a real
difference in many lives.</i></p>

Who is Gail? I am a person that
KNOWS I am fulfilling my purpose in life. The two most important things I have
done in my life are helping Frank die with as much dignity and grace as possible
and this mission: writing this book and creating the online course to mentor
individuals as they take the Resilient Heart Journey of grief. I want to share
a poem with you which I wrote a few months after Frank died. 

<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Phoenix Rising</i></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><i>Death
is a midwife for my new life.</i></p>
<p><i>I’ve
been stretched to extreme by her.</i></p>
<p><i>My
heart exploded, shattered,</i></p>
<p><i>Leaving
a deep gaping wound</i></p>
<p><i>In
the center of my being.</i></p>
<p><i>Suffering
is the catalyst</i></p>
<p><i>To
the challenge;</i></p>
<p><i>The
challenge to birth my expanded self</i></p>
<p><i>Through
the openness</i></p>
<p><i>This
sacred space.</i></p>
<p><i>Meanwhile,
I’ll dance in the</i></p>
<p><i>Darkness
of my sadness,</i></p>
<p><i>Swim
in the ocean of my tears,</i></p>
<p><i>Give
voice to my screaming feelings,</i></p>
<p><i>And
purify through fire.</i></p>
<p><i>For
the birth of my new existence,</i></p>
<p><i>I
surrender and await the Phoenix’s rising.</i></p>
<p></p>
<p>I eventually did rise like the Phoenix and I can inspire and
mentor you and others to do the same. It is possible to live a fulfilling and
joyful life after the death of someone you love. Please help me touch lives in a profound way.
Thank you from my whole heart!</p>

But when my husband Frank died at 51, I was determined to not let grief become my new identity. I held to the lifeline Frank gave me when he make me promise to use his death to help others. That vow inspired me to do the deep and painful work of recalibrating myself and my life. I had to reweave the torn tapestry of what was, into a new fabric of being. I tried everything I could find to transform my profound pain into meaningful purpose. Marilyn Grosboll, my grief coach said,
 ""Gail is a trailblazer in the transformation of grief. I've worked with grievers for more than twenty-five years and no one has mourned more creatively, soulfully, and completely. I encouraged her to write a book to inspire others."" 
Marilyn even took out her purse and paid for the first copy long before the writing began. I made my second promise to her that I would write this book to help others with death and mourning. 


I have written RESILIENT HEART: Transcending the Death of
Your Loved One and now I need your help to get it into the hands and hearts
of those dealing with the devastating loss of their loved one. You can
contribute to this important and needed mission. Your gift will touch so many
lives and give hope and guidance. You can donate in honor of a loved one you
have lost. This book and online grief course that will be part of this project
will empower people to engage in life again and do it wholeheartedly. I have combined not only my own experiences
with Frank’s, my parents, and close friend’s deaths but also many other
grievers’ stories. I have been a hospice volunteer for more than six years
helping patients and their families cope with dying and grief. RESILIENT HEART shares creative and
enlightened ways to mourn and reconnect with the part of us that is
unbreakable, invincible, and resilient. That unshatterable part of you is your
resilient heart. It is your heart that knows the way to get up and keep going
when your mind hasn’t a clue. In RESILIENT
HEART I give you support, comfort and hope when you are tossed into the
wilderness of grief. It is a rare individual that is left unscathed by loss of
a beloved. Unfortunately most don’t understand grief. I saw a study where people
were asked how long it takes to grief the death of a close loved one. I was
shocked to read that the average answer was two weeks! I and most are still in
shock longer than that. This book is needed. The proposal of Resilient Heart
won an award in a writing competition. I have also coauthored two other books
that are on Amazon. My heart and soul are in this book. I promise you that you
will be proud to be a part of this mission and you will be making a real
difference in many lives.

Who is Gail? I am a person that
KNOWS I am fulfilling my purpose in life. The two most important things I have
done in my life are helping Frank die with as much dignity and grace as possible
and this mission: writing this book and creating the online course to mentor
individuals as they take the Resilient Heart Journey of grief. I want to share
a poem with you which I wrote a few months after Frank died. 


Phoenix Rising

Death
is a midwife for my new life.
I’ve
been stretched to extreme by her.
My
heart exploded, shattered,
Leaving
a deep gaping wound
In
the center of my being.
Suffering
is the catalyst
To
the challenge;
The
challenge to birth my expanded self
Through
the openness
This
sacred space.
Meanwhile,
I’ll dance in the
Darkness
of my sadness,
Swim
in the ocean of my tears,
Give
voice to my screaming feelings,
And
purify through fire.
For
the birth of my new existence,
I
surrender and await the Phoenix’s rising.

I eventually did rise like the Phoenix and I can inspire and
mentor you and others to do the same. It is possible to live a fulfilling and
joyful life after the death of someone you love. Please help me touch lives in a profound way.
Thank you from my whole heart!
Here is my favorite photo of Frank and I.





Frank had a huge heart, too large to be contained in his six
foot six frame. Here’s Frank with Scruffy who we rescued from the dump.
