<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It began when I realized I had been duped by the Russian Intelligence Agency.</p>
<p>I’d been following an account called ""Blacktivist"" on Facebook throughout the 2016 election year. Its posts were of the “feel-good” variety, things of cultural interest to African-Americans: elementary school kids reciting heroes of black history; or an actor describing the problem of colorism and casting in Hollywood. Turns out, I was following a fake account created by Russians intended to suppress the vote of African Americans by undermining our trust in American institutions. If I, a journalist with 30 years' experience, could be fooled by a fake account, how many others were? And how could we, the people, begin a conversation to counter the effect of social media weaponized as a tool of voter suppression?  </p>
<p>""<a href=""https://brown.columbia.edu/casting-the-vote/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Casting the Vote: A Call to a Count</a>"" is a collaboration between director <a href=""https://charlottebrathwaite.com/CASTING-THE-VOTE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charlotte Brathwaite</a>, a 2019 Creative Capital Awardee; dramaturg Sunder Ganglani, writer <a href=""https://jananibalasubramanian.com/bio"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Janani Balasubramanian</a> and musician <a href=""https://justinhicksmusic.persona.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Justin Hicks</a>.  We are working on a new way to bring journalism to an audience and to engage them in the issues facing our democracy.  We've gathered a formidable group of theatre artists, young performers, chefs, and community organizers to bring my journalistic research on voter suppression to diverse audiences in new ways, and get them seriously engaged in the urgent issues haunting the very core of our democracy. This FREE evening, 7p October 16 at La Mama Experimental Theater is a dinner, a party, a call to action, a gathering, a survival guide for troubling times. There's documentary, live music, performance, food; and most of all, there's deep and pluralistic conversation. Together, we'll examine historical and contemporary voter suppression and chew on the upcoming 2020 census--all in an effort to understand 'who counts' in America, and how we might come to count on one another in the struggle for democracy, justice, and a more perfect union.</p>

<p>We are excited to work with our two lead actors, <b>Ellen Rice </b><i>(left)</i> and <b>Candace Myers</b><i> (right) </i>- who are deaf, and to announce their work on stage during September 2015, National Deaf Awareness Month.  We were not aware at the inception of this project that it is rare to have deaf actors play deaf roles. The Artizen Company never thought to have hearing actors perform in these roles until we began our search and discovered that deaf actors were difficult to find. However, we are overjoyed to have found Mrs. Rice and Mrs. Myers. They have been instrumental in helping The Artizen Company gain a better understanding of Deaf culture. </p>Like in the novel, their characters, Antonapoula and Joan Singer, eat, drink, sleep, and receive visitors. They do not speak; Singer knows sign language, while Ant does not. They and their visitors must find a way to effectively communicate while all around they’ll be presented with an endless stream of media showing failing communication. Will our true human condition be evident with these two offerings juxtaposed? Can we gain some deeper insight, or grow from the experience? These are just a few of the conversations our production of Silent Encounters will spark.<p></p>

</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Optics</h3> <p>The goal of this production is to change the world, one visitor at a time, by exploring how we connect and communicate. The dichotomy of our complex language is at the heart of this experiment: We have a plethora of words, yet these very words allow for deceit and confusion. We challenge our performers and our audience to find a deeper, truer way to communicate feelings, desires, and ideas by allowing only nonverbal communication.  The Artizen Company strives to make a positive impact on our community with every project, and Silent Encounters is no different. We are using our immersive and interactive style to help break down barriers and effect change. </p>
<p>With have had great success with our previous immersive productions. Audience were effected in way we couldn't even imagine. When a person is asked to act and are given an opprotunity to step-up to save a life, assist in the a birth, determine the fate of another, or simple dance lives change and life long connections are made. This is what The Artizen Company's immersive theater accomplishes.</p>

</div><div> <p>The major risk we face with this production is people just not connecting with our efforts. The whole purpose of this project is to connect human beings to other human beigns without words. If this is not an expereience people will always carry with them we missed the mark.</p>
<p>However, we have a fluid and improvization methond of preparaion. During our workshops we develop skills to engage the audience and to adjust and refine as the evening progresses.  You could even say Silent Encounters is a living breathing show.</p>

Will our true human condition be evident with these two offerings juxtaposed? Can we gain some deeper insight, or grow from the experience? These are just a few of the conversations our production of Silent Encounters will spark.


THE TARGET

 



Help The Artizen Company fully realize this production of Silent Encounters. The production is set to open October 1, 2015 and run through October 4, 2015 as a part of the Curious Encounters festival at 7 Stages theater in Atlanta, GA. The cast and crew are assembled and the times are set.
We need funds for production costs and to compensate all artists involved. We have a budget of $7000, and are asking all theater lovers and newcomers, the Deaf and Hard of Hearing Community and supports to sponsor us with a donation. Please contribute to this potentially life-changing experience for audiences and the production crew alike. Eyedrum Art and Music Gallery of Atlanta, GA is our non-profit arts organization fiscal sponsor for tax-exempt donations. Thank you for your much needed and valued support. 


Here is a breakdown of our remaining expenses:

Design Elements: Costumes, Sound, Sets & Props: Need - $2,100 (30%)

Artists & Staff Compensation: Need - $3,850 (55%)


Supplies, gifts, nd fees: Need - $1050 (15%)


We appreciate every single donation, from $1 to $7000, and thank you for supporting diversity on the stage! We have some very interesting perks for supporting this special project and letting your voice be heard. Take a look!



  


  





Oh, listen no worries! Even if we don't meet our full $7000 goal. The show will go on and each and every dime will be spent on the production and the artists involved.
   The Optics The goal of this production is to change the world, one visitor at a time, by exploring how we connect and communicate. The dichotomy of our complex language is at the heart of this experiment: We have a plethora of words, yet these very words allow for deceit and confusion. We challenge our performers and our audience to find a deeper, truer way to communicate feelings, desires, and ideas by allowing only nonverbal communication.  The Artizen Company strives to make a positive impact on our community with every project, and Silent Encounters is no different. We are using our immersive and interactive style to help break down barriers and effect change. 
With have had great success with our previous immersive productions. Audience were effected in way we couldn't even imagine. When a person is asked to act and are given an opprotunity to step-up to save a life, assist in the a birth, determine the fate of another, or simple dance lives change and life long connections are made. This is what The Artizen Company's immersive theater accomplishes.
Risks & Challenges
 The major risk we face with this production is people just not connecting with our efforts. The whole purpose of this project is to connect human beings to other human beigns without words. If this is not an expereience people will always carry with them we missed the mark.
However, we have a fluid and improvization methond of preparaion. During our workshops we develop skills to engage the audience and to adjust and refine as the evening progresses.  You could even say Silent Encounters is a living breathing show.

<h1>Montclair Shakespeare Series</h1>
<p>The Montclair Shakespeare Series
 is a free Shakespeare concert reading series designed to bring 
professional caliber classical theatre to the Montclair community. Each reading is accompanied by live, original music. The 
program kicked off in May 2015 with a one-night-only staged reading of <b><i>Twelfth Night</i></b>
 accompanied by live acoustic music at the <b>Montclair Women's Club</b>, followed by <i><b>A Midsummer Night's Dream</b> </i>and <i><b>As You Like It</b>, </i>performed outdoors at the <b>Van Vleck House &amp; Gardens</b>. Each reading is held in a historic, site specific venue in Montclair, and is meant to be kept 
""no frills,"" hearkening back to the simplest form of spoken storytelling.  Both local
 artists and established AEA professionals from NYC have volunteered 
their time to perform. This is celebration of Shakespeare's work and the
 cultural community of Montclair, which has always had an appreciation 
for the arts, but currently has little professional theatre available. Readings are free and open to the public, as it is our mission to make live performance of these plays available to everyone!<br/></p>
<p>The
 series follows a somewhat similar format to that of <b>Project Shaw</b>, a popular 
staged reading series based in NYC (<a href=""http://gingoldgroup.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://gingoldgroup.com/</a>) but will 
focus on the work of William Shakespeare.</p>
<p>In a concert-style 
staged reading, plays are read by the actors with the script in hand 
with very limited staging. The emphasis is on the language and on the 
actors' ability to bring the characters to life without costumes, sets, 
or movement. </p>
<p>Our next reading is <i><b>The Tempest</b>, </i>scheduled for September 2015. </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>How You Can Help<br/>
</h3>
<p>Donations/Funding  help us secure a suitable venue for the series for this season and beyond. We are happy to have forged partnerships with the Van Vleck House &amp; Gardens, and other spaces, but affordable space can be hard to come by, and every little bit helps! Offers for use of a venue for performance or rehearsal by businesses or individuals are also greatly appreciated as we search for a permanent home. <br/></p>
<p>Donations
 will also contribute toward the travel stipends required for Actors' 
Equity Association members coming to Montclair from NYC to perform. This
 ensures that we can have the highest caliber professional talent 
involved in this project, which is what sets us apart from local and community productions.  </p>
<p>Our goal is to continue this reading 
series beyond 2015, and potentially register as a non profit organization in the 
future. In doing so, we can expand our programming and outreach. Your 
donations will help us as we launch ourselves and our upcoming programs. </p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Our Goals and Mission<br/>
</h3>We are passionate about bringing these classic plays to life in their simplest form,  stripped down to their basic truth. Storytelling through poetic language alone has become a thing of the past, and we hope to change that. As a culture, we have a lot to learn about how to really <i>listen</i>. <br/><br/>We want to make performances free and available to everyone in the Montclair community. We are looking forward to forging ahead with education programs and other community engagement opportunities, to involve our professional actors with the community and with students. It is our hope that the company can grow and find a permanent home here in Montclair, and can expand beyond the works of Shakespeare. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Launching a theatre project is an extremely difficult task, and many 
companies have struggled to stay afloat in Montclair due to high venue 
rents and expenses. It is our goal to finally find a way bring theatre 
to this community at a low cost, but in the past we have only just barely broke even, as we have not wanted to compromise our integrity by charging admission. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We always need volunteers to help run our box office, coordinate actor transportation, provide marketing/promotional support, and assisting in rehearsals. These gestures go a long way and have made our events possible!</p>

However, playwright-director Dewey Moss has done his job so well, with this tight, taut play, that knowing “the big secret” may not diminish the impact but only heighten it differently. <i>Death of the Persian Prince</i> is an award-winning festival play... It’s very worthy of being offered by a subscription off-Broadway theatre company and being produced in the regionals ASAP.

About Our Journey
Death of the Persian Prince premiered at the NYC Midtown International Theater Festival to sold out audiences in July, 2015. We received phenomenal reviews as well as features in the Advocate Magazine, India.com, Next Magazine, Frock Magazine, ReviewFix.com, and TheatreReviewsltd.com. Immediately after the premiere we were invited to participate in the South Asian International Performing Arts Festival, where we were honored with the festival's Best Play Award. The show was then invited for a limited Off Off-Broadway run at DMAC-Duo Theater in NYC, where it was enthusiastically received by audiences, and it became clear that a longer run Off-Broadway was our next step.LISTEN TO THE PODCAST FROM LOCALTHEATERNY.COM >>What We Need$10,000. We are asking for seed money to help continue our proven track record. We will be able to expand our staff, reserve theater space and other pre-production steps with this amount.Why You Should Contribute “Sexual reassignment surgery is legal in Iran; however, homosexuality is forbidden and in most cases for males, punishable by death,” according to a 2014 report by the BBC. “There is no reliable information on the number of gender reassignment operations carried out in Iran. But one doctor from an Iranian hospital told the BBC that he alone carries out more than 200 such operations every year.”Death of the Persian Prince sheds light on this little-known topic by telling a very human story; this isn't a political issue-oriented play, but rather a powerful and emotional story of the human spirit. Howard Miller of Upstage-Downstage claimed, ""There is a tendency for plays with a strong social justice message to become pedantic and sanctimonious, but, truly, we do not come to the theater to be lectured to.  So double kudos to Mr. Moss for presenting this story through a naturalistic recounting of the story.""We feel this is a moving story, and one that needs to be heard.Other Ways You Can HelpIf cannot contribute to our campaign, you can still help!SPREAD THE WORD!  Part of the success of crowd-funding is simply reaching a large amount of people.  You can share this to people you know by using the Indiegogo share tools.Contact us directly if you'd like to contribute outside of the online campaign.Selected Reviews“I’m loath to say very much at all about Death of the Persian Prince only because the less you know about what it has up its sleeve, the more powerful it is. However, playwright-director Dewey Moss has done his job so well, with this tight, taut play, that knowing “the big secret” may not diminish the impact but only heighten it differently. Death of the Persian Prince is an award-winning festival play... It’s very worthy of being offered by a subscription off-Broadway theatre company and being produced in the regionals ASAP. It’s a solid, provocative, well-rendered sleeper…that really keeps you awake.”—David Spencer, Aisle Say“Death of the Persian Prince is a play of substance and heart that deserves recognition and the opportunity to be more widely seen. There is a tendency for plays with a strong social justice message to become pedantic and sanctimonious, but, truly, we do not come to the theater to be lectured to. So double kudos to Mr. Moss for presenting this story through a naturalistic recounting.”—Howard Miller, Upstage-Downstage“ Death of the Persian Prince will surely change your thinking about the transgender community and the deep prejudice that surrounds the lives of the brave and heroic individuals who choose to celebrate who they have always been. Death of the Persian Prince remains one of the most riveting and life-altering plays in the current canon of LGBTQ theatre.”—David Roberts, Theatre Reviews Ltd“Dewey Moss’ powerful new drama is an important play...We must not forget the harrowing, tragic fate that the Iranian regime imposes on many members of Iran’s LGBT community.

<p>A new theatre company, Madness Most Discreet presents The R+J Project: Romeo and Juliet Re-imagined. </p>
<p>Rehearsed minimally, but studied intensely, MMD uses innovation and audience engagement to bring Shakespeare to the audience who actually knows what Trivia Crack is. Hint: It's not a drug. </p>
<p>MMD revisits Shakespeare's stories and <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">innovates through spontaneity and audience engagement for a younger generation. </span></p>
<p>Madness Most Discreet Theatre was born from four actors experience with Original Practice Shakespearean Performance. MMD’s play on the Original Practice style is a performance where four actors each memorize the whole script of Romeo and Juliet,  and with a small amount of rehearsal leave the show in the audience’s hands, allowing the spectators to decide which actor will play what role. This “trial by fire” attitude in performance requires precision and specificity from its actors, but fosters incredible moments of discovery. ""The R&amp;J Project: Romeo and Juliet Reimagined” presents Shakespeare’s most famous star-crossed lovers like you’ve never seen them before. Our emphasis on the unknown and unrehearsed inspires fast-paced, spontaneous renderings of classic Shakespearean text. Inspired by renaissance traveling players, an MMD performance can take place at anytime, anywhere, requiring little more than the players’ bodies and voices. We bring to life Shakespeare's timeless stories through his eloquent words and the authenticity of spontaneous human interaction. This project promises moments of romance, lust, loss, and forgiveness, and that just begins to crack the surface of what is possible when we put YOU in control.<br/></p>
<p>Since we are a fresh company, we need we all the help we can get. From rehearsal space, to materials such as scripts and folding chairs and having us travel up and down the east coast, we need some support. For real.<br/></p>

</div>","Four actors. Eleven characters. Pick Your Poison.  

A new theatre company, Madness Most Discreet presents The R+J Project: Romeo and Juliet Re-imagined. 
Rehearsed minimally, but studied intensely, MMD uses innovation and audience engagement to bring Shakespeare to the audience who actually knows what Trivia Crack is. Hint: It's not a drug. 
MMD revisits Shakespeare's stories and innovates through spontaneity and audience engagement for a younger generation. 
Madness Most Discreet Theatre was born from four actors experience with Original Practice Shakespearean Performance. MMD’s play on the Original Practice style is a performance where four actors each memorize the whole script of Romeo and Juliet,  and with a small amount of rehearsal leave the show in the audience’s hands, allowing the spectators to decide which actor will play what role. This “trial by fire” attitude in performance requires precision and specificity from its actors, but fosters incredible moments of discovery. ""The R&J Project: Romeo and Juliet Reimagined” presents Shakespeare’s most famous star-crossed lovers like you’ve never seen them before. Our emphasis on the unknown and unrehearsed inspires fast-paced, spontaneous renderings of classic Shakespearean text. Inspired by renaissance traveling players, an MMD performance can take place at anytime, anywhere, requiring little more than the players’ bodies and voices. We bring to life Shakespeare's timeless stories through his eloquent words and the authenticity of spontaneous human interaction. This project promises moments of romance, lust, loss, and forgiveness, and that just begins to crack the surface of what is possible when we put YOU in control.
Since we are a fresh company, we need we all the help we can get. From rehearsal space, to materials such as scripts and folding chairs and having us travel up and down the east coast, we need some support. For real.
Visit madnessmostdiscreettheatre.com for more information and to get a sense for who we are.

And so you don't think we're just pocketing this money, here is a budget breakdown:


Materials  (Costumes, Properties, Set Pieces, Etc.):$400


Travel: $1000
Rehearsal Space: $900    

Venue Fees: $550
Advertising/PR/Marketing: $150



Education

Madness Most Discreet's  team of teaching artists also offers the opportunity for an interactive introduction to Shakespearean performance technique. In schools and recreation programs, possible classroom workshop topics may include, but are not limited to: text analysis, introduction to iambic pentameter, stage combat, and character creation.

Inspired by a collection of paintings by expressionist artist Sarah Shaw, SOMNOGRAM threads the themes of disconnect, isolation and death through a surrealistic exploration of the theories of dream interpretation and eternal recurrence. With a cast of intense and volatile characters, the play courts the audience to examine the conflict between our survival instincts and tendency for self-destruction, and to question the value of eternity, just as it lays bare the knowledge that we can never fully articulate what we really think and feel, and that we can never know - or be known - by someone else in perfect, absolute totality.

</div><p><strong>The Play</strong></p><div>
</div><p>Driven by activist passion and anthropological training, playwright Sandra Kammann’s new work tackles religious persecution, eco-spirituality, the mother-daughter bond and the nature of eternity, for starters. The hallmark alchemy of her mythic approach is deliciously nourishing, and the play’s visionary perspective proves both disarming and exhilarating in its bold authenticity.

</div><p>While navigating life’s challenges, Melissa feels the widening gap between her dreams for the future and her daily existence. When she and her teenaged daughter Claire find themselves displaced, a sense of powerless mediocrity threatens to overtake her once buoyant nature.  When the dreams begin, she is unaware of their meaning, and the gifts they offer.  Startled awake, she hears retreating voices singing a familiar blessing in a language she no longer comprehends.

</div><p>Set in contemporary Washington D.C. and in ancient Ireland, the heart of the play follows a band of Druids, members of an illuminated spiritual elite revered as practitioners of ancient Celtic wisdom. “<em>Duir-wyyd</em>” or “<em>Druid”</em> translates as one who can traverse the veil between the worlds to experience and transmit sacred knowledge. Allied with the spirits of Nature, Druids were the shamanic leaders of their time, tending to their people as healers, bards and visionaries. As Rome’s reach expands and the church’s influence grows, a monumental struggle over the fate of the people of the Isle of Eire ensues.

<p><b>Mon parcours :</b></p>
<p>Très
tôt, je me suis ouvert à différents styles de danse.  J’ai suivi mon premier cours de danse à 7
ans, du ballet-jazz, puis j’ai pratiqué le hip-hop, la danse latine et même le
« ballroom » en compétitions. La troisième année de mon secondaire, au moment
où je débute ma formation au secteur professionnel Danse-Études de l’École de
danse de Québec, j’ai déjà une bonne idée du style que je veux créer. Dès que
j’ai commencé le ballet, j’ai figuré des enchaînements de mouvements de type
break-ballet.  J’ai rapidement réalisé
que je ne pouvais pas être heureux sans danser les deux styles et que dans ma
vision, ils étaient déjà fusionnés. Je décide alors de perfectionner mon ballet
classique et de poursuivre ma formation pendant trois ans, à School of Alberta
Ballet (Calgary), afin d’être mieux équipé pour poursuivre mon projet de
création de break-ballet. </p>
<p>En
2008, Ballet Kelowna m’embauche comme un des danseurs principaux en ballet
classique et pour des ballets contemporain. De retour à Québec, j’enseigne la
danse à l’École de danse de Québec puis à Québec Multi Danse Association. Je
suis interprète, notamment, dans <i>La Noce</i> d’Harold Rhéaume, <i>Tatou
Militaire</i>, <i>Les Chemins invisibles</i> du Cirque du Soleil, la Comédie
musicale dramatique <i>à Jamais</i> à Saguenay. À plusieurs reprises, je suis
invité par L’Entre Choc de Victoriaville comme interprète et chorégraphe pour
des classiques, du contemporain et du break-ballet. Plusieurs stages intensifs,
dont à Los Angeles et New-York, s’ajoutent à mon parcours professionnel ainsi
qu’un mentorat avec Victor
Quijada (RubberBandance). </p>
<p>Mai
2015, je suis en résidence de création chorégraphique devant le public au Musée de la Civilisation de Québec.
Pendant six jours, accompagné de trois interprètes professionnels, j’ai créé en
direct une œuvre originale inspirée du thème « Corps naturels : l’organicité,
la primitivité du corps, le lien du corps avec la nature » dans le cadre de
l’exposition Corps Rebelles. Une expérience que je répéterai au début de
novembre 2015 car j’ai été réinvité je n’attends plus qu’une confirmation d’une
bourse.</p>
<p>Mes
principales techniques relèvent du ballet, des danses urbaines, du break-dance,
du contemporain ainsi que des principes et mouvements des arts martiaux qui inspirent mon approche et font partie
intégrante de la forme de break-ballet que je crée : le break-ballet WXWS (<i>Wu Xing Wu Shi</i> -
Guerrier dansant les cinq éléments).
Il ne s’agit pas de plusieurs styles collés,
mais bien d’un nouveau style propre à ma personnalité où le contemporain et les
arts martiaux sont le liant.</p>
<p>Je suis motivé par une
conjugaison de la splendeur physique du corps : la « physicalité » et
la profondeur de l’interprétation, parfois plus théâtrale ou abstraite. Tout
part de l’interne et s’alimente de la maîtrise de différents styles de danse; une complémentarité qui décuple
l’expression artistique et parfois animal de l’être.</p>
<p><b>L’importance de mon projet :</b></p>
<p>Je veux participer à un entraînement
intensif en arts martiaux avec le maître Ismet Himmet, directeur de l’école
élite WPD China Academy.  Ce stage en
Wudang Kung Fu se déroule sur deux mois en décembre 2015 et janvier 2016 sur
Hainan Island, en Chine.  À cet
entraînement rigoureux en arts martiaux, dont le Baguazhang et le Bajiquan,
s’ajoute des séances de Qi Gong et de la méditation. Les activités ont lieu six
jours par semaine de 5 heures à 21 heures.</p>
<p>Cet apprentissage à WPD China Academy
comprend la marche en cercle (Bagua Zou Zhuan), les changements de paumes (Lao
Ba Huan Zhang), les pratiques posturales propres au Bagua (Zhuang Fa – Yin Yang
Shou Dan) et les applications martiales. Du point de vue de la danse, cette
pratique présente de nombreux mouvements complexes demandant force, équilibre,
coordination, endurance, dont les mouvements en 360 degrés, beaucoup de spirales
et de cercles. </p>
<p>Cette formation est très importante
pour moi puisque les arts de Wudang représentent la fondation et l'inspiration
primaire de mon break-ballet.  Tant que
cette expression du mouvement issue des arts martiaux ne sera pas assez
approfondie et explorée, je sens incomplet cette partie qui compte pour au
moins le tiers de mon nouveau style. Le break et le ballet étant les autres
extrémités, le hiphop et le contemporain les agents liant de ces trois sphères.</p>
<p><b>Le pourquoi :</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Cet intensif viendra préciser,
renforcer et « naturaliser » l’essence des arts martiaux que je veux propager :
la force, la souplesse, l’agilité et le mouvement. J’ai déjà fait beaucoup de
Tai Chi dans le passé et j’ai toujours été très inspiré par le mouvement et la
qualité, la fougue, le contrôle, le relâchement et l’énergie des arts martiaux
chinois. J’ai recommencé à faire plus intensément des arts martiaux dans une
école nommée Wudang Paï Québec et j’ai vu une amélioration extrême au niveau de
ma force, de ma souplesse et de l’utilisation de mon corps de façon plus
efficace.  Depuis, j’ai aussi gagné en
stabilité, en équilibre, en vitesse et guéri d’anciennes blessures chroniques.
De plus, cet apprentissage a ajouté en qualité et en nouveauté dans mes démarches
de création chorégraphique. Je poursuis mon entraînement de Kung Fu et de Qi
Gong environ 5,5 heures par semaine ou plus, sans compter mes séances
personnelles.  </p>
<p>Séjourner en Chine me permettra d’être
au berceau de la boxe chinoise et d’en comprendre la richesse, la profondeur et
la subtilité. Apprendre les fondements du Bagua et approfondir le Gong Fu Xuan
Wu Paï, que je pourrai diffuser, favoriseront le développement de la danse en
intégrant et en échangeant mes connaissances pour améliorer les danseurs sur
plusieurs plans. Il y a aussi
la possibilité que je revienne avec un diplôme pour enseigner certaines bases
du Bagua, un style complémentaire à celui de mon professeur actuel à Québec.
Outre le matériel pour la danse et la possibilité d’enseigner en revenant de
Chine, j’aurai aussi acquis plusieurs exercices de renforcement et d’étirement
ainsi que des méditations et visualisations pour mieux enseigner.</p>
<p>Les principaux apports de ce stage
en arts martiaux en Chine sur l’évolution de ma pratique de la danse se
manifesteront par une nouvelle physicalité et une autre façon de saisir le
mouvement en intégrant à mon style les principes fondamentaux des arts martiaux
du point de vue mécanique, énergétique et philosophique. J’approfondirai mon
lexique et mon « syllabus » du break-ballet. Du point de vue professionnel, ce
stage m’ouvrira des portes, apportera un changement fondamental et raffinera ma
philosophie à la base du style de danse que je suis en train de peaufiner.</p>
<p><b>Détail du montant du financement :</b></p>
<p>J'ai été invité par le maître Ismet
Himmet, directeur de l’école élite WPD China Academy, grâce à mon professeur
d’arts martiaux et propriétaire de l’école Wudang Paï Québec, Philippe Lavoie,
qui a reçu une formation à cette académie et qui croit en mon style de
break-ballet WXWS. Ainsi après avoir discuté avec Ismet Himmet par courriel, il
croit également en mon projet de fusion.</p>
<p>Mon
projet d’entraînement intensif en arts martiaux en Chine a déjà reçu une
réponse positive de Première Ovation (ville de Québec) et du Conseil des arts
du Canada. Je considère que c’est le moment le plus propice pour réaliser ce
stage qui bonifiera ma création chorégraphique, mais il manque des fonds pour
que je puisse concrétiser mon projet. Le coût total pour cet entrainement
intensif pendant deux mois, qui est de 11 000 $, inclut la formation
avec ce maître de renommé, l’hébergement et la nourriture (3 700$), l’aller-retour
en avion et les frais de déplacement entre les aéroports  (2 070$), l’assurance voyage (300$ ), le visa
(150$), les vaccins (180$), les uniformes de l’école, des chaussures (400$), le
matériel pour archivage de matériel en formation (500$), l’entraînement
préparatoire pour avoir le meilleur de mon deux mois (900$), les frais lors de
mon absence, transport en Chine, cours privé avec Ismet, repas à l’extérieur de
l’école, le matériel pour apprendre les bases du chinois et les frais Indiegogo  (2 800$). </p>
<p>J’ai déjà accumulé 6 000 $ grâce à Première Ovation (Québec) et aux
Conseil
des arts du Canada que je remercie de leur soutien. Il manque 5 000 $, alors je
fais appel à vous, mais je continue de chercher de mon côté.</p>
<p>Si je recueille plus que le montant requis pour mon projet, les fonds
seront directement redirigés vers ma compagnie de danse, Wu Xing Wu Shi (Guerrier
dansant les cinq éléments), un OBNL (Organisme à  Non But Lucratif)
créé en 2014. Ils serviront à embaucher d'autres danseurs, à les aider dans
leur entraînement, à louer des studios et à soutenir les projets de création et
production. Je ne néglige pas le travail, les efforts et les démarches pour
diffuser mon style de break-ballet WXWS. 
D’ailleurs, j’ai été retenu par le diffuseur de La Rotonde à Québec pour
faire partie de leur programmation 2016-2017.</p><h4><i>Contreparties:</i></h4><p></p><p><b><i>1- Remerciements : 10$</i></b></p>

<p>« As the
expression of the human body is unique to all mankind and is not limited to a
certain time or race, martial arts are being kept as one of the truest
expressions of Chinese philosophy and Daoist and Buddhist ideas till today.
“Movement never lies” (Martha Graham).</p>
<p>In these
movements Chinese culture is much easier accessible to Western minds rather
than in old books. And practicing martial arts the old wisdom can be
experienced alive every day new, which makes it the perfect bridge for
understanding between West and East ».</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>L'impact :</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Grâce à votre contribution, ce
stage me permettra de perfectionner mon idée maîtresse et d’apposer ma griffe
en tant que danseur et chorégraphe dans le milieu de la danse à Québec, et plus
largement au Québec. Pour les artistes de la relève qui bénéficieront de
l’expérience que j’aurai acquise lors de ce stage en Chine, ce sera l’occasion
d’expérimenter une nouvelle forme de danse et peut-être aussi de poursuivre
cette démarche en profondeur. Le but avoué est d’augmenter le bassin de
danseurs et de chorégraphes de différents styles à Québec, y encourager la
danse et promouvoir un champ artistique dynamique où la pluralité des genres
peut coexister et se diffuser sans complexes. Quand viendra le moment
d’illustrer cette forme de danse, la production révèlera au milieu des
professionnels une forme distincte de mouvements, une fusion de styles formant
une unité et non pas une superposition de danses. </p>

<p>Hello,
my name is Mikaël Xystra Montminy.</p>
<p>Artistic
Director </p>
<p>Choreographer
– Dancer – Instructor – Dance Coach </p>
<p>Reiki
Master</p>
<p>Trainer</p>
<p><b>My dancing
journey</b></p>
<p>Early on I exposed myself to many styles of dance.
When I was seven years old, I had my first dance class, jazz-ballet, then I
danced hip-hop, latin and even competitive ballroom styles. In my third year of
junior high, at a time when I was just beginning my training in the
professional division of the Dance-Study program at « « <i>l’école de danse de Québec »</i>, I already had an idea of the dance
style I wished to one day create and as soon as I began to dance ballet, I was
already combining movements in a break-ballet style. I quickly understood that
I wouldn’t be happy without dancing both styles; in my mind the two were
already fusional. Thus I decided to perfect my classical ballet, training for
three years at the School of Alberta Ballet (Calgary) in order to acquire the
necessary skill to develop my break-ballet creation.</p>
<p>In 2008, Ballet Kelowna hired me as one of their main
dancers for both classical and contemporary ballet. On my return to Québec, I taught
both at <i>L’école de danse de Québec</i>
and at <i>Québec Multi-Danse Association.</i>
During this time I performed in <i>Cirque du
Soleil</i> :<i> Les chemins invisibles</i>, <i>Tatou militaire</i> and Harold Rhéaume’s <i>La Noce</i>, and the dramatic musical
theatre piece « À<i> Jamais</i> » in
Saguenay. On multiple occasions I was invited by the dance school <i>L’Entre Choc </i>in Victoriaville to perform
and choreographe classical, contemporary and break-ballet pieces. For professional
development I also attended master classes and workshops both in New-York and
Los Angeles and was mentored by Victor Quijada of the Rubberband dance company.</p>
<p>In May 2015, I began an artistic residency at the <i>Québec Musée de la Civilisation</i> (Museum
of Civilisation). For six days, accompanied by three other professional
dancers, I created a novel piece on the spot inspired by the theme “ Natural
bodies : organicism, the body’s primitivism, and its connection with
nature “ as part of the exposition <i>Corps
Rebelles</i> (Rebel bodies). I’ve been invited to repeat this dance experiment
in early November 2015; I await only the confirmation of the bursary.</p>
<p>My techniques are drawn from ballet, urban dances,
break dance and contemporary. Principles and movements from various martial
arts also inspire my approach and are an integral component of the style of
break ballet which I have created: WXWS break-ballet (<i>Wu Xing
Wu Shi</i> – The warrior
who dances the five elements). Wu Xing Wu Shi is more than the simple collation of
various traditions; it’s a style of its own through to my personality and held
together by the principles of martial arts and contemporary dance.</p>
<p>I’m
driven by the conjugation of the body’s physical splendour : physicality
and the depth of interpretation, sometimes almost theatrical or abstract. All
is born internally and nourished by the mastery of different dance techniques; synergy
which multiplies tenfold the artistic and sometimes animalistic expression of
the human being.</p>
<p><b>The Significance of this
Project</b></p>
<p>I wish to
intensively train with the martial arts master Ismet Himmet, director of the
élite WPD Chia Academy. This mentorship in Wudang Kung Fu will take place
between December 2015 and January 2016 on Hainan in China. In addition to rigorous
training in Baguazhang and Bajiquan techniques, the mentorship includes
workshops in in Qi Gong and meditation, six days a week from 5 am to 9 pm.</p>
<p>The
apprenticeship at WPD China Academy includes <i>Bagua Zou Zhuan </i>(walking in circles), <i>Lao Ba Huan Zhang</i> (palm changes), and postures specific to the
Bagua technique (<i>Zhuang Fa Yin Yang Shou
Dan)</i> and martial applications. From a dance perspective, this practice
presents numerous complex movements, requiring strength, balance, coordination,
and endurance, including 360 degree movements, spirals and circles.</p>
<p>This training is very important to me because the
Wudang arts represent the foundation and the very inspiration of my
break-ballet style. Until these martial arts movements have been sufficiently acquired,
honed and enriched, this very important aspect of my new style will remain
incomplete, having yet to achieve its full potential. Martial arts is an
important component along with the other poles of break dance and ballet,
hip-hip and contemporary acting as bonding agents.</p>
<p><b>Why? / The Reason </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>This intensive
training will clarify, strengthen and ""naturalize"" the essence of
martial arts that I wish to spread: strength, flexibility, agility and
movement. I've done a lot of Tai Chi in the past and have always been very
inspired by the movement, quality, passion, control, relaxation and energy of
Chinese martial arts. I reintensified my martial arts training in a school
named <i>Wudang Pai Quebec</i> and I saw an
extreme improvement in my strength, my flexibility and I discovered how to use
my body more effectively. Since then I have also gained stability, balance,
speed and healed old chronic wounds chronic. In addition, this learning has
added quality and novelty to my choreographic approach. I continue my Kung Fu
and Qigong training about 5.5 hours a week or more, not counting my personal
sessions.</p>
<p>Staying in
China, I would be in the birthplace of Chinese boxing, allowing me to
understand its richness, depth and subtlety and to learn the basics of <i>Bagua</i> and deepen my knowledge of <i>Xuan Gong Fu Wu Pai</i>, allowing me to
distribute and promote the development of dance by integrating and sharing my
knowledge to improve the dancers on several levels. There is also the
possibility that I return with a degree to teach some basics of <i>Bagua</i>, a complementary style to my
current professor in Quebec. In addition to dance equipment and the opportunity
to teach on my return from China, I will have acquired several strengthening
and stretching exercises, and meditations and visualization techniques for a
richer teaching.</p>
<p>The main
contributions of this training in martial arts in China on the evolution of my
dance practice will manifest as a new physicality and another of capturing
movement, by incorporating the fundamentals of martial arts from a mechanical,
energetic and philosophical perspective. I’ll expand my vocabulary and my
break-ballet syllabus. From a professional perspective, this mentorship will
open doors, bringing about a fundamental change, and will refine the philosophy
at the heart of the dance style I’m working to fine polish.</p>
<p><b>Details
of the financial plan</b></p>
<p>I’ve been
invited by Master Ismet Himmet, director of the WPD China Academy, and thanks
to my martial arts professor and owner of the Wudanf Paï School Québec,
Phillipe Lavoie, who was trained at that Academy and who is a firm believer in
my WXWS break-ballet style. Thus, having spoken with Ismet Himmet by email, he
also believes in my fusion project.</p>
<p>My
project to train intensively in martial arts in China has received a positive
response from the City of Quebec (<i>première
ovation</i>) and from the Canada Council for the Arts. I consider that now is
the best moment to realise this training which will enhance my choreographic
creations. However, I lack funds to realise this project. The total cost to
realise this training over the course of 2 months is approximately $10 500, including
my training with the well-known master, housing and food ($ 3700), round-trip
airfare and travel costs between airports ($ 2,000), travel insurance (300) $,  visa ($ 150), vaccines ($ 180), school uniforms
and shoes ($ 400), archival material for training equipment ($ 500),
preparatory to make the most of my time there ($ 900), fees due to my absence,
transportation in China, private courses with Ismet, meals outside of school,
and material to learn the basics of China ($ 2,300).</p>
<p>I’ve acquired $
6000 through first ovation funding (Québec) and through the Canada Council for
the Arts. I’m still missing $ 4500 however, thus I turn to you, and in the
meanwhile I continue to search additional funding opportunities.</p>
<p>If I collect more than the amount required
for my project, the funds will be directed to my dance company, Wu Shi Wu Xing
(The warrior who dances the five elements), an NPO (Non Profit Organization )
founded in 2014. With this money I will hire other dancers, to help them in
their training, rent studios and support the creation of projects and
productions. I neither neglect the hard work and effort nor the various
approaches possible to disseminate my style of WXWS break-ballet. Furthermore.
I’ve been retained by the broadcaster La Rotonde in Quebec to be part of their
2016-2017 programming.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Impact</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>With
your contribution, this course will allow me to improve the crux of my
technique and lay down my signature as a dancer and choreographer in the dance
Québec City dance community and more widely. Emerging artists will benefit from
the experience I have gained from this course in China as this is an
opportunity to experience a new form of dance and perhaps also to pursue this
approach in depth. The avowed aim is to increase the pool of dancers and
choreographers of different styles in Quebec by encouraging dance and promoting
a dynamic artistic field where the plurality of styles can coexist and spread
uninhibited. When the time comes to illustrate this dance form, the production will
reveal a distinct form of movement among professionals, a fusion of styles as a
cohesive unit and not merely a superposition of dances.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Successful
experiment</b></p>
<p>I have already managed this kind of experience. I
participated in several intensive courses that enhanced my dance training,
including the Okanagan Summer Dance Intensive, Professional Program, BC (2008),

Directeur Artistique
Chorégraphe - Danseur
-Enseignant -Répétiteur
Maître Reiki 
Entraineur
Mon parcours :
Très
tôt, je me suis ouvert à différents styles de danse.  J’ai suivi mon premier cours de danse à 7
ans, du ballet-jazz, puis j’ai pratiqué le hip-hop, la danse latine et même le
« ballroom » en compétitions. La troisième année de mon secondaire, au moment
où je débute ma formation au secteur professionnel Danse-Études de l’École de
danse de Québec, j’ai déjà une bonne idée du style que je veux créer. Dès que
j’ai commencé le ballet, j’ai figuré des enchaînements de mouvements de type
break-ballet.  J’ai rapidement réalisé
que je ne pouvais pas être heureux sans danser les deux styles et que dans ma
vision, ils étaient déjà fusionnés. Je décide alors de perfectionner mon ballet
classique et de poursuivre ma formation pendant trois ans, à School of Alberta
Ballet (Calgary), afin d’être mieux équipé pour poursuivre mon projet de
création de break-ballet. 
En
2008, Ballet Kelowna m’embauche comme un des danseurs principaux en ballet
classique et pour des ballets contemporain. De retour à Québec, j’enseigne la
danse à l’École de danse de Québec puis à Québec Multi Danse Association. Je
suis interprète, notamment, dans La Noce d’Harold Rhéaume, Tatou
Militaire, Les Chemins invisibles du Cirque du Soleil, la Comédie
musicale dramatique à Jamais à Saguenay. À plusieurs reprises, je suis
invité par L’Entre Choc de Victoriaville comme interprète et chorégraphe pour
des classiques, du contemporain et du break-ballet. Plusieurs stages intensifs,
dont à Los Angeles et New-York, s’ajoutent à mon parcours professionnel ainsi
qu’un mentorat avec Victor
Quijada (RubberBandance). 
Mai
2015, je suis en résidence de création chorégraphique devant le public au Musée de la Civilisation de Québec.
Pendant six jours, accompagné de trois interprètes professionnels, j’ai créé en
direct une œuvre originale inspirée du thème « Corps naturels : l’organicité,
la primitivité du corps, le lien du corps avec la nature » dans le cadre de
l’exposition Corps Rebelles. Une expérience que je répéterai au début de
novembre 2015 car j’ai été réinvité je n’attends plus qu’une confirmation d’une
bourse.
Mes
principales techniques relèvent du ballet, des danses urbaines, du break-dance,
du contemporain ainsi que des principes et mouvements des arts martiaux qui inspirent mon approche et font partie
intégrante de la forme de break-ballet que je crée : le break-ballet WXWS (Wu Xing Wu Shi -
Guerrier dansant les cinq éléments).
Il ne s’agit pas de plusieurs styles collés,
mais bien d’un nouveau style propre à ma personnalité où le contemporain et les
arts martiaux sont le liant.
Je suis motivé par une
conjugaison de la splendeur physique du corps : la « physicalité » et
la profondeur de l’interprétation, parfois plus théâtrale ou abstraite. Tout
part de l’interne et s’alimente de la maîtrise de différents styles de danse; une complémentarité qui décuple
l’expression artistique et parfois animal de l’être.
L’importance de mon projet :
Je veux participer à un entraînement
intensif en arts martiaux avec le maître Ismet Himmet, directeur de l’école
élite WPD China Academy.  Ce stage en
Wudang Kung Fu se déroule sur deux mois en décembre 2015 et janvier 2016 sur
Hainan Island, en Chine.  À cet
entraînement rigoureux en arts martiaux, dont le Baguazhang et le Bajiquan,
s’ajoute des séances de Qi Gong et de la méditation. Les activités ont lieu six
jours par semaine de 5 heures à 21 heures.
Cet apprentissage à WPD China Academy
comprend la marche en cercle (Bagua Zou Zhuan), les changements de paumes (Lao
Ba Huan Zhang), les pratiques posturales propres au Bagua (Zhuang Fa – Yin Yang
Shou Dan) et les applications martiales. Du point de vue de la danse, cette
pratique présente de nombreux mouvements complexes demandant force, équilibre,
coordination, endurance, dont les mouvements en 360 degrés, beaucoup de spirales
et de cercles. 
Cette formation est très importante
pour moi puisque les arts de Wudang représentent la fondation et l'inspiration
primaire de mon break-ballet.  Tant que
cette expression du mouvement issue des arts martiaux ne sera pas assez
approfondie et explorée, je sens incomplet cette partie qui compte pour au
moins le tiers de mon nouveau style. Le break et le ballet étant les autres
extrémités, le hiphop et le contemporain les agents liant de ces trois sphères.
Le pourquoi :

Cet intensif viendra préciser,
renforcer et « naturaliser » l’essence des arts martiaux que je veux propager :
la force, la souplesse, l’agilité et le mouvement. J’ai déjà fait beaucoup de
Tai Chi dans le passé et j’ai toujours été très inspiré par le mouvement et la
qualité, la fougue, le contrôle, le relâchement et l’énergie des arts martiaux
chinois. J’ai recommencé à faire plus intensément des arts martiaux dans une
école nommée Wudang Paï Québec et j’ai vu une amélioration extrême au niveau de
ma force, de ma souplesse et de l’utilisation de mon corps de façon plus
efficace.  Depuis, j’ai aussi gagné en
stabilité, en équilibre, en vitesse et guéri d’anciennes blessures chroniques.
De plus, cet apprentissage a ajouté en qualité et en nouveauté dans mes démarches
de création chorégraphique. Je poursuis mon entraînement de Kung Fu et de Qi
Gong environ 5,5 heures par semaine ou plus, sans compter mes séances
personnelles.  
Séjourner en Chine me permettra d’être
au berceau de la boxe chinoise et d’en comprendre la richesse, la profondeur et
la subtilité. Apprendre les fondements du Bagua et approfondir le Gong Fu Xuan
Wu Paï, que je pourrai diffuser, favoriseront le développement de la danse en
intégrant et en échangeant mes connaissances pour améliorer les danseurs sur
plusieurs plans. Il y a aussi
la possibilité que je revienne avec un diplôme pour enseigner certaines bases
du Bagua, un style complémentaire à celui de mon professeur actuel à Québec.
Outre le matériel pour la danse et la possibilité d’enseigner en revenant de
Chine, j’aurai aussi acquis plusieurs exercices de renforcement et d’étirement
ainsi que des méditations et visualisations pour mieux enseigner.
Les principaux apports de ce stage
en arts martiaux en Chine sur l’évolution de ma pratique de la danse se
manifesteront par une nouvelle physicalité et une autre façon de saisir le
mouvement en intégrant à mon style les principes fondamentaux des arts martiaux
du point de vue mécanique, énergétique et philosophique. J’approfondirai mon
lexique et mon « syllabus » du break-ballet. Du point de vue professionnel, ce
stage m’ouvrira des portes, apportera un changement fondamental et raffinera ma
philosophie à la base du style de danse que je suis en train de peaufiner.
Détail du montant du financement :
J'ai été invité par le maître Ismet
Himmet, directeur de l’école élite WPD China Academy, grâce à mon professeur
d’arts martiaux et propriétaire de l’école Wudang Paï Québec, Philippe Lavoie,
qui a reçu une formation à cette académie et qui croit en mon style de
break-ballet WXWS. Ainsi après avoir discuté avec Ismet Himmet par courriel, il
croit également en mon projet de fusion.
Mon
projet d’entraînement intensif en arts martiaux en Chine a déjà reçu une
réponse positive de Première Ovation (ville de Québec) et du Conseil des arts
du Canada. Je considère que c’est le moment le plus propice pour réaliser ce
stage qui bonifiera ma création chorégraphique, mais il manque des fonds pour
que je puisse concrétiser mon projet. Le coût total pour cet entrainement
intensif pendant deux mois, qui est de 11 000 $, inclut la formation
avec ce maître de renommé, l’hébergement et la nourriture (3 700$), l’aller-retour
en avion et les frais de déplacement entre les aéroports  (2 070$), l’assurance voyage (300$ ), le visa
(150$), les vaccins (180$), les uniformes de l’école, des chaussures (400$), le
matériel pour archivage de matériel en formation (500$), l’entraînement
préparatoire pour avoir le meilleur de mon deux mois (900$), les frais lors de
mon absence, transport en Chine, cours privé avec Ismet, repas à l’extérieur de
l’école, le matériel pour apprendre les bases du chinois et les frais Indiegogo  (2 800$). 
J’ai déjà accumulé 6 000 $ grâce à Première Ovation (Québec) et aux
Conseil
des arts du Canada que je remercie de leur soutien. Il manque 5 000 $, alors je
fais appel à vous, mais je continue de chercher de mon côté.
Si je recueille plus que le montant requis pour mon projet, les fonds
seront directement redirigés vers ma compagnie de danse, Wu Xing Wu Shi (Guerrier
dansant les cinq éléments), un OBNL (Organisme à  Non But Lucratif)
créé en 2014. Ils serviront à embaucher d'autres danseurs, à les aider dans
leur entraînement, à louer des studios et à soutenir les projets de création et
production. Je ne néglige pas le travail, les efforts et les démarches pour
diffuser mon style de break-ballet WXWS.

faire partie de leur programmation 2016-2017.Contreparties:1- Remerciements : 10$

Extrait de la lettre
d'échange culturel que le maître Ismet Himmet m'a envoyée :
« As the
expression of the human body is unique to all mankind and is not limited to a
certain time or race, martial arts are being kept as one of the truest
expressions of Chinese philosophy and Daoist and Buddhist ideas till today.
“Movement never lies” (Martha Graham).

L'impact :

Grâce à votre contribution, ce
stage me permettra de perfectionner mon idée maîtresse et d’apposer ma griffe
en tant que danseur et chorégraphe dans le milieu de la danse à Québec, et plus
largement au Québec. Pour les artistes de la relève qui bénéficieront de
l’expérience que j’aurai acquise lors de ce stage en Chine, ce sera l’occasion
d’expérimenter une nouvelle forme de danse et peut-être aussi de poursuivre
cette démarche en profondeur. Le but avoué est d’augmenter le bassin de
danseurs et de chorégraphes de différents styles à Québec, y encourager la
danse et promouvoir un champ artistique dynamique où la pluralité des genres
peut coexister et se diffuser sans complexes. Quand viendra le moment
d’illustrer cette forme de danse, la production révèlera au milieu des
professionnels une forme distincte de mouvements, une fusion de styles formant
une unité et non pas une superposition de danses. 

« Ma compagnie de danse, Wu Xing Wu Shi (Guerrier dansant les  cinq éléments) créée en 2014, veut amener une touche différente dans
le milieu de la danse contemporaine et travailler avec des danseurs intéressés
par la singularité de mon approche chorégraphique » (Mikaël Xystra Montminy).


Des expériences réussies :
J’ai déjà
réussi des expériences de ce genre.  J’ai
participé à plusieurs stages intensifs qui ont bonifié ma formation en danse, notamment
à Okanagan Summer Dance Intensive, Professional Program, C.-B. (2008), Millenium
Dance Complex, Los Angeles (stage de ballet et de hip-hop) (2009), Dance
Theater Summit, New York (classes de ballet et contemporain), Broadway Dance
Centre, New York (danse urbaine) et Alvin Ailey (ballet) (2012).
J’ai récemment obtenu des
subventions de recherche et création chorégraphique : 260 heures avec
Première Ovation (ville de Québec), une semaine de mentorat avec Victor Quijada
du Groupe RUBBERBANDance et pour une résidence de six jours de création devant
le public pour l’exposition Corps Rebelles au Musée de la Civilisation (Québec).
Comment contribuer :
Que vous puissiez me soutenir financièrement ou non,
S.V.P. ayez la gentillesse de parler de mon projet, de le partager sur
Indiegogo et ailleurs. Plus il y aura de gens qui participeront, même avec de
petits montants, la force du nombre sera victorieuse.------------------------------------------------------------------------------English____
Hello,
my name is Mikaël Xystra Montminy.
Artistic
Director 
Choreographer
– Dancer – Instructor – Dance Coach 
Reiki
Master
Trainer
My dancing
journey
Early on I exposed myself to many styles of dance.
When I was seven years old, I had my first dance class, jazz-ballet, then I
danced hip-hop, latin and even competitive ballroom styles. In my third year of
junior high, at a time when I was just beginning my training in the
professional division of the Dance-Study program at « « l’école de danse de Québec », I already had an idea of the dance
style I wished to one day create and as soon as I began to dance ballet, I was
already combining movements in a break-ballet style. I quickly understood that
I wouldn’t be happy without dancing both styles; in my mind the two were
already fusional. Thus I decided to perfect my classical ballet, training for
three years at the School of Alberta Ballet (Calgary) in order to acquire the
necessary skill to develop my break-ballet creation.
In 2008, Ballet Kelowna hired me as one of their main
dancers for both classical and contemporary ballet. On my return to Québec, I taught
both at L’école de danse de Québec
and at Québec Multi-Danse Association.
During this time I performed in Cirque du
Soleil : Les chemins invisibles, Tatou militaire and Harold Rhéaume’s La Noce, and the dramatic musical
theatre piece « À Jamais » in
Saguenay. On multiple occasions I was invited by the dance school L’Entre Choc in Victoriaville to perform
and choreographe classical, contemporary and break-ballet pieces. For professional
development I also attended master classes and workshops both in New-York and
Los Angeles and was mentored by Victor Quijada of the Rubberband dance company.
In May 2015, I began an artistic residency at the Québec Musée de la Civilisation (Museum
of Civilisation). For six days, accompanied by three other professional
dancers, I created a novel piece on the spot inspired by the theme “ Natural
bodies : organicism, the body’s primitivism, and its connection with
nature “ as part of the exposition Corps
Rebelles (Rebel bodies). I’ve been invited to repeat this dance experiment
in early November 2015; I await only the confirmation of the bursary.
My techniques are drawn from ballet, urban dances,
break dance and contemporary. Principles and movements from various martial
arts also inspire my approach and are an integral component of the style of
break ballet which I have created: WXWS break-ballet (Wu Xing
Wu Shi – The warrior
who dances the five elements). Wu Xing Wu Shi is more than the simple collation of
various traditions; it’s a style of its own through to my personality and held
together by the principles of martial arts and contemporary dance.
I’m
driven by the conjugation of the body’s physical splendour : physicality
and the depth of interpretation, sometimes almost theatrical or abstract. All
is born internally and nourished by the mastery of different dance techniques; synergy
which multiplies tenfold the artistic and sometimes animalistic expression of
the human being.
The Significance of this
Project
I wish to
intensively train with the martial arts master Ismet Himmet, director of the
élite WPD Chia Academy. This mentorship in Wudang Kung Fu will take place
between December 2015 and January 2016 on Hainan in China. In addition to rigorous
training in Baguazhang and Bajiquan techniques, the mentorship includes
workshops in in Qi Gong and meditation, six days a week from 5 am to 9 pm.
The
apprenticeship at WPD China Academy includes Bagua Zou Zhuan (walking in circles), Lao Ba Huan Zhang (palm changes), and postures specific to the
Bagua technique (Zhuang Fa Yin Yang Shou
Dan) and martial applications. From a dance perspective, this practice
presents numerous complex movements, requiring strength, balance, coordination,
and endurance, including 360 degree movements, spirals and circles.
This training is very important to me because the
Wudang arts represent the foundation and the very inspiration of my
break-ballet style. Until these martial arts movements have been sufficiently acquired,
honed and enriched, this very important aspect of my new style will remain
incomplete, having yet to achieve its full potential. Martial arts is an
important component along with the other poles of break dance and ballet,
hip-hip and contemporary acting as bonding agents.
Why? / The Reason 

This intensive
training will clarify, strengthen and ""naturalize"" the essence of
martial arts that I wish to spread: strength, flexibility, agility and
movement. I've done a lot of Tai Chi in the past and have always been very
inspired by the movement, quality, passion, control, relaxation and energy of
Chinese martial arts. I reintensified my martial arts training in a school
named Wudang Pai Quebec and I saw an
extreme improvement in my strength, my flexibility and I discovered how to use
my body more effectively. Since then I have also gained stability, balance,
speed and healed old chronic wounds chronic. In addition, this learning has
added quality and novelty to my choreographic approach. I continue my Kung Fu
and Qigong training about 5.5 hours a week or more, not counting my personal
sessions.
Staying in
China, I would be in the birthplace of Chinese boxing, allowing me to
understand its richness, depth and subtlety and to learn the basics of Bagua and deepen my knowledge of Xuan Gong Fu Wu Pai, allowing me to
distribute and promote the development of dance by integrating and sharing my
knowledge to improve the dancers on several levels. There is also the
possibility that I return with a degree to teach some basics of Bagua, a complementary style to my
current professor in Quebec. In addition to dance equipment and the opportunity
to teach on my return from China, I will have acquired several strengthening
and stretching exercises, and meditations and visualization techniques for a
richer teaching.
The main
contributions of this training in martial arts in China on the evolution of my
dance practice will manifest as a new physicality and another of capturing
movement, by incorporating the fundamentals of martial arts from a mechanical,
energetic and philosophical perspective. I’ll expand my vocabulary and my
break-ballet syllabus. From a professional perspective, this mentorship will
open doors, bringing about a fundamental change, and will refine the philosophy
at the heart of the dance style I’m working to fine polish.
Details
of the financial plan
I’ve been
invited by Master Ismet Himmet, director of the WPD China Academy, and thanks
to my martial arts professor and owner of the Wudanf Paï School Québec,
Phillipe Lavoie, who was trained at that Academy and who is a firm believer in
my WXWS break-ballet style. Thus, having spoken with Ismet Himmet by email, he
also believes in my fusion project.
My
project to train intensively in martial arts in China has received a positive
response from the City of Quebec (première
ovation) and from the Canada Council for the Arts. I consider that now is
the best moment to realise this training which will enhance my choreographic
creations. However, I lack funds to realise this project. The total cost to
realise this training over the course of 2 months is approximately $10 500, including
my training with the well-known master, housing and food ($ 3700), round-trip
airfare and travel costs between airports ($ 2,000), travel insurance (300) $,  visa ($ 150), vaccines ($ 180), school uniforms
and shoes ($ 400), archival material for training equipment ($ 500),
preparatory to make the most of my time there ($ 900), fees due to my absence,
transportation in China, private courses with Ismet, meals outside of school,
and material to learn the basics of China ($ 2,300).
I’ve acquired $
6000 through first ovation funding (Québec) and through the Canada Council for
the Arts. I’m still missing $ 4500 however, thus I turn to you, and in the
meanwhile I continue to search additional funding opportunities.
If I collect more than the amount required
for my project, the funds will be directed to my dance company, Wu Shi Wu Xing
(The warrior who dances the five elements), an NPO (Non Profit Organization )
founded in 2014. With this money I will hire other dancers, to help them in
their training, rent studios and support the creation of projects and
productions. I neither neglect the hard work and effort nor the various
approaches possible to disseminate my style of WXWS break-ballet. Furthermore.
I’ve been retained by the broadcaster La Rotonde in Quebec to be part of their
2016-2017 programming.

Impact

With
your contribution, this course will allow me to improve the crux of my
technique and lay down my signature as a dancer and choreographer in the dance
Québec City dance community and more widely. Emerging artists will benefit from
the experience I have gained from this course in China as this is an
opportunity to experience a new form of dance and perhaps also to pursue this
approach in depth. The avowed aim is to increase the pool of dancers and
choreographers of different styles in Quebec by encouraging dance and promoting
a dynamic artistic field where the plurality of styles can coexist and spread
uninhibited. When the time comes to illustrate this dance form, the production will
reveal a distinct form of movement among professionals, a fusion of styles as a
cohesive unit and not merely a superposition of dances.


Successful
experiment
I have already managed this kind of experience. I
participated in several intensive courses that enhanced my dance training,
including the Okanagan Summer Dance Intensive, Professional Program, BC (2008),
Millennium Dance Complex, Los Angeles (internship in ballet and hip-hop, 2009),
the Dance Theater Summit (ballet and contemporary classes) at New York Broadway
Dance Center, New York (urban dance) and Alvin Ailey ballet (2012).
I recently obtained grants for research and
choreography: 260 hours through the first ovations award (Quebec City), a
mentoring week with Victor Quijada's RUBBERBANDance Group and a six day creative
residency for the exhibition Rebel Bodies (Corps
Rebels) at the Québec Museum of Civilization.
How to contribute
Whether
you can support me monetarily or not, please do me the kindness of discussing

participate, even with small amounts, will mean victory by strength in numbers.

Excerpt from the cultural exchange letter which
Ismet Himmet, the master, sent to me
As the expression of the human body is unique to all
mankind and is not limited to a certain time or race, martial arts are being
kept as one of the truest expressions of Chinese philosophy and Daoist and
Buddhist ideas till today. “Movement never lies” (Martha Graham).
In these
movements, Chinese culture is much easier accessible to Western minds rather
than in old books. And practicing martial arts the old wisdom can be
experienced alive every day new, which makes it the perfect bridge for
understanding between West and East",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","6/24/2015: One Week Left (Or, Desperate Times)What is Creative License?
 Creative License is a rock musical comedy from Boston that's slowly taking over the fringe scene.  We're a small band of passionate but proven artists that want to bring it to the next level - the New York International Fringe Festival (FringeNYC)!We were recently selected by the festival and are seeking funds to transport and produce the show there this summer.  We had a successful workshop last summer in the Boston area, and this year the show is better than ever.  Here's what press said about the workshop of the show:

“One of the best things I’ve seen in 16 or 17 years…– Michele Markarian, Boston Events Insider“CREATIVE LICENSE shines…ingenious songs…you really do leave the theater humming…hilarious!”– Beverly Creasey, Boston Arts Review“A cohesive ensemble…good musical variety….promising story…fun choreography…check it out!”– Nancy Grossman, BroadwayWorld.com“A Must-See!”– MyEntertainmentWorld

The show has a lot of laughs, a lot of heart, and a lot of fun, as we hope you'll see in our video above.  We're big believers in it, and we want you to be too.  With your help we can get the people and materials we need to produce it in front of up to 75,000 people.So Who Are We?Meet the creative team behind the FringeNYC production of Creative License!




Kevin Cirone (Writer/Composer/Producer/Actor)  Kevin has worked in Boston theater and film for over 12 years, running the gamut from sketch-writing for a hit comedy show to performing in musicals to indie film and everything in between.  Creative License is his first fully-realized theatrical endeavor.





Rachel Bertone (Director/Choreographer) Rachel is an IRNE- and Eliot Norton Award-nominated director and choreographer from the Boston area with credits at numerous professional theaters including Reagle Music Theater and the Lyric Stage Company.  She also is a gifted performer with credits all over Boston and beyond.





Dan Rodriguez (Music Director/Co-Composer) Dan is an IRNE-winning music director with credits at the American Repertory Theater, Speakeasy Stage Company, Moonbox Productions and Reagle Music Theater.  In addition to his theatrical work, Dan is also an active accompanist, teacher, conductor and composer.



What We Need & What You Get
 We've put together a reasonable budget to fit the scale of production we can safely transport to the Fringe festival.  So where will the money go?


Hiring producers, stage managers and designers with festival and/or traveling show experience who understand the requirements and challenges.

Hiring actors and musicians

Renting rehearsal space

Materials for a new, portable set

Transportation to and from New York City for cast, crew, orchestra, set, and equipment.


Sounds like a good plan, and we're confident we can execute on it.  So what's in it for you?


You'll be part of the birth of a BRAND-NEW rock musical making its New York City PREMIERE!
You'll get the satisfaction of helping emerging artists continue to create new work and have their work seen
If you're in the NYC area, you can see it for yourself LIVE!  (And if you do - come and say hi - we'd love to thank you in person!)




PLUS!  Giving to our campaign means you'll also receive fantastic perks, like:




An EXCLUSIVE DVD of Creative License - The Official Bootleg, a high-quality recording of our live workshop at Davis Square Theater last summer!

EXCLUSIVE Creative License FringeNYC T-shirts!

Lunch with our FringeNYC cast and crew!  Get an in-person hug, high-five, or handshake from some of our team!

Tickets (and travel!) to see the show in New York City at the Fringe Festival!  You can see IN  PERSON what your gift helped us create!
Shout-outs in our FringeNYC program and on our official Facebook and Twitter pages!  It's a badge of honor for theater lovers and social media nerds alike!
And more!

Sweet, eh?  So give all you can!

   The Impact

Creative License has proven to be a theatrical experience that people love and has the potential to move beyond its meager beginnings.  The Fringe festival has proven to be a launchpad for new theater to bigger and better things, so it's a huge step forward for this entertaining, rocking, and hilarious show.
If you haven't already, check out the website, listen to some of the music, read the reviews.  We want you to feel the same passion we feel for this show and help us make this project a reality.
   Risks & Challenges The primary challenge is money and time.  The show has to be rehearsed, transported and produced at the festival in August, so time is a factor.  With the complexity of this task we can't afford to also worry about where the money is coming from.
Our budget is reasonable and we know we can produce the show within these means.  All we need is your help.

</div><div> <p>In addition to providing access to the entire community to shows that are rarely seen; we are providing art to a community that is underserved due to its proximity to New York City. The Surrounding New Jersey area is an overlooked resource for producing great theatre and we will be providing that to the Newark and Jersey City communities by offering affordable performances close to home.</p>
<p>Through our Over Easy Production, we will also be providing other artists an opportunity to be seen by a wider range of patron by giving them a stage on which to perform.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risks &amp; challenges for all new theatrical ventures are always similar. The first is being taken seriously and getting people to come. The second is funding your initial production.

</div></div>","Who We Are
We are the Wilsor Theatrical Group; a collective of like-minded artists who have come together to produce theatre that is Underdone and Over Easy. 

It is our goal to produce theatrical events that are under represented in the community and give audiences an opportunity to experience these rare theatrical treasures.
   What We Need & What You Get We are asking for $7,500 to help launch our first season. This money will go toward renting our performance venue, paying musicians, insurance costs, and Administrative fees such as postage, website management, and marketing materials. In return we will provide you with an array of different packages that include signed memorabilia, tickets, and more. All donations are tax-deductible thanks to our partnership with Fractured Atlas. 
The Impact
 In addition to providing access to the entire community to shows that are rarely seen; we are providing art to a community that is underserved due to its proximity to New York City. The Surrounding New Jersey area is an overlooked resource for producing great theatre and we will be providing that to the Newark and Jersey City communities by offering affordable performances close to home.
Through our Over Easy Production, we will also be providing other artists an opportunity to be seen by a wider range of patron by giving them a stage on which to perform.
    Risks & Challenges The risks & challenges for all new theatrical ventures are always similar. The first is being taken seriously and getting people to come. The second is funding your initial production. We believe that with the experience and expertise that Dustin can provide from his past successful projects, we will be able to maneuver these obstacles easily & create a venue known for ""must see theatre"".
    Other Ways You Can Help In addition to your money; we are looking for artists interested in being part of our collective, as well as suggestions of the shows that you believe are Underdone.

The last 2 years I have also gone to acting camp in CA, called Young Actors Theater Camp, or CAMPYATC.COM, where I have taken classes from Naomi Grossman (American Horror Stories-she is Pepper), Candi Milo (Voice for Dexter Cartoon), and many more.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Of all the luxuries that money can afford, Time is what I most need right now. <br/></p>
<p>Being the kind of writer that I am, I'm always too close to my work; writing often in <i>between</i> between the lines. When my work asks me to step back and give it a fresh look, I do. But after working on a piece for so long to get it just right, there comes a point when stepping back isn't enough. I have now to sit back and watch what I've written.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>My Play's Journey<br/>
</h3>
<p>I began writing this play in 2012 which might explain why I currently have three versions. <br/></p>
<p>First is the One Act version. I used that as my thesis project which my grad school, The Actors Studio of Drama School at Pace University in New York, professionally produced in our Rep season under the title <i>Less Than the Number Three. </i>The result? People liked it. It was well received.<br/></p>

<p>The second version is what I'd like to call the behemoth version; a Three Act play with an approximate run time of 120 minutes. Same story, same two characters but with an additional character and a much bigger (perhaps too big) theme. I titled it <i>Walking Lovers. </i><br/></p>

<p>To say people didn't like it would be an understatement. And I don't blame them.

Attracting the participants and an audience who wants to see their work is always a challenge. By the nature of the work, when we begin our journey in October, we often have no idea about how it is going to turn out by the performance in early July. This of course is the same for all theatre that is produced, but most productions start off with a script and a director's vision for that piece. We start off with just  a group of young people, a writer, a director and a theme. Where it will go is anyone's guess but we always impress upon the group that they must trust the process and magical things will happen! As Goethe said <b>""Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it now"".</b> That is what we must do at the beginning  of each Characters Stage Company  project. We know that if we trust , great things will happen! Getting in the final money that we need is one of the challenges that I, as producer faces each year  as we approach the end phase of our project. But I trust that the right people will  come  forward and help us and each year I am amazed not only by the generosity of individuals, but also by the faith of the community's local businesses in rallying round to provide the wonderful ""Perks' that we offer on each project.See our Perks page and get involved!</p>

You can use the Indegogo share Tools to do this- we are so grateful for anything anyone can do to help us.

By the nature of the work, when we begin our journey in October, we often have no idea about how it is going to turn out by the performance in early July. This of course is the same for all theatre that is produced, but most productions start off with a script and a director's vision for that piece. We start off with just  a group of young people, a writer, a director and a theme. Where it will go is anyone's guess but we always impress upon the group that they must trust the process and magical things will happen! As Goethe said ""Whatever you can do, or dream you can do, begin it now"". That is what we must do at the beginning  of each Characters Stage Company  project. We know that if we trust , great things will happen! Getting in the final money that we need is one of the challenges that I, as producer faces each year  as we approach the end phase of our project. But I trust that the right people will  come  forward and help us and each year I am amazed not only by the generosity of individuals, but also by the faith of the community's local businesses in rallying round to provide the wonderful ""Perks' that we offer on each project.See our Perks page and get involved!

“Matters
of Facts” is a dance performance and discussion event that combines movement
with images, video, interviews and interactive animation to depict prisoner of
war camps that existed throughout the United States during World War II. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">This project intends to be
more than a performance – it is a multimedia dance experience. It will move audiences to do more than merely observe, immersing them in Camp Aliceville and engaging them to walk around and through the performance space as the dancers move. The work teaches, entertains and challenges modern day audiences to confront the present in light of a little-known piece of America’s past.</span>

</div><p>The most compelling part of this history is that very few living Americans are aware that these prisoner of war camps existed on the homefront, despite the large impact they had on the surrounding communities. While quality of life for prisoners was held to a standard by Geneva Convention law, treatment within the United States exceeded that level. Captured soldiers described the camps fondly; it was a place where they were free to study, play sports, create music and theater clubs, and eat decent food. Small communities surrounding the POW camps experienced an economic boom. Civilians went to work inside the camps and prisoners worked on farms alongside American citizens, earning respectable wages from the American government. While the American Red Cross provided the POWs with money and excesses of food, American families faced war-time rations. Americans were confused about how to view the captured living in such close proximity. The German soldiers appeared to be likable members of society but they represented the enemy. In light of current debates about Guantanamo Bay and treatment of enemy soldiers, this history is especially relevant today. “Matters of Facts” presents all facets of this history through dance, sound, and projection to open up a middle ground where discussion can take place.</p><p>Through immersive dance, ""Matters of Facts"" beings a conversation about how we interpret our past. Our community is bombarded with highly opinionated news blurbs all day long, with little room for face to face discussion and conversation. We scroll through Facebook and Twitter news feeds, commenting virtually and superficially. “Matters of Facts” is an hour-long work that immerses the audience in one historical topic in order to open up a conversation with broad implications for our modern community.  How are we manipulated by what government and media choose to make public? Is it a problem when historical bias influences education? How should we pass down our current present for future generations? 
The work does not set out
to answer these questions but, rather, promote discussion by providing
information in an immersive, experiential and visceral way. After experiencing this performance, audience members are invited to a post-performance discussion session with the choreographer, dancers and composer to talk about their reactions. <br/><br/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why we need your help!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469479919/Adelante20160122_1U5A8112-_ZF-4866-22646-1-007_idau13.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;width: 348px;height: 435px;background-color: initial;""/>
</h3>""Matters of Facts"" requires upwards of 150 hours of rehearsal and preparation from dancers and choreographers, a brand new score, and work with interactive body-mapping technology. The work has been developing since December 2015 and, for the final, evening length production, we are working with emerging mediums and structures in order to find new and more meaningful ways to connect to audiences. After last May's successful production of ""[re]CLAIM"", NDC understands the challenges that arise when producing new work. We are excited to take on those challenges again, in a new state, with new collaborators and a new audience.

Little

<p>When a dragon moves into the well, crisis ensues as work grinds to a
halt. Will Orphan Jack kill the dragon to save the day? If he does, he’ll marry
the Princess and live an easy life. That is if he isn’t killed trying - or
tossed into the moat for not trying. <br/></p>
<p>Crisis demands action, and Orphan Jack rises
to the occasion – only to find he prefers the company of the dragon over that
of royalty. With drama, comedy, song, dance, magic, and plenty of surprises, this new
musical brings to life a heart-warming story for kids of all ages. <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hi. I’m Janie Downey Maxwell, author of the historical
fiction novel <i>Gunny Malone</i>, and the play, <i>The Mysterious Case of the Missing
Ring</i>. Last September, I was minding my own business –working on research
for the sequel to <i>Gunny Malone</i> in the morning, doing my corporate job during
the day, and performing on stage in local community theaters at night – when
this dragon, Kiran, descended on me, insisting I write his story – AND that it
had to be a musical. </p>
<p>I tried to ignore him, but have you
ever wrestled with a dragon? They’re tricky! And stubborn. Kiran wants stage
time to tell his story, to show how we can change the world with a little more
love, a little less judgment, and a LOT less stuff. Feeling that strange pull of the Universe, I left my corporate job at the end of
December and am committed to getting this Dragon off my back and onto the stage. <br/></p>
<p>Production of this piece will create:</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Great ensemble theater done on a simple set.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>Original song and dance numbers in a mix of styles – show tunes,
blues, ballads, disco, pop, tangos, and more.</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>A cast of funny, interesting
characters with great lines anyone would be proud to be part of, with an even mix of male and female characters, young and old. <br/></p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>A musical with a universal message about the power of being kind and
helping with an open heart.</p>
<p>So here’s where I need your help: I
want to enter <i>The Dragon's Well</i> in the 2016 <a href=""http://www.nymf.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New York Music Theater Festival</a> (NYMF). Getting into the NYMF is an incredible
opportunity to stage a full production off-Broadway. Several recent shows have moved right from the NYMF to Broadway - so while a wild dream, the NYMF is a great venue to get new work exposed to NYC audiences. And who knows where it goes from there!</p>
<p>I am also going to submit The Dragon's Well for a <a href=""http://www.artsandletters.org/awards2_rodgers.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Richard Rogers Award</a>. This will help pay to get the show produced off-Broadway as part of the NYMF. </p>
<p>Both submissions are due in early November.</p>
<p>To get <i>The Dragon's Well</i> ready, I wrote a shortened
version of the show which we performed this past June at PortFringe here in Portland,
Maine. This helped knock the rough edges off the book, and gave me the opportunity to work out three original songs. </p>
<p>Now the BIG work starts - editing the script, honing the script and lyrics, and finishing the score. To submit <i>The Dragon's Well</i> to the NYMF, I need
an outstanding script - along with 75% of the score recorded. Your contribution to this campaign will help get the book perfect, and will give us
the financing we need to get the score fleshed out, orchestrated, and recorded. </p>
<p>Getting a musical on its feet is a
huge endeavor and I’m up for it. I’m an excellent writer and business woman,
being both creative and organized. I love the big picture and I sweat the details. I have excellent help here in Portland to finish the score . And the
Universe even sent me an editor/lyricist from NYC to help edit the book! Awesome.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that I have crazy
love for this project and it’s going to be a great show. Check out the
contribution awards to the right. And please don’t hesitate to contact me with
any questions. With your help, this show will have a
fairytale ending.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>I am looking to raise $12,000 to get
The Dragon's Well up and running. Your help with funding will help get the script finalized, and the score completed and recorded.</p>
<p>Anything we raise will help keep this show moving along. The more we raise, the better the quality of the  final recording we submit to the Festival.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>The first show I was ever in was a
Christmas pageant when I was five. I remember the feeling of walking in costume through
a packed audience to the small stage, feeling the energy around me, and knowing that
I would do that walk again and again in my life. And I have. I’ve performed in and
have helped produce dozens of shows. Each time the lights dim, the music
starts, the curtains open, and the energy in the room rises, I am carried away by the magic of live theater.</p>
<p>Writing for the theater is a small way
of giving back to an art that is so important to me and to so many others I
know and love. Your support will help get a new story onto the stage for actors, crew, production artists - and audiences.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Getting a show written, recorded, and
produced is no small thing. I am working with a strong team of individuals here
in Maine and in New York who will do an outstanding job of this. It’s possible
that <i>The Dragon's Well</i> will not get into the NYMF or win a Richard Rogers award - and that’s okay too. We’ll
still get this show produced and published so that acting troops
around the world can perform it. It would just be nice to start on Broadway... :)</p>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I'd love it if you can help with funding for this show. AND if you can't contribute, I hope you'll help spread the word through emails and social media. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Sending great dragon love your way.<br/></p>

<h2> On April 3rd Gregory Dolbashian's DASH Ensemble will premiere its newest evening length production, DASHOW at The DiMenna Center and we need YOUR help to bring DASHOW to life!</h2>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Help The DASH continue to perform and develop DASHOW</h3>
<p>Over the course of the last year, Gregory Dolbashian and The DASH Ensemble is creating and developing DASHOW and now its ready to roll out to audiences all over New York and abroad, but we need your support in order to keep performing this exciting work.<br/></p>
<h1></h1>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div>
<h2>A bit more about DASHOW. . .</h2>
<p>Created by Gregory Dolbashian in collaboration with The DASH Ensemble, DASHOW integrates  dance, theater, narrative, and a touch of humour wrapped into a story focusing on the excitement and the fears of growing up. DASHOW first came from a small solo series Dolbasian created called Akward Magic, which was a series of personal stories and scenes from Dolbashian's life. <br/></p>
<p>Engaging all 7 members of The DASH including himself, DASHOW expands on these personal stories bringing its audience into a world of fearlessness and at the same time deep vulnerability. Dolbashian's work has been called ""fluid and inventive"" and his artists have been described simply as ""wonderful"" both by The New York Times. Employing highly crafted languages both in their movement and in their theatricality, DASHOW brings out a vast range within each cast member. We see them shift between the identities of dancer, actor, poet,  performer, and just simply human. </p>

<br/><h2>DASHOW Must Go On. . . </h2>
<p>To continue to self-produce DASHOW throughout New York and abroad is a big undertaking! The show consists of 11 members including our cast, our production team made up of our lighting, sound, and costume crew. We build everything ourselves. We take over spaces that are suitable for DASHOW but may be outside of the traditional dance venues and build out the entire production. Lighting, sound, even our own floor is supplied through our efforts in rentals, favors, and friends in the right places. We continue to fund everything on our own as a company. This campaign is the first step to evolving beyond that model. Our goal is to continue to bring DASHOW to various venues in NYC and abroad <br/></p>
<p>In addition to this premiere date, a version of DASHOW will also be happening at SummerStage in Central Park in July and also again in September in a brand new dance series called Dance Crawl!</p>
<p>All contributions received through Indiegogo will go directly to the costs of executing and performing DASHOW. Your contributions help fund the theater rental, the rental of all of our lighting and sound equipment, all of our promotion material, and to costs of our wardrobe. By contributing you will be helping The DASH Ensemble consistently bring this great work to life and possibly even be the one who steals DASHOW!<br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Campaign
MascallDance, a Vancouver, British Columbia dance organization, supporting the work of Artistic Director Jennifer Mascall, provides a forum for research, creation, performance, education and documentation of contemporary dance in combination with related disciplines. 
MascallDance is  remounting The Three Cornered Hat - A profoundly powerful study of movement, space and human interaction choreographed by Jennifer Mascall featuring the diverse talents of contemporary dancers - Lara Barclay, Amber Funk Barton, Dario Dinuzzi, Billy Marchenski, Darcy McMurray and Chris Wright. The piece was well received in it's premiere. As stated by the Alexander Varty, The Georgia Straight: ""The Three Cornered Hat is hilarious, uncanny and conceptually stimulating, but it's also a sensory delight.""  
We are asking for funds to costume our incredible dancers to ensure the work is enjoyed by audiences of all ages and maintain the safety of the dancers. 
To view a short clip of the Three Cornered Hat's last showing at Dancing on the Edge 2014 see below.

   Where will your money go?
We need $2000.00 dollars to costume our dancers for our upcoming show. All funds will be going directly towards costuming our Dancers. As Amber said. 

$10 Could buy some socks
$50 Could buy a shirt
$100 could buy some pants

<h3><span style=""line-height: 26px;"">IL PROGETTO</span></h3>
</div>
<p></p><p>Nel 2014 lo spettacolo <b>Cyrano dans la Lune</b> ha debuttato a Torino e nello stesso anno la Compagnia Villari-Deluca ha organizzato la sua prima tournée teatrale indipendente. Ora il progetto preme per raggiungere nuovi orizzonti, per superare i suoi limiti e per arrivare dove pochi hanno messo piede. Per crescere ed essere distribuito in modo capillare, raggiungendo anche la tua città, necessita di una<b> produzione teatrale permanente</b>. Ad alimentare questo viaggio sarà la complicità, il supporto e l’aiuto di tutti coloro che vorranno <b>sostenere la prossima tournée,</b> <b>diventando assieme a noi co-produttori del progetto.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sono circa 400.000 i km che ci separano dalla Luna. Il tragitto è lungo, ma più piacevole se fatto in compagnia. Noi abbiamo riempito i serbatoi per coprire i primi 75.000 km, ora contiamo su di voi. Prendiamo posizione e prepariamoci al decollo per partire assieme in questa nuova impresa: il conto alla rovescia è iniziato.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>

<p>Una Luna, un marchingegno a rotelle, una valigia, una spada, due attori-clown (un poco attori e un poco clown) ed una storia. Quella di Cyrano de Bergerac: in questo caso ""osservata"" attraverso il personalissimo sguardo dei due protagonisti. Una storia che ha l'urgenza di essere raccontata, ancora oggi. Attraverso continui cambi di registro, lo spettacolo scivola dalla prosa al gioco clown, dalla parodia al melodramma e ben presto la narrazione sposta il piano del racconto sulla figura di Hercule Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac: l'uomo che ispirò la popolare opera di Edmond Rostand. Un uomo realmente esistito e non un personaggio di fantasia come spesso si crede, con una storia affascinante tutta da scoprire. Uno spirito libero ed un coraggioso, capace di raggiungere (primo tra tutti) la Luna.</p>

<p></p><br/></div>","IL PROGETTO

Nel 2014 lo spettacolo Cyrano dans la Lune ha debuttato a Torino e nello stesso anno la Compagnia Villari-Deluca ha organizzato la sua prima tournée teatrale indipendente. Ora il progetto preme per raggiungere nuovi orizzonti, per superare i suoi limiti e per arrivare dove pochi hanno messo piede. Per crescere ed essere distribuito in modo capillare, raggiungendo anche la tua città, necessita di una produzione teatrale permanente. Ad alimentare questo viaggio sarà la complicità, il supporto e l’aiuto di tutti coloro che vorranno sostenere la prossima tournée, diventando assieme a noi co-produttori del progetto.

Sono circa 400.000 i km che ci separano dalla Luna. Il tragitto è lungo, ma più piacevole se fatto in compagnia. Noi abbiamo riempito i serbatoi per coprire i primi 75.000 km, ora contiamo su di voi. Prendiamo posizione e prepariamoci al decollo per partire assieme in questa nuova impresa: il conto alla rovescia è iniziato.
IL NOSTRO OBIETTIVO
Ci piace fare le cose con poco, ma così è veramente troppo poco!
Chiediamo la tua collaborazione e partecipazione per coprire i costi necessari a mettere in piedi una produzione teatrale che ci permetta di far evolvere lo spettacolo e gestire al meglio la prossima tournée teatrale. Saremo pretenziosi, ambiziosi o forse solo un poco folli…ma basta una piccola quota di complicità versata da ciascuno, e potremo mettere piede insieme sulla superficie lunare come già fece Cyrano.
Ogni 10 euro donati percorreremo 500 km.

Perché diventerai un nostro alleato, compagno di viaggio e co-produttore.

Perché siamo per un Teatro capace di riconquistare il proprio “ruolo” nella società, consapevoli che fare arte e cultura significhi contribuire a migliorarci come uomini verso un’elevazione della coscienza collettiva.


Perché il “fare comune” è un’alternativa concreta per sottrarre le nostre vite agli effetti di un settore culturale in crisi.

Lo spettacolo

CYRANO DANS LA LUNE - Storia di un naso che voleva arrivare sulla Luna



di e con: Daniele Villari e Max Deluca


regia: Daniele Villari


disegno luci: Luca Carbone


riprese e montaggio: Patrizio Saccò 


musiche originali dal vivo: Max Deluca


co-produzione dal basso: Compagnia Villari-Deluca e nº Guasconauti


Una Luna, un marchingegno a rotelle, una valigia, una spada, due attori-clown (un poco attori e un poco clown) ed una storia. Quella di Cyrano de Bergerac: in questo caso ""osservata"" attraverso il personalissimo sguardo dei due protagonisti. Una storia che ha l'urgenza di essere raccontata, ancora oggi. Attraverso continui cambi di registro, lo spettacolo scivola dalla prosa al gioco clown, dalla parodia al melodramma e ben presto la narrazione sposta il piano del racconto sulla figura di Hercule Savinien Cyrano de Bergerac: l'uomo che ispirò la popolare opera di Edmond Rostand. Un uomo realmente esistito e non un personaggio di fantasia come spesso si crede, con una storia affascinante tutta da scoprire. Uno spirito libero ed un coraggioso, capace di raggiungere (primo tra tutti) la Luna.

<p>Fast forward 20 years. Kids are grown and doing great. I've been performing OH MY GODDESS!

The People - 
The playwright is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse (CSA). Kammeran Giggers chose All the Beautiful Things after a child disclosed their abuse to her. Together they collaborated to bring this story to life. 

               





You will laugh. You will cry. You will fall in love with this tender story that punches you in the gut. 


The Play - Two kids meet one Sunday afternoon under the sanctuary of an old tree in the middle of a creek bed. Bit-Bit, the older city girl, and Man, the younger silly country boy, bicker and sass each other but eventually bond and form a friendship over their shared family secrets. Summers and Sundays pass and as they get older they gain strength from each other's company.


Parallel to their own friendship is the longer lasting one of Bit-Bit’s grandmother, Ida, and her best friend Teetsy.  As Bit-Bit and Man meet by their tree, Ida and Teetsy sit on a porch and avoid their own issues. Instead the two older women focus their talk on canning peaches, childhood, and daily lives. Neither speaks directly about their struggles.  


All come to a head as truth collides with family history, sparked by tragedy.
This play explores the cycle of sexual abuse in a family, the tendency to keep silent and look the other way, and the strength in speaking up and sparking a change.

can breakthrough. With your contribution we can reach farther, shout

Affording all of us a greater understanding of some of those awkward silences in some family records.  Ms. Jones is a crafted and skilled voice; please consider supporting All the Beautiful Things, and allow the four wonderful creatures residing within to have full-throated voices and existence.
Laurence
Ballard  Professor

""ALL THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS” by Masha T. Jones delivers a powerful theatrical journey, from sweet childhood moments to searing emotional confrontations. With her SCAD MFA thesis show, Kammeran Giggers has taken on a role that showcases her strength, sense of humor, and versatility as a performer. I can't wait to see the results, from this incredibly talented group of collaborators."" -Playwright and SCAD Performing Arts Professor Kate WalatI had the great honor of hosting a reading of Masha T. Jones’ play, All the Beautiful Things, at Savannah State University. All participants were deeply moved and eagerly anticipate its production. During the discussion afterward, the words “powerful”, “important,” and “true,” were used to describe what was heard. I believe Ms. Jones’ play to be a work of art, that should be supported, not only because of it’s important message; but also because of it’s heartbreakingly, beautiful language.Renee Bishop Savannah State University Executive Producer/Writer HBO, CBS, NBC and The History Channel

</h3>
<div>We always knew it would come... The expansion of <i>Melonlight School of Ballroom Dance &amp; Yoga</i> into an elegant and versatile theater. We've found the perfect venue for our professional ensemble to create and perform our original, unique, and edgy shows. The thing about being in the <i>Melonlight</i> is... you need light. But hold that thought, and let me tell you a little bit about:</div>
<h4>Where We Came From</h4>
<ul>
<li>Little high school love birds, Raymond and Emma <i>(that's me)</i>, dreamt up <i>Melonlight</i> about fifteen years ago. We've worked hard since then to develop our craft as dancers, choreographers, writers, artists, teachers, and of course entrepreneurs!</li> <li>Our school offers a full schedule of dance and yoga to students of all ages. We've been profoundly affected and honored by the positive impact our classes and performances have had on our community. Thanks Melonheads. </li>
<li>Within our professional ensemble our creativity runs wild! We produce shows of ever-changing genres with an intentional blending of dance, theater, story, powerful lighting, and delicate timing. We intend to invoke a certain kind of audience reaction; you'll have to let us know if we've succeeded ;)</li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 24px;"">Where We're Going</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To a bigger space in historic </span>downtown<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Eureka Springs, Arkansas where we can teach and entertain locals and tourists alike.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">To the stars! A big empty room with beautiful hardwood floors and a high tin pressed ceiling is like a giant, blank white canvas to an </span>ensemble<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of dancers and dreamers. The sky is the limit! </span>
</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <p>So, about those stars we need...<br/></p>
<h3>Elements of Theatrical Magic</h3> <p>We're really lucky that our new venue is already well equipped for teaching dance and yoga. What's lacking are the elements of theatrical magic <i>(aka our stars)</i>: lighting, curtains, behind the scenes equipment, and technical software. A grand total of $12,000 will give us all the funding needed to create a customizable venue that can morph to meet the needs of each unique show or event. From ballroom, to thrust stage, to proscenium, to theater in the round; the creative design work we do now will support our shows for years to come, so it's important that we do it right. Funds from this campaign will pay for:</p>
<ul> <li>Theatrical lighting, rigging equipment, and technical design software</li>
<li>A projector and screen to support the photo and video aspects of our shows</li>
<li>A fresh coat of paint to reflect our beautiful new LEDs</li>
<li>Frames with castors to be built for our mirrors and chalk boards</li>
<li>Curtains for backstage and wings</li>
<li>A jumpstart on our first show for the new theater, <i>I Dreamt of Tango,</i> to cover costuming, set, props, etc</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><i>I Dreamt of Tango</i></h3> <p>Our new show is a dream, and you are the dreamer. Move back in time and step into the river of tango; a connected flow of energy, passion and story; a journey through a surreal world where your pounding heartbeat seduces you with inquiry... what does it mean to be authentic? Take our word, philosophy has never been so sexy. Experience the sensory world of tango, and come alive in our new theater this June at the premiere of <i>I Dreamt of Tango.</i></p> </div> <div> <h3>Testimonials</h3> <p> Our shows and classes have been well loved by our communities in both Denver and Eureka Springs. Here are some kind words from our fans <i>(we call them Melonheads).</i></p> <ul> <li>""<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">With endless energy, creativity, humor, and patience, Emma and Ray share their art, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">sprinkling fairy dust on anyone wishing to partake. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In a community blessed with talent and diversity, Melonlight sparkles!"" -Alicia</span></span>

</li>
</ul>
<ul><li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I hadn't danced for years (except alone in my living room) and I was so delighted to discover Melonlight. My son, daughter, and I soon became Melonheads and I always left the studio feeling refreshed down to my bones. Melonlight offers not just a fun outlet and alternative to traditional exercise but nourishment for your soul. Ray and Emma are two of the kindest souls I've ever met. They give so much of themselves to their art and their students. Their enthusiasm and love of each other and of life in general are contagious.

We've worked hard since then to develop our craft as dancers, choreographers, writers, artists, teachers, and of course entrepreneurs! Our school offers a full schedule of dance and yoga to students of all ages. We've been profoundly affected and honored by the positive impact our classes and performances have had on our community. Thanks Melonheads. 
Within our professional ensemble our creativity runs wild! We produce shows of ever-changing genres with an intentional blending of dance, theater, story, powerful lighting, and delicate timing. We intend to invoke a certain kind of audience reaction; you'll have to let us know if we've succeeded ;)  Where We're Going





To a bigger space in historic downtown Eureka Springs, Arkansas where we can teach and entertain locals and tourists alike.


To the stars! A big empty room with beautiful hardwood floors and a high tin pressed ceiling is like a giant, blank white canvas to an ensemble of dancers and dreamers. The sky is the limit! 

   So, about those stars we need...
Elements of Theatrical Magic We're really lucky that our new venue is already well equipped for teaching dance and yoga. What's lacking are the elements of theatrical magic (aka our stars): lighting, curtains, behind the scenes equipment, and technical software. A grand total of $12,000 will give us all the funding needed to create a customizable venue that can morph to meet the needs of each unique show or event. From ballroom, to thrust stage, to proscenium, to theater in the round; the creative design work we do now will support our shows for years to come, so it's important that we do it right. Funds from this campaign will pay for:
 Theatrical lighting, rigging equipment, and technical design software
A projector and screen to support the photo and video aspects of our shows
A fresh coat of paint to reflect our beautiful new LEDs
Frames with castors to be built for our mirrors and chalk boards
Curtains for backstage and wings
A jumpstart on our first show for the new theater, I Dreamt of Tango, to cover costuming, set, props, etc    I Dreamt of Tango Our new show is a dream, and you are the dreamer. Move back in time and step into the river of tango; a connected flow of energy, passion and story; a journey through a surreal world where your pounding heartbeat seduces you with inquiry... what does it mean to be authentic? Take our word, philosophy has never been so sexy. Experience the sensory world of tango, and come alive in our new theater this June at the premiere of I Dreamt of Tango.   Testimonials  Our shows and classes have been well loved by our communities in both Denver and Eureka Springs. Here are some kind words from our fans (we call them Melonheads).  ""With endless energy, creativity, humor, and patience, Emma and Ray share their art, sprinkling fairy dust on anyone wishing to partake. In a community blessed with talent and diversity, Melonlight sparkles!"" -Alicia



""Ray and Emma are consummate professionals. They are also two of the kindest people I know which makes them incredible teachers. I fell in love with Emma's yoga class from the minute I walked in. The clean, warm, studio was filled with beautiful music, light incense wafted in the air and Emma's skill, demeanor and beautiful flow kept me coming back week after week. Professional, knowledgeable, prepared and FUN!!!"" -Carrie


I hadn't danced for years (except alone in my living room) and I was so delighted to discover Melonlight. My son, daughter, and I soon became Melonheads and I always left the studio feeling refreshed down to my bones. Melonlight offers not just a fun outlet and alternative to traditional exercise but nourishment for your soul. Ray and Emma are two of the kindest souls I've ever met. They give so much of themselves to their art and their students. Their enthusiasm and love of each other and of life in general are contagious. I thank God that He created these two special souls and delivered them to our little community."" -Nicole
    Give & Receive 
This is where we say please. Pretty please. Pretty please with a watermelon slice on top. While we may not be rich in money, we are rich in love, passion, creativity, motivation, hard work, and community. We do this work because it feeds us happiness, joy, and inspiration. And as teachers and performers, we share what we eat; so happiness, joy, and inspiration is what we intend to give back again and again, plus some thoughtful thanks, awesome Melonlight gear, show tickets, classes, and more! So please donate to our new theater and show. And if you can't donate then step outside and shout it from the rooftops, and Facebook, and Instagram, and Indiegogo's forum: ""Melonlight needs your help to keep on going and growing!""With love and creation at the root of every action, we say thank you!                                               Emma, Raymond, Maggie, Caia & Jerry",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Charles Curtis, writer and director of the play
called “Strings”. I wrote this piece at a time where the
value of a life of a man of color was worthless. Seeing so many of our
black and brown men gunned down stirred something in me. That thing said write.
I’m often asked why I wrote this play. I wrote this piece to give voice to the scores of men of color gunned
down in the street. Young men like Trayvon, Tamir, Akai and others with so
much to live for, and so much left to do. Like me, others have been stirred to
stand up for their sons, their fathers, their brothers and uncles. That is what
“Strings” is about. “Strings” is about a modern day vigilante, a lawyer with an
ulterior motive, and the strings that bind them both.</p>

Presented along side this work will be two more original works by Uarts Dance Seniors! I sincerely hope you can come and enjoy all of the performance.
What We Need & What You Get
For this performance to have the most impact there are a few aspects that are critical to the presentation.  1) Having multiple perspectives informing the work.2)Ample time in the studio3) Proper costuming and props to develop images and relate to the audience.We have tried our best to cover the first two aspects.  This has shown through our committed and diverse cast, and the assistance of new people in rehearsals helping us shape and present our images.  We are asking you to help us fund these extensive, but crucial costumes and props.Each collaborator's costume will cost between 50-100 dollars.  We are buying materials, props, makeup, face prosthetics and paying for a seamstress to help us make and design each character's individual costume.I also believe that it is extremely important to pay artists for their time and dedication.  Any additional money will go to the collaborators for over a year's worth of rehearsal and research.  Finally the location is in Kensington and requires money for travel to get to and from the site.  We are hoping to have enough money to pay for the audience's travel from Center City to Kensington so the work is accessible to as many people as possible.So, rounding out the numbers...Costumes: $100x7=700Travel: $350 (4.50 per audience member + gas and tokens for each rehearsal for                                  the cast)Pay: $50x9=450=$1500For your donation you can receive various perks :)Each donation of $20 or more will receive a handwritten thank you card.Each donation of $100 or more will have the opportunity to attend one rehearsal and become a part of the process! The Impact
We are hoping to shift our audience's perspective and really get people thinking about how and why our society is controlled by these various forms of imperialism.  If we can get people thinking and learning about these harmful infrastructures, then maybe we can start to do something about them.

</p><p>Året
er 1942. Teatersjef Henry Gleditsch skulle spille Doktor Relling i
Villanden på Trøndelag Teater. I stedet fikk han en rolle i NS
Fylkesfører Henrik Rogstads maktspill, som gav et helt annet utfall.
I stedet for sitrende premierenerver, et premierekledd publikum,
applaus, blomster og premierefest, ble Henry Gleditsch sammen med syv
andre menn fraktet med bil til Falstad fangeleir i Ekne ved Levanger.
En konsentrasjonsleir. En dødsleir. 
</p>
<p>I
stedet for å avslutte forestillingen med sceneteppets fall, ble det
avsluttet med en skuddsalve. To mot hodet og tre mot hjertet, i
grålysningen, i Falstadskogen. Det ble altså ingen premiere på
Villanden kvelden tirsdag 6. oktober 1942. Hvordan kunne en mann uten
våpen være en så stor fare at de valgte å henrette akkurat han? 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Som
teaterkunstnere og samfunnsengasjerte har det blitt vår livsoppgave
å fortelle historien til ensemblet ved Trøndelag teater med
teatersjef Gleditsch i spissen. Den kommende teaterforestillingen <i>En
utmerket gærning </i>er i
skjæringspunktet mellom teaterkunsten og samfunnsengasjementet.
Inspirert av den verden vi lever i, går vi tilbake i historien og
feirer triumf av menneskelig samhold, medmenneskelighet og tro i møte

<p><i>En

bånd blir testet i møter med NS og fylkesfører Rogstad. Hva var de
villige til å ofre for det de trodde på? Deres reise tar dem fra
etableringen av et fast teater i Trondheim til et teater underlagt
strenge sensurlover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Med
hjelp fra Birger Straume (eneste gjenlevende) og etterkommere fra

that the mood will be magical. Spring is approaching and all the
stories in the walls will contribute to give the show an additional
historical and mystical touch.

The
contributions here will be used to defrey some of the costs of the
Falstad production. If and when the production earns profits, it will
be used to develope the play and the story so it can further be
played at schools, events, festivals and theatres. The higher the
amount crowdfounded, the higher the percentage of profit will be
spent, so that the story can live on and the memories persist.

In
the middle of the forest in Ekne nearby Levanger, the Falstad Centre
promote an understanding of what took place during WWII. It was here
that Julius Paltiel picked up leaves with his mouth, crawling on his
knees along with the other jews. It was here that female prisoners
knitted Selbu mittens of sewing thread to make the time pass. It was
here that Henry Gleditsch translated the German death sentence to the
other nine chosen.


The
Falstad Centre, An Excellent Madman, and we have the same mission: To
tell stories that educate and ensure that we never forget and never
repeat, but maintain compassion, freedom of speech and democracy. By
donating today, you will help us make this project come to life.

The
power of one


Small
things can have great impact. As the saying goes, ""A mountain
can be moved, stone by stone."" While no contribution is too
large, neither is any too small. Indeed, a single dollar is a
meaningful gift when we give together for a common purpose.


Art,
in any form, has the power to transform minds and hearts, and creates
the possibility to cease injustice caused by fear and prejudice.
Everyone who contributes, regardless of amount, will have their name
added to our virtual ""wall of fame"" on the project´s
website.


If
a contribution is not possible at this moment, your voice is still
valuable. Take a minute to share this campaign with your friends
using social media, and show them that stories like this continues to
matter.


Your
participation produces a theater play, creates an endowment for the
Falstad Centre, and brings us together as voices for justice and
solidarity. It is the best of all possible worlds, a legacy you help
us pass on. This torch we have carried, we will now pass it to all of
you.

We
hope this will inspire you to support and share this campaign.
Together we can do this.

From
the bottom of our hearts - thank you.

One way was to rent a billboard with their face on it, and the other was to host an evening where the audience would pay to see that person sing songs and tell of their life’s adversities, fears, and personal triumphs. Both ways were often considered egotistical acts, which people grew tired of seeing… often as they were currently seeing it. </p><p><strong><a href=""https://www.ambushcabaret.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AMBUSH CABARET</a> <i>is a new way of sharing unique stories of cherished members of our community, in a way that not only celebrates people, through music, comedy, and storytelling, but also does it in a way that everyone universally gives perpetual consent to</i></strong><i>.</i> In this way, we uplift and support performing artists by sharing their innately human and relatable stories without the veil of pretense, which creates a sense of community with the audience. Plus, it’s hilariously entertaining, unexpected, and heartfelt. </p><p>What’s not to love? There’s an element of danger watching someone perform their life story, in front of an audience, without any prior rehearsal. Literally anything could happen, and you are guaranteed to see authentic in-the-moment reactions. </p><p>Our aim for this campaign is to <u>ask for an investment of funds to ensure this very necessary form of live entertainment can have a healthy head start</u>. We have proven our concept by performing two live shows for five Ambushees for completely full houses, and these successes were done with no other resources but sweat equity. </p><p>With your contributions, we intend to, not only<u> increase our production value which gives patrons a more fulfilling experience, but also equitably compensate our beloved cast and crew who tirelessly contribute their time and efforts in bringing each show to life. </u></p><p>Having a good head start can help us look towards the future of our show. Aside from the show we have to think about maintaining upkeep costs, the expansion of our brand of entertainment into other mediums, as well as providing a possible growth into education and community outreach. The aim is not only fortitude, but growth. </p><p>So please join us in building a strong, supportive, and extremely rewarding show which strives to <u>enhance, entertain, and enrich</u>, not only the live entertainment community, but a larger community who strives to love, laugh, and gain a better, more intimate understanding of the human condition. </p><p><strong>IN SHORT....</strong></p><p>I'm <a href=""https://www.ambushcabaret.com/acbios"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael Cavinder</a>, Creator and Artistic Director of <a href=""https://www.ambushcabaret.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ambush Cabaret</a>. Thank you for taking the time to read more about our endeavor. I’ve been a contributor and creator of theater for nearly 25 years working as an actor, director, writer, and now producer. Ambush Cabaret was conceived in 2019 during a conversation about expression of a performer's personal story and how it is nearly impossible to write a story about yourself without putting any amount of pretense in it. The only way to eliminate the filters that the artist themselves veils over their story is to omit the artist from the writing process. So that’s exactly what we did! Over the last two years, under the leadership of myself, fellow producer and director Marisa Matthews, and Musical Director Benet Braun, we and a dedicated group of actors and writers developed a show that hilariously uplifts and celebrates an artist in a way that doesn’t focus on what they’ve done to achieve recognition, but rather who they have become in order to achieve. We’ve done this with nothing but our sweat and dedication. Now we turn to you. I promise there is no other show of this nature. If you are intrigued even a little, get in on the ground floor and invest in us. Then come see what you’ve helped to create. It will not disappoint. Thank you. </p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>What we need from you is capital investment to start building a foundation for this company to grow. The quality of our show is directly affected by the quality of the talent it recruits, both on and off stage.

One way was to rent a billboard with their face on it, and the other was to host an evening where the audience would pay to see that person sing songs and tell of their life’s adversities, fears, and personal triumphs. Both ways were often considered egotistical acts, which people grew tired of seeing… often as they were currently seeing it. AMBUSH CABARET is a new way of sharing unique stories of cherished members of our community, in a way that not only celebrates people, through music, comedy, and storytelling, but also does it in a way that everyone universally gives perpetual consent to. In this way, we uplift and support performing artists by sharing their innately human and relatable stories without the veil of pretense, which creates a sense of community with the audience. Plus, it’s hilariously entertaining, unexpected, and heartfelt. What’s not to love? There’s an element of danger watching someone perform their life story, in front of an audience, without any prior rehearsal. Literally anything could happen, and you are guaranteed to see authentic in-the-moment reactions. Our aim for this campaign is to ask for an investment of funds to ensure this very necessary form of live entertainment can have a healthy head start. We have proven our concept by performing two live shows for five Ambushees for completely full houses, and these successes were done with no other resources but sweat equity. With your contributions, we intend to, not only increase our production value which gives patrons a more fulfilling experience, but also equitably compensate our beloved cast and crew who tirelessly contribute their time and efforts in bringing each show to life. Having a good head start can help us look towards the future of our show. Aside from the show we have to think about maintaining upkeep costs, the expansion of our brand of entertainment into other mediums, as well as providing a possible growth into education and community outreach. The aim is not only fortitude, but growth. So please join us in building a strong, supportive, and extremely rewarding show which strives to enhance, entertain, and enrich, not only the live entertainment community, but a larger community who strives to love, laugh, and gain a better, more intimate understanding of the human condition. IN SHORT....I'm Michael Cavinder, Creator and Artistic Director of Ambush Cabaret. Thank you for taking the time to read more about our endeavor. I’ve been a contributor and creator of theater for nearly 25 years working as an actor, director, writer, and now producer. Ambush Cabaret was conceived in 2019 during a conversation about expression of a performer's personal story and how it is nearly impossible to write a story about yourself without putting any amount of pretense in it. The only way to eliminate the filters that the artist themselves veils over their story is to omit the artist from the writing process. So that’s exactly what we did! Over the last two years, under the leadership of myself, fellow producer and director Marisa Matthews, and Musical Director Benet Braun, we and a dedicated group of actors and writers developed a show that hilariously uplifts and celebrates an artist in a way that doesn’t focus on what they’ve done to achieve recognition, but rather who they have become in order to achieve. We’ve done this with nothing but our sweat and dedication. Now we turn to you. I promise there is no other show of this nature. If you are intrigued even a little, get in on the ground floor and invest in us. Then come see what you’ve helped to create. It will not disappoint. Thank you. What We Need & What You GetWhat we need from you is capital investment to start building a foundation for this company to grow. The quality of our show is directly affected by the quality of the talent it recruits, both on and off stage. We start with insightful and intuitive comedic writers, add in our production staff who design and build our lights, props, sound, choreography, costumes, hair and makeup, and then sprinkle in the supporting cast who bring these elements to life by singing, portraying important role models, and literally putting the star in their spotlight.

<h3>Welcome to Raising Cain Productions, a brand new Norfolk-based theatre company, producing its debut play, ""My Other Half"".</h3>
<p>Chris Sainton-Clark wrote and self-published this dark comedy thriller during the UK's first lockdown. Now that vaccinations are starting to be rolled out, and venues will hopefully be opening their doors again soon, Chris has seized the opportunity to independently produce this production using his career experience in stage management, lighting and sound design, simultaneously kickstarting his company and providing opportunities for young local creatives.</p>
<p>With two Norfolk venues, Sheringham Little Theatre and St George's Theatre, Great Yarmouth confirmed to house the play, the next stage is creating this production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>With the bulk of our budget being applied to through the Arts Council UK, we have come to indiegogo to fund the remaining budget. Paid opportunities for young local creatives is of extreme importance to us. Your donations will mean that even if we do not acquire our arts council funding for this project, we can begin to pay intial artistic fees for our creatives in addition to a profit share for them after the show has been produced. If we do not raise our full amount on indiegogo, no matter the amount, those fees will go towards our creatives. If we acquire arts council funding and earn more on our campaign than expected, then these funds will go towards taking this production to the next level and touring it nationwide.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Theatres and independent creatives have been hit incredibly hard by the coronavirus pandemic, especially in rural locations such as Norfolk, where support for venues is much less than bigger cities, with or without considering the pandemic. Now more than ever, it is vital that small productions find their feet and start creating work, to support their development, the development of venues and that of artists who have been struggling to find work in these tough times. Donating to this project will mean helping protect the ability for creative talents to express themselves.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>There are risks to this production in the same way that there are risks to any, especially considering how hard gathering an audience can be at the moment. But Raising Cain Productions is fortunate to be working with venues that offer a large support network. Sheringham Little Theatre and St George's Theatre have a strong audience base that make an effort to support local small-scale theatre. Despite reduced seating size, the few productions that they have put on during the pandemic have been very popular, most notably the lockdown pantomime which was live-streamed to 210,000 school children across the country. Chris Sainton-Clark has been working alongside these productions providing lighting and sound design and operation, lending his hand to all aspects of putting on a production and is confident to bring his own creation to the stage.</p>
<p>Another risk is the production being postponed. Our planned date for the production is in June 2021, but this could easily not be feasible with COVID restrictions. However, our two housing venues have confirmed they want to have this production on stage and postponing it is an option.</p>
<p>If you can't donate to this project, following Raising Cain Productions on social media and sharing their posts will make a huge difference.</p>
<p>You can also purchase the script as an ebook or paperback from amazon here.</p>

Anxiety. Depression. GPAs. SAT/ACT scores. Resumes. And class rank.</p><p>Holmes and Gomes were setting out to write a musical for teenagers about what mattered to them and overwhelmingly the story teenagers wanted told was the succeed-at-all-costs mentality they were enduring in our school system right now. As the conversations continued, Holmes and Gomes started noticing examples of adults sharing (and in many cases, causing) this mentality when it came to academics, and knew this was the direction their project needed to go.</p><p>After a year of discussion with students, writing, workshopping and creating, <i>Ranked, A New Musical</i> debuted at Granite Bay High School on April 4, just twenty-three days after <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/us/college-admissions-cheating-scandal.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Operation Varsity Blues</a> and the college admission scandal became public. The apropos timing landed <i>Ranked</i> in the <a href=""https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/711931714/high-school-musical-explores-themes-from-the-college-admissions-scandal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">national spotlight</a>, and <a href=""https://www.broadwayworld.com/sacramento/article/BWW-Review-RANKED-A-NEW-MUSICAL-Premieres-at-the-Theatre-At-Granite-Bay-20190408"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ultimately earned rave reviews</a> for its storytelling, music, and timeliness for teenagers and their parents alike.</p><p>The story focuses on a group of students trying to navigate a high school system in the not too distant future that values students' class rank above all else.

<li>
<strong>Recording a full cast album of <i>Ranked</i></strong><br/>People have been asking us since the show premiered, ""when can I listen to the music on Spotify/Apple Music?""  Now that we're done making major changes to the script and score, our plan is to get a group of amazingly talented actors and musicians in a recording studio and make that happen. <br/><br/>This album would not only be for your listening pleasure, but would provide us with high quality tracks from <i>Ranked</i> we can use to market and advertise the show to producers, publishers, and of course - new fans!<br/><br/><strong>To get in the studio and have our album mixed, we need $10,000.</strong><br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Take <i>Ranked</i> to New York City</strong><br/>We have a lot of industry friends with a lot of industry contacts, and we want to get all of them in one room to see what <i>Ranked</i> is about. Our plan is to fly the creative team, some actors and some musicians to New York City for a private performance for producers, directors and publishers. <i>Ranked, A New Musical</i> ... on Broadway?<br/><br/>Who knows. But we need to start somewhere! And if they feel as strongly about the show as many of you have, this will be a great opportunity.<br/><br/><strong>For us to buy plane tickets and secure lodging for our creative team, we need $10,000.</strong>
</li>
</ol><p>To record the cast album and take <i>Ranked</i> to New York City for a weekend, we’re asking for a total of $20,000 in contributions. </p><h3>Why This Matters</h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566782084/no2anja0wadxhspafomk.jpg"" src=""""/></i></h3><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i>""The role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible.""  Toni Cade Bambara </i></h3><p>To be blunt, our modern education system is no longer sustainable.</p><p>Academic inflation has led our students to feel that anything less than a bachelor’s degree is failure. As a result, high school has become a GPA arms race – weighted courses give students the opportunity to surpass a 4.0, electives and philanthropy are simply for resumes, and College Prep Coaches provide admissions navigation to the highest bidder.</p><p>Because of this, occupations that don’t require a college degree have become stigmatized and marginalized. Woodshops, auto-shops, and skilled labor training is almost non-existent at public high schools, and “college and career centers” have really digressed into “college prep centers.” The arts have also been adversely affected by this, as students load up on as many academic classes as possible to improve their transcripts, and arts programs have fallen to the wayside.</p><p>In addition to electives, mental health has also taken a toll. Student cases of anxiety, depression and suicide have reached historic highs – all with ties to the pressure and current reality of our secondary schooling system.</p><p>Our universities have reacted to all of this. In the past ten years the average grade point average of admission has gone from a 3.5 to a 4.0. And once students arrive at their college of choice, the cost of housing, tuition and books is enough to bury them in debt (<a href=""https://studentloanhero.com/student-loan-debt-statistics/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Of 2018 graduates, 69% left college with loans. An average of $29,000 in debt</a>). Despite unemployment for recent college graduates matching all-time highs, there are millions of skilled labor vacancies in our country that remain unfilled because there aren’t enough people trained for them.</p><ul>
<li>Historic cuts to electives.</li>
<li>Historic numbers of AP classes.</li>
<li>Historic number of college applicants.</li>
<li>Historic rates of teen depression and suicide.</li>
<li>Historic amounts of student debt.</li>

As the conversations continued, Holmes and Gomes started noticing examples of adults sharing (and in many cases, causing) this mentality when it came to academics, and knew this was the direction their project needed to go.After a year of discussion with students, writing, workshopping and creating, Ranked, A New Musical debuted at Granite Bay High School on April 4, just twenty-three days after Operation Varsity Blues and the college admission scandal became public. The apropos timing landed Ranked in the national spotlight, and ultimately earned rave reviews for its storytelling, music, and timeliness for teenagers and their parents alike.The story focuses on a group of students trying to navigate a high school system in the not too distant future that values students' class rank above all else. Amidst the anxiety and competition, the story's central conflict? A student's parents paying to inflate their class rank - without their knowledge.Holmes and Gomes did not tell the future. They listened.And now we need everyone to listen to what our students are saying.Ranked is a story that needs to be told nationwide.And we need your help to make that happen.What We Need

Recording a full cast album of RankedPeople have been asking us since the show premiered, ""when can I listen to the music on Spotify/Apple Music?""  Now that we're done making major changes to the script and score, our plan is to get a group of amazingly talented actors and musicians in a recording studio and make that happen. This album would not only be for your listening pleasure, but would provide us with high quality tracks from Ranked we can use to market and advertise the show to producers, publishers, and of course - new fans!To get in the studio and have our album mixed, we need $10,000. 

Take Ranked to New York CityWe have a lot of industry friends with a lot of industry contacts, and we want to get all of them in one room to see what Ranked is about. Our plan is to fly the creative team, some actors and some musicians to New York City for a private performance for producers, directors and publishers. Ranked, A New Musical ... on Broadway?Who knows. But we need to start somewhere! And if they feel as strongly about the show as many of you have, this will be a great opportunity.For us to buy plane tickets and secure lodging for our creative team, we need $10,000.

To record the cast album and take Ranked to New York City for a weekend, we’re asking for a total of $20,000 in contributions. Why This Matters""The role of the artist is to make the revolution irresistible.""  Toni Cade Bambara To be blunt, our modern education system is no longer sustainable.Academic inflation has led our students to feel that anything less than a bachelor’s degree is failure. As a result, high school has become a GPA arms race – weighted courses give students the opportunity to surpass a 4.0, electives and philanthropy are simply for resumes, and College Prep Coaches provide admissions navigation to the highest bidder.Because of this, occupations that don’t require a college degree have become stigmatized and marginalized. Woodshops, auto-shops, and skilled labor training is almost non-existent at public high schools, and “college and career centers” have really digressed into “college prep centers.” The arts have also been adversely affected by this, as students load up on as many academic classes as possible to improve their transcripts, and arts programs have fallen to the wayside.In addition to electives, mental health has also taken a toll. Student cases of anxiety, depression and suicide have reached historic highs – all with ties to the pressure and current reality of our secondary schooling system.Our universities have reacted to all of this. In the past ten years the average grade point average of admission has gone from a 3.5 to a 4.0. And once students arrive at their college of choice, the cost of housing, tuition and books is enough to bury them in debt (Of 2018 graduates, 69% left college with loans. An average of $29,000 in debt). Despite unemployment for recent college graduates matching all-time highs, there are millions of skilled labor vacancies in our country that remain unfilled because there aren’t enough people trained for them.
Historic cuts to electives.
Historic numbers of AP classes.
Historic number of college applicants.
Historic rates of teen depression and suicide.
Historic amounts of student debt.
We must make radical changes to our education system to avoid a national, systemic crisis. For our teenagers, that crisis is already here.Ranked, A New Musical challenges audiences to question their own ideas of academic success, how it should be achieved, and what its implications are for a happy life.Ranked In the News

<h3>Hi there! </h3>
<p>We’re Krystina, Callie and Joe, three theatre makers who make work based on our personal experiences of the world, to bring audiences together to shed light on underrepresented stories.</p>
<p>We are raising money to take Krystina’s first full length play, Glitch, a show about Autism, grief, small towns and video games, to VAULT Festival this March. This semi-autobiographical show looks at what it is to be made to be an outsider and the stories we tell about those seen as different, asking- isn’t it past time we let everybody create their own stories?…</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who is Kelly?</h3>
<p>Kelly’s autistic, never left her hometown because of it, and now she’s facing her Dad’s declining health. She’s frustrated, stuck, and looking for a way out - although she doesn’t realise it until it potentially arrives, in the form of a video game speedrunning contest. </p>
<p>“I’m weird. Diagnosably weird. I mean, I don’t actually feel weird, but everyone tells me I am, so I must be?”</p>
<p>As Kelly navigates her grief, she comes to understand what her Dad has been trying to tell her all along. Other people have been writing Kelly’s story, making her a label instead of a person. Maybe it's time for that to change.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why I (Krystina) wrote Glitch?</h3>
<p>Glitch started out as a what-if; I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (a form of autism) as an adult, and I wondered what my life might have looked like if I'd been diagnosed as a child, and how I might have gotten on in the small town in which I grew up. I realised pretty quickly I was equally asking what if I'd never left my hometown; and so Sutward, with all its quirky characters, emerged pretty quickly. Around the same time, I'd become a lot more conscious of how people's perceptions of autism, particularly fuelled by fictional portrayals, differed so much from the reality I knew. I decided to try and change that!</p>
<p>Around the same time, I was experiencing a bereavement. It occurred to me (several months later!) that we don't talk much about the ways in which grief transforms our lives, sometimes for the better as much as for the worse. The two subject areas just became natural bedfellows in my brain from then on; Kelly's default of brutal honesty allowed me to talk honestly about the thing we're all most afraid of, and that will happen to us all.</p>
<p>It ought to be said that while I love video games, I am a terrible gamer and definitely not a speed runner! One thing I always did as a child, and returned to around the time of my diagnosis, was watch other people playing games like Sonic and Mario; turns out YouTube has plenty of this! Through this I discovered speed running; the high-paced, skill-driven yet somewhat solitary nature of it seemed a perfect fit for Kelly. Gaming culture has taken a bit of a hit in recent years; in making Kelly a speed runner, I wanted to celebrate the positive and fun things I'd witnessed about the community. (Meanwhile, I have been playing Breath of the Wild for over a year and am still nowhere close to finishing...)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Journey so far</h3>
<p>Krystina developed Glitch on Soho Theatre Writer's Lab 2018-19, where she found a huge amount of support because of her different point of view, not in spite of it. VAULT Festival will be its debut outing and we’re really looking forward to both getting into the Studio with it, and also to hopefully bring it to wider audiences later in the year.</p>
<p>It's become obvious quite quickly that even though it's explicitly about autism, and grief, those who have read it seem to have found a lot of themselves in it. This has been a delight as ultimately our belief is we're all different, but with more in common than differences, especially when it comes to autism and disability more widely. We’re really looking forward to the conversations people have around the show, and to welcoming as many as possible into a space we're carving out for new audiences.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What next?</h3>
<p>Over the next month we will be finalising a performance draft of the show, designing the staging and technical elements of the show, and entering the rehearsal room. In early March the show will be performed at VAULT Festival in London, providing us with the opportunity to gather reviews, build industry connections, and allow programmers to see the show so it can have a life after these initial performances, hopefully with further performances in London, Nottingham and a run at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How we will use the funds</h3>
<p>The funds raised through this fundraiser will allow us to make sure the show is accessible to as many people as possible. Given the themes of the show, and the story told by the character, it would be unfair for audiences with similar stories to not be able to see this one on stage. </p>
<p>Therefore funds raised would be used to cover the costs of:</p>
<p>- Ear defenders and tinted glasses</p>
<p>- Providing captioning for all performances </p>
<p>- Live streaming the performances</p>
<p>Another important part of access is making sure everyone in the team gets paid properly, so money raised will also go towards making sure the creative team can be paid appropriately for their work and time. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thank you for reading this far and for considering donating to our show!</h3>
<p>If you're not able to donate, but would still like to support us, please share our fundraiser and spread the word about the show</p>

Additionally, 2015’s <i>You’ll Not Feel The Drowning</i> was the recipient of the Custom Made Theatre Company’s New Development Program Workshop in 2017, 2013's <i>Walls Of Troy</i> was a finalist for the Stanley Drama Award, and 2014’s <i>The String’s The Thing</i> was the recipient of the Max K. Lerner Fellowship through Inkwell Theatre. The entire festival won ""Playwriting Series Most Likely to Win a Gold Medal"" from the SF Bay Guardian in 2013. EXIT Press has released a collection of five plays from Year One of the festival, <i>Songs of Hestia</i>, and ten plays from Year Two, <i>Heavenly Bodies</i>, both available for purchase on Amazon.com and at bookstores across the country. Steel Spring Stage Rights has published <i>Ino Leucothea</i> as part of Volume IV of <i>Red Bull Shorts</i>. A monologue from 2018’s <i>Diana</i> was included in The Best Men’s Monologues of 2019 by Smith &amp; Kramer. Find out more at <a href=""http://www.sfolympiansfestival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.sfolympiansfestival.com</a>.</p><p>Since 2010 the festival has featured the work of 125 Writers, 95 Directors, 510 Actors, and 46 Fine Artists!<br/><br/><i>Of her experience at the festival, 2018 writer Libby Emmons wrote:</i><br/>""I was skeptical at first, about writing a play about a goddess, but it has opened doors in my mind, from the research phase through the writing process, in terms of what is possible on stage, what is possible if you take your feet off the ground.""<br/><br/>This year we are excited to debut 38 new plays by 36 writers, 17 of whom will be contributing written work to the festival for the first time! The plays range from shorts to one-acts and full-lengths, and each one explores a different legend or god from the mythology of Ancient Gaul, Britain, Ireland, and the legends of King Arthur. Though exclusively local in the past, the 2019 festival includes a number of non-Bay Area writers, brought into the festival for the first time to honor the roaming spirit of the Celts! </p><p><strong>Why do you need so much money?</strong></p><p>Over the years, the festival has grown and shrunk and grown again, adjusting itself to best serve the community it has come from. Though in the past we have raised as much as 12K, this year we're only looking to raise $5,000. </p><p>$3,100 of the money we raise goes to keeping the doors of the theater open, the lights turned on and the water running- all really necessary! So, when you donate to the Festival you're actually also donating to the EXIT Theatre, the cornerstone of San Francisco's small and indie theatre scene. The rest of the money we raise is split three ways...</p><p>One third goes to marketing and materials: postcards, posters, programs, high quality printings of the work created by our fine artists, the catering for our opening night party, and of course, all the photocopies of these brand new scripts we need for the readings.</p><p>One third goes to paying our staff, which consists of an Art Director who runs the art side of the festival, a Technical Director who keeps the festival moving the nights of the Festival itself, and a Box Office Manager who runs front of house and assists our audiences with having the best possible experience they can when coming to the festival. Our Executive Director/Producer doesn't get paid and donates all his time. Our actors, directors and playwrights are paid from the box office itself each night, something we can do because our administrative staff is paid through gifts from generous benefactors like you! <br/><br/>The final third of the money raised this year goes to funding an experiment we're doing for the first time: including a multi-discipline, 8 part serial that brings new theater development together with fine art creation, music, movement, and non-traditional storytelling.

Many have also received additional readings on local and national stages, or other development or workshop opportunities, including: 2010’s Juno En Victoria (Pacific Play Company); 2011’s Joe Ryan (Impact Theatre), Pleiades (Atlantic Stage), Io (Chameleon Theatre Circle), and Selene, or Someone Like The Moon (EXIT Theatre); 2012’s Caeneus and Poseidon (Playwrights’ Center of San Francisco, City Lights Theater), and Twins (San Francisco State, Custom Made Theatre Company); 2013's Under The Gods' Golden Cleats (Dramatist Guild); 2014’s Beauty Secrets (Cutting Ball Theatre Company), Finding Medusa (Musical Café), The String’s The Thing (Inkwell Theatre); 2015’s You’ll Not Feel The Drowning and Oceanus (Custom Made Theatre Company), Ino Leucothea (Red Bull Theatre); 2016’s Ceres En Victoria (The Swedish American Hall), Lethe (Artists at Albatross Reach), Drumming With Anubis (Left Edge Theater Company), Erinyes/Eumenides (Custom Made Theatre Company) and Macaria (Custom Made Theatre Company); 2017’s Thoth (Custom Made Theatre Company); and 2018’s The Fire Wolves (Live Girls Theatre). Additionally, 2015’s You’ll Not Feel The Drowning was the recipient of the Custom Made Theatre Company’s New Development Program Workshop in 2017, 2013's Walls Of Troy was a finalist for the Stanley Drama Award, and 2014’s The String’s The Thing was the recipient of the Max K. Lerner Fellowship through Inkwell Theatre. The entire festival won ""Playwriting Series Most Likely to Win a Gold Medal"" from the SF Bay Guardian in 2013. EXIT Press has released a collection of five plays from Year One of the festival, Songs of Hestia, and ten plays from Year Two, Heavenly Bodies, both available for purchase on Amazon.com and at bookstores across the country. Steel Spring Stage Rights has published Ino Leucothea as part of Volume IV of Red Bull Shorts. A monologue from 2018’s Diana was included in The Best Men’s Monologues of 2019 by Smith & Kramer. Find out more at www.sfolympiansfestival.com.Since 2010 the festival has featured the work of 125 Writers, 95 Directors, 510 Actors, and 46 Fine Artists!Of her experience at the festival, 2018 writer Libby Emmons wrote:""I was skeptical at first, about writing a play about a goddess, but it has opened doors in my mind, from the research phase through the writing process, in terms of what is possible on stage, what is possible if you take your feet off the ground.""This year we are excited to debut 38 new plays by 36 writers, 17 of whom will be contributing written work to the festival for the first time! The plays range from shorts to one-acts and full-lengths, and each one explores a different legend or god from the mythology of Ancient Gaul, Britain, Ireland, and the legends of King Arthur. Though exclusively local in the past, the 2019 festival includes a number of non-Bay Area writers, brought into the festival for the first time to honor the roaming spirit of the Celts! Why do you need so much money?Over the years, the festival has grown and shrunk and grown again, adjusting itself to best serve the community it has come from. Though in the past we have raised as much as 12K, this year we're only looking to raise $5,000. $3,100 of the money we raise goes to keeping the doors of the theater open, the lights turned on and the water running- all really necessary! So, when you donate to the Festival you're actually also donating to the EXIT Theatre, the cornerstone of San Francisco's small and indie theatre scene. The rest of the money we raise is split three ways...One third goes to marketing and materials: postcards, posters, programs, high quality printings of the work created by our fine artists, the catering for our opening night party, and of course, all the photocopies of these brand new scripts we need for the readings.One third goes to paying our staff, which consists of an Art Director who runs the art side of the festival, a Technical Director who keeps the festival moving the nights of the Festival itself, and a Box Office Manager who runs front of house and assists our audiences with having the best possible experience they can when coming to the festival. Our Executive Director/Producer doesn't get paid and donates all his time. Our actors, directors and playwrights are paid from the box office itself each night, something we can do because our administrative staff is paid through gifts from generous benefactors like you! The final third of the money raised this year goes to funding an experiment we're doing for the first time: including a multi-discipline, 8 part serial that brings new theater development together with fine art creation, music, movement, and non-traditional storytelling. This work, which is being led by two of San Francisco's most exciting experimental artists, is pushing the boundaries of what the festival can do, and helps keep us a place where artists get to flex their muscles in a way they might not otherwise get to do! Perhaps most importantly, if we manage to raise all of our funds, we'll be able to keep our ticket price (which is only $10) low, and our comp policy generous, ensuring that the wide variety of audiences looking to experience these new works can do so affordably.Okay, but why should I support you?When you support this festival, you're not just supporting the 36 writers whose work will be presented this year, but also the 80+ actors we predict this festival will use, a dozen directors, and a dozen fine artists, the staff of the festival, and the theater where we work, the theater itself, the neighborhood it is located in, and the cultural life of the city that is our home.

<h3>What is SHADOW. EURYDICE SAYS?</h3>
<p>Most people think Eurydice is a love story. Jelinek thinks otherwise. In her trademark stream-of-consciousness style, Jelinek chops, screws and tears apart the old myth, bringing feminist theory and Freud to bear on boy bands and smartphone culture. Spoken by a chorus of women of a certain age, SHADOW. EURYDICE SAYS is a jagged, vulgar last lament on the subject of love, aging, disappearing, and death.</p>
<p>SHADOW. EURYDICE SAYS will perform October 12–14, 2017 in the John Cullum Theatre at the American Theatre of Actors (314 W. 54th St, NY/NY) as part of the 2017 Araca Project. Get your tickets <a href=""http://shadoweurydicesays.brownpapertickets.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>!</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Jessica Rizzo (director), Ashley Chang (producer), and Ariel Sibert (producer) are great friends who met at Yale School of Drama. They bonded over postdramatic theater, the total devastation of Magda Szabó’s “The Door,"" and Bikini Kill. Over the past four years, they've worked together on several projects, including SISTER SANDMAN PLEASE, REVOLT. SHE SAID. REVOLT AGAIN, and a Guerilla Girls-inspired intervention called PRAYIN WOMANTIS. Wry feminism wends its way in and out of all their collaborations and is a staple of their friendship.</p>

<h3>What Are These Shows?</h3>
<p><i><strong>Greencard Wedding</strong></i> (<a href=""http://www.greencardwedding.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">greencardwedding.com</a>)</p>
<p><i>Brooklyn 2012, where you can be whatever you want. . . until your visa expires. </i>Inspired by a true, bittersweet love story of one band's artistic triumph via technology and music, <strong><i>Greencard Wedding</i></strong> is part rock concert, part Skype film featuring notable locations in the New York indie rock scene. This multi-media indie rock musical speaks to how we define ourselves as artists, the politics of immigration, and artist visa regulations. Performed in English and some Gaelic. Wedding cake served to all audience members. </p>
<p>JODY:  <i><strong>Greencard Wedding</strong></i> is the first generative work I made. I had a band (Greencard Wedding) that had a member whose visa was canceled, which was really heartbreaking. This play is based on that experience and includes music, film and wedding cake soaked in whiskey.  Time Out has called us ""talents to watch not to mention a pleasure to hear"" and Broadway World has labeled our music ""whiskey-soaked, heart-soaring harmonies."" </p>
<p><i><strong>AMP </strong></i>(<a href=""https://www.goodeproductionsnyc.com/amp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">goodeproductionsnyc.com/amp</a>)</p>
<p>JODY: <i>AMP</i> :  An electrical current. A Modern Prometheus. An investigation of Luigi Galvani, Mary Shelley and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. My new solo horror play AMP, explores scientist Luigi Galvani's discovery of animal electricity in 1790 and how it informed the creation of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as well as the development of electroshock therapy in the 1950's.</p>
<p>In <i>AMP</i>, Mary Shelley begins the process of writing Frankenstein on stage. Mary's monologues are interwoven with film interviews of a woman who auditions for the Boston Symphony during their first historic ""blind auditions"" and is committed to an asylum where she undergoes electroshock therapy.</p>
<p>Part of the text in this show is taken directly from the writings of Mary Shelley, Percy Shelley, Lord Byron, William Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft, Luigi Galvani and medical journals. Many of these people are voiced by actors through ghostly voice overs.</p>
<p>The projections used in AMP are photographs I took on location at abandoned asylums in New York and Massachuttes. Those shots were recently published here on <a href=""http://www.boredpanda.com/a-womans-photos-from-creepy-photos-from-abandon-asylums-that-will-seriously-scare-you/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bored Panda</a></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Producing theater in New York is expensive. Producing independently is even harder. But it allows for the best flexibility of schedule and venue. We spent months finding the right home and time for these shows, and we're confident we've found both. Accessibility and outreach to the widest possible audience are our commitment.</p>
<p>With 21 performances of both shows total, our cost <i>per performance</i> is <strong>$2050</strong>, which means we need to sell 60 full price tickets to each performance to break even.</p>
<p>To think of it differently: each seat at every performance (99 seats x 21 perf.) costs approximately <strong>$20</strong> whether or not someone is sitting there. And that's par for the course for a New York debut, one of the most expensive producing cities in the world, but one that is still at the center of the critical and artistic worlds.</p>
<p>Much of our budget is venue rental and overhead, but the other primary considerations include technical rentals (both shows extensively use projections and <i>Greencard Wedding </i>uses multiple instruments and rigs), a massive marketing and press plan to bring in audiences, and a living wage for our artists.</p>
<p>Our IndieGoGo amount is only a portion of the <b>$38,000 </b>budget these shows require, but it is a significant investment into these exciting new works and brings the per-performance cost down to a much more manageable/sellable $1,400.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>You are helping the curation and presentation of a new theatrical voice, which is the mission of Goode Productions.</li>
<li>You are investing in a noted track record that the full company of both shows possesses: exciting work and engaging performances.</li>
<li>You are helping to produce two shows with vastly different feels and stories which complement each other in their empathy and shared humanity.</li>

What We Need & What You Get
Producing theater in New York is expensive. Producing independently is even harder. But it allows for the best flexibility of schedule and venue. We spent months finding the right home and time for these shows, and we're confident we've found both. Accessibility and outreach to the widest possible audience are our commitment.
With 21 performances of both shows total, our cost per performance is $2050, which means we need to sell 60 full price tickets to each performance to break even.
To think of it differently: each seat at every performance (99 seats x 21 perf.) costs approximately $20 whether or not someone is sitting there. And that's par for the course for a New York debut, one of the most expensive producing cities in the world, but one that is still at the center of the critical and artistic worlds.
Much of our budget is venue rental and overhead, but the other primary considerations include technical rentals (both shows extensively use projections and Greencard Wedding uses multiple instruments and rigs), a massive marketing and press plan to bring in audiences, and a living wage for our artists.
Our IndieGoGo amount is only a portion of the $38,000 budget these shows require, but it is a significant investment into these exciting new works and brings the per-performance cost down to a much more manageable/sellable $1,400.

The Impact

You are helping the curation and presentation of a new theatrical voice, which is the mission of Goode Productions.
You are investing in a noted track record that the full company of both shows possesses: exciting work and engaging performances.
You are helping to produce two shows with vastly different feels and stories which complement each other in their empathy and shared humanity.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>DUBLIN CAROL</strong></h3>
<p>Dublin undertaker, John Plunkett, is a man haunted by his past – a past he would sooner forget. It’s the morning of Christmas Eve and he’s back in his office with his new assistant, after overseeing an early morning funeral.  Then an unexpected visit from his estranged daughter throws his daily routine into turmoil.  It’s a visit that forces him to confront the ghosts of his past, and one that offers him a final opportunity to make things right.</p>
<p>""Can a play be both brutal and tender, as gentle as it is harsh?...such paradoxes seem utterly natural when describing McPherson’s painfully beautiful Dublin Carol…a small treasure"" (Charles Isherwood, Variety)</p>
<p><strong>CAMPAIGN GOAL</strong></p>
<p>Our funding goal of $2000 represents 30% of our overall budget.  We are specifically targeting production costs associated with the rental of rehearsal space and the services of a publicist. </p>
<p>Finding suitable and affordable rehearsal space in Toronto can be a challenge, particularly for indie companies like ours.  With approximately 100 hours of rehearsal planned for Dublin Carol, this cost can be prohibitive.  Your donation will help to ensure that the actors will have enough time in the rehearsal hall to dig deep and explore their characters to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>Dublin Carol is Fly on the Wall's fourth fully realized production and we are at the stage where we would like to grow our audience base.  By engaging the service of a publicist, we hope to enhance our profile in the community which in turn, will lead to increased ticket sales.</p>
<p>With your help, we will be able to allocate a greater portion of box office revenue to the artists themselves - without whom this project would not be possible.</p>

<p>WHO WE ARE:</p>
<p>Third Eye Theatre Ensemble presents quality productions of new or seldom performed operatic works that inspire conversation while advocating for human rights and social justice. We want to get people talking about the issues we face in today's world and hope the power of music and theater can inspire those conversations at a community level. We believe we fulfill a very special niche in Chicago's arts scene and have something unique to offer our audiences. We are thrilled that <i>With Blood, With Ink</i> will be our third Midwest Premiere! This year we are partnering with a non-profit organization whose mission aligns with the theme of the opera. We will invite the selected organization to present a post-show discussion to stimulate conversation regarding the themes addressed in the opera. We will also donate $1 of each ticket sale to the selected organization. We will announce the selected organization very soon! Stay tuned!</p>
<p>WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:</p>
<p>We are at an exciting point in our organization. We were very fortunate to receive two grants this year, which will help us immensely. In order to continue to expand our success as a company and further our mission, we need your help. Thus far, we have been able to produce one high quality production a year on a very small budget. We will not produce more works until we have the funds to do so. If we reach our financial goal for this opera, we will have funds in reserve so that we can produce more than one opera per year. Additionally, many people don't realize that arts organizations cannot survive on ticket sales alone. In a typical arts organization, individual giving makes up 40% of funding. Therefore, we have to rely heavily on individual giving for a large part of our funding. We hope you will believe in what we want to achieve and will contribute as generously as you can. Every bit helps, so even if you can only give $5, that still helps us get closer to our goal. With $5, we can buy 1/4 hour of rehearsal space!</p>
<p> WHAT YOU WILL GET:</p>
<p>Our perks are listed on the right hand side of the page. We hope someone will take advantage of the personal wake up call from our stage director, Rose Freeman. She will start your day off right! Additionally, everyone who donates to our campaign will be listed on our website as a supporter of Third Eye Theatre Ensemble. Those who donate prior to 10/2 will be listed in our program. You'll also get our undying gratitude, which we hope counts for a lot, and a feeling that you are making a difference. Each and every contribution, no matter the amount, helps us tremendously. Plus you're helping to keep the performing arts alive and bringing new opera to Chicago. Who wouldn't feel good about that?</p>

I have been a professional SAG-AFTRA/AEA actor and voice talent since 1979.  From my early Boomer days of LPs and phonographs, I have always enjoyed song parodies, especially those of my childhood hero Allan Sherman.  Growing up on black and white TV with the likes of Lucy, Ernie Kovacs, and Sid Caesar and amid all those old burlesque and vaudeville sketches, I have always wanted to produce a show that integrated great comedy and musical satire, all centering around one universal subject matter.  But which one?</p><p>Influenced by the success of ""Menopause the Musical"", ""Forbidden Broadway"", and The Capitol Steps programs on NPR, I began looking online for what was trending.  That is, when my computer, cable, and internet weren't conspiring to give me fits. How about Divorce? Too soon. Children? Not everybody's got 'em.  And nobody needs a comedy about Funerals.</p><p>Turns out the answer was right then under my fingertips. Literally.</p><h3>Why I Can't Techno</h3><p>Parking my car in a lot one day, there was that guy- the one with the Smartphone who crossed my path and never looked up once.  And I nearly ran him over. Three times.</p><p>Frustration welled up inside of me.  By that point, I had had it with the distraction of modern technology anyway, with it constantly changing and intruding in my organized life.  To relieve my stress, I suddenly blurted out ""Oblivious"" to the tune of ""Aquarius"". Satisfied by my utterance, that was my catalyst to write ""I Can't Techno"" and spawned the song, which turned out to be the opener for the show.   Most of us tend to suffer from being ""Technologically Challenged"".  And we will continue to be afflicted in the Future.  But it has happened down through the Ages, so remember, YOU ARE NOT ALONE! Just check out what Socrates tells Plato: ""No one can remember anything anymore without some Tablet to tell 'em""!</p><p> </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/146577732?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><div> </div><p>That's why I wrote this show: so we can all disconnect from our social media clouds for 90 minutes, collectively laugh a little about technology, and let off some of our compressed steam.  After all, laughter IS the best medicine! And the old story of Man vs. Machine is Eternal. It'll be there waiting for you when you finish our short journey through Modern Times- past, present, and future. Plus, we really need to celebrate the things that sometimes make our lives easier these days and go ahead and ""Greet Technology"" (to the tune of ""We Are Family""), which we do in our closing number.</p><h3>What We Need to Techno</h3><p>We need $25,000.  That sounds like a lot of currency, but it's not, really.  It is, however, so that we can properly showcase this great idea in the right performance space, with excellent digital visuals and great sound and so that we can pay the best cast and crew for their talents. And working under the Equity Members' Project Code allows me and my colleagues to present the production as a legitimate Indie collective. All the participants are willing to take a chance on the show and although they are getting paid for their work, it is not at the rate they are truly worth.  But that's how much they believe in the idea.</p><p>So, hey, then what's the ""Big Idea""!? The idea is that this will NOT be ending at SYNCHRONICITY THEATRE in Midtown Atlanta after a 5 PERFORMANCE, ONE-WEEK LIMITED ENGAGEMENT, Thursday, March 22- Sunday, March 25, 2018.  This funny musical revue has the ""legs"" to last a lifetime, with songs long remembered by Boomers, Gen Xers, and Millennials alike, coupled with hilarious skits.</p><p>Below is a breakdown of how the money pie will be divvied up. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505258910/sfoyzya8zqr1c8rkkgb1.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter</strong> will be a performance event of roughly 70 minutes, currently scheduled for presentation at LaMaMa ETC, New York's landmark avant garde theater venue on May 11 - 13, as a featured work in LaMaMa Moves, an annual festival of post-modern movement based performances.</p>
<p><strong>Your contribution will support fees, travel, lodging and related expenses of composers, musicians, performers, and other creative, technical and administrative personnel.</strong></p>
<p><strong>New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter</strong> begins with Adrien Barrere’s 1910 film, <i>Tom Pouce Suit Une Femme</i>, a work about unlikely romance and the persistence, courage and discomfort of pursuing one’s desires. Contextualized by the destabilizing realities of the Great Flood of 1910 that submerged Paris into icy waters for several weeks and the emotional trauma of this historical moment, New Love is a meditation on love, desire, and queerness. </p>
<p><i>“In the US, in the current context in which male sexuality and its expressions are under the microscope and the way in which one expresses one’s desire, particularly desire that the mainstream invalidates, it seems important to me that we not lose sight of the nature and realization of one’s deep and persistent desires for another, the extent to which expressing that desire is not only an exercise of power, but a critical, human moment that is sometimes painful, sometimes marvelous, sometimes brave, sometimes welcomed, sometimes repulsed, sometimes embraced, sometimes triumphant, sometimes devastating and transformative. New Love… explores this territory from the point of view of people whose relationship to “their sex” is essential and contested. Looking at these issues through the “lens” of Paris, for me requires a kind of circumspection that, I hope, will be informed by a range of cultural perspectives, that, for me, as an “etranger” is often in high relief” TW.</i></p>
<p>In 1910, pioneering Pathé Frères motion picture studio was in the process of reconstructing itself after Paris’s Great Flood that had submerged much of the city, in the dead of winter and destroyed a large percentage of its inventory and film stock. Among the first projects the studio released was <i>Tom Pouce Suit Une Femme</i>, a short film by director Adrien Barrère, who was best known for his work as an illustrator. Its subject was a comedic tale of romance between characters we would now describe as a transgender woman and a young cisgender little male who encounter one another on the sidewalk in front of her apartment building. The young man follows her into the building and, unseen, enters her apartment. A romantic flirtation takes place and is precipitously brought to an end when the transwoman picks up her suitor and drops him from the window to the sidewalk. The short film was critiqued at that time in the review, Motography as a work that ""embodies in quintessential form the kind of vulgarity and horseplay that has been the basis of so many motion picture attacks.""</p>

<p>As the second work presented of <strong>This Dancerie</strong>, Tony Whitfield’s ten part cycle of projects exploring queer life in Paris over the last century, <strong>New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter </strong>offers points of departure for explorations of themes and issues that will span the coming century and is the point of departure for <strong>New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter</strong>’s exploration of the resilience of desire and the queer human spirit as it surfaces through non-conformity.</p>
<p>Central to this investigation will be Tony Whitfield in the role of on-stage interrogator/ruminator/ narrator/reflector. A project of Whitfield CoLabs, <strong>New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter</strong> is a new work, developed through a collaborative process with a diverse group of artists and a group of gay, lesbian, trans, queer and gender non-conforming folk from New York and Paris with whom Whitfield, working in collaboration with Paris-based choreographer Alexandre Bado and Assistant Director Oisin Stack, explores their understandings of desire, difference, danger and self realization through words and movement.</p>
<p><i>“The complexity of <strong>New Love: 1910</strong>… lies in spaces we create between the buoyancy of Adrien Barrère’s film and the dark rationalizations in Maria Schneider’s final monologue from Last Tango in Paris…where struggles for self definition and self-possession bang up against internalized conventions” TW.</i></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/241946092?portrait=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p><strong>New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter</strong> is a new work, developed through a collaborative process with a diverse group people whose relationships to the world defy binary conventions to explore, through movement and recollection those moments of recognition and the actions they inspire. That collaborative development process draws upon the input of a group of composers, musicians, live performers, and videographers/editors and a broad range of gay, lesbian, trans, queer and gender non-conforming folk from New York and Paris. To accommodate practical as well as conceptual realities of disparate venues, the project will be tailored to respond to the talents and input of the contributors in each city, assuming opportunities for fine-tuning at each performance venue. While many of Whitfield’s collaborations in <strong>New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter </strong>will be new working relationships, a core group of collaborators—among them, actor/director Oisin Stack and choreographer and performer Alexandre Bado in Paris and composers Andrew Alden and Kurt Hoffman as well as video editors, Hanisha Harjani, Peifu Chen, --have worked with Whitfield on previous projects. To bring a breadth of perspectives to the exploration inherent in this piece, the group of collaborators Whitfield has brought together are from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds with histories of working across a variety of discipline in traditional and unexpected contexts. Their experience contributes to a <strong>New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter’s</strong> combination of video, film, movement, live music and testimony in its narrative delivery.</p>
<p><strong><u>BACKGROUND</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter</strong> is the second work in Tony Whitfield’s ten part cycle of works entitled <strong>This Dancerie </strong>exploring Paris as the site of <i>a queer century lived in public</i> in a multi-event, multi-site, multi-media project.  This Dancerie investigates the ways in which gay men have created public expressions of desire despite prohibitions against the manifestation of those aspects of their lives.</p>
<p>In a series of projects spanning several years, <strong>This Dancerie</strong> will seek to:</p>
<ul>
<li>illuminate transitions in identity that evolve for cisgender males over the course of a century, moving from  the modern construct of the homosexual to current articulations of “queerness;”</li>
<li>look at the persistence of public expressions of identity that defy binary gender definition across the century;</li>
<li>reflect the critical social events that have had an impact on “queer” lives ranging from wars to public health crises to liberation struggles to fashion and entertainment;</li>
<li>reflect the intersections of class, race, ethnicity, economics, politics and creed as well as immigration patterns that have created evolving heterogeneity in the French populus;</li>
<li>reflect changing technologies that have supported notions of self actualization while challenging policies and practices that have defined standards of public decency.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519213941/cmlfrha1jfxbegql7xh5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Unifying the works in the <strong>Dancerie</strong> cycle will the personal responses of the project Artistic Director, Tony Whitfield rooted in understandings of the narrative underlying each work in the cycle to their relationships to contemporary socio-political issues. The pretext of <strong>This Dancerie</strong> is urbanization as a prerequisite for modern homosexual subculture and the understanding that despite the lack of recognized communities or “gay ghettos,” gay men have lived forbidden aspects of their lives in many cities, in public. <strong>This Dancerie</strong> focuses on Paris as a crossroad of queer life in which, although, technically, homosexuality was legal since 1791, notions of public decency were legislated and under surveillance and further complicated by the re-criminalization of same-sex relations during the Nazi occupation that remained in place until the 1980s.</p>
<p><strong>This Dancerie</strong> will highlight a series of sites and events across Paris of historical importance for gay men as members of a broader social context. For each site, narratives based on actual events will be developed and represented in public works that range from image projections to performing arts-based works/events. Each narrative will seek to elaborate aspects of gay history and the intersection of that history with issues of race, class, creed, ethnicity, ability and gender. The role immigration has played will also be underscored in <strong>This Dancerie</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>This Dancerie</strong>’s Artistic Director and Executive Producer is Tony Whitfield. Each work in the series that will constitute <strong>This Dancerie</strong> will be conceived, written, directed and produced by Whitfield in collaboration with teams of artists, performers and technicians based in Paris and New York. Each work in the <strong>Dancerie</strong> cycle will have a team specifically assembled to meet its artistic demands.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next five years, Whitfield plans to execute ten works that will constitute <strong>This Dancerie</strong> in locations across Paris where same sex desire has created a shifting landscape of encoded behavior, transgressive beauty and seduction, criminalized activity, class-complicated entanglements, immigrant survival strategies, forbidden trans/interactions. As such, they will also employ elements that will seek to engage viewers and community groups in a variety of ways that illuminate connections to the City’s gay history. In situations that range from motion activated videos to dance parties to social media directed investigations, <strong>This Dancerie</strong> will ask viewers/participants to question what it means to live a forbidden life in public.</p>
<p>All of the <strong>This Dancerie</strong>’s constituent parts are and have been conceived and developed with the goal of presentations in Paris and New York, as well as other cities with the desire of creating contexts for discussion that have international implications in a framework that encourages analysis and comparison. Toward that end, international creative teams are being engaged various collaborative activities that are integral to each project’s realization.</p>
<p>To date, support for <strong><i>This Dancerie </i></strong>has been provided by The Jerome Foundation, The New School University, and contributions of private donors through crowdfunding campaigns. Administrative support in France is provided by Association Errances and fiscal sponsorship in the US is provided by Fractured Atlas.</p>

</div></div>","New Love: 1910 

 
New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter will be a performance event of roughly 70 minutes, currently scheduled for presentation at LaMaMa ETC, New York's landmark avant garde theater venue on May 11 - 13, as a featured work in LaMaMa Moves, an annual festival of post-modern movement based performances.
Your contribution will support fees, travel, lodging and related expenses of composers, musicians, performers, and other creative, technical and administrative personnel.
New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter begins with Adrien Barrere’s 1910 film, Tom Pouce Suit Une Femme, a work about unlikely romance and the persistence, courage and discomfort of pursuing one’s desires. Contextualized by the destabilizing realities of the Great Flood of 1910 that submerged Paris into icy waters for several weeks and the emotional trauma of this historical moment, New Love is a meditation on love, desire, and queerness. 
“In the US, in the current context in which male sexuality and its expressions are under the microscope and the way in which one expresses one’s desire, particularly desire that the mainstream invalidates, it seems important to me that we not lose sight of the nature and realization of one’s deep and persistent desires for another, the extent to which expressing that desire is not only an exercise of power, but a critical, human moment that is sometimes painful, sometimes marvelous, sometimes brave, sometimes welcomed, sometimes repulsed, sometimes embraced, sometimes triumphant, sometimes devastating and transformative. New Love… explores this territory from the point of view of people whose relationship to “their sex” is essential and contested. Looking at these issues through the “lens” of Paris, for me requires a kind of circumspection that, I hope, will be informed by a range of cultural perspectives, that, for me, as an “etranger” is often in high relief” TW.
In 1910, pioneering Pathé Frères motion picture studio was in the process of reconstructing itself after Paris’s Great Flood that had submerged much of the city, in the dead of winter and destroyed a large percentage of its inventory and film stock. Among the first projects the studio released was Tom Pouce Suit Une Femme, a short film by director Adrien Barrère, who was best known for his work as an illustrator. Its subject was a comedic tale of romance between characters we would now describe as a transgender woman and a young cisgender little male who encounter one another on the sidewalk in front of her apartment building. The young man follows her into the building and, unseen, enters her apartment. A romantic flirtation takes place and is precipitously brought to an end when the transwoman picks up her suitor and drops him from the window to the sidewalk. The short film was critiqued at that time in the review, Motography as a work that ""embodies in quintessential form the kind of vulgarity and horseplay that has been the basis of so many motion picture attacks.""

As the second work presented of This Dancerie, Tony Whitfield’s ten part cycle of projects exploring queer life in Paris over the last century, New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter offers points of departure for explorations of themes and issues that will span the coming century and is the point of departure for New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter’s exploration of the resilience of desire and the queer human spirit as it surfaces through non-conformity.
Central to this investigation will be Tony Whitfield in the role of on-stage interrogator/ruminator/ narrator/reflector. A project of Whitfield CoLabs, New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter is a new work, developed through a collaborative process with a diverse group of artists and a group of gay, lesbian, trans, queer and gender non-conforming folk from New York and Paris with whom Whitfield, working in collaboration with Paris-based choreographer Alexandre Bado and Assistant Director Oisin Stack, explores their understandings of desire, difference, danger and self realization through words and movement.
“The complexity of New Love: 1910… lies in spaces we create between the buoyancy of Adrien Barrère’s film and the dark rationalizations in Maria Schneider’s final monologue from Last Tango in Paris…where struggles for self definition and self-possession bang up against internalized conventions” TW.

New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter is a new work, developed through a collaborative process with a diverse group people whose relationships to the world defy binary conventions to explore, through movement and recollection those moments of recognition and the actions they inspire. That collaborative development process draws upon the input of a group of composers, musicians, live performers, and videographers/editors and a broad range of gay, lesbian, trans, queer and gender non-conforming folk from New York and Paris. To accommodate practical as well as conceptual realities of disparate venues, the project will be tailored to respond to the talents and input of the contributors in each city, assuming opportunities for fine-tuning at each performance venue. While many of Whitfield’s collaborations in New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter will be new working relationships, a core group of collaborators—among them, actor/director Oisin Stack and choreographer and performer Alexandre Bado in Paris and composers Andrew Alden and Kurt Hoffman as well as video editors, Hanisha Harjani, Peifu Chen, --have worked with Whitfield on previous projects. To bring a breadth of perspectives to the exploration inherent in this piece, the group of collaborators Whitfield has brought together are from diverse ethnic and cultural backgrounds with histories of working across a variety of discipline in traditional and unexpected contexts. Their experience contributes to a New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter’s combination of video, film, movement, live music and testimony in its narrative delivery.
BACKGROUND
New Love: 1910: World Out of Kilter is the second work in Tony Whitfield’s ten part cycle of works entitled This Dancerie exploring Paris as the site of a queer century lived in public in a multi-event, multi-site, multi-media project.  This Dancerie investigates the ways in which gay men have created public expressions of desire despite prohibitions against the manifestation of those aspects of their lives.
In a series of projects spanning several years, This Dancerie will seek to:

illuminate transitions in identity that evolve for cisgender males over the course of a century, moving from  the modern construct of the homosexual to current articulations of “queerness;”
look at the persistence of public expressions of identity that defy binary gender definition across the century;
reflect the critical social events that have had an impact on “queer” lives ranging from wars to public health crises to liberation struggles to fashion and entertainment;
reflect the intersections of class, race, ethnicity, economics, politics and creed as well as immigration patterns that have created evolving heterogeneity in the French populus;
reflect changing technologies that have supported notions of self actualization while challenging policies and practices that have defined standards of public decency.


Unifying the works in the Dancerie cycle will the personal responses of the project Artistic Director, Tony Whitfield rooted in understandings of the narrative underlying each work in the cycle to their relationships to contemporary socio-political issues. The pretext of This Dancerie is urbanization as a prerequisite for modern homosexual subculture and the understanding that despite the lack of recognized communities or “gay ghettos,” gay men have lived forbidden aspects of their lives in many cities, in public. This Dancerie focuses on Paris as a crossroad of queer life in which, although, technically, homosexuality was legal since 1791, notions of public decency were legislated and under surveillance and further complicated by the re-criminalization of same-sex relations during the Nazi occupation that remained in place until the 1980s.
This Dancerie will highlight a series of sites and events across Paris of historical importance for gay men as members of a broader social context. For each site, narratives based on actual events will be developed and represented in public works that range from image projections to performing arts-based works/events. Each narrative will seek to elaborate aspects of gay history and the intersection of that history with issues of race, class, creed, ethnicity, ability and gender. The role immigration has played will also be underscored in This Dancerie.
This Dancerie’s Artistic Director and Executive Producer is Tony Whitfield. Each work in the series that will constitute This Dancerie will be conceived, written, directed and produced by Whitfield in collaboration with teams of artists, performers and technicians based in Paris and New York. Each work in the Dancerie cycle will have a team specifically assembled to meet its artistic demands.
Over the course of the next five years, Whitfield plans to execute ten works that will constitute This Dancerie in locations across Paris where same sex desire has created a shifting landscape of encoded behavior, transgressive beauty and seduction, criminalized activity, class-complicated entanglements, immigrant survival strategies, forbidden trans/interactions. As such, they will also employ elements that will seek to engage viewers and community groups in a variety of ways that illuminate connections to the City’s gay history. In situations that range from motion activated videos to dance parties to social media directed investigations, This Dancerie will ask viewers/participants to question what it means to live a forbidden life in public.
All of the This Dancerie’s constituent parts are and have been conceived and developed with the goal of presentations in Paris and New York, as well as other cities with the desire of creating contexts for discussion that have international implications in a framework that encourages analysis and comparison. Toward that end, international creative teams are being engaged various collaborative activities that are integral to each project’s realization.
To date, support for This Dancerie has been provided by The Jerome Foundation, The New School University, and contributions of private donors through crowdfunding campaigns. Administrative support in France is provided by Association Errances and fiscal sponsorship in the US is provided by Fractured Atlas.

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Impulse Repertory Co. is a small professional theatre company dedicated to producing intimate, provocative works that nurture the actor-audience relationship at the core of theatre.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a newly minted 501(c)(3) nonprofit theatre company serving Atlanta by continuing to develop the talents, skills, aspirations, and contributions of the City's actor-artists, Impulse Rep is raising funds to produce its first professional rep season in August of 2017.</li>
<li>In light of recent uncertainties in the artistic community, donated funds are becoming the life blood of artistic ventures nationwide. Smaller arts ventures are coming to rely heavily on the generosity and artistic foresight of their patrons. If the arts are important to your community (and they are), your dollars represent your vote to keep them present and available, to nurture artists, and to develop future audiences by getting them up close and personal with the art itself.</li>
<li>Your donations also represent an opportunity to let your own voice be heard in the conversations that artists start, nurture, and provoke in the community.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul><li>In this campaign, we are seeking $20,000 (or more) in funding to produce the Summer 2017 Impulse Rep season: <p> </p>
</li></ul>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>ANTIGONE</i> by Sophocles<br/>directed by Kara Cantrell</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>JULIUS CAESAR</i> by William Shakespeare<br/>directed by Matt Lewis</p>
<ul>
<li>Donors will receive recognition in our season materials, performance tickets, VIP treatment at our performances, gifts from our sponsor partners, and more depending on their giving level.</li>
<li>What happens if we don't reach our goal here on Indiegogo? The good news is: we still produce! Indiegogo will take a percentage of the funds and send the rest to us to continue towards our production goals. The bad news is: we'll be seeking further funding from other sources that may or may not be able to continue funding arts ventures in our community, and the depth and breadth of our productions becomes severely limited.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>The growing impact of the arts in Atlanta is undeniable. As you may know, the film industry has exploded in our City and our state in recent years. This has prompted a huge influx of artists and craftspeople in our region. These artists come for the jobs, certainly, but they stay in communities and environments that nurture them by allowing them to explore and appreciating their work. Our goal at Impulse Rep is to become a home base for actor-artists to create projects for themselves, to explore their craft in new and exciting ways, and to try their hands in different roles or positions.</li>
<li>In 2011 and 2012, Kara Cantrell produced three plays under the name, Impulse Rep, with great success. Partnering with the Alliance Theatre Education Department as our hosts, as well as directors Rachel Jones, Justin Anderson, and David Crowe, the productions of <i>Medea, No Exit,</i> and <i>The Darker Places Trilogy</i> by Atlanta playwright, Daniel Guyton, we had our first financial and critical successes. Now that the company has gone ""legit,"" we've onboarded six new members drawn from Atlanta's finest actor/directors to round out our resident company: Ken Hornbeck, Renée Jamieson, Jessica McGuire, Patrick Tansor, Clint Thornton, and Vallea Woodbury.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nonprofit arts ventures are often difficult to get off the ground and we know we're entering the field at a time when major funding sources are being diminished.</li>
<li>Our plan for overcoming these challenges rests in the resident company's desire, expertise, and networks as artists. Our passionate team casts a City-wide, even region-wide net to pull and pool resources from fellow artists and art institutions, local and national businesses, personal relationships, and community service endeavors. A big net catches many fish.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please know that even the smallest monetary donation helps, but if you're just not in a position to help financially at this time, you can still help in profoundly valuable ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please share this campaign with your friends, family, colleagues, and neighbors via social media, e-mail, and one-on-one interactions. Be sure to use the Indiegogo tools!</li>
<li>Volunteer! We need people to assist with services such as house and box office management, set and costume building, securing loans of scenic, lighting, and sound equipment, running lighting, sound, or wardrobe during shows, and the list goes on. Please let us know if you can help out!</li>

Whether that entertainment is shock, awe, laughter, or sorrow, it's important to me that the audience walk away from my show feeling fulfilled. The Bakery isn't here to push a political agenda. I'm not looking to have the audience leaving the theatre having a discussion on how the art of baking bread laced with rat poison is just like the growing crisis with ISIS. Rather, I'd like the audience to leave beaming from cheek to cheek, quoting the show, and feeling even just the slightest bit happier than they were upon arrival. I don't write for me, I write for the audience. Very rarely do I sit alone in my room with an open bottle of bourbon pouring out my deepest darkest thoughts onto page in order to achieve some therapeutic sense of relief. Rather, I write strictly out of a desire to add a little joy to a world that has seems to have forgotten how to laugh.</p><p>The Bakery is a true labor of love. It was not written out of the love of theatre, the love of entertaining, or even the love of art. Rather, the play was written out of my extreme passion for baked goods. It is my utmost pleasure to be able to share that passion with you, and present my fully-staged original piece. The Bakery is a small play with a lot of courage. It makes light of extreme situations in an effort to show not only the inherent comedy, but also inherent dark absurdity in humanity. </p><p>The Bakery received its first production with a theatre company called Studio 501 at Pace University in New York City. Having been rewritten several times over the last five years, it will be fully staged and premier in the Hollywood Fringe Festival here in Los Angeles.

It's my greatest hope to be able to delight the audience by putting on the best show possible. However, we can't do it alone! I am constantly one step away from poverty and living in an area of Los Angeles where I constantly fear for my life. Shows are expensive to produce! As the show does not take place in a nudist colony, costumes are required. In addition to costumes, there's the cost of rat poison, bear traps, fanny packs, baked goods, and a whole other assortment of random items that add to the comedy in the piece. Above all, I'd like to have a set that transports the audience fully into the world of the play.

<h3>Hi! We're the cast of ""Mortality"" and ""Polity"".  We're raising funds to take our original Australian one-act plays on the road to the Adelaide Fringe Festival for a 6-show season between March 8-12, 2017.</h3>
<p>Tix and details available at: <a href=""https://www.adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/mortality-and-polity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.adelaidefringe.com.au/fringetix/mor...</a> </p>
<p>Your contribution enables us to hire a theatre and stage our plays for the Festival.  If 200 people gave as little as $10 we'd reach our goal.</p>
<p>Our work combines laugh-out-loud comedy with poignancy, inviting our audience to reflect on our humanity and all our foibles.  ""Mortality"" contains interlinking scenes of life and death, raising the question of responsibility for our own mortality. ""Polity"" is a satirical look at the dating world of the political class.</p>
<p>Here are some of the reviews from our Brisbane season:</p>
<p>""Just attended this fantastic production! Original, well constructed , funny and quirky dialogue... EXCELLENT acting and direction ...exciting new theatre!"" Sue Manger - Casting Consultant</p>
<p>""Witty and so alarmingly good this is some great writing...It was an hysterical hoot."" Barry Stone</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul><li>We need at least $2,000 to pay for our theatre.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We love what we do so much, that we do it for free.  We deeply believe in the value the arts gives to society - the opportunity to reflect, to learn, to laugh, to grow and share.</p>
<p>Funding for the arts is tight and in demand.  We self-funded our successful Brisbane season and are doing the same to bring our show to a larger audience.  We just need your support to pay for the venue.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know everyone can't afford to contribute.  You can help in other ways by sharing this campaign far and wide and telling your friends and family in Adelaide to come to our show!</p>

<p>Hey Everyone! What time it is? ""SHOWTIME""! My hilarious new coming of age play has just been accepted into the Midtown Theater Festival in New York City and will go up for a run this July and August. I present you with this wonderful news of course for you to come see the show but also I will need your help! <br/><br/>For those of you that don't know I graduated from Manhattanville College in 2011 with a dual degree in Theater &amp; Education. Afterwards, I went on to act in plays and write shorts for my students to perform. Upon watching their performances not only were my child actors great but so was my writing and that began my playwriting career. <br/><br/>While riding to work and rehearsals I would get stuck on the subway cart with ""Showtime"". Showtime [shoh-tayhm] noun - a group of subway performers who do amazingly choreographed musical numbers including acrobatics all while the subway was in motion. I began to wonder about their story. Where did they come from? How old were they? How did they come to doing flips on the train? Who choreographed these numbers? <br/><br/>After doing some research, and including my own voice from my experience teaching in inner city schools, I came to write the humorously-fun and courageous ""Showtime"". <br/><br/>Upon finishing the play, I was given two wonderful opportunities to put up stage readings of the play in Los Angeles (were I now reside). The readings went over so well I decided to submit the play into the Midtown Theater Festival to which it was so graciously accepted and it's finally time to bring this riveting story to life.</p>
<p>Tagline: Three young subway performers make a living from their flips on the train. Today's the day to payback the most dangerous gangster in town, so ladies and gentlemen what time is it? ""SHOW TIME"".</p>
<p>In order to put this colorful tale on its feet I will need your help. Lots of elements go into to putting up a play, including paying all 8 actors, director, producer, venue, stage manager, light and sound board operators, stage crew, costumes, props, rehearsal space, programs etc. I will need to raise $6000 for this production to run successfully. This is my first crowd funding project so I don't ask for money often. But I do ask that you give what you can and come see this amazing production when it goes up this summer. Thank you for your time. <br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>The playwright <br/>Krystina Bailey</p>

<p><strong><u>About the Play</u></strong></p>
<p>In Delicious Filth, Jack and Jill are just trying not to hate themselves while dating and sleeping around New York City until a gaggle of misfits from Sexual Freak Paradise show up seeking refuge from a genocidal Vladimir Putin. Objectified by those around them and by each other, Jack and Jill try to maintain their friendship in the face of an ancient prophecy, an impending war, and Shrek. The play addresses how humans are categorized, the levels of oppression that exist on a global scale, and the ways in which groups oppress and abuse one another. By weaving influences from Greek mask, 1920s musicals, Thornton Wilder, internet culture, and romantic comedies, our goal is to use this humor to entice the audience into a conversation around why and how oppressive systems are perpetuated and what they may lead to. It's also pretty funny.</p>
<p>The majority of our budget will be allocated for artist fees with a small amount left for renting rehearsal space, marketing, and some very basic props and costumes.</p>
<p><strong><u>About the Festival</u></strong></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Alexandra Shields and I am the producer of this project. My partner and director, Gus Schlanbusch, and I are looking to launch one of our theatrical passion projects, <i>The Aliens</i>. Here's an explanation from Gus as to why he was drawn to this particular play.</p>
<p><i>The Aliens</i> is, at its core, a play about missed connections, missed opportunities, and miscommunications. All of its characters are desperately seeking connections, comradeship and purpose. All of them want the others to be successful, and wish to help, but - just like in real life - figuring out what someone else wants or needs sometimes proves to be <i>really hard.</i></p>
<p><i>The Aliens</i> crystallizes this desire to fill a role, live up to an expectation, and care for one's fellows, and distills it out into a beautiful examination of yearning, loss, desire and need.</p>
<p>It's also funny.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Alexandra here again! Putting on a production is no easy feat. First and foremost, we are looking to pay our actors and designers for the work they contribute to the show, so our first priority is making sure that a large percentage of our budget goes to them. Secondly, we need lighting equipment, sound equipment, props, set pieces, posters, and programs. Your contributions would go to making sure that we are able to purchase the best quality equipment for our budget. Currently, we are looking to raise $5,000 dollars. No donation is too small. Thank you!</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>LITTLE is a delightful musical reimagining of the folktale Chicken Little.  It’s about an awkward chicken who feels he can’t live up to the expectations of his macho rooster of a father.  Little’s life is transformed when he gets hit in the head with a piece of the sky.  He runs away in a panic to warn the word of its impending doom. Along the way he meets the carefree Ducky Lucky, the deeply insecure Turkey Lurkey, and the kooky Goosey Loosey.  The play features a live folk band, puppets, an overabundance of bird puns, and as much joyous and simple theatrical magic as we can pack onto a stage.</p>
<p>We've been offered the incredible opportunity to participate in a residency at The Barn Arts Collective on Mount Desert Island, Maine.  During our week at The Barn, we'll perform the show for family audiences and students at the local elementary school.  The residency itself is free, but we need to pay for transportation, food, stipends for our team, and the building of multiple puppets that feature in the show.</p>
<p>This campaign is important because it will allow us to make the most of this prestigious residency.  Our time spent there will help us ensure the show is made to the highest standards so that when we return to NYC, LITTLE will be ready to present to audiences and critics.  Our ultimate goal is to bring this play to as wide of an audience as possible, and in achieve that it needs to shine when it debuts in the city.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We are Kristin McCarthy Parker (director), Colin Waitt (book), and Wesley Zurick (music &amp; lyrics).  </p>
<p>Collectively we have a proven track record of creating shows that strike a chord with a wide audience.  Kristin and Colin are part of the team that created PUFFS, which began life at The Peoples Improv Theater and is currently running off-Broadway at New World Stages.  Its Australian production was the longest running show in Melbourne in 48 years, and a filmed version of the original off-Broadway cast was distributed by Fathom Events in May.  Wes' BIBLE STORIES! was a runaway hit when presented by The Atlantic Farm Team.  His work has also been produced at The Bushwick Starr, The Bowery Poetry Club, Judson Memorial Church, and The Cincinnati Fringe Festival.</p>
<p>Our complete bios can be found at the end of this pitch.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to achieve the goals of our residency, we need to raise funds for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rental car transportation (including gas) for our team of 8 who'll spend the week at The Barn</li>
<li>Food for the week</li>
<li>Materials to build our puppets, including a larger than life Foxy Loxy, a chorus of squirrels, and an overly friendly dog.  Our puppets are being designed and built by the amazing Kayla Prestel.</li>
<li>Stipends for our team at The Barn as well as stipends for our choreographer and puppet designer/builder</li>
</ul>
<p>As thanks for your donation, we offer a variety of perks, including tickets to see the show when it performs in NYC and producer credits.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Crowdfunding is a a popular way of raising funds to make theater.  Our feeds are full of pitches, and we're sure yours are too.   We know that it's impossible to donate to every project you come across, so if you are't able to financially back LITTLE, you can help by getting the word out and making some noise about our campaign on social media, in emails, and in person.  Be sure to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>

<p>A Summary of Dancing England and the re-boot</p>
<p>As you probably know by now, Dancing England was a incredibly successful series of traditional dance showcase events run between 1979 and 1987 at the Derby Assembly Rooms. 30 years later, it happened again. Sheffield, 2017.</p>
<p>We think there's enough interest out there to run the show again, and make it a regular event.</p>
<p>My name is still Edwin Dyson and along with Phil Heaton, Arwen Heaton, Amy O'Brien, and Eilidh Smith, I'm one of the organisers for Dancing England 2019. I have strong family connections to the initial series, and Arwen was the organiser of the Daughter of Dancing England events.</p>
<p>I was there between 1979 and 1987, soaking up the atmosphere, enjoying the traditional dancing and being entranced by re-enactments of some of our most interesting and unique folklore customs. I MC'd the 2017 event, Arwen stage managed the whole affair, Phil sold posters, programmes, and more importantly put the bulk of the acts together, and Eilidh and Amy admirably ran backstage.</p>
<p>We've a good team in place for Dancing England 2019, and some great acts already lined up for you to enjoy; including some old(er) faces dancing Cotswold Morris, Rapper Sword, Step Clog, Molly, Longsword, Border Morris and North West. But joined together with younger teams, both aiming to showcase the tradition and the vibrancy of traditional dance in the UK. </p>
<p>After the 2017 re-boot, we realised that there's a wealth of good feeling and nostalgia out there for Dancing England, and we know people really want it to happen again. We need some more help to get the 2019 event under way, deposits need paying, publicity material needs printing and shipping.</p>
<p>If you choose to take part in this crowdfunding exercise and contribute to Dancing England 2019, you would be joining us in ensuring that some of our fantastic traditional and revival dancing teams are seen by a wider audience and that our more unique folklore customs are kept alive and known.</p>
<p>Might you be ready to make a contribution?</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>I'll break this down for you in more detail:</p>
<p>To run an event like this takes money, there's no bones about it. We need to raise approximately £2750 to pay for venue deposits and the like.</p>
<p>Tickets will go on sale in due course through the venue, but we want to get Dancing England 2019 set up on a firm financial footing first. This will hopefully ensure some stability for the future. The organisers will also be contributing financially to the event. We've also applied for National Lottery money, and grants from other sources too.</p>
<p>There are two types of crowdfunding for this project. Firstly you could become a Patron of Dancing England. This costs £40 and in return you would receive our heartfelt thanks, a mention in publicity, early entry to the event enabling you to get one of the best seats in the house and a free programme and poster.</p>
<p>Secondly, if you felt unable to be a Patron, you could be a Supporter of Dancing England in return for £10 of your hard earned money. This would again earn you a significant amount of gratitude, a thank you in the programme and the knowledge that you've helped a much-loved and oft-missed traditional dance event take place once again.</p>
<p>The Impact Of Your Funding</p>
<p>Your funding contribution will make a real difference to Dancing England and the people that want to come and watch the teams take part.</p>
<p>England is full of peculiar and exciting customs and traditions. Dancing England enables people to experience and appreciate our vast wealth of cultural heritage.</p>
<p>Dancing England was a glimpse of spring in the depths of winter. It was a highlight on people's calendars. It was valued and loved. We think there's enough love for this to happen again.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>Of course there are risks in organising an event like this. With proper planning we can mitigate most or all of those.</p>
<p>We are starting small. By 1987 Dancing England had grown to an audience of 2000. Our new Nottingham venue has a capacity of 700.</p>
<p>We will be harnessing the power of social media to spread the message, build enthusiasm for the event and to crowdfund Dancing England.</p>
<p>If, in the sad event, we don't raise a sufficient amount of monies, we will work with the venue to see how they can help. If in the sadder event that doesn't work, then we will refund everyone's contributions and say thank you.</p>
<p>We don't want that to happen.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>We understand that you might not be able to help financially at this point in time, but that doesn't mean that you can't assist in other ways.</p>
<p>Please help us to get the word out and make some noise about Dancing England.</p>
<p>Please Share, Like and Retweet this crowdfunding campaign on Facebook and other social media</p>
<p>You could also use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>Why not get in touch and ask for a flyer or poster to take along to your local folk club or dance practice?</p>
<p>Thank you for reading the pitch so far. Now, might we ask you for that contribution? Find 'Select A Perk' at the top right of this page and choose one! Thank you.</p>

We've also applied for National Lottery money, and grants from other sources too.
There are two types of crowdfunding for this project. Firstly you could become a Patron of Dancing England. This costs £40 and in return you would receive our heartfelt thanks, a mention in publicity, early entry to the event enabling you to get one of the best seats in the house and a free programme and poster.
Secondly, if you felt unable to be a Patron, you could be a Supporter of Dancing England in return for £10 of your hard earned money. This would again earn you a significant amount of gratitude, a thank you in the programme and the knowledge that you've helped a much-loved and oft-missed traditional dance event take place once again.
The Impact Of Your Funding
Your funding contribution will make a real difference to Dancing England and the people that want to come and watch the teams take part.
England is full of peculiar and exciting customs and traditions. Dancing England enables people to experience and appreciate our vast wealth of cultural heritage.
Dancing England was a glimpse of spring in the depths of winter. It was a highlight on people's calendars. It was valued and loved. We think there's enough love for this to happen again.
Risks & Challenges
Of course there are risks in organising an event like this. With proper planning we can mitigate most or all of those.
We are starting small. By 1987 Dancing England had grown to an audience of 2000. Our new Nottingham venue has a capacity of 700.
We will be harnessing the power of social media to spread the message, build enthusiasm for the event and to crowdfund Dancing England.
If, in the sad event, we don't raise a sufficient amount of monies, we will work with the venue to see how they can help. If in the sadder event that doesn't work, then we will refund everyone's contributions and say thank you.
We don't want that to happen.
Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that you might not be able to help financially at this point in time, but that doesn't mean that you can't assist in other ways.
Please help us to get the word out and make some noise about Dancing England.
Please Share, Like and Retweet this crowdfunding campaign on Facebook and other social media
You could also use the Indiegogo share tools!
Why not get in touch and ask for a flyer or poster to take along to your local folk club or dance practice?
Thank you for reading the pitch so far. Now, might we ask you for that contribution? Find 'Select A Perk' at the top right of this page and choose one! Thank you.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Our Story:</p>
<p>Devon Frieder is a professional actor and choreographer in New York City. She graduated from the Boston Conservatory with a B.F.A. in Musical Theatre, during and after which she began producing shows in Santa Fe and Albuquerque to provide other young, aspiring performers with exciting new performing opportunities. Her theatre company has continued to grow every year and this winter she will be producing the hit movie-based musical <i>Bring It On</i>, with music and lyrics written by <i>Hamilton</i>'s Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p>
<p>This will be the 13th show she has directed, produced, and choreographed for teens/young adults in New Mexico.  Past shows include <i>First Date</i>*, <i>Heathers</i>+,<i> Dirty Rotten Scoundrels</i>*, <i>Lysistrata Jones</i>*, <i>The Wedding Singer</i>+, <i>Xanadu</i>*, <i>The Drowsy Chaperone</i>, <i>13: The Musical</i>*, <i>Gypsy</i>, <i>You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown</i>, <i>The Fantasticks</i>, and <i>The Last Five Years</i>.</p>
<p>*denotes a New Mexico Premiere  +denotes an Albuquerque Premiere</p>
<p>The Impact:</p>
<p><i>Bring It On</i> has nearly 40 people involved in the production, including cast and crew members.  Many of these young people have appeared in multiple productions because of the impact the shows have made on their lives.  Devon has received multiple letters from former cast members thanking her for helping them rediscover their love for theatre and, in some cases, overcome their fears of performing in public.  </p>
<p>In addition to gaining an intensive theatre experience that many no longer receive in school due to lack of arts funding, they are also developing artistic passions that they may not have had before and building life-long friendships and connections.</p>
<p> What We Need:</p>
<p>The majority of the funds needed for this project will go towards renting the rehearsal and performance space, officially licensing the show through Music Theatre International, and providing accompaniment tracks, props, costumes, and sets.  All of Devon's shows would not have been possible without the extremely generous help of patrons and supporters like you.  Please help make this production of <i>Bring It On</i> a reality with your contribution today. Even $5 can buy a necessary prop, and $20 can costume an entire character.</p>
<p> Other Ways You Can Help:</p>
<p>Spread the word!  If you have ever been involved in or seen one of Devon's shows, you understand the kind of impact they have on both performers and audiences alike.  We urge you to tell everyone you know about this campaign and pitch in; remember, every little bit helps!</p>

<h2>The Story</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Hello, I’m TinaO. My story has already been changed because you are here. Thank you for your messiness and the <i><strong>innate brilliance </strong></i>you are. </p>
<p>Thank you for your jagged and broken bits and the genius of you that is <i><strong>often misunderstood</strong></i>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your <i><strong>shame and shouting</strong></i>. Thank you for both.</p>
<p>I love the <i><strong>fierce positions</strong></i> you take but don’t always share.</p>
<p>Thank you for your aching confusion and the <strong><i>mystery of this time.</i></strong></p>
<p><i><strong>You are a story,</strong></i> and I am devoted to the mystery of us.</p>
<p>Starting in April 2021 I will be touring my Solo-Show: O MY GOD in small venues across Canada. I will also be releasing my book: Story Stones which connects the dots between twelve Core Stories, revolution histories, creation myths, and how we are all literally stardust.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607220357/bl7q0q5xyjpswmgrec7y.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are a super-nova in the making.</p>
<p>We are descendants from the core. We live and express ourselves as a core-narrative from which we come.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>My wish and ask is that you will:</h2>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-order my book</li>
<li>Purchase tickets to my show and</li>
<li>Support my story &amp; talk-back tour here</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>It's a STORY Triple Crown. </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Without a shift in where we place our listening, we will become the very thing we are afraid of: fake news, false leaders, and fractured societies. We are already well on our way along the path. </p>
<p>Help me share the landscape of myth and story, support the healing of a trauma based narrative, and welcome a more compassionate, integrated and unflinching path to the tomorrow we are living into right now. </p>

<h2>Out on the Skinny Branches</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>If you've been around me for awhile you've probably heard me say <i>'Come out with me on the Skinny Branches.'</i> It's only in the place where we are willing to risk shaking, even falling, that new footing can happen.</p>
<p>Both of these projects has me shaking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>___________________________________</p>
<h2>THE BOOK - Story Stones...</h2>
<p> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Explains hows</strong> <i>we are literally stardust. </i>This flesh, blood and bone is made of the same materials as the galaxy of stars above us.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Challenges the Christian path</strong> <i>of one God</i> - after experiencing a call to a life of service in faith.</li>
<li>
<strong>Invites us to believe</strong> <i>there is such a thing as Core Story,</i> a narrative on the very energy we are made of and from. </li>
<li>And <strong>brings you along my own Core Story </strong>as I consistently live through story ripple after story ripple of proof that I do or do not matter. </li>
</ol>
<p>These skinny branches are shaking and this is just the book!</p>

<h2>PRE-ORDER THE BOOK</h2>
<p><strong>When you pre-order your copy of Story Stones, </strong>you are supporting the fastest delivery of my book in physical form. I am self-publishing with FriesenPress, a local and Canadian-proud publishing house who happens to be run by a sensational woman and champion of young leaders, Tammara Kennelly. We met a few years ago when we sat next to each other at a women's leadership luncheon in Victoria. My book will be in great hands. I trust her implicitly. The cost to bring my book to physical form (and get it to you), is approximately $6500. </p>
<p>The pre-sale of a personally signed copy of Story Stones will be <strong>$60. </strong></p>
<p>When 200 of you pre-buy the book - the publishing cost is covered.</p>
<p>I always say to my clients, <i>if you can't pre-sell 200 copies of your book, you aren't ready to launch one yet.</i></p>
<p>So this is me walking my talk. ;) </p>

<h2>MY SHOW - O MY GOD...</h2>
<h3><i>It seriously has me out on the skinny branches</i></h3>
<p> </p>

<p>We are 65% Oxygen, 18% Carbon, 10% Hydrogen, 3% Nitrogen, 1.5% Calcium, 1.5% Phosphorus, and trace elements such as potassium, sulfur, sodium, magnesium, boron, Selenium, Copper and Zinc. Elements come from stars. We are literally made up of stardust. </p>
<p>When stars die, the elements that were generated inside of them are swept out into space, and the next generation of stars from those elements burn and are swept out again. Everything we are originates from stardust. This cycle has been going on for thirteen billion years. Our solar system is considered to be less than one third of that time. We are only 4.5 billion years old. </p>
<p>When you pick up a rock, something that has not and will not ever decompose, you are holding a remnant of The Big Bang in your hands. </p>
<p>A visual I offer my story clients is this: </p>
<p><i>We come into the world as a story stone, with a divine narrative of who we are tucked inside. We are made AS something FOR something. I happen to be someone who loves water, so I  imagine that as the stone of our being meets the ocean of our life, our story ripples out. Each ripple is a point of expansion of the story we are made as.</i></p>
<p>Think about a star’s gravity pulling it in as its nuclear force expands it out. This is our story ripple.</p>
<p>Not only are we a Story Stone, but we are also a star, and overtime, a<i> supernova </i>in the making.</p>
<p>We begin as stardust, words and impulses, like an enormous cloud of gas and dust many light-years across. The double-edge sword of our story, which is our medicine <i>(gravity)</i> and our poison <i>(force)</i>, continues to collect to our core with every contraction and ripple until our outward pressure balances our inward pull. As the core of our story collects, contracts and releases, it begins to reach the outer layers and that’s when this story stone begins to shine. </p>
<p>We are made AS something FOR something. We are made to shine as the star we are.</p>

<p>Only to die of a hunger strike</p>
<p>Because she refused to be married to a Pagan king. </p>

<p>And a witch,</p>
<p>Except she wasn’t a witch</p>
<p><br/>She just knew how to take the fall for another woman, for protection,</p>
<p>And did.</p>
<p>And then at 24 was tortured without mercy</p>
<p>Flogged along a path between six parishes</p>
<p>That’s six churches for you in today’s words</p>

<p><i>Tina Overbury and Meribeth Deen helped me write my first book, a book that has been inside of me for a number of years but which I struggled getting onto the written page. </i></p>
<p><i>They helped me transform the words and content into something amazing, that is me, but I could not do on my own. They did not help me get it done in record time, because the process is one of digging deep, uncovering more of what was within me and they guided me at every step to pull out ‘more’ from ‘me’. </i></p>
<p><i>They don’t take over. They guide. They coach. They ask. They listen. They challenge. They understand. </i></p>
<p><i>As a team, there is this intersection of gifts, talents, experience and personality that dovetail beautifully. I am a more confident writer because of these two. They are loyal and supportive. They are with you every step of the way.  Without them, I would have had a book. That’s it. With them, I have my life work, my words, my creation in a beautiful format that is now ready for the world to see. Know this! This is the team you want to have walk beside you through the process of writing and completing a book because they honor ‘you’ and your work.  I highly recommend Meribeth and Tina.  I will hire them again for Book Two.</i></p>

</div></div>","The Story
 
Hello, I’m TinaO. My story has already been changed because you are here. Thank you for your messiness and the innate brilliance you are. 
Thank you for your jagged and broken bits and the genius of you that is often misunderstood.
Thank you for your shame and shouting. Thank you for both.
I love the fierce positions you take but don’t always share.
Thank you for your aching confusion and the mystery of this time.
You are a story, and I am devoted to the mystery of us.
Starting in April 2021 I will be touring my Solo-Show: O MY GOD in small venues across Canada. I will also be releasing my book: Story Stones which connects the dots between twelve Core Stories, revolution histories, creation myths, and how we are all literally stardust.
 

 
We are a super-nova in the making.
We are descendants from the core. We live and express ourselves as a core-narrative from which we come.
 
My wish and ask is that you will:
 

Pre-order my book
Purchase tickets to my show and
Support my story & talk-back tour here

 
 
It's a STORY Triple Crown. 
 
Without a shift in where we place our listening, we will become the very thing we are afraid of: fake news, false leaders, and fractured societies. We are already well on our way along the path. 
Help me share the landscape of myth and story, support the healing of a trauma based narrative, and welcome a more compassionate, integrated and unflinching path to the tomorrow we are living into right now. 
 


 
 
Out on the Skinny Branches
 
If you've been around me for awhile you've probably heard me say 'Come out with me on the Skinny Branches.' It's only in the place where we are willing to risk shaking, even falling, that new footing can happen.
Both of these projects has me shaking.
 
___________________________________
THE BOOK - Story Stones...
 


Explains hows we are literally stardust. This flesh, blood and bone is made of the same materials as the galaxy of stars above us.  

Challenges the Christian path of one God - after experiencing a call to a life of service in faith.

Invites us to believe there is such a thing as Core Story, a narrative on the very energy we are made of and from. 
And brings you along my own Core Story as I consistently live through story ripple after story ripple of proof that I do or do not matter. 

These skinny branches are shaking and this is just the book!
 
LISTEN to excerpts from the book here:
14 Minutes: A Supernova Death

 
10 Minutes: Hands Down


 

 
PRE-ORDER THE BOOK
When you pre-order your copy of Story Stones, you are supporting the fastest delivery of my book in physical form. I am self-publishing with FriesenPress, a local and Canadian-proud publishing house who happens to be run by a sensational woman and champion of young leaders, Tammara Kennelly. We met a few years ago when we sat next to each other at a women's leadership luncheon in Victoria. My book will be in great hands. I trust her implicitly. The cost to bring my book to physical form (and get it to you), is approximately $6500. 
The pre-sale of a personally signed copy of Story Stones will be $60. 
When 200 of you pre-buy the book - the publishing cost is covered.
I always say to my clients, if you can't pre-sell 200 copies of your book, you aren't ready to launch one yet.
So this is me walking my talk. ;)

MY SHOW - O MY GOD...
It seriously has me out on the skinny branches
 
I never set out to write a show about witches, patriarchy, and the lasting effect on society when six generations of children watch their mother's be accused and tortured to the point of hysteria so that they do indeed look and sound like the very witches they were accused of being.
Yet here I am.
I sat down to a blank page to write a clown show confessional about a 15,000 year old footprint and the many faces of God - and somehow in making that commitment, an Irish War Goddess named Morrigan came to visit... and now we're here. 
This show is important to me on many levels, but mostly because I LOVE and deeply value LIVE THEATRE and its ability to lovingly and compassionately say the unthinkable. 
These are unthinkable times. 
We could all use a safe place to say, see, and feel the unthinkable. 
I believe we're entering the Age of the Artist, and this show is my physical, mental, emotional and spiritual contribution to dismantling the dominance model we've been in  for fall too long.

Annnnnd it's my 50th BIRTHDAY
So every show is a chance to 
celebrate my birthday with me.

We are 65% Oxygen, 18% Carbon, 10% Hydrogen, 3% Nitrogen, 1.5% Calcium, 1.5% Phosphorus, and trace elements such as potassium, sulfur, sodium, magnesium, boron, Selenium, Copper and Zinc. Elements come from stars. We are literally made up of stardust. 
When stars die, the elements that were generated inside of them are swept out into space, and the next generation of stars from those elements burn and are swept out again. Everything we are originates from stardust. This cycle has been going on for thirteen billion years. Our solar system is considered to be less than one third of that time. We are only 4.5 billion years old. 
When you pick up a rock, something that has not and will not ever decompose, you are holding a remnant of The Big Bang in your hands. 
A visual I offer my story clients is this: 
We come into the world as a story stone, with a divine narrative of who we are tucked inside. We are made AS something FOR something. I happen to be someone who loves water, so I  imagine that as the stone of our being meets the ocean of our life, our story ripples out. Each ripple is a point of expansion of the story we are made as.
Think about a star’s gravity pulling it in as its nuclear force expands it out. This is our story ripple.
Not only are we a Story Stone, but we are also a star, and overtime, a supernova in the making.
We begin as stardust, words and impulses, like an enormous cloud of gas and dust many light-years across.

Tina Overbury and Meribeth Deen helped me write my first book, a book that has been inside of me for a number of years but which I struggled getting onto the written page. 
They helped me transform the words and content into something amazing, that is me, but I could not do on my own. They did not help me get it done in record time, because the process is one of digging deep, uncovering more of what was within me and they guided me at every step to pull out ‘more’ from ‘me’. 
They don’t take over. They guide. They coach. They ask. They listen. They challenge. They understand. 
As a team, there is this intersection of gifts, talents, experience and personality that dovetail beautifully. I am a more confident writer because of these two. They are loyal and supportive. They are with you every step of the way.  Without them, I would have had a book. That’s it. With them, I have my life work, my words, my creation in a beautiful format that is now ready for the world to see. Know this! This is the team you want to have walk beside you through the process of writing and completing a book because they honor ‘you’ and your work.  I highly recommend Meribeth and Tina.  I will hire them again for Book Two.
