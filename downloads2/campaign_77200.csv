<h3>Why make Local Scene</h3>
<p>My name is Seth Reynolds and I founded Local Scene for two main reasons.  First, I have moved around a bit and noticed that there are not any good websites to help an individual get integrated into their community.  Hopefully you have a friend who can help you get your bearings, but I feel with the power of the internet we can do much better. Second, I am a big proponent of shopping locally.  Local businesses tend to be much more concerned with sustainable business practices.  Also, shopping at local businesses greatly helps local economies by keeping the money spent in the local economy.  Typically the greatest challenge for small business is getting sufficient exposure.  As the internet is the great democatizer we can use it to make it easy for people to connect with local business.  Local Scene will solve both of these issues.</p>
<div>
<h3>Why get funding on Indiegogo</h3>
<p>Local Scene is attempting to raise $40,000 to pay for hosting costs, data entry, and feature development.  Our choice to seek funding through Indiegogo was deliberate.  The primary purpose of Local Scene is to highlight local businesses and events so we do not want to need ad revenue from large corporations.  Our goal is to create a website to give voice to the ""shop locally"" grassroots movement and so we are asking for your help in ensuring this project has the finances to stay true to this vision.</p>
<p>All funding we receive will go to supporting the website and moblie apps developed by Local Scene.  If we do not reach our full goal we may have to scrap a few proposed functions such as the social clubs portion of the site or a moblie app, but we we should be able to accomplish the core goals.  However, if we manage to raise more then our goal we may be able to implement even more advanced feature or expand the geographic reach of the site sooner.  Because of the nature of the project, we can scale up or down to ensure all of the money donated is used to advance Local Scene and its goals.</p>
<p>The perks we will provide to our donors fall into two categories. First, we will send out T-Shirts or Hoodies so you can show your solidarity with the goals of the site.  Second, we will give membership perks to small businesses for those who are willing to contribute large amounts.  But you do not have to own a small business to receive this perk, you can give it to your favorite local business.  Thus your contribution can both support the cause Local Scene is championing and help support your favorite small business.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Value of Local Scene</h3>
<p>Everybody wants to have somewhere to go, something to do and someone to see.  Local Scene aims to ensure that is always true.  We want to use the internet to reinvigorate the lifeblood of communities.  The way to do this is making it easy for someone to figure out what to do, whether their interest is as basic as ""I want Japanese food"" or as specific as ""I want a divey, Chicago style pizza joint which uses locally sourced ingredients"".  But it should encompass enough to enable people to find activities as diverse as attending a Turkish cultural festival or listening to an indie bluegrass garage band.</p>
<p>But besides making it easy for people to find things to do, this site will help the local business community.  Supporting the local business community is the best way to improve our communities. First, it keeps money local.  This allows business owners to hire more local workers and make improvements to their business.  Also, local business are more inclinded to invest in the community by sponsoring clubs and schools.  Plus supporting local businesses allows a community to develop a richer and more diverse community rather than simply having the monolithic big box stores and chains.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Supporting Your Local Scene</h3>
<p>The most important way an individual can support our project is by supporting their local community by attending events and shopping locally.  But we would also hope that you tell your friends about this project.  Please share this project on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest.  Also, please sign up for our mailing list on <a href=""http://www.localscene.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.localscene.net</a> so we can give you updates even after this campaign finishes.  We hope to engage with everyone who is passionate about improving their local community, not just those who can afford to sponsor the development.  Finally, please visit our site frequently.  Although we cannot effectively hold physical rallies, web traffic can just as effectively communicate solidarity.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone for anything you do to help.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>And all you want to do is hold the device in your hands right now, don't you? Well, that's exactly the same thing I want to do!<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>I decided to be pro-active. I have no funds to become a backer of this project. But, since this is a crowd-funding platform, I decided to start a campaign to support me on getting this device. That's probably a crazy idea, but who knows! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Becoming a backer of this project will help me to support the Ubuntu Edge and hopefully get it all the way to it's goal of $32m, It's a HUGE goal but Open Source has always surprised me at it's huge community influence and support that those involved have for one another and their respective projects.</p>
<p>Inlcuded with all perks of $10 and up I will write you a personal thank you note from the bottom of my heart! I truly appreciate all the support that anyone can show even if they don't have money to support, a nice comment will still warm the hearts of all those that see it!</p>
<p>all $100 + perks will get an AWESOME drawing (I'd do it myself but I suck at drawing but I can definately beg one of my friends to do it for me!!) of anything they want really, wether it's a pet or a name or anything really!! (Well, maybe not ANYTHING but you kinda get the point right?)</p>
<p>If you pledge $400 or MORE I will make a youtube video WITH the Ubuntu Edge once it arrives specifically for you to say thank you for your support or if you don't want a video all to yourself then i can give you a shoutout in one of my other videos for all your AWESOMNESS!!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting this campaign you allow me to place an order for the Ubuntu Edge, to become one of the backers. This will increase YOUR chance to get YOUR device by about 0,0025 percent. Not so bad for just $10 extra, right?</p>
<p>Once my campaign reaches it's goal, which is $860 for Ubuntu Edge device and for the shipping costs, I will contribute to <a href=""http://igg.me/at/ubuntuedge/x/4049336"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"" title=""this campaign"">this campaign.</a></p>
<p>Everything I promise is to use the device proudly, showing the power of crowd-funding, showing the power of ubuntu. showing the power of the community.</p>

<p><strong><em>Gabberz mission is to help children from all walks of life develop a powerful voice to influence the future of their world. Our self-paced public speaking coaching program helps build confidence and leadership skills in children , enabling a new generation of doers... of builders... of leaders who will mold a bright, positive, and productive future.</em></strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""Overview Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/768803/pictures/full/20130421130954-Overview_Banner.jpg?1366574997"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Gabberz is a multi-level, activity-based coaching program provided through a detailed and <strong>kid-friendly activity-based guidebook</strong> and supplementary materials that lead kids through the building blocks needed to <strong>gain the confidence to express themselves</strong> in any situation.</p>
<p>Starting with a simple speech we provide, the student delivers an easy-to-read presentation in front of his or her immediate family. Then <strong>the program builds foundational skills through fun, exciting, and surprising exercises</strong> that escalate as the student builds experience, confidence, and the skills to deliver more complicated speeches to progressively larger audiences (building at the student's own pace and comfort level).</p>
<p>As the student progresses through the program and <strong>gains confidence</strong>, the levels become much <strong>more rigorous and adventurous</strong>. See the sections below on ""how"" Gabberz works and ""why"" kids need the program.</p>
<p><img alt=""What is Campaign About Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/768857/pictures/full/20130421144351-What_is_This_Campaign_Banner.jpg?1366580634"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why do I need your help?</strong> Your contributions will help me provide the program to kids from challenging and limited backgrounds. <strong>These kids are the ones who need most to feel like they are making a positive impact on their world</strong>.</p>
<p>For example, I've very recently begun working with the dedicated and wonderful folks at a private school in one of the poorest counties in the nation where opportunities for these children are nearly non-existent. The heart-breaking stories of what these kids endure on a daily basis is beyond what most of us could even imagine. <strong>I've offered to develop, produce, and deliver a coaching program specifically for their kids at zero cost to them</strong>. This is in addition to my focus on single-student programs.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Why Do Kids Need Gabberz Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/768860/pictures/full/20130421140508-Why_do_Kids_Banner.jpg?1366578310"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Imagine if, in every aspect of a person's life (school, college, career, courting, family, etc.), they not only had the confidence to speak up and express themselves, but had an <strong>INNER DRIVE to seek out opportunities to speak</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine if they could walk up to anyone, anytime, anywhere, and <strong>talk confidently</strong> with them. Imagine them looking forward excitedly to that job interview, giving that speech in school, being the center of conversation in social situations, or <strong>just standing up confidently and expressing their ideas</strong> at a business meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Many kids and adults are absolutely terrified</strong> of those exact things and are held back in life because of it. <strong>Jerry Seinfeld</strong> famously once said something along the lines of, ""<em>according to polls, most people at a funeral would rather be in the coffin than giving the eulogy</em>."" I don't know how true that is, but the <strong>Fear of Public Speaking tops fear of death in many polls</strong>.</p>
<p>The <em>fear and terror of speaking</em> (whether to 1 person or to 100) is a <strong>real and debilitating phobia</strong> that holds people back, stunts their careers, and results in awkward social situations that limit their prospects and feed their fears even further. But, this is a <strong>learned phobia</strong> and it doesn't need to be that way for anyone.</p>
<p><em>Imagine if our children were to learn the joy of public speaking at an early age, </em><strong><em>before</em></strong><em> the fear could possibly develop... </em><strong><em>Imagine where they could go in life. Imagine what they could do.</em></strong></p>
<p> <img alt=""Why Does Gabberz Work Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/768862/pictures/full/20130421140539-Why_Does_Gabberz_Work_Banner.jpg?1366578345"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I like to compare Gabberz to learning to ride a bike as a kid. At first, <strong>you're scared</strong>. You don't know what's going to happen. You don't know if you're going to fall and get hurt. <em>Are people going to laugh at you</em>? Ridicule you?</p>
<p>So, you try ""just a little"". <em>Just enough</em> that you won't get hurt if you fall. <strong>Your family is there to encourage and guide you</strong>. But you're still scared. Tentative.</p>
<p>After a few wobbly tries, you begin to feel like maybe, <em>just maybe</em>, this is something you could do if you kept at it. <strong>So you keep trying</strong>. Slow. Wobbly. Unsure. But in the back of your mind you start to realize that<strong> this could be fun</strong>.</p>
<p>After a while, you take the training wheels off. Maybe you try pavement instead of grass. Work your way up slowly, at your own pace, still concerned about getting hurt. <strong>But then... </strong><em><strong>once</strong></em><strong>, </strong><em><strong>finally</strong></em><strong>, you get up enough speed to </strong><em><strong>feel the wind in your face</strong></em>.</p>
<p>From that point on, you're hooked. You push a <em>little</em> harder, <strong>looking for a little more wind</strong>, starting to gain a little confidence. Beginning to understand that, not only is this something you <em>can</em> do, but <strong>it's something you ""</strong><em><strong>want</strong></em><strong>"" to do</strong>.</p>
<p>That's Gabberz in a nutshell. <strong>THE WIND IN YOUR FACE!</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Girl on Bike Image"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/767998/pictures/full/20130420214501-bike_girl_smile_pink_helmet_gabberz.jpg?1366519506"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Just like learning to ride a bike, or swim, or do algebra, comfort comes from familiarity. Gabberz starts out very simply and safely with the goal of just getting the student up in front of their immediate family and doing simple foundational things.</p>
<p>Each lesson is designed to build on the previous ones using <strong>fun and interactive methodologies</strong> that are entertaining for both the student and their audience. There are many different types of lessons and the student's goal (in addition to continued acclimatization to speaking in front of others) is to learn that <strong>even the most boring topic can be brought to life</strong> by an animated speaker who is <strong>having fun</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt=""Boy Scream Image"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/768000/pictures/full/20130420214630-Boy_Scream_eyes_closed_with_Gabberz_logo.jpg?1366519593"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>And that is only one, tiny part of the puzzle we use to help the student <strong>build a foundation of confidence and skill</strong>. Using many tiny steps like these, we <strong>build on that confidence</strong> and keep stretching and challenging the students. <strong>Our goal in every lesson is to make it fun and positive</strong> so that the student will begin seeking out reasons to speak in front of others.</p>
<p><em><strong>Imagine the advantage this training and skill will provide these kids in college, career, and life!</strong></em></p>
<p><img alt=""Information on Rewards Banner"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/768867/pictures/full/20130421140852-Rewards_Banner.jpg?1366578536"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Note that you can contribute any amount from <strong>$1 on up</strong>, not just what's listed to the right (all contributions will give you access to ""<strong>Supporters Only</strong>"" updates and inside information). You can also request that we not provide you any of the perks you earned.</p>
<h2>A Little Different</h2>
<p>We're a little different than many campaigns on Indiegogo in that our perks aren't really about providing contributors with <strong>super nifty gadgets</strong> like a secret decoder watch that plays videos while automatically organizing your life and polishing your shoes. <strong>We do have a few cool things</strong> like the shirts, copies of the coaching program, actual coaching, and other simple rewards to thank you.</p>
<p>However, every dollar we spend on our wonderful supporters is a dollar that we can't spend on reaching out to help these kids. <strong>They are the ones who get the real rewards</strong> and will benefit from this program when you support us. We hope you'll <strong>believe in the importance of this</strong> as much as we do and contribute as much as you can.</p>

<p>Please help us complete the program and bring confidence to these kids to give them the power to create an awesome world for themselves. Your support is <strong>greatly appreciated</strong>!

The heart-breaking stories of what these kids endure on a daily basis is beyond what most of us could even imagine. I've offered to develop, produce, and deliver a coaching program specifically for their kids at zero cost to them. This is in addition to my focus on single-student programs.
 
Imagine if, in every aspect of a person's life (school, college, career, courting, family, etc.), they not only had the confidence to speak up and express themselves, but had an INNER DRIVE to seek out opportunities to speak.
Imagine if they could walk up to anyone, anytime, anywhere, and talk confidently with them. Imagine them looking forward excitedly to that job interview, giving that speech in school, being the center of conversation in social situations, or just standing up confidently and expressing their ideas at a business meeting.
Many kids and adults are absolutely terrified of those exact things and are held back in life because of it. Jerry Seinfeld famously once said something along the lines of, ""according to polls, most people at a funeral would rather be in the coffin than giving the eulogy."" I don't know how true that is, but the Fear of Public Speaking tops fear of death in many polls.
The fear and terror of speaking (whether to 1 person or to 100) is a real and debilitating phobia that holds people back, stunts their careers, and results in awkward social situations that limit their prospects and feed their fears even further. But, this is a learned phobia and it doesn't need to be that way for anyone.
Imagine if our children were to learn the joy of public speaking at an early age, before the fear could possibly develop... Imagine where they could go in life. Imagine what they could do.
 
I like to compare Gabberz to learning to ride a bike as a kid. At first, you're scared. You don't know what's going to happen. You don't know if you're going to fall and get hurt. Are people going to laugh at you? Ridicule you?
So, you try ""just a little"". Just enough that you won't get hurt if you fall. Your family is there to encourage and guide you. But you're still scared. Tentative.
After a few wobbly tries, you begin to feel like maybe, just maybe, this is something you could do if you kept at it. So you keep trying. Slow. Wobbly. Unsure. But in the back of your mind you start to realize that this could be fun.
After a while, you take the training wheels off. Maybe you try pavement instead of grass. Work your way up slowly, at your own pace, still concerned about getting hurt. But then... once, finally, you get up enough speed to feel the wind in your face.
From that point on, you're hooked. You push a little harder, looking for a little more wind, starting to gain a little confidence. Beginning to understand that, not only is this something you can do, but it's something you ""want"" to do.
That's Gabberz in a nutshell. THE WIND IN YOUR FACE!


Just like learning to ride a bike, or swim, or do algebra, comfort comes from familiarity. Gabberz starts out very simply and safely with the goal of just getting the student up in front of their immediate family and doing simple foundational things.
Each lesson is designed to build on the previous ones using fun and interactive methodologies that are entertaining for both the student and their audience. There are many different types of lessons and the student's goal (in addition to continued acclimatization to speaking in front of others) is to learn that even the most boring topic can be brought to life by an animated speaker who is having fun.

And that is only one, tiny part of the puzzle we use to help the student build a foundation of confidence and skill. Using many tiny steps like these, we build on that confidence and keep stretching and challenging the students. Our goal in every lesson is to make it fun and positive so that the student will begin seeking out reasons to speak in front of others.
Imagine the advantage this training and skill will provide these kids in college, career, and life!

Note that you can contribute any amount from $1 on up, not just what's listed to the right (all contributions will give you access to ""Supporters Only"" updates and inside information). You can also request that we not provide you any of the perks you earned.
A Little Different
We're a little different than many campaigns on Indiegogo in that our perks aren't really about providing contributors with super nifty gadgets like a secret decoder watch that plays videos while automatically organizing your life and polishing your shoes. We do have a few cool things like the shirts, copies of the coaching program, actual coaching, and other simple rewards to thank you.
However, every dollar we spend on our wonderful supporters is a dollar that we can't spend on reaching out to help these kids. They are the ones who get the real rewards and will benefit from this program when you support us. We hope you'll believe in the importance of this as much as we do and contribute as much as you can.

Please help us complete the program and bring confidence to these kids to give them the power to create an awesome world for themselves. Your support is greatly appreciated! You can also help by spreading the word far and wide to help us reach as many supporters as possible. Please use the simple link, www.GoToGab.com.
Please consider supporting our mission and helping us give these kids a voice!
Thanks!

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p></p>
<p>To get a water tank is actually a bit complicated due to the fact that they are on an island. First, the tank needs to be transported from Honiara (the capital of the Solomons Islands, situated at the island of Guadalcanal). Next, in order to level and secure the tank, we will need to build a small cement platform. These building materials will travel from Malaita island to Fo’ondo. Finally we will need pipes, plumbing and men power to complete the installation of the water tank, which means salary for the local workers. With more money we can even build a toilet or latrine! Can you imagine how amazing it would be to be able to go from a hole in the ground to new toilets? Stored water for dry seasons, and bonus toilets for a healthier condition, we are counting on you!</p>

<p>My name is Monti Panzica and along with my wife, Angela, we opened Red Mosquito Raceway in November of 2012. Red Mosquito Raceway (RMR) is an indoor carpet racing track for radio control cars. It is located just outside of Cincinnati, Ohio in the small town of Bativa.</p>
<p>I have been racing remote control (r/c) cars for over 20 year. I even work inside the r/c racing world as a leading producer of r/c racing tires. Needless to say, r/c racing is my life, hobby, and passion (beside Angela!). I enjoy r/c racing because it brings people and families together for friendly competition. Remote control racing is open to everyone regardless of age, experience, and income. If you enjoy competition and have a thirst for fun and excitement r/c racing is for you!</p>
<p>Over the past 8 months, Angela and I have spent time, money, and countless hours bringing my dream of owning my own track to reality. The track has brought together a community of racers, but we still need some additional help to better serve the patrons of the track.</p>
<p>To make this dream a full success, I need additional funding for various projects.  </p>

<h3>Picture This...<br/>

<p>Picture This...
You wake up, look in the mirror and realize you are in need of some attention from a barber. You head down to the barbershop where you notice that everyone working looks as though they have stepped back in time. There is no over abundance of items hanging on the walls and the atmosphere is distinct with a classic, clean appearance with a comfortable vibe. You are greeted with a handshake and a welcome to the shop. You sit down in a chair to wait and watch the barbers in the shop do their thing while the soulful Billy Holiday plays quietly in the background. The shop keep offers you a beverage to nurse while you wait and eventually finish off during your appointment. You engage in a friendly conversation when your beverage arrives and notice that the track has changed to Witchcraft by Frank Sinatra. A gentleman approaches, introduces himself with a handshake and invites you over to the chair. You sit down, tell the barber what you need done and he instantly goes to work while keeping the conversation engaging and between friends. A few minutes go by and Hound Dog by Elvis has now come on. You are at the bottom of your beverage, your hair is done, styled and you smell good. The gentleman walks you over to the counter and finishes the appointment off with a handshake while the shop keep takes payment which is well below $20 for your new look. You are invited back and offered a customer appreciation card which will ensure that after a few visits, your cut will be on the house. On your way out you take notice of the product on the shelving. Turning around, you pick some up to keep you looking good until your next visit. As Rockaway Beach by The Ramones comes on the radio you notice the signage on the counter showcasing the on-site and in-shop wedding services. You ask about the details as you are part of a wedding party in a few months. A barber will actually travel to your location and provide haircuts for the grooms party and company or you have the option of booking the shop after hours to come in and enjoy the whole experience of being inside the barbershop itself. As you step out of the shop Get Rhythm by Johnny Cash comes on the radio and another sign catches your eye offering free barbering services to men who are currently down on their luck and are out of work. Exiting the shop to finish off your day you realize you have a few extra dollars in your pocket and are feeling satisfied from the top notch customer service you just received in a relaxing, welcoming, and comfortable environment.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Now that you know</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This campaign is to help me reach my goal of opening Sailor Bup's Barbershop, a throwback barbershop offering men's traditional barbering services at an attractive price point and keeping the men of Halifax looking good while offering an inviting environment. In addition to traditional services, Sailor Bup's will also be offering a community outreach program to unemployed men getting back into the work force, themed events in the shop, onsite wedding cuts for the groom and groomsmen as well as much more along the path and progression of this venture.  Keep reading for more information - I hope to see you on opening week with your free cut coupons in hand.</p>
<h3>Where Your Money Goes &amp; Return For You</h3>
<p>My goal is very small as the majority of this project has been funded out of my own pocket. $5000 is the goal for this campaign. That's it! The money will be entirely allocated to cover startup costs. As I am a devoted supporter of local business, the money will be given to local designers, web developers, photographers/videographers, printers, et cetera.  Not a penny of this money will go toward a large corporation or non-local business, where possible. As a way to keep local small business successful, the concept of keeping money out of the banks and in return offering product and services to the customer is front of mind in this venture. The purchase of any perk will offer you significant value in both product and service. <br/><br/>Shipping is available all across Canada. You will be prompted to throw in your address so I can get everything to you with an estimated delivery of December 1st.<br/><br/>*Logo designed by Jane Tooker - independent designer</p>
<h3>The End Result</h3>
<p>As a contributor, you are both helping to build something great for the community in Halifax and taking a charitable step to help unemployed men build confidence when trying to get back into the workforce through our outreach program. Please remember that this is not a way of asking you to give your hard-earned money for no return. You receive a significant amount of value in each reward level as well as a personalized thank you hanging in the shop that will greet you every time you come in. </p>
<h3>Can't Donate?</h3>
<p>Completely understood. Maybe someone you know would like to take advantage of this start-up offer. Please share this campaign! Get the word out, and just by doing that you will have contributed to the success of this project.</p>

Turning around, you pick some up to keep you looking good until your next visit. As Rockaway Beach by The Ramones comes on the radio you notice the signage on the counter showcasing the on-site and in-shop wedding services. You ask about the details as you are part of a wedding party in a few months. A barber will actually travel to your location and provide haircuts for the grooms party and company or you have the option of booking the shop after hours to come in and enjoy the whole experience of being inside the barbershop itself. As you step out of the shop Get Rhythm by Johnny Cash comes on the radio and another sign catches your eye offering free barbering services to men who are currently down on their luck and are out of work. Exiting the shop to finish off your day you realize you have a few extra dollars in your pocket and are feeling satisfied from the top notch customer service you just received in a relaxing, welcoming, and comfortable environment.
Now that you know

This campaign is to help me reach my goal of opening Sailor Bup's Barbershop, a throwback barbershop offering men's traditional barbering services at an attractive price point and keeping the men of Halifax looking good while offering an inviting environment. In addition to traditional services, Sailor Bup's will also be offering a community outreach program to unemployed men getting back into the work force, themed events in the shop, onsite wedding cuts for the groom and groomsmen as well as much more along the path and progression of this venture.  Keep reading for more information - I hope to see you on opening week with your free cut coupons in hand.
Where Your Money Goes & Return For You
My goal is very small as the majority of this project has been funded out of my own pocket. $5000 is the goal for this campaign. That's it! The money will be entirely allocated to cover startup costs. As I am a devoted supporter of local business, the money will be given to local designers, web developers, photographers/videographers, printers, et cetera.  Not a penny of this money will go toward a large corporation or non-local business, where possible. As a way to keep local small business successful, the concept of keeping money out of the banks and in return offering product and services to the customer is front of mind in this venture. The purchase of any perk will offer you significant value in both product and service. Shipping is available all across Canada. You will be prompted to throw in your address so I can get everything to you with an estimated delivery of December 1st.*Logo designed by Jane Tooker - independent designer
The End Result
As a contributor, you are both helping to build something great for the community in Halifax and taking a charitable step to help unemployed men build confidence when trying to get back into the workforce through our outreach program. Please remember that this is not a way of asking you to give your hard-earned money for no return. You receive a significant amount of value in each reward level as well as a personalized thank you hanging in the shop that will greet you every time you come in. 
Can't Donate?
Completely understood. Maybe someone you know would like to take advantage of this start-up offer. Please share this campaign! Get the word out, and just by doing that you will have contributed to the success of this project.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

There is a terrible injustice being perpetrated against two very good people here in our community, both of whom have served our church and the wider community faithfully for over ten years.</p>
<p><strong>What's Going On</strong></p>
<p>Two years ago, in 2010, our bishop, the Most Rev. Stephen J. Enea, in anticipation of receiving a large pledged donation, authorized the commencement of the restoration of our cathedral church. Work began on the foundation and repointing of the exterior of the building. The total cost of the work done to date is $450,000. Due to unforeseen circumstances, the donation was not given and the church could not pay the bills. As a result, several of the contractors got angry but rather than suing the diocese in civil court proceedings, they filed criminal charges against our bishop, the Most Rev. Stephen J. Enea and Philip G. Barker, Jr., the dioceses’ chief operating officer.</p>
<p>In August of this year, Archbishop Stephen and Mr. Barker were indicted, arrested and charged with several counts of Grand Larceny and a charge of<br/>Scheme to Defraud. Both the Archbishop and Mr. Barker are set to be tried on<br/>December 2<sup>nd.</sup></p>
<p>The claim by the District Attorney is that there was never any intent to pay the bills,<br/>even though the church was paying one of the subcontractors of one of the<br/>complainants for months before the complaint was filed with the DA. In addition,<br/>there were several public efforts (for example, our annual parish festival<br/>which is intended to raise funds for the restoration of the church) made to<br/>raise funds to pay the bills. Last month, through the generosity of a supporter of the Church, two of the bills, totaling approximately $15,000 have been paid were paid but the judge has refused to drop those two charges.</p>
<p>What is being done here is the result of an act of hate and vengeance on the part of the contractors involved. From the very beginning, this should have been a civil<br/>case and not a criminal case. No one denies the right of creditors to sue for<br/>money they are owed but to inflict criminal charges and the way it has all been<br/>done smacks of religious persecution and an effort to discredit and destroy the bishop and the Church. We also believe this is an effort on the part of the District Attorney<br/>to make a name for himself by supposedly protecting the public from another allegedly ""bad priest"".</p>
<p>The District Attorney’s involvement in this matter and the way in which the entire matter is being handled has done far more damage to the church and our community than what has been done to the creditors. The complainants, with the willing help of the District Attorney, are intent upon destroying our Archbishop, administrator and our<br/>Church. They are driving people away from the Church. Further, the judge in charge of the case has prohibited the archbishop from performing his priestly ministry by forbidding him to travel outside the area thus violating his right to religious freedom. This means he cannot serve Divine Liturgy in other communities, visit the sick, bury the dead, etc. Because of some of the negative publicity, which, because it involves a priest, has furthered already problematic anti-clerical sentiments. Because of this, the bishop has received hate mail because of one of the articles that has appeared in<br/>the local newspaper and the coverage on local television stations.</p>
<p>Our intent by this fundraising campaign is first and foremost to raise the money<br/>needed to pay off all the remaining restoration bills and second, to create an<br/>awareness of the injustice which is being done to our bishop, Mr. Barker and<br/>our faith community and of the fact that there is an active effort to discredit Christianity and the Church in society today.</p>
<p>We are a small Orthodox Catholic community and we need your help. Since this all<br/>began in August, we have lost so much and stand to lose even more if we don’t<br/>stop this assault now. We are asking all Christians and people of good-will to<br/>help us now. </p>
<p>Our church is by no means affluent. It is in one of the poorer sections of Utica.<br/>It has been without heat and electricity for many years now but we have continued<br/>to worship in it, even in the coldest months of the winter and oftentimes with temporary electricity provided by a gas generator. Yet, in our own poverty, we have<br/>faithfully and joyfully ministered to those of our brothers and sisters in<br/>need. We have never gone outside our community to seek help for ourselves or<br/>our own needs but now we find it necessary to reach out to the wider community<br/>so that we can continue to help others and two of our own whom we cannot help<br/>by ourselves.</p>
<p><b>What Needs to Be Done</b></p>

<p> I am a disabled stay-at-home father to my two beautiful daughters, a hobbyist mead (honey wine) maker looking to go professional, and am looking to start keeping my own bees to produce the honey needed.</p>
<p>The aim of this campaign is to help cover the costs of buying hives, bees, and the equipment needed to maintain the hives.  I want to establish an apiary before pushing to go professional with the meadery.</p>
<p>This is important to me because at the moment I live on disability, and am looking to break out of it. I want to provide a better life for my family, despite living with a handicap, and I feel beekeeping would be a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>My Story:</p>
<p>I was hit by a car at the age of 12 and left for dead. I suffered massive head trauma, as well as allergic reactions to penicillin, this caused me to have a stroke. While giving me a cat scan to figure out what happened, I had an allergic reaction to the dye used, and suffered a heart attack. They brought me back, got me stabilized, and induced me into a coma. I spent a month and a half in this coma. When I awoke I had lost the use of the left hand side of my body (due to the stroke).</p>
<p>I spent the better part of 2 years being labeled a cripple in school, struggling to learn to walk again, and believing I was nothing more than a worthless handicap.</p>
<p>Now almost 20 years later, I have learned to walk again, and seek to make something more of my life, through the keeping of bees, and the production of mead.</p>
<p> Originally our thought to get this started was that we were going to need a farm of our own, however one of the local farmers has volunteered his 75 acre farm for us to put hives on. So the cost comes down to the hives, the bees, and the basic equipment.</p>
<p>I estimate that we need roughly $2000 to truly get this project off the ground. My father has volunteered to build the hives for me in his woodshop at a cost of only $200 per hive to me. This is a third of the going market rate for similar hives. I am thinking that 6 hives will be a good start. Six hives means that I will need 6 separate packages of bees, which run roughly $100 each. And of course I will need the basic equipment for keeping the bees (veil, smoker, etc…), which runs about $200.</p>

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p><strong>On May 18, we will hold the 5th and final Marines Helping Marines Fishing Tournament at the Anchor Marina in North East, Maryland. Each year we strive to provide a fun-filled weekend for approximately 20 or more severely wounded warriors and their families.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Veterans are paired up with professional anglers who will teach them the ropes of bass fishing. Together the two will perform as a team against other anglers. The tournament is open to the public. After the tournament concludes, a barbeque will be held for all and proceeds from the day will be given to the Marines Helping Marines foundation.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><strong>These heroes are confined to the hospital for rehabilitation. Many of them cannot go home as they do not live close to the area. Through donations we are able to allow them and their families to leave the area for a weekend, meet new friends, engage in the community, and learn a little about bass fishing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need to provide each servicemember with the proper fishing equipment to compete in this tournament. Fishing companies do donate product, however that is not always enough.

we have to ask you one more time to really get behind The Idle Hour.  
Any donation at any level is really important.  But we also really need your help in 
spreading the word about this fundraiser.  It is critical.  So please pass this along to your friends and neighbors, or anyone else you think might be interested in keeping us in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The Idle Hour opened about 12 years ago on an unassuming corner in South Baltimore.  A bar has stood on the same corner ever since 1937.  When we were lucky enough to be given our turn at owning it, we respectfully reopened keeping the intimacy and warmth of an old neighborhood corner bar where you can relax with a good drink and good company, and of course great music.  We have had so much fun creating a community and sharing this with you over the years at The Idle Hour.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have recently run into a structural issue that has forced us to close our doors.  The wall behind the back bar has started to buckle to the point we are not comfortable having a bar full of people.  We already have the plans for repair, and the team we'd like to use to get the job done.  Temporary walls must be constructed, and then the compromised wall will be removed in sections and replaced with a new foundation and block wall.   What we need now is the money to move forward with this plan.  Our bank and insurance company have not offered any assistance despite our twelve year relationship.  We are trying to raise $40,000 with our fundraiser, to be matched with $40,000 of our own money.  The total amount will give us the ability to do the repairs, continue to pay the monthly bills, and get that beautiful front door reopened.<br/></p>
<p>We hope to get this process started as soon as possible so we can have the Idle Hour up and running by the end of summer.  The plan is to bring back the bar as close to what it was before.  If, however, we manage to exceed our goal, we plan to put all the extra funds towards opening our second floor.  This will give us the space to handle the busy weekends, as well as have the ability to host private events and bigger parties; perhaps even some live music from time to time.</p>
<p>We have some great incentives at various gift levels to make sure each individual gets something in return for their contribution.  To be sure, reopening the bar is the greatest reward of all, but we also want you to get something special.  From stickers to T-shirts, CD's to private events, we have something for everyone.<br/></p>
<p><b>For you Chartreuse drinkers out there, we've got a great perk - the introduction of The Idle Hour Chartreuse Bottle Club. Only fifty lucky people will be able to join this limited club.  Chartreuse VEP is very hard to come by and is rarely seen in liquor stores, let alone bars. You can become a member of the world's only VEP Bottle Club right here in South Baltimore. If this one sells out we are half way to reaching our fundraising goal!</b><br/></p>
<p>And now for a little fine print- Donations can be processed using your credit card with PayPal or billed directly.  By using the PayPal option, funds will be available to us six to eight weeks sooner than using your credit card directly,  Either option will work, but the sooner we have the funds, the sooner we can start construction. Shipping is available for most of the perks, but we would much rather deliver them to you at the bar when we reopen so we can shake your hand and say thanks in person. <br/></p>
<p>Thank you so much for the good times.  Let's keep them going.  Long live Idle Hour.<br/></p>

<p><b>Welcome to Recologie!</b></p>
<p>Hello!  We are Maria Cisneros and Judith Weber,
partners and co-founders of Recologie Lifestyle, a brand new 6000 square foot flex-space
which exists to support community engagement, healthy living, socially
responsible shopping and most of all to provide for those who wish to have a
space to call “home” when away from home and work.</p>
<p>Here you will find
an eco-conscious boutique, a vegan/vegetarian café, a gallery supporting
artists working in recycled materials, a commercial kitchen  and soon…a larger space which will
support a flexible theater, a place for workshops, classes, music, private
parties and just about everything else!</p>
<p>We have completed
about 50% of our project and are bursting with successful experiences and want
to finally finish the space that will allow many more people to enjoy and
participate in what we have created. 
We firmly believe that a PLACE needs to exist to provide an atmosphere
of community - a place to share ideas, test new projects, exchange ideas, relax,
entertain and be entertained.  We
believe that people need to connect and we want to help make that possible!</p>
<p>We have completed
the front portion of our new space and with adequate contributions we can develop the rear portion and buy new
equipment for our commercial kitchen, renovate the space to include a flexible
stage, an audio visual system to present documentary films, a sound and
lighting system to support the many artists and entertainers who would like to
develop their projects and can’t yet afford to buy their own equipment.  We want to install flooring to support
dance and air handling equipment to assure a healthy environment.  Funding will allow us to hire staff and
increase marketing to let everyone know about us.  Our space is community friendly and we want to be able to
encourage exploration and experimentation for artistic and health-oriented
programs.  </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What
You Get</b></p>
<p>We are seeking an initial amount of $20,000 to help get us going for our second phase of
development.  The funds will first
go to complete our kitchen which needs some new equipment, lighting and an
electrical upgrade.  Our space came
with a commercial kitchen but it needs to be brought up to current code!  The remaining funds will support the
open space.  We would like to install reclaimed wood flooring, a
platform for staging, general track-lighting and a stage-specific lighting
sound system.  </p>
<p>The campaign
perks we have to offer are unique and specific.  They are a sampling of what and who you will find at
Recologie.  From eco-forward
fashion to vegan dining, our perks will demonstrate the value of Recologie to
the community.</p>
<p>If we do not
reach our goal, we will at least complete the kitchen which will, in itself,
allow us to create a catering center and to support culinary classes for those
who want to learn to cook vegan/gluten free meals and learn about healthy
eating with “real food”.  The
kitchen will allow us to create a revenue stream to be able to continue our
work towards our fully equipped flex-space.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We have spent a year in development
and have successfully overcome many of our obstacles, both financial and logistical.  Your contribution will help to fully
realize our next phase and be able to fulfill the promise of what we began.</p>
<p>Recologie is a special place. It is a
space that provides a personally rewarding environment.  It is what place-makers call a ""Third
Place"" - where people can go to interact and connect with their community, a place
to network and build new relationships, to share talents and interests.  It has a vegan/vegetarian café that
offers a growing health-conscious community an alternative place to dine that
recognizes their food preferences. It supports local farmers and, in the
gallery, supports local and global artists who design and create using
repurposed and sustainable materials. 
Recologie’s mission is to raise awareness and educate about
environmental and personal well-being. 
The boutique supports Global Fair Trade products honoring fair business
practices and pays forward to support communities of creative people working to
support their villages in under-developed countries.  It is a
place that welcomes others to create their visions</p>
<p>Maria Cisneros established the
Recologie Boutique five years ago in the village of Larchmont, NY and within a
very short time discovered that her clients loved her mission and the products
she offered.  There seemed to be an
amazing need and respect for an alternative shopping experience and the success
of the boutique prompted our new partnership and the desire to incorporate the
boutique into a destination which would include food, a gallery, and a public
space.</p>
<p>Judith Weber, an artist and arts advocate,
began developing Artist Lofts in 1978 to provide affordable space in a
community environment.  In 1983 she
co-founded Media Loft, a 33,000 sq ft factory building which would make space
available to over 30 artists. In 2001 she converted it to a legal mixed-use
Artists in Residence for affordable living for artists.  The need for community is what drove
her desire to develop space and it is the need to create space for the community
that drives her passion for Recologie.</p>
<p>Together we feel that our skills and
commitment to serving the community will again be successful.</p>
<p>Recologie is about the community and
recognizes the need for a place to connect.  Those who come in are somehow immediately comfortable and
return over and over. They enjoy what we offer and very often bring us new
ideas and now have an opportunity to share them with others.  We care and everyone feels it.</p>
<p><b>Our Commitment to Success</b></p>
<p>We have
developed a comprehensive business plan which guides us through the steps of
development.  We realize that by
creating a complex business which needs to develop concurrent revenue streams,
we have taken on a challenge.  We
are confident that by aligning each of these businesses (food, entertainment,
events, retail and exhibition) with a singular mission we can integrate the
goals and measure the results making it possible to re-balance as we grow.  </p><p>Maria established the successful
original Recologie and has many years of experience as a retailer as well as
also being a Naturalist Artist making her contribution to the Gallery
invaluable. Judith, an artist, arts space developer and recent President of the
New Rochelle Council on the Arts, brings an ability to envision, create and
manage the Gallery and create the outreach which builds the cultural events
calendar. </p><p>We have a Technology Director who manages and grows the website and a
team of community members with professional experience in the theater and
health industries to help guide us through the correct choices and evaluate our
success.</p>
<p>We are a
TEAM.  Each with skills and
determination to succeed and build a space that will serve us all.</p>

encourage exploration and experimentation for artistic and health-oriented
programs.  
What We Need & What
You Get
We are seeking an initial amount of $20,000 to help get us going for our second phase of
development.  The funds will first
go to complete our kitchen which needs some new equipment, lighting and an
electrical upgrade.  Our space came
with a commercial kitchen but it needs to be brought up to current code!  The remaining funds will support the
open space.  We would like to install reclaimed wood flooring, a
platform for staging, general track-lighting and a stage-specific lighting
sound system.  
The campaign
perks we have to offer are unique and specific.  They are a sampling of what and who you will find at
Recologie.  From eco-forward
fashion to vegan dining, our perks will demonstrate the value of Recologie to
the community.
If we do not
reach our goal, we will at least complete the kitchen which will, in itself,
allow us to create a catering center and to support culinary classes for those
who want to learn to cook vegan/gluten free meals and learn about healthy
eating with “real food”.  The
kitchen will allow us to create a revenue stream to be able to continue our
work towards our fully equipped flex-space.
The Impact
We have spent a year in development
and have successfully overcome many of our obstacles, both financial and logistical.  Your contribution will help to fully
realize our next phase and be able to fulfill the promise of what we began.
Recologie is a special place. It is a
space that provides a personally rewarding environment.  It is what place-makers call a ""Third
Place"" - where people can go to interact and connect with their community, a place
to network and build new relationships, to share talents and interests.  It has a vegan/vegetarian café that
offers a growing health-conscious community an alternative place to dine that
recognizes their food preferences. It supports local farmers and, in the
gallery, supports local and global artists who design and create using
repurposed and sustainable materials. 
Recologie’s mission is to raise awareness and educate about
environmental and personal well-being. 
The boutique supports Global Fair Trade products honoring fair business
practices and pays forward to support communities of creative people working to
support their villages in under-developed countries.  It is a
place that welcomes others to create their visions
Maria Cisneros established the
Recologie Boutique five years ago in the village of Larchmont, NY and within a
very short time discovered that her clients loved her mission and the products
she offered.  There seemed to be an
amazing need and respect for an alternative shopping experience and the success
of the boutique prompted our new partnership and the desire to incorporate the
boutique into a destination which would include food, a gallery, and a public
space.
Judith Weber, an artist and arts advocate,
began developing Artist Lofts in 1978 to provide affordable space in a
community environment.  In 1983 she
co-founded Media Loft, a 33,000 sq ft factory building which would make space
available to over 30 artists. In 2001 she converted it to a legal mixed-use
Artists in Residence for affordable living for artists.  The need for community is what drove
her desire to develop space and it is the need to create space for the community
that drives her passion for Recologie.
Together we feel that our skills and
commitment to serving the community will again be successful.
Recologie is about the community and
recognizes the need for a place to connect.  Those who come in are somehow immediately comfortable and
return over and over. They enjoy what we offer and very often bring us new
ideas and now have an opportunity to share them with others.  We care and everyone feels it.
Our Commitment to Success
We have
developed a comprehensive business plan which guides us through the steps of
development.  We realize that by
creating a complex business which needs to develop concurrent revenue streams,
we have taken on a challenge.  We
are confident that by aligning each of these businesses (food, entertainment,
events, retail and exhibition) with a singular mission we can integrate the
goals and measure the results making it possible to re-balance as we grow.  Maria established the successful
original Recologie and has many years of experience as a retailer as well as
also being a Naturalist Artist making her contribution to the Gallery
invaluable. Judith, an artist, arts space developer and recent President of the
New Rochelle Council on the Arts, brings an ability to envision, create and
manage the Gallery and create the outreach which builds the cultural events
calendar. We have a Technology Director who manages and grows the website and a
team of community members with professional experience in the theater and
health industries to help guide us through the correct choices and evaluate our
success.
We are a
TEAM.  Each with skills and
determination to succeed and build a space that will serve us all.

RainCatcher is a non-profit organisation dedicated to healing communities by providing clean water for children in the developing world using affordable and sustainable solutions.When I first discovered RainCatcher I was in awe at all of the progress they had made, helping literally hundreds of schools & projects around the world through the installation of water filters & water harvesting systems - with big plans on helping more.I quickly became an ambassador & from that day forward would always carry water filters in my bag that I could quickly & easily install into any schools or villages affected by contaminated water that I might come across during my travels.WHY PUSHUPSI like to create fund raising challenges that are not only engaging, but challenging to myself.  I believe raising money for charity, even if it might be a sad situation, can be done in a fun way that can further promote the cause, spread awareness & help get others involved. How This Fundraiser Will HelpIt will literally be saving lives.  We are passing thousands of children every single day who are drinking contaminated water & within minutes we can install a life saving filter that will provide clean water for years to come.I remember I was helping build a school in Guatemala earlier this year. It was 2 hrs away from the closest city in a remote village with several hundred children living there.  I ran out of bottled water & followed two small girls from the school to where the local water supply was. The stream they took me to was a major reality check.  When I saw the colour, insects & pollution of that water, I didn't want to go near it let alone drink it.  Yet here were to young children filling up a bucket just meters away from 2 pigs using the same water supply as there toilet.In this situation I was able to pull a water filter from my bag, find an old bucket & within a few minutes, provide a solution that allowed there whole village filtered water for years to come.  It cost me $50.Now imagine what it would be like to walk for miles at a time to find a similar supply.  If I can raise $10,000 it means, through the help of RainCatcher, I am going to be able to install 200 water filters to schools, villages & orphanages who desperately need clean water. That is over 100,000 children with clean water.  100,000 children who do not need to drink muddy water anymore & worry about being sick or seeing there little brother or sister die.Please take a quick look at the perks I have listed for donations & please remember - while a $100 donation is enough to provide a full village with clean drinking water for years - Just $10 alone is helping save lives!! Please Tweet or Facebook me if you do donate so I can organise a thank you letter or new PenPal from the children you are helping & please do not hesitate to contact me on the links below for any additional questions!Join me on this mission as I share everything from start to finish & don't forget to like & share this campaign!Thanking you all from the bottom of my heart in advance :)Together we can make a difference!Tyson MayrFacebook.com/TNTravellerRainCatcher.org/tysonInstagram.com/tysonTRAVELTwitter.com/tysonTRAVEL",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h1>Remote control Page Turner For Music<br/>
</h1>
<br/>
</center>

Patent pending.....<br/>In case this looks familiar, I felt obliged, for the sake of most visitors who were using cell phones, to present more information in the main video. Thanks for visiting.<br/><br/><p>It has been a long time since people began wanting a page turner, especially for music - and nothing has ever been available that is affordable, easy to set up, and simple to use. <br/><br/>Enter Cue Page Turners: take seconds to set up, are stable on a music stand or piano, use  wireless remote control, are based on sound mechanics that won't break down with normal use, they are fun to use, and they are elegant.<br/><br/>They will be quite inexpensive and everyone should support this.<br/></p>

This project goes back almost fifty years, when I started participating in the public school music program. Not that I thought of a page turner at the time. It was the experience of contending with various instruments, music stands and sheet music all at once, which left a bit of mostly forgotten frustration lurking quietly in my memory.<br/><br/>Just a few decades later a suggestion from a friend that I design a wood music stand, got me thinking about a page turner to go with it.<br/><br/>The basic idea was simple; I wanted to emulate an arm and two fingers. From there it turned into a drawing on the blackboard. Now it just wanted a turning mechanism. I was obsessed by now, so, gathered whatever scraps of metal and plastic I could find around my shop, then ran to my favorite hardware store, spent an hour there and bought a bunch of generic stuff I could make comply with my plans.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/202503/files/20131116154147-color.jpg?1384645307"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
Arriving back to my shop, I spread out my horde on a work table. For a long while, I stared at my horde, then at my blackboard art and back and forth. Eventually the parts desired began to stick out from the crowd. With some alterations, I had what is called a dry assembled prototype. From there, it was easy to determine what was needed to make these parts cooperate in turning a page back and forth, (for repeat sections).<br/><br/>Ordinarily, when I finish with a design it gets built. In this case, that did not happen. The reason is that I could not afford the casts that are necessary for plastic injection. This is how the plastic components are made. There were no 3d printers at the time. I committed the project to a set of mechanical drawings and put it on the proverbial shelf.<br/><br/>Late this last spring, I went to the Amazon website, and got distracted by some comments under the kindle product. The one that caught my eye was from a customer who said that a reasonable mechanical page turner would be preferable to a computer screen. I agreed, especially for music.<br/><br/>Not needing a lot of encouragement, I made patent drawings, wrote a description and filed for a patent.

Two is preferable for producing in plasticine and metal. Having the 3d printers and my 3d drawings, I could settle some details and produce a manufacturer prototype. The details include whether to use plastic or metal for the arms. The arms need to stay straight in order for the mechanism to work well. In addition, the fixed ends of the arms are connected together so they can rotate independently.

Research has shown that doulas can improve birth outcomes by being there to support women before, during, and after labor.

I've fallen on hard financial times, but your generosity can help me secure steady income and bring much needed social justice activism to the region.</p><h3>Mutual Aid in Action</h3><p>Your contribution will go directly to securing a personal vehicle. In return, you get a great gift.</p><p>The first twenty donors to give $50 or more will receive a signed copy of <i>The Enemy in Blue: The Renatta Frazier Story</i>, a creative non-fiction book I co-authored with my mother.</p><p>This historical work chronicles the true story of my mother's experiences with racism and sexism while a police officer. The power of a city against her, Renatta Frazier fights back against a corrupt system, enduring relentless public criticism, police intimidation, and upheavals in her life and career. With the help of a journalist committed to the truth, the undying love of her family and an unwavering faith, she changes the landscape of an entire city, setting a lasting precedent. It's an important piece of Illinois history.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I've allowed a month to raise $2700 to purchase a reliable vehicle. If I don't reach my goal, the funds will be added to my personal contribution. Either way, all donations will be used to purchase a vehicle, nothing else.</span><br/></p><h3>Help A Friend Change The World</h3><p>In the state of Georgia, it is very difficult to be effective as an activist without consistent reliable transportation. Public transit is limited to Atlanta and a handful of metropolitan areas, and it is expensive to utilize on a regular basis as the city continues to raise rates.</p><p>Securing a personal vehicle will not only allow me to earn steady income to assist in the care of my household, but it will also allow me to expand activist projects in the state of Georgia and in the Southeast region. Some of these projects include:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>recruiting local activists for anti-oppression and anti-extraction</li>
<li>animal rights direct actions in the city of Atlanta</li>
<li>anti-human trafficking in Atlanta - the nation's worst city for human trafficking</li>
<li>pro-feminist education for men</li>
<li>coalition building with regional organizations</li>
</ul><p>But it's not just the state and region you will be impacting - I am part of an international network of environmental and social justice activists, and I attend conferences, gatherings and actions across the country. Your contribution will ensure that myself and my comrades will have the resources to continue resistance to empire.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Spread the word! Let's put our ideals of community, mutual aid and solidarity to action.</p><ul>
<li>Share this donation page on your social media sites</li>

I've fallen on hard financial times, but your generosity can help me secure steady income and bring much needed social justice activism to the region.Mutual Aid in ActionYour contribution will go directly to securing a personal vehicle. In return, you get a great gift.The first twenty donors to give $50 or more will receive a signed copy of The Enemy in Blue: The Renatta Frazier Story, a creative non-fiction book I co-authored with my mother.This historical work chronicles the true story of my mother's experiences with racism and sexism while a police officer. The power of a city against her, Renatta Frazier fights back against a corrupt system, enduring relentless public criticism, police intimidation, and upheavals in her life and career. With the help of a journalist committed to the truth, the undying love of her family and an unwavering faith, she changes the landscape of an entire city, setting a lasting precedent. It's an important piece of Illinois history.I've allowed a month to raise $2700 to purchase a reliable vehicle. If I don't reach my goal, the funds will be added to my personal contribution. Either way, all donations will be used to purchase a vehicle, nothing else.Help A Friend Change The WorldIn the state of Georgia, it is very difficult to be effective as an activist without consistent reliable transportation. Public transit is limited to Atlanta and a handful of metropolitan areas, and it is expensive to utilize on a regular basis as the city continues to raise rates.Securing a personal vehicle will not only allow me to earn steady income to assist in the care of my household, but it will also allow me to expand activist projects in the state of Georgia and in the Southeast region. Some of these projects include:
recruiting local activists for anti-oppression and anti-extraction
animal rights direct actions in the city of Atlanta
anti-human trafficking in Atlanta - the nation's worst city for human trafficking
pro-feminist education for men
coalition building with regional organizations
But it's not just the state and region you will be impacting - I am part of an international network of environmental and social justice activists, and I attend conferences, gatherings and actions across the country. Your contribution will ensure that myself and my comrades will have the resources to continue resistance to empire.Other Ways You Can HelpSpread the word! Let's put our ideals of community, mutual aid and solidarity to action.

<div>I began researching ways to step around too much salt and preservatives in food when I spoke to a doctor that told me that we as humans only need 2,500 ml of sodium a day, and that true most health food dieters declare war on fat and cholesterol but completely miss the massive intake of sodium that is un necessarily put in our food.  He said that most Americans consume between 10 and 15, 000 ml. a day and that too much sodium is chiefly responsible for hypertension and other complications.  I too have been affected by this and thus was forced to give up much of the food that I loved.  I however decided to do the work and Find ways to create recipes that are low to no sodium and low cholesterol with high nutritional value.  I will use only organic products and non GMO ingredients.  I will also not use preservatives as my bread is meant to be eaten.  I keep myself healthy and fed, and I can make sure that you all have at least one place that is able and willing to make sure that you get baked goods that you do not have to be afraid of.  This Campaign is important to me because I know what its like to worry about what you eat, and look at others enjoying what you would like to but cannot because of what food makers put in our food now these days.  Please help me accomplish the creation of Daily Bread low sodium bakery.  </div>

<p align=""center"">Teach a woman to run her own business, and she feeds her family for a lifetime.”</p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Announcing the launch of the “Freedom Stitchers” project to create self-sufficiency for marginalized and jobless women in Gaza.</strong></p>
<p>The “Freedom Stitchers” project begins in Gaza, in late autumn 2013</p>
<p>ABOUT</p>
<p>“Freedom Stitchers” will be a <strong>sustainable project run by women in Gaza.</strong> This micro-business is based on the idea that Palestinian women possess their own unique artistic and design skills, but they need a process to sell their finished products to the world, (with a little help from their friends at “Freedom Stitchers.”) They have the right to set up businesses, but are prevented in selling their artistry by the illegal blockade on their borders. </p>
<p>We therefore intend to help set up this business for women in Gaza to market not only their exquisite embroidery, but to also enhance their artistic skills by teaching them how to knit, crochet, do silk ribbon embroidery, beadwork, felting, and other types of hand stitching for textile art which can then be sold.</p>
<p>The three of us organizers, Sinead MacLochlainn, Mary Hughes Thompson and Greta Berlin are long-time activists for justice in Palestine. You can read more about us on our bio page and on the website at <a href=""http://www.freedomstitchers.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.freedomstitchers.org</a> </p>
<p>HOW YOU CAN HELP US</p>
<p>“Freedom Stitchers” will work to set up a trade route to import supplies and then export the finished products made by these women. This idea has worked in other countries, but because Gaza is occupied and blockaded, no one has ever tried to import yarn, needles and material and export the finished goods. “Freedom Stitchers” aims to change this by creating a Trade-not-Aid project. Donating to this project provides the raw materials for the art work, something that is very difficult for the women of Gaza to receive. Your donation will help us set up a micro-business and will enable the project to be video-taped and perhaps even live streamed. </p>
<p>Your donations will help to enable these women to ‘Stitch for Freedom."" Payments can be accepted by clicking on the CONTRIBUTE button that Indiegogo has set up for us.

<p>DOCUMENTING THE PROJECT</p>
<p>The “Freedom Stitchers” group intends to videotape parts of our initial three-week project, as we set up and run workshops with various women’s groups. You will have the opportunity to meet via video, some of the women and women’s groups in Gaza who hope to benefit from the “Freedom Stitchers” empowerment project, hear their personal stories and get to know them. You can share in our workshops as the women progress towards self-sufficiency via their work, as we see them progress from raw materials to finished projects ready for export.</p>
<p>FREEDOM STITCHERS ETHOS</p>
<p>Seven years ago, we were told we would never be able to sail boats into Gaza. Of the five co-founders of the Free Gaza movement, four were women, Mary Hughes Thompson and Greta Berlin being the major organizers from the beginning. We proved the naysayers wrong, and we did set sail for Gaza. We believe in the power of women, we believe we can help to empower our sisters in Gaza to be more self-sufficient and generate a small income if we share our knowledge, abilities and skills, if we reach out and join our hands, and stitch for Freedom!</p>
<p>We know women can make a difference. We have done it already. We have sailed boats into Gaza. We have taken delegations into Gaza. We have organized and nagged and prodded and pulled dignitaries, members of civil society and journalists to come to Gaza and see what is happening. It’s not enough. The next step is to begin to empower, and who better than women to take up that task?</p>
<p>We want to raise $25,000 USD (£16,400) as start-up money for this project. The money will be spent as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Implementing the project for up to 5 women’s groups in Gaza</li>
<li>Purchasing all supplies for project implementation for up to 5 women’s groups. e.g. yarn, embroidery ribbon,  embroidery threads, all sewing supplies, knitting needles and crochet hooks.</li>
<li>Funding to cover the project, including shipping items to and from Gaza, duty fees and transfer fees and miscellaneous government fees.</li>
<li>Shipping in five containers of yarn and needles, plus embroidery thread and other supplies, since many women cannot continue to embroider the beautiful Palestinian patterns for lack of raw materials. Embroidery thread is often not allowed into Gaza.</li>
<li>Paying a Palestinian videographer from inside Gaza (hopefully a woman) and an editing suite to produce a documentary of the project from beginning to end.</li>
<li>Website implementation, internet hosting for the sales site, design of logo and other creative work by Palestinians as needed.</li>
</ol><p>Teach one …Make one…Market to the World  </p>
<p>Together we CAN make a difference in the lives of our Palestinian sisters, but we need your support and your donations to make it happen. Join with us. You will be part of a small business. You will be able to contribute in creating work for women in Gaza who might never have had the chance for any income.  So we ask all women and men around the world to support us, to follow us, to encourage us. To contribute to our project of breaking the siege, one woman at a time, through empowerment as we reach out our hands to our sisters in Gaza.</p>

</div>","What the heck is this Fit Body Boot Camp (FBBC) thing all about?
The short of it? It is the first Indoor Boot Camp.  It is also the exercise regime I’ve done for
a year and one I wholeheartedly believe in. 
As an educator at a school district I know what child obesity looks like
that’s why I am also looking to use this as a way to help youth get in shape
and be healthier.  
See, once I open my doors every year I am committed to sponsoring a total of four inner city youth who will pledge to take part in work outs four days per week for 12 weeks. So while I am raising money to start my own business I want to use my
business to give back to young people and the surrounding community but I need
your help to make it happen! 
Why Fit Body Boot Camp? 
Because as a member I believe in it.  I have seen people my age as well as
60-year-old grandmothers and grandfathers take part in the workouts and not
only shed weight but also feel alive again. 
Because I believe our body is our temple and if we don’t take
care of it, who will?  
Because I have what it takes to not just run a business but do
it so well that every person who walks in through the door will be impacted by the
services I provide.  
Because I want to continue to impact youth in a way that is
meaningful and fills my soul yet allows me do what I am passionate about. 
Because working out was what kept me sane in high school and in
college.  No matter what dysfunction was
going at home or in my life working out made everything better.Because most importantly it is researched base. Fit Body Boot Camp offers workouts done in 30 minutes from warm up to cool down. The secret to the massive fat loss results that the client gets is due to the After Burn™  the workouts produce. At Fit Body Boot Camp each and every workout combines elements of high Intensity Interval Training, Exercise Stacking™ as well as Active Rest Periods making sure to give you the best possible workouts and most calories burned in every session.  These are all key components to creating the After Burn Effect.  The average Fit Body Boot Camp workout burns 600-1000 calories in under an hour - that's twice the calories burned over any other workout program out there. The elements that encompass a Boot Camp workout create the perfect physiological state for continuous calorie burn for up to 28 hours after a workout session. And because I honestly have dreamt of owning my business for as
long as I can remember and it has taken me 15 years to figure out what that
business should be, now that I have figured it out I am going all out to make
this happen. Why $8,200?My overall budget is $20,000, I am in need of $8,200
to make this dream come true.  The $8,200
will pay for equipment, marketing and finalize the purchase.  Once everything is final my doors will open
within 90 days. 
What you'll get by giving to the Fit Body Boot Camp Start Up
Project?
How about warm, fuzzy feelings, for starters? Or knowing that
you are helping someone, who growing up couldn’t fathom this opportunity, to
make her dream come true.  Not enough?
Okay, check out the Perks and while you are doing that know that every dollar
is getting me closer to opening my doors and eventually giving four to five inner-city youth, per year, an opportunity to get healthy.  Also consider this, for every youth and client I touch they will touch
and influence someone in their household to become a bit healthier.  Eventually we will have dozens of people
making healthier choices everyday and in time hundreds.  
Here's how you can help
First, PUNCH IN YOUR CREDIT CARD NUMBER. (Don’t worry I promise
it will feel good.) Give $1 to $25 and you will get a BIG THANK YOU.  The truth is everybody will get a thank you BUT YOURS, YOURS will
be EXTRA SPECIAL! 
$50 and get a FBBC Water Bottle 
$75 and get a T-shirt. You can wear it to workout in! :)
Or choose to sponsor a youth. 
THIS will really make your heart all warm and fuzzy!!! 
Equally, or perhaps more importantly, tell all your friends to
give us their money. Seriously: spread the word! ""Like"" us on

<p>A Legacy is not something you make for yourself, but the influence you’ve left on others.</p>
<p>That's part of how it started...  The sideways smile of our then pre-teen children learning how to take their first shots.  Finding it harder and harder to find range time for them or us to practice because there is nothing close where you'd be comfortable taking your child.  Recognizing, as a parent, that you look for a different type of range when you're involving your kids.  It's very different to get swept when it's just you...but when a total stranger sweeps your kid because they have not been taught the proper way to handle a firearm - it immediately becomes a different issue.</p>
<p>It became more and more evident that there really are not a lot of options for indoor ranges (good or bad) that were in close enough proximity to get as much practice time as we wanted.  In speaking with friends and relatives that are active or retired law enforcement or military, it was the same story...nothing close enough and finding time to practice (especially LEO) before qualifications are imminent.</p>
<p>As we travelled well over an hour to obtain our certifications from reputable trainers in a high caliber range, we spent most of that time discussing the need for something closer to us. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we're planning to build...</h3>
<p>Our Legacy will be to bring a range closer to home for not just us, but the many pending members, local law enforcement, and Boy / Girl Scouts.  Our plan is to build more than a range; but a Guntry Club that will partner with local law enforcement, civilians, youth and adult groups.  Legacy Indoor Range and Armory will be state of the art - have the best of the best and eliminate the worst of the worst.</p>
<p>A project of this magnitude is not  inexpensive.  Finding banks and investors can be overwhelming due to the polarizing nature of the industry.  The area in which we are looking to build has nothing like this within 50 miles.  The needs of local law enforcement groups and civilians are great.  Already having obtained preliminary and final site plan approval for the property where we would like to build, we need people willing to believe in our vision and help us obtain the funding to move to the next step.</p>
<p>With over 20 years of shooting and archery experience between them, the founders, in addition to being NRA Certified Instructors, bring a background from multifaceted fields of expertise.  Andrew, a Tax Accountant by trade, and Melissa, a Process Improvement Expert, bring an extensive background in business, financial, and logistics operations experience.  As parents of children who enjoy both the shooting sports and archery, it became increasingly difficult to find suitable ranges that were the environment in which they wanted to teach their children.  Shooting sports in general is a vastly popular industry.  Women and children, in particular, represent the fastest growing demographic portions of the shooting sports industry.  Legacy and RBAC (property management company) will afford the community access to a state of the art indoor training facility that is safe, family friendly, clean, and reputable.</p>
<p>RBAC, by custom design, will build a facility for Legacy to provide local access to classrooms, onsite gunsmithing, retail firearms and accessories, trained firearm professionals, and specialized training for our local law enforcement.  In addition, our large training facility will provide the community an opportunity to utilize our indoor ranges, and classrooms for meeting and team building events, women’s only and children’s events, and private instruction.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How your funds can help...</h3>
<p>Land:  We have found an excellent plot of land - just over 5 acres</p>
<p>Building:  New customized tilt up construction</p>
<p>Inventory:  Enough to build up roughly 5000 sq ft of an Armory</p>
<p>Range / Port Construction:  Best around.  Automated Targeting system; certain areas able to be dynamic for Law Enforcement drills.  50 ports in all + 25 archery lanes and a Shoot House for Law Enforcement.</p>
<p>State of the Art Ventilation System:  Air will be pulled in from the outside and filtered before being returned to the outside.  No recycled air in the ranges.</p>
<p>Classroom Media:  Flat screen displays for classes.  Controlled and standardized training materials.  Excellent trainers and firearm instructors.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact...</h3>
<p>By our building this easy, accessible, state of the art range, we are enabling many people the opportunity to properly educate themselves on how to use their firearm and then have a place to practice that is closer to home.  We are giving law enforcement and our military personnel a centralized location to train and practice using their firearm.  In addition, we will provide a different level of training to our local law enforcement and first responders.</p>
<p>Given the distance between our location and other indoor ranges, we will maximize your range time by reducing travel time to the range. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The largest risk in this industry is always the perception that our politicians will vote to remove our gun rights.  We keep this threat in perspective, of roughly 11,300 attempts to change our Constitution; only 27 Amendments have been passed.  In addition, constitutional analysts have shown that congress has repeatedly been unable to muster enough votes to evoke change to the 2nd amendment in general.  Lastly, each time there is a potential risk or discussion of additional gun control laws, gun sales ultimately thrive.</p>
<ul>
<li>We hope to better educate people on their rights and strive to help people have the ability to talk about rights and infringement impact.</li>
<li>We will teach regular everyday people how to choose the proper firearm for them as well as giving them the opportunity to practice.</li>
<li>We will give law enforcement more opportunities to train to avoid accidental discharge.</li>
<li>We will provide tactical training to teach law enforcement an improved methodology for unique situations.</li>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>""You are what you

<p><b>How long it
had been that you had a juicy apple? Ever wondered why mangoes in market
nowadays doesn’t taste the same as you had them in childhood?</b></p>
<p>The way of
farming makes all the difference. We are practicing only chemical farming now.</p>
<h4>So, now the
billion-dollar question arises…. Can’t we really practice organic farming and
still have the same productivity? </h4>
<p>The answer
is Yes, Its Possible!!!  Its high time we
shift to organic farming!!!</p>
<h3><b>About Us: </b></h3>
<h4>Team</h4>
<p>We – Vinoth Kumar
&amp; Raja S Pandian will be doing this project and need to travel at least
6 to 8 months to finish it.</p>
<h4><b>Vinoth Kumar</b></h4>
<p>Hi , I'm Vinoth
Kumar, an organic farmer.  I’ve studied Electrical Engineering and Masters in
Human Resource Management. I’ve worked for 6 years in different corporate
companies like Allsec Technologies, Zoho Corporation , Groupon &amp; Standard Chartered bank.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454229987/xbjpf9jyk9lsamwllb4p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><br/>
<p>I’ve given
up my corporate jobs to do full time Organic Farming and I’ve spoken to lot of
farmers and convinced them to practice Organic Farming. I come from a agricultural
family, we have been doing farming since many decades here in Cheyur. We are so full of pesticides that we no longer know what is good for our health.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440658892/c0oblzilwsw2uyffjduo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440659117/dqgj6sqswxb6x6icbcnj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>
<p>When I
started Organic Farming, the access to the organic and traditional methods was
very difficult, because they were not documented properly. All the information
are restricted to specific area. I had to travel a lot to visit lot of
farmers, especially old people and collect a lot of information about the
traditional methods which they followed 30 to 40 years ago. I got brilliant
results when I applied them in my farm and I really would like to share them
with as many people as possible. </p>
<h4><b>Raja S Pandian</b></h4><div>Not
everyone's turning point in life starts with turtles. I am lucky to be among
that clan, which made me meet different people and helped me carry myself
towards different experiences through these people. I work as a volunteer for
SSTCN to conserve turtles in coast of Chennai. I also work to regulate the
waste management issue of the city by being part of Paperman. Backpacking
happened between all this. I am constantly finding ways to add meaning to my
travel trips by giving back to the society. My next travel plan will be on the
same. To travel for a cause, to travel to document the practice of sustainable
agriculture and to promote it across South east Asia.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441008277/jkbg0bqhjtfsqgxiovjs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h2><b>Mission of this project:</b></h2>
<p>We want to
take this to the next level, after successfully doing Organic Farming and
converting people to do Organic farming in Cheyur, we feel the importance
of documentation of Organic farming, Traditional Methods and the need for Sustainable
Living which are fast disappearing. It is important that we eat healthy and
stay healthy, the poison pumped in most of the farms are slowly killing us and
most importantly destroying our planet. </p><p>Phase 1 - India :</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457418226/eepnpey2lwyeibiyykyv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Phase 2 - South East Asia :</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457418247/nfg98iofl4kdg2kehwav.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>
<p>We have planned to "" CYCLE "" to across South East Asian countries like Srilanka, Indonesia,
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Bangladesh and
Bhutan. India has a strong cultural relation with these countries and we would like to
take it as an advantage to document their traditional practices. </p>
<p>We have
traveled extensively in India, Nepal &amp; Bhutan to meet many farmers. We will also be meeting many more farmers, students in schools, Universities. We strongly believe
that the messages conveyed to kids are like seeds sown in the soil. It will
definitely grow and create a forest!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440659318/m0bzvfzxzchydkhsz6uq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We feel
travelling and meeting people as a vital tool in creating people’s movement and
to address or spread knowledge on organic farming and sustainable living.</p>
<p>We have
documented the traditional methods followed in different parts of India, Nepal
and Bhutan. Once we are back in India, we will release the documentation as a book
and a soft copy. We will also setup a place in my farm where everyone from across the
world can come and practice Organic farming. </p>

<br/></div>","“When
it is understood that one loses joy and happiness in the
attempt to possess them, the essence of natural farming will be realized. The
ultimate goal of farming is not the growing of crops, but the cultivation and
perfection of human beings.”  -Masanobu Fukuoka.
""You are what you
eat!"" So eat right!
How long it
had been that you had a juicy apple? Ever wondered why mangoes in market
nowadays doesn’t taste the same as you had them in childhood?
The way of
farming makes all the difference. We are practicing only chemical farming now.
So, now the
billion-dollar question arises…. Can’t we really practice organic farming and
still have the same productivity? 
The answer
is Yes, Its Possible!!!  Its high time we
shift to organic farming!!!
About Us: 
Team
We – Vinoth Kumar
& Raja S Pandian will be doing this project and need to travel at least
6 to 8 months to finish it.
Vinoth Kumar
Hi , I'm Vinoth
Kumar, an organic farmer.  I’ve studied Electrical Engineering and Masters in
Human Resource Management. I’ve worked for 6 years in different corporate
companies like Allsec Technologies, Zoho Corporation , Groupon & Standard Chartered bank.
I’ve given
up my corporate jobs to do full time Organic Farming and I’ve spoken to lot of
farmers and convinced them to practice Organic Farming. I come from a agricultural
family, we have been doing farming since many decades here in Cheyur. We are so full of pesticides that we no longer know what is good for our health.
When I
started Organic Farming, the access to the organic and traditional methods was
very difficult, because they were not documented properly. All the information
are restricted to specific area. I had to travel a lot to visit lot of
farmers, especially old people and collect a lot of information about the
traditional methods which they followed 30 to 40 years ago. I got brilliant
results when I applied them in my farm and I really would like to share them
with as many people as possible. 
Raja S PandianNot
everyone's turning point in life starts with turtles. I am lucky to be among
that clan, which made me meet different people and helped me carry myself
towards different experiences through these people. I work as a volunteer for
SSTCN to conserve turtles in coast of Chennai. I also work to regulate the
waste management issue of the city by being part of Paperman. Backpacking
happened between all this. I am constantly finding ways to add meaning to my
travel trips by giving back to the society. My next travel plan will be on the
same. To travel for a cause, to travel to document the practice of sustainable
agriculture and to promote it across South east Asia.


Mission of this project:
We want to
take this to the next level, after successfully doing Organic Farming and
converting people to do Organic farming in Cheyur, we feel the importance
of documentation of Organic farming, Traditional Methods and the need for Sustainable
Living which are fast disappearing. It is important that we eat healthy and
stay healthy, the poison pumped in most of the farms are slowly killing us and
most importantly destroying our planet. Phase 1 - India :Phase 2 - South East Asia :
We have planned to "" CYCLE "" to across South East Asian countries like Srilanka, Indonesia,
Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Myanmar, Bangladesh and
Bhutan. India has a strong cultural relation with these countries and we would like to
take it as an advantage to document their traditional practices. 
We have
traveled extensively in India, Nepal & Bhutan to meet many farmers. We will also be meeting many more farmers, students in schools, Universities. We strongly believe
that the messages conveyed to kids are like seeds sown in the soil. It will
definitely grow and create a forest!
We feel
travelling and meeting people as a vital tool in creating people’s movement and
to address or spread knowledge on organic farming and sustainable living.
We have
documented the traditional methods followed in different parts of India, Nepal
and Bhutan. Once we are back in India, we will release the documentation as a book
and a soft copy. We will also setup a place in my farm where everyone from across the
world can come and practice Organic farming.

We are now ready to employ this new tool to develop and expand our operation on our new twelve acre site. This will increase our supply of fresh produce for this community that will be distributed at local markets, our CSA program, and through local hunger relief organizations. Expanded production will also allow for expanded educational opportunities for our high school youth workers, elementary school trips, our partnership with Austin Peay State University, and other groups. Expanded production also allows for increased revenue streams that support all of our educational and outreach programs. This helps to create not only a sustainable garden ecologically but also financially. </div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div> <p>While racing gear is cool, and funding is essential, raising awareness about our efforts is what will keep our organization running in the end--pun intended.</p>
<p>Globally over 1 billion people live on a devastating income — making less than $1.25<br/>a day. Most of the problems threatening families in the developing world are<br/>a direct result of this poverty. We believe in dropping differences to make a difference by offering a hand up to end poverty. Through your help, our efforts are impacting impoverished communities, both locally and globally.</p>
<p>In Ethiopia, we run a women's empowerment program called 10x10 which teaches essential business and life skills to women affected by leprosy and HIV/AIDS. These women are living with their families in a community built on top of a trash dump in Korah, Ethiopia, but through our program, many have gone from making $0.30 a day to $7-$10 per day!</p>
<p>In El Salvador, we are bridging the gap between churches and communities through our gang-prevention program called LiveGold. Children as young as 11 years old are often recruited by gangs, but by offering these kids another option, LiveGold is strengthening families and communities. In 2016 we plan to launch the same program in Honduras and continue impacting South America!</p>
<p>Locally, we work with at-risk and homeless youth through our LifeStrengths development system. We discovered many youth living government-assisted lifestyles have been socially isolated, but through LifeStrengths, these individuals are developing skills to become self-sufficient. We pair individuals with a LifeCoach so they can work together, developing strength in the areas of education, employment, and personal development!</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>On December 22nd, three days before Christmas in the middle of the night our furnace stopped working. We have a home warranty plan, that came with our home purchase that we thought would take care of it, we were wrong. It is now plummeting well below zero around here and still no furnace. We are lucky enough to have friends that have provided us with electric heaters to keep half the house warm. We have moved the three kids in to one room next to ours so we can run a heater in the hallway and keep both rooms warm. We keep the main living room warm and kitchen and have a small heater we move around to spot heat like the bathroom. I can only imagine what our power bill is going to cost us over the next couple of months. Another problem we have around here is our main bathroom. When we bought our home, everything seemed to work fine. Then we tried to bathe the baby and the bathtub wouldn't drain. We called a drain person to come out and we found out the pipes were completely blocked coming from the tub and they would need replaced. The bathroom is completely outdated and needs some work. The tub and toilet is a 1970's burnt orange and the floor below the toilet looks like its slowly sinking. We have gotten by with bathing the kids either at Grandma's or the kitchen sink. We have a shower, but the baby does not like it one bit. Not to mention he has a skin infection, which required he be bathed and scrubbed twice a day.</p>
<h3>A little about us</h3>
<p>My name is Heidi and my husband is Andy. We have three beautiful children: Blaykli 12, Dexton 5 and Sway 18 months. I have always worked a lot, both before our marriage and during, up until November 1st. I decided then, that I was going to scale back and spend more time with our children. Andy was making good money and enough that would allow me to stay home a little more. Shortly after I gave my notice and my position was replaced, my husband lost his job. Fortunately I worked for family, so they were able to find me things to do to keep us above water for a short period of time. Andy then got a new job November 13th and was working lots of overtime and making more then he was before. We caught up on our bills and was feeling good, then the job ended on December 10th, sooner then we thought. We had saved enough for a small Christmas for the kids and that was about it. Andy is still without work, probably for at least a few more weeks and we need a furnace. Even if he does go back to work sooner or later, we are so far behind on our bills, it will take us a little while to catch up.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have a bid for a new furnace and to bring everything up to code, that is not safe in our utility room. It will cost $4062 to replace the furnace and run the proper ventilation fresh air pipes which includes drilling holes through the brick of the house. We have received a bid of $3087 to remodel the bathroom moderatly and reuse some of our current fixtures. The remainder of the money $2851 will pay for any additional costs in case there are problems unseen in the remodel or update. It will also help pay for the power bill that is quickly adding up with the electric heaters. If we do not reach our goal, any money received will be put towards the furnace and remodel. I know its not much, but there are some perks we have set up for the certain donation amounts, I wish we could give something for every donation, I hope a simple thank you is plenty for your kindness..</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I know I am asking for something personal, when there are so many other causes to contribute to that may help a community, but we need help. I have never asked for a hand out and we always try and help others when we are able. My children need your help, I want them to be able to sleep in their own rooms, in their own space. I want my baby to be able to enjoy a bath at home, not have to go to Nana's or be in a kitchen sink. He loves to play in the bath and he can't at home.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I am not asking for someone to give $100. I am not even hoping for $50 from one person. All I am asking is for $5 to $15 or $20, anything helps..</p>
<div> </div>
<div>I realize that money is tight right now. Believe me, I understand as much as anyone! But any donation will help. And I will be so grateful for your generosity!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you cannot help fund, I would appreciate it if you could just share this link to people on your Facebook friend's list, or in your email list.</div>

<div>I appreciate all of the help and support already!</div>

On December 22nd, three days before Christmas in the middle of the night our furnace stopped working. We have a home warranty plan, that came with our home purchase that we thought would take care of it, we were wrong. It is now plummeting well below zero around here and still no furnace. We are lucky enough to have friends that have provided us with electric heaters to keep half the house warm. We have moved the three kids in to one room next to ours so we can run a heater in the hallway and keep both rooms warm. We keep the main living room warm and kitchen and have a small heater we move around to spot heat like the bathroom. I can only imagine what our power bill is going to cost us over the next couple of months. Another problem we have around here is our main bathroom. When we bought our home, everything seemed to work fine. Then we tried to bathe the baby and the bathtub wouldn't drain. We called a drain person to come out and we found out the pipes were completely blocked coming from the tub and they would need replaced. The bathroom is completely outdated and needs some work. The tub and toilet is a 1970's burnt orange and the floor below the toilet looks like its slowly sinking. We have gotten by with bathing the kids either at Grandma's or the kitchen sink. We have a shower, but the baby does not like it one bit. Not to mention he has a skin infection, which required he be bathed and scrubbed twice a day.
A little about us
My name is Heidi and my husband is Andy. We have three beautiful children: Blaykli 12, Dexton 5 and Sway 18 months. I have always worked a lot, both before our marriage and during, up until November 1st. I decided then, that I was going to scale back and spend more time with our children. Andy was making good money and enough that would allow me to stay home a little more. Shortly after I gave my notice and my position was replaced, my husband lost his job. Fortunately I worked for family, so they were able to find me things to do to keep us above water for a short period of time. Andy then got a new job November 13th and was working lots of overtime and making more then he was before. We caught up on our bills and was feeling good, then the job ended on December 10th, sooner then we thought. We had saved enough for a small Christmas for the kids and that was about it. Andy is still without work, probably for at least a few more weeks and we need a furnace. Even if he does go back to work sooner or later, we are so far behind on our bills, it will take us a little while to catch up.
What We Need & What You Get
We have a bid for a new furnace and to bring everything up to code, that is not safe in our utility room. It will cost $4062 to replace the furnace and run the proper ventilation fresh air pipes which includes drilling holes through the brick of the house. We have received a bid of $3087 to remodel the bathroom moderatly and reuse some of our current fixtures. The remainder of the money $2851 will pay for any additional costs in case there are problems unseen in the remodel or update. It will also help pay for the power bill that is quickly adding up with the electric heaters. If we do not reach our goal, any money received will be put towards the furnace and remodel. I know its not much, but there are some perks we have set up for the certain donation amounts, I wish we could give something for every donation, I hope a simple thank you is plenty for your kindness..

The Impact
I know I am asking for something personal, when there are so many other causes to contribute to that may help a community, but we need help. I have never asked for a hand out and we always try and help others when we are able. My children need your help, I want them to be able to sleep in their own rooms, in their own space. I want my baby to be able to enjoy a bath at home, not have to go to Nana's or be in a kitchen sink. He loves to play in the bath and he can't at home.


Other Ways You Can Help
I am not asking for someone to give $100. I am not even hoping for $50 from one person. All I am asking is for $5 to $15 or $20, anything helps..
 
I realize that money is tight right now. Believe me, I understand as much as anyone! But any donation will help. And I will be so grateful for your generosity!!
 
If you cannot help fund, I would appreciate it if you could just share this link to people on your Facebook friend's list, or in your email list.
 
I appreciate all of the help and support already!
 
Thank you so much!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The objective of Communitas is two fold. Firstly, to offer

<p>And secondly, Communitas hopes to encourage ethical and

<p>Forming partnerships with women’s economic empowerment and

training, and opportunity to do so, are able to develop their own communities,
socially, politically, and economically better than any outside organization,
or aid package can. Don’t just teach a person to fish, bring them and their
catch to the fish market!</p>
<p><b>Plan of Action</b></p>
<p>The first step towards achieving Communitas’s mission is
taking an initial trip to Nepal to meet with women’s organizations, form
partnerships, and purchase the first batch of items to bring back to the United
States. The items would then be marketed in an online store/website that is
currently being developed, as well as in select retail locations. </p>
<p>Nepal has been chosen as the pilot country primarily due to contacts
already established with a local women’s organization that produces
contemporary items using traditional Nepali dyeing and weaving techniques. The
organization is locally run by a Nepali woman, requires the children of the
women employed to attend school, and provides training in skills such as math,
reading, writing, and sewing to the women they employ. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Part of the goal of Communitas is to help these local
organizations grow, to include more women, and discourage women from going
abroad as domestic help, by providing them economic opportunity in their own
countries.</span></p>
<p>Communitas will reserve 25% of proceeds from each item sold
to be put in a fund towards a scholarship for top female academic performers
from the communities in which Communitas has its partnerships, to attend university.
 The focus on education was chosen because
education is the most definite way to inspire and create the capacity for
grassroots driven economic, social, and political progress. </p>

All funds raised that exceed our goal will go towards forming a second partnership with a women's development program in Ethiopia. <br/><p></p></div>","Communitas

Nepal has been chosen as the pilot country primarily due to contacts
already established with a local women’s organization that produces
contemporary items using traditional Nepali dyeing and weaving techniques. The
organization is locally run by a Nepali woman, requires the children of the
women employed to attend school, and provides training in skills such as math,
reading, writing, and sewing to the women they employ. Part of the goal of Communitas is to help these local
organizations grow, to include more women, and discourage women from going
abroad as domestic help, by providing them economic opportunity in their own
countries.
Communitas will reserve 25% of proceeds from each item sold
to be put in a fund towards a scholarship for top female academic performers
from the communities in which Communitas has its partnerships, to attend university.
 The focus on education was chosen because
education is the most definite way to inspire and create the capacity for
grassroots driven economic, social, and political progress. 

All funds raised that exceed our goal will go towards forming a second partnership with a women's development program in Ethiopia.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I started Nodoguro as a pop-up restaurant with my wife, Elena Roadhouse in the spring of 2014. We introduced Portland to experimental and creative Japanese Sousaku cuisine in a fun and eclectic setting.  It was born as a""kaiseki without the rules"" pop-up from the internet with nothing more than a website and a DIY reservation system. We were asking our guests to purchase tickets in advance to my virtual restaurant, which became a reality in an empty dining room somewhere in the city, just once or twice a month. Nodoguro quickly evolved into a full-time 13 seat destination restaurant nestled inside of a hidden cafe space in a boutique grocery store on SE Hawthorne.

<p>Just as Nodoguro <span>was named Portland Monthly's Restaurant of the Year for 2015, we learned that we would lose our restaurant space due to the closure of the grocery store we leased it from. During the time most assumed we would celebrate what we had accomplished with so little, we were actually scrambling to keep our little dream alive. With little hope of finding a new space on such a short timeline before it seemed we would shut down, we began to look for a new restaurant.

<p><span>Today I would like to announce that our search has ended and we have just signed a lease on our new permanent home, in the historic Genoa restaurant space at 2832 SE Belmont in Portland, Oregon.</span></p>
<p><span>It may be a super cool idea, but let's face it, there is nothing glamorous or fun about operating a pop-up restaurant. The packing, loading, moving, cooking in an unfamiliar kitchen, and then, packing again is definitely not fun, but for us it was worth it every night in order to make our bootstrap restaurant dream a reality. I remember the relief we felt the night we didn't have pack our dishes up after taking the over the former Evoe space inside of  Pastaworks. It allowed Nodoguro to grow, mature, and plant little tiny roots, but I recall, wishing we could provide our guests with a bit more comfort and warmth than our space allowed. The upside of losing our restaurant space a couple months ago, is the opportunity it provided to create a space that fits our personality and offers greater comfort to our guests. </span></p>
<p><span>With your contributions,we plan to remodel the beautiful Genoa restaurant space to feature a spacious 15 seat chef counter, which put you right in our preparation area similarly to how we served at The original Nodoguro.

It is a place where you can hang out before or after dinner for a glass of wine or conversation. It will be our little library and we hope it will be the kind of place where you can relax, lose track of time, and maybe make some new friends. This area will also be open to guests who would like to come have snacks and drinks during our normal dinner service, as well.

<p>
</p>
<p>The Hastings Independent Press (HIP) is a free fortnightly newspaper, run mainly on a voluntary basis by a group of local
 residents who know that Hastings is a unique place, with a character 
that deserves recognition. We aim to give a voice to the residents 
of Hastings and St Leonards to support a strong sense of community and to provide an impartial platform for debate about local issues. We encourage anyone who lives in Hastings and St Leonards to come and get involved.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The
paper started back in January 2014, when a group of locals took
matters into their own hands after becoming frustrated at the quality
of local news coverage.
We
feel it’s important that a local paper should be community
controlled, and written by people who live in and love Hastings. We
also believe a local paper should serve its readers rather than
its shareholders. That’s why the Hastings Independent is set up as
a not-for-profit Community Interest Company, with all profits being
invested back in to the company to help achieve its social aims.</p>
<p>
These
aims are:</p>
<p>
1.
To provide training, work experience and, in the long term,
employment for local people who wish to work in journalism and the
media industry</p>
<p>
2.
To raise awareness of, and to address, community issues</p>
<p>
3.
To promote citizenship, the arts and education.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>
We’ve
now been running for over two years and have just printed our 50th
issue. To be honest, we’re sometimes amazed we’re still going.
But we are, thanks to the support of our loyal advertisers, the
commitment and hard work of our talented team of 50+ volunteers
and the blood, sweat and tears of our long-suffering designer and
advertising manager. 
</p>
<p>
Getting
the paper out each fortnight is a mammoth task, and they do
everything from researching and writing articles, drawing cartoons,
taking photos, creating crosswords, editing each section, designing
the layout, uploading to the website, posting on Facebook and
Twitter, responding to enquiries, training up new contributors,
delivering the paper, liaising with stockists, liaising with
advertisers, organising fundraising events and applying for grants.
No wonder they look so haggard!</p>
<p>
We’re
well aware that we’re not perfect. There’s been more than the
occasional typo in the paper, a few episodes of time travel ... and
even a rogue shark spotting! Sometimes
we haven't been able to fit in all the articles we've been sent, and
sometimes we’ve fitted in something we really shouldn’t have.
It’s been a steep learning curve, but what we’ve achieved, given
the few resources we have, is astounding – and with your help we
want to keep doing it.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>
If
we can secure funding to help us cover our core costs, our volunteers
can focus on what’s most important – producing the best newspaper
they can. It’s hard for them to focus on research and writing when
they’re also having to hold emergency fundraisers and trudge around
town delivering papers in the rain.</p>
<p>
We
need to raise £15,000 to enable us to expand our current operation.
Here’s what we plan to do with it:</p>
<p>
1.
We want to pay a distribution co-ordinator to do our deliveries,
increasing reliability and freeing up our volunteers to focus on
news.</p>
<p>
2.
We need to improve our new premises, which was kindly donated to
us but needs some work. This would give us a central, professional
venue from where we can run the paper, provide training for our
volunteers, store all the equipment we need to design and produce the
paper. </p>
<p>
3.
We also need funding to help cover our core running costs such as
printing and design. While the bulk of these are covered by
advertising, sometimes there’s a shortfall. We’re unable to cover
this with any grant money we’re awarded, as it’s a condition of
most grants that they can’t be used for running costs. 
</p>
<p>
Everyone
who supports our crowdfunding campaign will become a friend of HIP
and will be invited to any friends events we hold in the future. You
can also choose a subscription or an advertisement as your reward.
With a subscription, you’ll get the paper delivered direct to your
door for a year. With  an advert, your message will reach an estimated readership of 14,000
local
people each fortnight.</p>
<p>
Even
if we don't reach our entire goal of £15,000, every penny you
contribute will help us improve the running of the paper. <br/></p>
<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
The
Hastings Independent has featured contributions from hundreds of
local people of all ages and backgrounds over the last two years,
including many students who have gained useful work experience. This
has included articles, cartoons, photos, poems, recipes, profiles of
local artists, music reviews, event listings, pages put together by
locals schools, reports from residents overseas, and much more. </p>
<p>
It’s
not just a paper, it’s an important local service provider. At a
time of uncertainty regarding media studies in Hastings, it’s vital
that we continue to offer much-needed media training and work
experience in the town. Many of our former volunteers have gone on to
get jobs in journalism, communications and the community sector. Some
have even gone on to write for national newspapers, thanks in part to
the experience they gained at the paper. We’ve also managed to
generate enough income to pay two part-time workers and hope to
employ more.<br/></p>
<p>This
opinionated paper is written by an opinionated community. Readers may
not always agree or appreciate every article or feature, but if we
cause a reaction we are doing our job. It’s important the town's
voice is heard, and that includes everyone – if you disagree with
something, we want to hear from you too.</p>
<p>
There
are several sources of local news – but the Hastings Independent
fills an important gap. It provides free community news and
information for those who can’t afford to buy newspapers, or who
lack access or confidence on the internet. 
</p>
<p>
The
Hastings Independent deliberately gives the maximum space possible to
promote community groups and their campaigns. In our coverage we try
to be constructive and offer solutions – and never to
sensationalise. With our expanding social media and new website, we
aim to provide more interactive coverage and offer additional

</div> </div>","Summary 


The Hastings Independent Press (HIP) is a free fortnightly newspaper, run mainly on a voluntary basis by a group of local
 residents who know that Hastings is a unique place, with a character 
that deserves recognition. We aim to give a voice to the residents 
of Hastings and St Leonards to support a strong sense of community and to provide an impartial platform for debate about local issues. We encourage anyone who lives in Hastings and St Leonards to come and get involved.


The
paper started back in January 2014, when a group of locals took
matters into their own hands after becoming frustrated at the quality
of local news coverage.
We
feel it’s important that a local paper should be community
controlled, and written by people who live in and love Hastings. We
also believe a local paper should serve its readers rather than
its shareholders. That’s why the Hastings Independent is set up as
a not-for-profit Community Interest Company, with all profits being
invested back in to the company to help achieve its social aims.

These
aims are:

1.
To provide training, work experience and, in the long term,
employment for local people who wish to work in journalism and the
media industry

2.
To raise awareness of, and to address, community issues

3.
To promote citizenship, the arts and education.  


We’ve
now been running for over two years and have just printed our 50th
issue. To be honest, we’re sometimes amazed we’re still going.
But we are, thanks to the support of our loyal advertisers, the
commitment and hard work of our talented team of 50+ volunteers
and the blood, sweat and tears of our long-suffering designer and
advertising manager. 


Getting
the paper out each fortnight is a mammoth task, and they do
everything from researching and writing articles, drawing cartoons,
taking photos, creating crosswords, editing each section, designing
the layout, uploading to the website, posting on Facebook and
Twitter, responding to enquiries, training up new contributors,
delivering the paper, liaising with stockists, liaising with
advertisers, organising fundraising events and applying for grants.
No wonder they look so haggard!

We’re
well aware that we’re not perfect. There’s been more than the
occasional typo in the paper, a few episodes of time travel ... and
even a rogue shark spotting! Sometimes
we haven't been able to fit in all the articles we've been sent, and
sometimes we’ve fitted in something we really shouldn’t have.
It’s been a steep learning curve, but what we’ve achieved, given
the few resources we have, is astounding – and with your help we
want to keep doing it.
What We Need & What You Get



If
we can secure funding to help us cover our core costs, our volunteers
can focus on what’s most important – producing the best newspaper
they can. It’s hard for them to focus on research and writing when
they’re also having to hold emergency fundraisers and trudge around
town delivering papers in the rain.

We
need to raise £15,000 to enable us to expand our current operation.
Here’s what we plan to do with it:

1.
We want to pay a distribution co-ordinator to do our deliveries,
increasing reliability and freeing up our volunteers to focus on
news.

2.
We need to improve our new premises, which was kindly donated to
us but needs some work. This would give us a central, professional
venue from where we can run the paper, provide training for our
volunteers, store all the equipment we need to design and produce the
paper. 

3.
We also need funding to help cover our core running costs such as
printing and design. While the bulk of these are covered by
advertising, sometimes there’s a shortfall. We’re unable to cover
this with any grant money we’re awarded, as it’s a condition of
most grants that they can’t be used for running costs. 


Everyone
who supports our crowdfunding campaign will become a friend of HIP
and will be invited to any friends events we hold in the future. You
can also choose a subscription or an advertisement as your reward.
With a subscription, you’ll get the paper delivered direct to your
door for a year. With  an advert, your message will reach an estimated readership of 14,000
local
people each fortnight.

Even
if we don't reach our entire goal of £15,000, every penny you
contribute will help us improve the running of the paper. 
   The Impact

The
Hastings Independent has featured contributions from hundreds of
local people of all ages and backgrounds over the last two years,
including many students who have gained useful work experience. This
has included articles, cartoons, photos, poems, recipes, profiles of
local artists, music reviews, event listings, pages put together by
locals schools, reports from residents overseas, and much more. 

It’s
not just a paper, it’s an important local service provider. At a
time of uncertainty regarding media studies in Hastings, it’s vital
that we continue to offer much-needed media training and work
experience in the town. Many of our former volunteers have gone on to
get jobs in journalism, communications and the community sector. Some
have even gone on to write for national newspapers, thanks in part to
the experience they gained at the paper. We’ve also managed to
generate enough income to pay two part-time workers and hope to
employ more.
This
opinionated paper is written by an opinionated community. Readers may
not always agree or appreciate every article or feature, but if we
cause a reaction we are doing our job. It’s important the town's
voice is heard, and that includes everyone – if you disagree with
something, we want to hear from you too.

There
are several sources of local news – but the Hastings Independent
fills an important gap. It provides free community news and
information for those who can’t afford to buy newspapers, or who
lack access or confidence on the internet. 


The
Hastings Independent deliberately gives the maximum space possible to
promote community groups and their campaigns. In our coverage we try
to be constructive and offer solutions – and never to
sensationalise. With our expanding social media and new website, we
aim to provide more interactive coverage and offer additional
community services.
Check
 out our recent coverage of the university campus closure protests, Suggs from Madness laying the last plank on the restored pier, the Victorian hot baths converted into a state-of-the-art skate park, and what people in Hastings think of the EU referendum.
Risks & Challenges
  

We’ve
already wrestled with and overcome just about every risk and
challenge possible in the last two years. Somehow we’ve managed to
keep going, so we’re confident that we can continue to grow. However, we have now reached  a crux point, so it is vital that we ensure this crowdfunding campaign is successful to provide us with a more stable financial footing.

We’re
also now in a position to apply for funding from a range of other
sources, so we’ll be aiming to secure additional grants, in
particular to support our free training programme for our volunteers.

What emerged was her vision for Tare. Tare combines all of her passions – oceans, reducing plastic pollution, environmental education, and fostering community – into one venture. Kate can't do it alone though and has been astounded by the outpouring of support to help her vision come to life. Kate was recently highlighted in a Dal Alumni Profile. <a href=""https://www.dal.ca/news/2018/07/05/alum-kate-pepler-adds-it-all-up.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read it here</a>!</p><p> </p><h2>Risks and challenges</h2><p>While there are now many zero waste bulk stores worldwide, this is the first zero-waste coffee shop/store/community hub in Nova Scotia.

And we aim to support our growth and survival by offering educational weekend programs for kids, a high-quality bi-monthly speaker series, and do it yourself workshops where people can make and take home their own beauty and cleaning products. </p><p>In addition, we feel that having the café will not only bring people into the store, but will also create a place for eco-conscious individuals to come together.

What emerged was her vision for Tare. Tare combines all of her passions – oceans, reducing plastic pollution, environmental education, and fostering community – into one venture. Kate can't do it alone though and has been astounded by the outpouring of support to help her vision come to life. Kate was recently highlighted in a Dal Alumni Profile. Read it here! Risks and challengesWhile there are now many zero waste bulk stores worldwide, this is the first zero-waste coffee shop/store/community hub in Nova Scotia. However, there has already been wonderful support for Tare, both from the media and the local community. We have held 5 pop-up shops and already sold over $3000 of zero-waste lifestyle products. The challenge will be in retaining the customer base after that initial excitement of our opening. Creating a community of like-minded individuals takes time. And we aim to support our growth and survival by offering educational weekend programs for kids, a high-quality bi-monthly speaker series, and do it yourself workshops where people can make and take home their own beauty and cleaning products. In addition, we feel that having the café will not only bring people into the store, but will also create a place for eco-conscious individuals to come together. Additionally, the store will bring people in who might then stay for a coffee and a treat.Seen onYou read all the way to the bottom!

<h3><strong>HELP US SAVE THE TABARD!</strong></h3>
<p><em>We need to cover ourselves so please ensure you’ve read about our goal and understand that your donation (less Indiegogo fees) and validity of your perk are contingent on us securing majority ownership of the Tabard.</em></p>
<p><strong>What's the Tabard Inn Employee Committee?</strong></p>
<p>The Tabard Inn Employee Committee is comprised of current and former employees, and even some patrons who are concerned about the future of the Tabard.  We've come together to save the Tabard by growing employee ownership to keep Tabard in the hands of those who know it and love it.</p>
<p><strong>How Will Contributions Help Save the Tabard?</strong></p>
Tabard Inn Employee Committee believes the Tabard belongs in the hands of those who know it and love it.  To preserve the Tabard and promote its continued success, we seek to grow employee ownership for 30% to a majority.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To grow employee ownership requires resources. We need your help.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Sounds a Bit Complicated. How Exactly Will This Work?</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise funds to increase employee ownership to protect the Tabard.  If we are unable to grow that ownership to secure a safe majority ownership, we will return your donations less Indiegogo fees, which could range between 4%-9%.  Also, keep in mind, the perk you receive for your contribution will only be valid and honored if we secure majority ownership.   If we are unable to secure majority ownership, your perk will not be valid.</p>
<p>If we are successful in our attempts to secure majority ownership, we ask for your patience.  We estimate that we will need up to 1 year after securing ownership to fulfill your perk, or begin fulfilling perks that are realized over time.</p>
<p>We know the next year could very well include a lot of extra work, but we're ready and excited to have you join our campaign to save the Tabard.  We can’t accomplish this without you!</p>
<p><strong>Amazing Perks. It Almost Feels Like I'm Getting the Deal!<br/></strong></p>
<p>Well, let’s just say we consider this a mutually beneficial relationship; we love you and we hope you love us.  While trying to remember this is a fundraiser, we’ve tried our best to be fair and offer unique perks that express our gratitude.</p>
<p>We want to give you the world, but Indiegogo only allows us 20 perks at a time.  We've got plenty more ideas and offerings so if you're desiring something that isn't on the list, e-mail us at <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">savethetabard@gmail.com</span> and we'll try to figure something out.</p>
<p>For now, here are just a few of the incentives you could receive:</p>
<p>* A commemorative <strong><em>Rooms of the Tabard</em></strong> print.  This print will feature one photo from each of Tabard's 38 uniquely designed rooms. Photos will be taken by an Architectural Digest photographer.</p>
<p>* Personally designed cocktail on Tabard's cocktail menu for one year with a special recognition.  Please keep the names classy!</p>
<p>* 1 year membership to Tabard's Chef's Table, Salon Series, or Wine Club.</p>
<p>* Ink a Tabard employee with the <strong><em>Save the Tabard</em></strong> Logo</p>
<p>* Penthouse for a romantic weekend getaway.</p>
<p>* Private Tabard dinner party at your home.</p>
<p>* Tabard wedding or renewal of vows ceremony and reception.</p>
<p>As these and other perk categories are snatched up, we’ll be adding more!  Remember, we only retain your contribution, less Indiegogo fees and you only get your perk if we succeed in securing majority ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Why is the Tabard Worth Saving?</strong></p>
<p>Customers often share their personal stories of how they came to love Tabard.  Each time, it just reinforces what we believe - that Tabard is a special place. It's the perfect mix of character and class, perfection and experimentation, and comfort and edge. But that didn't happen by accident.</p>
<p>While valuing and empowering employees, the Tabard philosophy has always put the customer first. As a result, employees constantly collaborate looking for ways to improve the Tabard. We learn, teach, experiment, share and challenge one another.  In the end, customers benefit from an even better Tabard experience.</p>
<p>We know we're a little different. We like to think that's part of our charm.  No televisions in our hotel rooms.  Real books on our bookshelves. Thought-provoking artwork adorn our walls. We’ve always prided ourselves on our diverse and talented staff.  Generations of families are employed at the Tabard. If it feels like a family, that's because we are a family.</p>
<p>Tabard doesn't suppress character; it encourages expression.  No matter your background, your vestures, or your beliefs, the Tabard welcomes you.</p>
<p>We believe shareholders and employees aren't the only ones who have invested in the Tabard.  We know our patrons love the Tabard; some of you have been visiting us for over thirty years.  Now, that's an investment!  We realize when you choose the Tabard that you are contributing toward our success.  That is why we express our gratitude after you've shown your patronage.</p>
<p>Devoted employees and loyal patrons have made the Tabard a DC institution.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We realize not everyone is in a position to donate, but even small donations help.  We will do our best to recognize all who have contributed - big and small.</p>
<p>There are other ways you can help!!</p>

<h3>About the Geekery</h3>
<p>Purveyor of Geekery was started when my husband and I decided to start our family. Instead of continuing in <a href=""http://shellgreenier.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">my corporate world addiction</a>, I wanted to use my powers for good instead of evil*. In the last year and half I've worked with business owners around the world (yes: world, CRAZY! check out my <a href=""http://purveyorofgeekery.com/#client"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">client map here</a>) getting their businesses in gear, from marketing to consulting to training. In my spare time I've helped non-profits with their engagement strategies like the jQuery Foundation, mentor people in new skill sets and drink coffee to keep up with the pace. I want to continue doing this, only on a slightly larger scale. </p>
<p>* Evil: <span class=""prondelim"">[</span><span class=""pron""><span class=""boldface"">ee</span>-v<span class=""ital-inline"">uh</span>l</span><span class=""prondelim"">]</span> adjective Used to describe businesses who use disclaimers as a way to negate their actual offer and rip customers off via small print. The dark side really didn't have cookies, just a Keurig. No thanks.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What About the Big Girl Pants</h3>
<p>While focusing on everyone else's business, Purveyor of Geekery has neglected to take itself seriously as its own business entity. Neglected. Depressed. Miserably and Lonely, the little business sulks in the corner. It's time to start taking her seriously.</p>
<p>1. PoG needs a new computer. Seriously, the old one was on it's last leg years ago and I've been borrowing a family member's computer to make it by for the last year. You can only borrow something for so long before it crosses the line from ""borrowing"" to ""taking.""</p>
<p>Worse case scenario, I'll throw the components of my old laptop into a barebones case that it is compatible with. The worse case scenario is reflected in the funding amount set. Any money over the amount I am trying to raise will go towards better equipment. The idea of not having to duck tape a computer together would be fantastic! </p>
<p>2. Purveyor of Geekery needs a home, officially. I'm looking at space in a start-up incubator in the county over which also just happens to have non-astronomical Business Tax Fees as the city I would have to register if I filed locally. </p>
<p>Any and all funds will be put towards these two areas, above or below the amount set.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Perks! Please check out the different levels to the right. By helping my fund, you have the chance to get design, consultation, or training for yourself, friends and family or the non-profit of your choice. Contributions of $100 or more will get a gift certificate with matching funds from me towards the same, so for instance $100 becomes a $200 gift certificate. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Purveyor of Geekery has helped over 500 clients last year with their business goals. That is an insane number to think of: almost two people a working day on the road to no longer being reliant on corporate culture to make ends meet. Without a functioning computer, this is no longer feasible, obviously. Moving forward it will continue bring affordable services but will focus more on self sustainability, or teaching business owners how to raise successful businesses on their own as well. </p>

<p>My name is Katy Larsen. I am a mother of three, but I only mother 2 on Earth. I lost my middle child <a href=""http://somewhere-over-the-rainbow.myshopify.com/blogs/news/8380873-hannahs-story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Hannah's Story"">Hannah</a> to stillbirth in September 2009. I began gifting items to women that I would craft myself in an attempt to heal someone elses's heart. I didn't realize at the time how healing it was to my own heart.</p>
<p>I soon opened an <a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/somewheretherainbow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Etsy"">Etsy shop</a> and began selling Remembrance Items for these babies lost. I used the proceeds to continue to gift other families. I made memory boxes for all the hospitals in my state with a Labor &amp; Delivery Department, 21 in all, because <a href=""http://somewhere-over-the-rainbow.myshopify.com/blogs/news/8380873-hannahs-story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Hannah's Story"">Hannah</a> was born in an ER. It was horrific. But I was beginning to heal and with the birth of my third child I began to see some hope again. And that reflected in my shop as well. The side by side co-existence of hope and grief is most definitely depicted there.</p>
<p>This year I decided to try to take my venture a step farther and become an LLC with a real operating <a href=""http://www.sotrshop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"" title=""SOTR Shop"">website</a>. If I was to continue to help people and continue to raise awareness, I needed to grow. And so recently I joined forces with a marketing company called Vocus. This is where the funds come in. Marketing your company is not cheap but I see no other way to spread the word, spread the love, spread the hope. Losing a baby during or after pregnancy is devastating and my mission for my daughter is to help as many families as I can. Recentlt they issued my first <a href=""http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/7/prweb10968775.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_parent"" title=""Press Release"">Press Release</a>.</p>
<p>The funds will be use to continue the marketing process, to update some of the equipment we are working with and<strong> MOST IMPORTANTLY</strong> reach out and raise awareness. Pregnancy and Infant loss is taboo. Nobody wants to talk about a dead baby.....unless you have one.</p>
<p>The impact on these families is immense. It validates the life of that child to know that just one person has remembered his/her birthday or due date or day that they passed. One would be incredibly surprised to learn of how common Pregnancy and Infant Loss is, yet how you never hear of it. 1 in 4 pregnant women will suffer a loss. That is 25% of pregnant women.</p>
<p>Startling, right?</p>
<p>I would be estatic at the outreach this could create. Ideas are floating through my head at more and more ways of reaching bereaved parents and I hope you will believe in me and my cause and contribute. You will be impacting the lives of hundreds, hopefully thousands, of women.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute to my cause, you can still help! Tell your friends and use the share tools!</p></div>","SOTR Raising Awareness for Pregnancy and Infant Loss

The digital world is helping more musicians make music but provides less revenue for them to make a living. Now, mobile technology is here, and we believe mobile can completely transform the music experience and provide new revenue streams that sustain Artists. We started Adva Mobile when we saw a way to help Artists connect with their fans on mobile phones, engage their fans where they are (on their phones!) and give them tools to sell music, tickets and merchandise, and let them keep all the money themselves.</span></font></p><p></p><p></p>

We give artists everything they need to take advantage of mobile – phone friendly web sites, Apps, text messaging, downloads, tour dates, and a storefront to sell stuff to their fans. Most of the bands choose our free service -- we think every band should be able to take advantage of this new mobile technology. More of them are starting to upgrade to our paid services. The back end software and databases of our site works great and provides the most complete mobile marketing functionality and tools available to Artists anywhere. <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/68870705@N05/6267339476/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Custom_Designs by jackk911, on Flickr""><img alt=""Custom_Designs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6050/6267339476_cfa3013645.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a> </font></span></p>

OUR STORY
We're music fans and technology nerds, and we’re concerned about the current chaotic state of music. The digital world is helping more musicians make music but provides less revenue for them to make a living. Now, mobile technology is here, and we believe mobile can completely transform the music experience and provide new revenue streams that sustain Artists. We started Adva Mobile when we saw a way to help Artists connect with their fans on mobile phones, engage their fans where they are (on their phones!) and give them tools to sell music, tickets and merchandise, and let them keep all the money themselves.
We built our first version in 2008 and over 1,400 bands have found us and signed up. We give artists everything they need to take advantage of mobile – phone friendly web sites, Apps, text messaging, downloads, tour dates, and a storefront to sell stuff to their fans. Most of the bands choose our free service -- we think every band should be able to take advantage of this new mobile technology. More of them are starting to upgrade to our paid services. The back end software and databases of our site works great and provides the most complete mobile marketing functionality and tools available to Artists anywhere.  
 So we are doing amazing things for artists to help them connect with their fans and make money and have music careers. We've made some really cool custom mobile websites (including one for our friends at Constant Contact) and Apps and have run some great campaigns that get fans to sign up and download music. They're just starting to make purchases on mobile phones. The artists are excited and believe we are giving them a good service and a path to their future, which they know is mobile.
 
Lately though, they’re telling us that their mobile site is not cool and our web site dashboard to manage their mobile campaigns is dated – thus, they are reluctant to use it. Some of our partner opportunities are turned off because the portal looks so old, and one has refused to partner with us until we display current design standards. It’s like what Steve Jobs said: Great Products are useful (check), emotionally satisfying (check) and attractive to look at (definitely uncheck!). So we need to fix that.  
  WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET 


We're looking to raise $6,500 to design a modern image for our webpages and layout the user interface that manages our software in a modern, attractive look that will be appealing to our customers. We need to hire a graphics web designer with experience in user interface technologies to take our existing mobile marketing services platform and make it easy to use and beautiful to look at.This individual or team will deliver approximately 30 webpages laid out with the user interface designed for the task -- uploading music to download, entering concert information, managing fans, etc. Their deliverable is HTML and CSS files that execute the design. This design next needs to be tied into the existing backend database, so that, for example, when you enter a tour date, it shows up correctly on the database so that it shows up correctly on a fans mobile phone. We need to hire a software pro expert in .NET/ASP programming to integrate the front end with the back end. We financed the company so far out of our own pockets, sweat, and credit. The money raised here will go directly to hiring a contract design and user interface professional that can deliver an outstanding user interface experience for the services we provide.  If we raise more than our goal, we'll use the money to improve the platform with more features, and marketing.
 
As long as we're working with a design expert, we would also have him design new mobile web templates for our free and paid subscribers. The current mobile designs are functionally amazing but boring to look at, and artists are not excited to promote their own mobile web presence when it looks so lame. For artists that choose our free service,even they should have a design that is current and modern.
 
 
 We're offering a wide range of perks to our Indie GoGo pledgers. If you're an artist or someone in the music industry, you can take advantage of the paid versions of our mobile platform at terrific discounts. You’ll get to work with the new platform you helped create! If you're part of a business that can benefit from mobile advertising, our mobile websites display thousands of ads each day and we can offer you mobile advertising targeted to the music demographic -- 18 to 34-year-olds. Friends that help us out get to claim support for our mission and we’ve thought of a bunch of fun stuff from Adva Mobile to thank you. Take a look and make your pledge now! And THANK YOU SO MUCH!

<h3>Our Project</h3>
<p>We are a group of passionate garden and sustainable-living enthusiasts in the small rural hilltown of Plainfield, Massachusetts. We have established a relationship with our local Franklin Land Trust to use some of their pristine farm land to create a community garden. This land, also known as the Guyette Farm, was gifted to the Franklin Land Trust by Eveyln Guyette and is permanently protected from development. We seek to create a beautiful and functional agricultural space for community members to use and enjoy, as a continuation of the long farming history of the land by the Guyette family.</p>
<p>Our community garden seeks to fill an important void in our area: access of gardening land for those in transition or without land, or for those who need extra support such as education and resources to build organic, nutrient dense soil. In addition, we are in need of more community building activities to strengthen our neighborhood ties in an otherwise isolating landscape. Furthermore, the community garden establishes public space for group garden projects to benefit the community at large.</p>
<p>Last year we plowed a quarter acre and cover cropped the area in preparation for the garden. This year will be our first season of growing food crops. We are welcoming people to acquire plots for personal gardens in half of the plowed land. In the other half, we are initiating shared community projects. This year, some of these community projects include: seed saving to create a local seed bank; growing vegetables for our local elementary school and for the food pantry; sustainable growing demonstrations using Permaculture and Grow Biointensive techniques. </p>
<p>Last year we invited local experts and held workshops on pruning berries and on sheet mulching. These workshops supported our intention to re-establish and maintain the heirloom raspberries and blueberries that were part of the Guyette family's garden. This year, we hope to continue to provide workshops on a variety of gardening practices, such as hand pollination of winter squash, basic seed saving, and more. We also hope to use garden produce for healthy cooking instruction.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help us with the start-up costs of the Guyette Farm Community Garden. Our priorities from funding are to pay for compost and amendments to build a nutrient dense soil composition, and to pay for needed fencing to protect the crops from wildlife feasting. Any additional funds will be used for creating a watering system.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please consider giving whatever amount you can. Every little bit helps, even if it's $1 or $5.  Please look at the ""Perks"" in the boxes on the right side of this page to see what we will give back to you when you are able to give $10, $25, $50, $150, $300 or more. </p>
<p>The funds we raise from your contributions will focus on these garden start-up needs:</p>
<p>1. Compost for the quarter acre: $500 estimation including already inquired discounts</p>
<p>2. Orgnaic Amendments for the garden: $500 estimation. </p>
<p>We hope to build a nutrient dense soil with time. And we hope that by providing compost and amendments, we will make it more appealing for those without access, and easier for gardeners to create flourishing gardens.</p>
<p>3. Basic Fencing: $750 estimation for metal fence posts and metal grid fencing.</p>
<p>Extra Funds-- Watering System: Any extra funds from this campaign will go towards the set-up of a watering system which involves pumping from the nearby spring with piping and hoses that connect to the garden. Estimated $1000 cost.</p>
<p>Even if we do not reach our campaign goal of $1,750 to cover compost, amendments, and fencing, we will still go ahead with our plans for the community garden this season.</p>
<p>If you would like to make a tax deductible donation, you can donate directly to Franklin Land Trust, with a memo about supporting the Community Garden. . </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Food insecurity and environmental degradation are major concerns for people all over the world. I believe that now, more than ever, we need to act to change the social and economic divide supported by systems of exploitation. Taking charge of local food production is an important act of connection with land, earth's resources, labor, and community. Creating this community garden is an example of dedicated action, which will increase the health of people, communities, and our environment. </p>
<p>John Jeavons, my teacher and pioneer of Grow Biointensive mini-farming says, ""All we need to do is to start with one growing bed and tend it well, and we have begun the exciting, expanding, giving process of enlivening and healing the Earth and ourselves.""</p>

<h3>Our Groundbreaking</h3>
<p>On Saturday, May 12, 2012, we will be having the groundbreaking for our garden. We will have activities from 10 am to 2 pm. The following is the schedule of activites:</p>

Mandy loved treats, but she was picky: she wanted goodies free of dairy, soy, eggs, wheat, and refined sugars; and they couldn't taste like dust. This was no easy task, but Mandy was determined: if no one else was making yummy cookies and treats up to her standards, she would do it herself! Thus, Wholesome Bakery was born.Wholesome Bakery knows there are many different diets out there, and many people with allergies to different ingredients. Wholesome Bakery is about making delicious treats that all people, no matter what their diet, may enjoy. There is no wheat, no soy, no eggs, and no dairy in Wholesome Bakery's treats because these are all very common allergens, as well as zero refined sugars. Only wholesome ingredients and natural sweeteners are used. Those are Wholesome Bakery's standards: No junk, and no ingredients devoid of nutritional value.

Wholesome Bakery has been baking goodie after goodie, unrelenting in the quest for the best-tasting, most mouth-watering, least complicated treat. Wholesome Bakery uses local, organic ingredients, the lowest-level gluten flour, and low-glycemic sweeteners. The results, after years of hard-work (and lots of taste-testing) are delicious treats that taste like treats!
What began as goodies for a health-conscious individual years ago has blossomed into a full-scale bakery. Wholesome Bakery needs help taking its next big step: opening a retail location so everyone knows where to find our goodies!
Wholesome Bakery, right now, operates out of a commercial kitchen in the Mission District and is sold at numerous coffee shops, cafes, and grocery stores all over San Francisco.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Bun Always Rises is a licensed residential bakery in Lyla &amp; Jules' very own kitchen in Northampton, MA. Help us take our business a HUGE leap forward by going wholesale! A wholesale license will let us <span>source our products to grocery markets &amp; stores!</span></p>
<p>We built our humble bakery with a commitment to providing local, organic, vegan &amp; gluten-free baked goods through sliding-scale costs. Our specialty is vegan challah which we bake every Friday and (once the warmth arrives, we will) deliver by bike.</p>
<p>What have we done so far? One wedding and one to come, numeous birthday cakes, a full season at two fabulous farmer's markets, Shabbos dinner deliveries, and so much more!</p>
<p>In fact, our challahs, cinnamon buns, cakes, cookies, breads, muffins and more have become so popular that we've decided to go wholesale! This means we can venture beyond deliveries and our farmer's market tables, and start sourcing to local groceries &amp; stores in the area.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>$300 will get us our Massachusetts wholesale license!</p>
<p>$150 will get us necessary prints of product labels and signage!</p>
<p>$150 will get us more baking equitpment (quadrupling our products = building an industrial cooling rack, etc!) </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Hopefully, a warm feeling that you've allowed us to engage with our community with a stronger presense. Check out the side bar on the right to find out how we can express our gratitude for your contributions :)</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Getting a wholesale license means a lot of great things.</p>
<p>It means that we can make challah available in this area of Western Massachusetts (of which there's a dire lack!).</p>
<p>It means you are supporting a beautiful, alternative economy that we're trying to cultivate. Because all our products are sliding-scale (aka- 'pay what you can'), your ability to help us in turn means that we will be able to continue providing affordable organic local breads &amp; baked goods.</p>
<p>Above all, a wholesale license will allow us to sell our sliding-scale vegan baked goods DAILY at Food For Thought Books- a not for profit collectively run Bookstore in Amherst, MA. (Foodforthoughtbooks.com)</p>
<h3><strong>With Love</strong></h3>
<p>We love you! We pitch this fundraising effort humbly and with immense gratitude for your time scrolling through the page. Every contribution counts. We thank you with sticky fingers &amp; flour-spotted clothes for anything you are able to give, your good wishes much included.</p>

<h2><strong>The Concept</strong></h2>
<p>South of the Border has been created to change the way people experience cities. We want to give locals and tourists alike an opportunity to get to know Sydney at a deeper level by going to places not on the tourist trail, but those with heart and soul. Just like Redfern.</p>
<p>We’ve created an incredible 3 hour walking experience in the Sydney suburb of Redfern. Small groups of no more than 10 people will get to hear the amazing stories you’ve perhaps heard about but never had the chance to fully engage with. You’ll meet the local heroes that make the community tick. You’ll see first-hand the amazing culture, local craftsmen and art that make Redfern buzz.</p>

<p>While we’re creating innovative tourism experiences, our dream is that tourism can become a catalyst for positive change in urban communities. That’s why South of the Border is a social enterprise that proudly supports a number of grassroots community initiatives. When you join a South of the Border Redfern experience, you can be sure that your money is supporting the community. Creating real shared value for you and the local community.</p>

<h2><strong>The Innovation Process</strong></h2>
<p>We’ve had an amazing journey so far, having worked on creating South of the Border throughout 2012. The Founders are extremely passionate about the potential for tourism to be sustainable and nourishing for local communities. And breaking down some of the barriers that separate positive connections. In creating South of the Border they’ve taken a human-centred approach by incorporating feedback into every step of the design and creation process.</p>
<p>This began back in February 2012, when Nathan &amp; Baptiste joined Nobel Laureate, Muhammad Yunus, for the Social Business Week workshop in Singapore. <em>Prof. Yunus and his team made us dream...</em></p>
<p><img alt=""Yunus"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/115215503/IMG_2712-%20600.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>On returning to Sydney, the guys were fortunate enough to come across the amazing service designers at specialist firm, Huddle Design. The team worked through many service design innovation workshops. <em>Nathan Welch and his team made us believe…</em></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/38208279/Indiegogo/IMG_3520.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img alt=""working"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropbox.com/u/115215503/CCS%20office-%20400.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Off again we travelled (it’s great to work in the travel industry!), this time to seek advice and best practice on two key focus areas. Firstly, the guys wanted to experience walking ‘tours’ in a number of different cities to test the status quo. To go way beyond and seek innovation points. Secondly, Nathan sought the sage advice of a number of social enterprises, to develop community engagement and to deeply understand how to ensure sustainability in the community. <em>Aarti, Inir and Chris made us concentrate…</em></p>
<p>Over the last couple of months, the South of the Border team have been running a series of prototype tours in Redfern. This has been at different stages of the experience’s development to incorporate feedback, to test our assumptions. Thanks to all those who have participated. We love you guys! <em>Our friends have made us realise anything is possible…</em></p>

<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Who are the South of the Border Founders? </em></h3>
<p>Nathan Wiltshire is from Sydney, having spent a number of years working in the tourism industry. He’s passionate about tourism as a catalyst for positive change . And Baptiste Bachellerie, an adopted Parisian, has come to Sydney to see how he can make a real difference. Plus the amazing South of the Border team – Jess, Mette, Laura, Emil, Hasan, Stella &amp; Caroline – these guys and gals are truly special.</p>
<h3><em>When will South of the Border begin tours?</em></h3>
<p>We’ll be starting our Redfern experience in early February 2013.</p>
<h3><em>When will I be able to claim my Redfern experience?</em></h3>
<p>We’ll be running a number of walking experiences in Redfern throughout February 2013. There will be weekday and weekend schedules to chose from. Dates to be released mid-January.</p>
<h3><em>What happens if I am unable to attend any of the tour dates?</em></h3>
<p>There will be many dates to chose from. In the unlikely event that you cannot attend any dates in February, we will either offer you a date in March, or another great perk such as lunch with the Founders. You won’t be disappointed!</p>
<h3><em>What will the $8500 target of funding go towards?</em></h3>
<p>We’ll be using your generous support to create a full website, to document and create content around our project and the community support we’re generating, and to cover operating costs to run the tours in February including insurance, tour guide and other costs.</p>
<h3><em>What will happen if you don’t reach $8,500?</em></h3>
<p>Firstly, we’ll cry! Only joking! The majority of our target ($8,500) is to enable us to create the most amazing website we have our heart set on. With less money we can still fulfil our project aims. Just the scale and scope of our web platform will be a little more modest. We’ve bootstrapped everything to date, so we’ve proven it can be done!</p>

<h3><em>How does South of the Border aim to support grassroots community initiatives?</em></h3>
<p>South of the Border supports grassroots community initiatives in and around Redfern in three ways. Firstly, we provide technical assistance for a whole manner of tasks such as developing social media and expanding networks. Secondly, we give these initiatives a platform to connect with a wider scope of people. Lastly, we directly fund some initiatives that we interact with during our Redfern walking experience.</p>
<h3><em>Is there opportunity for me to become involved in South of the Border and the work they do?</em></h3>

Firstly, the guys wanted to experience walking ‘tours’ in a number of different cities to test the status quo. To go way beyond and seek innovation points. Secondly, Nathan sought the sage advice of a number of social enterprises, to develop community engagement and to deeply understand how to ensure sustainability in the community. Aarti, Inir and Chris made us concentrate…
Over the last couple of months, the South of the Border team have been running a series of prototype tours in Redfern. This has been at different stages of the experience’s development to incorporate feedback, to test our assumptions. Thanks to all those who have participated. We love you guys! Our friends have made us realise anything is possible…

FAQ
Who are the South of the Border Founders? 
Nathan Wiltshire is from Sydney, having spent a number of years working in the tourism industry. He’s passionate about tourism as a catalyst for positive change . And Baptiste Bachellerie, an adopted Parisian, has come to Sydney to see how he can make a real difference. Plus the amazing South of the Border team – Jess, Mette, Laura, Emil, Hasan, Stella & Caroline – these guys and gals are truly special.
When will South of the Border begin tours?
We’ll be starting our Redfern experience in early February 2013.
When will I be able to claim my Redfern experience?
We’ll be running a number of walking experiences in Redfern throughout February 2013. There will be weekday and weekend schedules to chose from. Dates to be released mid-January.
What happens if I am unable to attend any of the tour dates?
There will be many dates to chose from. In the unlikely event that you cannot attend any dates in February, we will either offer you a date in March, or another great perk such as lunch with the Founders. You won’t be disappointed!
What will the $8500 target of funding go towards?
We’ll be using your generous support to create a full website, to document and create content around our project and the community support we’re generating, and to cover operating costs to run the tours in February including insurance, tour guide and other costs.
What will happen if you don’t reach $8,500?
Firstly, we’ll cry! Only joking! The majority of our target ($8,500) is to enable us to create the most amazing website we have our heart set on. With less money we can still fulfil our project aims. Just the scale and scope of our web platform will be a little more modest. We’ve bootstrapped everything to date, so we’ve proven it can be done!

How does South of the Border aim to support grassroots community initiatives?
South of the Border supports grassroots community initiatives in and around Redfern in three ways. Firstly, we provide technical assistance for a whole manner of tasks such as developing social media and expanding networks. Secondly, we give these initiatives a platform to connect with a wider scope of people. Lastly, we directly fund some initiatives that we interact with during our Redfern walking experience.
Is there opportunity for me to become involved in South of the Border and the work they do?
We’re always looking for passionate people to collaborate with us! Start a conversation by emailing us at contact@gosouth.co .",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>*<i>************************En français plus bas.*******************************</i><br/></b><br/>We, Max Godber, Mauricio Buschinelli, Iman Khailat and Sam Richer, are the co-founders of Cycle AlimenTerre. We are 4 roommates that live in a Do-it-yourself (DIY) household. We came together to develop an <b>urban agriculture model</b> that could<b> benefit communities</b> directly. We wanted to see an affordable and healthy produce alternative to box stores or expensive markets emerge in our neighborhood. We set out to farm local, naturally grown vegetables in people’s unused backyards and distribute them by bicycle
 market.<br/> <p></p>
<p></p> </div>After 2014's pilot project, we are in it for another year and could use your help with our start-up costs. We believe our business model is sustainable and that by the end of the 4th year, our operations will pay for themselves. <b>We just need a boost to get off the ground!</b><br/><div>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>How does this help?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improve food security in our neighborhood by increasing access to fresh, natural produce.</li>
<li>Low production costs du to community involvement and the lack of expensive machinery allow us to sell our quality produce cheaper.</li>
<li>Increase overall well-being and good health for the residents of my neighborhood. </li>
<li>Positively impact our environment by promoting active transport and chemical-free agriculture,</li>
<li>Increase green spaces.</li>
<li>Offer learning opportunities for volunteers and interns.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
<b>How does it work?</b><br/>
</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
We install micro-farms in backyards donated to the project by community members. We use the SPIN farming (Small-Plot-INtensive) method to maximise our yield and reduce our costs. <br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1283787/files/20150310090244-STHb4.jpg?1426003364"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<br/><p>Here are SPIN-Farming's Key Characteristics*:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production based</li>
<li>Sub-acre in scale</li>
<li>Low capital intensive</li>
<li>Entrepreneurially driven</li>
<li>Environmentally friendly</li>
<li>Close to markets</li>
</ul>
<br/><p><b>We maintain</b> the gardens with the help of volunteers and interns. A portion of the <b>harvested produce is divided </b>between the land donors and the rest is brought to market. In our neighborhood, four areas have been classified as<b> food deserts</b>: «spaces of relative exclusion where people suffer from psysical and economical barriers to access healthy food**». These food deserts is where we wish to concentrate our efforts. </p>
<p>All our work is done using <b>bikes</b>. We transport compost, tools, seedlings, wood and much more, all using bike trailers. This keeps our operations eco-friendly and cost effective.</p>
<p>In order<b> to finance</b> our project, CAT will also be producing<b> micro-greens</b> using an indoor growing set-up. This will allow us to produce a delicious, healthy, fresh baby green 10 months out of the year. They will then be sold to local merchants and restaurants. <br/></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Can we do it?</h3>
<p>We aren't going to lie to you, farming can be risky business. The growing season is unpredictable, every year brings new climactic challenges and different waves of pests. </p>
<p>However, we already have one year of operation. The 2015 growing season will only be better. We are better prepared, better organised, more knowledgeable...</p>
<p>But more important, now we have help. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>We now have the support of over half a dozen influencial organisations within our neighborhood. <br/>
</li>
<li>We have volunteers and interns working with us, giving invaluable support and help. <br/>
</li>
<li>We have more land, in better locations. <br/>
</li>
<li>We have allies providing us with growing space, equipment, discounts, advice.</li>
<li>We have very experienced farmers and gardeners lending their brains.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We have everything we need this year to really kick butt!</p>

<p></p>
<h3>YES WE CAN!</h3>
<p>Our biggest setback is our total lack of funds. So far, we've been financing CAT through the sale of 2014's produce and our own meager salaries. Unfortunately, we won't survive another season without some help with our start-up costs.</p>

<p>Nous sommes Max Godber, Mauricio Buschinelli,
Iman Khailat et Samantha Richer, colocs et co-fondateurEs de Cycle AlimenTerre. Nous nous
sommes  unis en 2014 pour développer <b>un modèle en agriculture urbaine</b> qui bénéficierait notre <b>communauté</b>. Notre désir: voir l’émergence de
marchés locaux qui fourniraient des produits sains et abordables comme
alternative aux supermarchés. Nous nous sommes mis a l'épreuve en tentant de
cultiver des légumes dans les cours arrières inutilisées pour ensuite faire la distribution de ceux-ci au moyen d'un marché à vélo.</p>
<p>Suite à l'année
pilote de 2014, nous nous lançons de nouveau pour la saison 2015, mais nous avons besoin d'un petit coup de main. Nous avons confiance que notre modèle
d'affaire est durable et nos projections démontrent que nous devrions être rentable à partir de notre 4e année d'opérations. D'ici là, nous
aurons besoin d'aide avec les coûts de départ.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>Mais en quoi ce
projet est-il bénéfique?</b></h3>
<br/><ul>
<li>Amélioration de la sécurité alimentaire dans notre quartier en augmentant la disponibilité et l'accessibilité de produits frais.</li>
<li>L'implication volontaire ainsi que l'absence de machinerie lourde permet de réduire nos coûts d'opération et de vendre nos légumes à un meilleur prix.</li>
<li>Amélioration générale du bien-être de notre communauté à travers de saines habitudes de vie et une bonne alimentation. <br/>
</li>
<li>Impact positif sur l’environnement en promouvant le transport actif et une agriculture sans produits chimiques.</li>
<li>Augmentation des espaces verts.</li>
<li>Opportunités d'appentissage pour bénévoles et stagiaires. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul></ul>
<h3>
Comment ça fonctionne?</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<p>Nous installons des
mini-fermes dans les cours arrières qui nous sont offertes par des membres de
notre communauté. Nous utilisons la méthode «SPIN
farming»(Small-Plot INtensive) pour cultiver nos légumes.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Voici les caractéristiques de la methode SPIN farming*</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Basé sur la production <br/>
</li>
<li>Moins d'un acre<br/>
</li>
<li>Investissement initial minime<br/>
</li>
<li>Bon pour de jeunes entrepreneurs</li>
<li>Écologique</li>
<li>Près des marchés<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<b>Nous entretenons les jardins</b> avec l'aide de bénévoles et de stagiaires. Une portion
des<b> récoltes est offerte aux propriétaires </b>des terrains cultivés et l'autre
portion est vendue dans les marchés. Ḑans notre quartier, il y a 4
régions classifiées comme <b>désert alimentaire</b>, c'est-à-dire: «espaces de relative exclusion où les gens souffrent des barrières physiques et économiques pour accéder à une nourriture saine**». C'est dans ces régions
que nous désirons concentrer nos efforts
<p>
</p>
<p>Tout le travail est complété à l'aide de <b>vélos</b>. Nous transportons notre compost, nos
outils, nos semences, et encore plus avec notre remorque pour bicyclettes.
Grâce à cela, notre projet est éco-responsable et rentable.</p>
<p></p>

<p>
</p>
<p>Afin de
<b>financer le projet</b>, CycleAlimenTerre cultivera aussi des
pousses à l'intérieur pour 10 mois de l'année. Ces pousses seront par la

</div></div>","*************************En français plus bas.*******************************We, Max Godber, Mauricio Buschinelli, Iman Khailat and Sam Richer, are the co-founders of Cycle AlimenTerre. We are 4 roommates that live in a Do-it-yourself (DIY) household. We came together to develop an urban agriculture model that could benefit communities directly. We wanted to see an affordable and healthy produce alternative to box stores or expensive markets emerge in our neighborhood. We set out to farm local, naturally grown vegetables in people’s unused backyards and distribute them by bicycle
 market. 
 After 2014's pilot project, we are in it for another year and could use your help with our start-up costs. We believe our business model is sustainable and that by the end of the 4th year, our operations will pay for themselves. We just need a boost to get off the ground!

  How does this help?

Improve food security in our neighborhood by increasing access to fresh, natural produce.
Low production costs du to community involvement and the lack of expensive machinery allow us to sell our quality produce cheaper.
Increase overall well-being and good health for the residents of my neighborhood. 
Positively impact our environment by promoting active transport and chemical-free agriculture,
Increase green spaces.
Offer learning opportunities for volunteers and interns.



How does it work?



We install micro-farms in backyards donated to the project by community members. We use the SPIN farming (Small-Plot-INtensive) method to maximise our yield and reduce our costs. 


Here are SPIN-Farming's Key Characteristics*:

Production based
Sub-acre in scale
Low capital intensive
Entrepreneurially driven
Environmentally friendly
Close to markets

We maintain the gardens with the help of volunteers and interns. A portion of the harvested produce is divided between the land donors and the rest is brought to market. In our neighborhood, four areas have been classified as food deserts: «spaces of relative exclusion where people suffer from psysical and economical barriers to access healthy food**». These food deserts is where we wish to concentrate our efforts. 
All our work is done using bikes. We transport compost, tools, seedlings, wood and much more, all using bike trailers. This keeps our operations eco-friendly and cost effective.
In order to finance our project, CAT will also be producing micro-greens using an indoor growing set-up. This will allow us to produce a delicious, healthy, fresh baby green 10 months out of the year. They will then be sold to local merchants and restaurants.

Can we do it?
We aren't going to lie to you, farming can be risky business. The growing season is unpredictable, every year brings new climactic challenges and different waves of pests. 
However, we already have one year of operation. The 2015 growing season will only be better. We are better prepared, better organised, more knowledgeable...
But more important, now we have help. 

We now have the support of over half a dozen influencial organisations within our neighborhood. 

We have volunteers and interns working with us, giving invaluable support and help. 

We have more land, in better locations. 

We have allies providing us with growing space, equipment, discounts, advice.
We have very experienced farmers and gardeners lending their brains.


We have everything we need this year to really kick butt!



YES WE CAN!
Our biggest setback is our total lack of funds. So far, we've been financing CAT through the sale of 2014's produce and our own meager salaries. Unfortunately, we won't survive another season without some help with our start-up costs.
And that's where you come in!! 
The money you donate to our project will go into:
Branding and MarketingBusiness AdministrationEquipmentGrowing spaceHand ToolsIrrigationOffice SuppliesOrganic MaterialsPaying coordinatorsRow Cover SystemSeedling; Microgreen PropagatorTrailer SystemsTrellis System

Please help us develop this model in our neighborhood and fill a need that is currently being unmet. Check out our cool artesanal gifts you can receive when you back our project.
As an incubator project of the NDG Food Depot, you can receive a tax receipt for donations over 20$ should you wish so. Please note that you can not be issued a tax receipt if you claim a perk. Please send an email to lecyclealimenterre@gmail.com to claim your tax receipt.

Thanks for your time. We know you're busy, so we kept it short. Should you want to know more, we'll gladly answer any questions. Please visit our FB page

Nous sommes Max Godber, Mauricio Buschinelli,
Iman Khailat et Samantha Richer, colocs et co-fondateurEs de Cycle AlimenTerre. Nous nous
sommes  unis en 2014 pour développer un modèle en agriculture urbaine qui bénéficierait notre communauté. Notre désir: voir l’émergence de
marchés locaux qui fourniraient des produits sains et abordables comme
alternative aux supermarchés. Nous nous sommes mis a l'épreuve en tentant de
cultiver des légumes dans les cours arrières inutilisées pour ensuite faire la distribution de ceux-ci au moyen d'un marché à vélo.
Suite à l'année
pilote de 2014, nous nous lançons de nouveau pour la saison 2015, mais nous avons besoin d'un petit coup de main. Nous avons confiance que notre modèle
d'affaire est durable et nos projections démontrent que nous devrions être rentable à partir de notre 4e année d'opérations. D'ici là, nous
aurons besoin d'aide avec les coûts de départ.


Mais en quoi ce
projet est-il bénéfique?

Amélioration de la sécurité alimentaire dans notre quartier en augmentant la disponibilité et l'accessibilité de produits frais.
L'implication volontaire ainsi que l'absence de machinerie lourde permet de réduire nos coûts d'opération et de vendre nos légumes à un meilleur prix.
Amélioration générale du bien-être de notre communauté à travers de saines habitudes de vie et une bonne alimentation. 

Impact positif sur l’environnement en promouvant le transport actif et une agriculture sans produits chimiques.
Augmentation des espaces verts.
Opportunités d'appentissage pour bénévoles et stagiaires. 




Comment ça fonctionne?


Nous installons des
mini-fermes dans les cours arrières qui nous sont offertes par des membres de
notre communauté. Nous utilisons la méthode «SPIN
farming»(Small-Plot INtensive) pour cultiver nos légumes.


Voici les caractéristiques de la methode SPIN farming*


Basé sur la production 

Moins d'un acre

Investissement initial minime

Bon pour de jeunes entrepreneurs
Écologique
Près des marchés


Nous entretenons les jardins avec l'aide de bénévoles et de stagiaires. Une portion
des récoltes est offerte aux propriétaires des terrains cultivés et l'autre
portion est vendue dans les marchés. Ḑans notre quartier, il y a 4
régions classifiées comme désert alimentaire, c'est-à-dire: «espaces de relative exclusion où les gens souffrent des barrières physiques et économiques pour accéder à une nourriture saine**». C'est dans ces régions
que nous désirons concentrer nos efforts


Tout le travail est complété à l'aide de vélos. Nous transportons notre compost, nos
outils, nos semences, et encore plus avec notre remorque pour bicyclettes.
Grâce à cela, notre projet est éco-responsable et rentable.




Afin de
financer le projet, CycleAlimenTerre cultivera aussi des
pousses à l'intérieur pour 10 mois de l'année. Ces pousses seront par la
suite vendues aux commercants et restaurants locaux.

Poly A. Endrasik Jr - Communications

Terry Beltran - Special Events Coordinator
We are raising money online from Now until March 31, 2014 to help with startup costs. 

The money raised will go towards Wi-Fi, office and daycare furniture and other equipment to run an efficient office.

Many women struggle trying to have a career and a family too. With technology
being what it is today, many mothers are choosing to work from home or
telecommuting. However, they still need uninterrupted time to get the job
done.  Daycare can often be expensive and many families spend thousands on
day care every year. This can make many families suffer financially. 
Visionary Meetings vows to help other
women start or grow their company and by reducing the barriers that is needed
for them to succeed.
We’re creating Visionary Meetings on the
behalf of millions of women who spend countless hours taking care of their
families and still devote time to working and creating that dream business like
myself.
I’m one of those women that try to
balance work and family. I know firsthand how hard it is to rearrange your
finances so you can have enough to pay daycare cost and maybe a couple other
bills.Due to the economy it has been a challenge obtaining capital to fund our
project.  The current campaign will only fund 1/3 of the necessary capital
required to open the doors. We are in the process of seeking a small loan for
the rest of the amount needed.Perks
Please note that perks that require an items that needs to
ship may be shipped in separate packages.
We will add a NEW perk every week so come and visit us every
week. Unpopular or unclaimed perks may be removed so if you see a perk you like
make sure you claim it right away. If you’re interested in discounts for prepaid coworking
space, we have two listed. please contact us as we will be adding more prepaid weeks in the coming weeks
after the initial launch as details on of construction start to come in. Visionary Meetings will offer conference rooms, onsite daycare, limited number of private offices and a open coworking space.T-shirt with Visionary Meetings Logo - $25Pledge levels will be set up with specific rewards for donations to the
project. Any amount will help and no pledge will go unrewarded.

name is Daniel Roberts and I live with Spina Bifida, I am 19 years old. My racing
career started in August of 2009 at the age of 14 in Snowflake,
Arizona which was my first race ever. Since that day I have dreamed of becoming an ATV Racing Professional. My life revolves around
my racing, as well as school, and volunteer work. At school I keep a 3.2 GPA. I was able to attend Arcadia High School in the morning for a couple of classes everyday and then be home schooled the rest of the day because of my condition. Even though I am classified with Spina Bifida at an S1 L6 level on the spine, I have 
never had to have a shunt or go through the tremendously awful and heart
 wrenching surgery...I was one of the fortunate ones that did not have 
to endure that. Each level of Spina Bifida is different with all varying
 degrees based on the opening you are born with on your spine. I have two ports in my stomach and my level affects my lower extremities of my body.<br/></p><p>I will always need to be within a short distance of shower facilities because just changing my undergarments is most always not enough. This makes me self conscience as I cannot always get clean without showering, and I have to change several times a day and shower usually 3 times a day or more. But I have learned to be relatively quick about it and it is also quicker and helps because I am  a young man. I was also born with clubbed feet and had to have tendon release surgery done on both feet. They are more like levers now because of the surgery and my lower legs below the knees are not defined with normal calf muscles and are very thin. My racing boots help me to align my feet and protect my lower legs. Even though I live with these things, I consider myself to be very lucky everyday.<br/></p><p>Racing is my dream and I take it very seriously, I train very hard and
maintain a healthy lifestyle. When I am on the race track I am focused and
confident and my results have shown this. Although I have a medical
condition I do not let it affect my outlook on life and my racing, in
fact it is just the opposite. I choose to use my condition to fuel my
determination of racing professionally, to be a positive role model,
and to be a beacon of hope to others that live with my level of Spina Bifida.<br/></p><p>Any and all help that I receive here will help me to take some of the financial burden from my parents as I also had major shoulder surgery, (bony bankart), which required a few months of rehab this year and I havent be able to race until 3 months ago again. Now I am full steam ahead. Contributions I receive upon completion of this campaign will go towards my racing expenses such as: Gas, Food, Lodging, Entry Fees and Bike Repairs as many of the races are out of state in Northern California, Utah, Nevada and Northern Arizona. If I do not reach my campaign goal, your contributions will go towards my training and my continued future racing events. <br/></p><p>My
goals are to race all of the WORCS series, most QUAD X races, Many
Big 6 races and many local races where I live. I am moving up to the
A class in the WORCS series and my goal for that class is to be top 3
in points. I will also be doing the Pro-am class and my goal for that
is to be top 5 in points. My focus  is to represent promoters,
contributors, and myself in a professional manor by my

those with medical conditions and disabilities in my spare time at the 
Disability Empowerment Center in Phoenix, AZ. I will be attending 
college to attain a degree in Occupational Therapy to help others in the
 future. I appreciate you taking your time to visit and read my dreams and for your consideration to help me achieve them.  I want to help others know that Spina Bifida does
not have to limit their dreams and aspirations in any way.<br/></p><p>Below are some of my recent accomplishments:<br/></p><h3></h3><p><u><b>Race

started in ISIOLO COUNTY of Kenya.As a Maasai warrior,who despite going to school has maintained his traditions and culture;i felt it important to bring the lost chemistry,friendliness between human beings and wildlife back.It is much disheartening that the menace of poaching has continued to put our world in the risk of wildlife extinction.The number of rhinos and elephants estimatedly in our country is decreasing every second.This has been caused by the poor relationship environment;involving residents living around the wildlife regions and wildlife.Community no longer owns conservation of wildlife as it used to do before.The government and other stakeholders have left community in matters wildlife protection,which has given poachers a gap to sneak through and butcher our wild animals.</p><p>WHAT IS OLOIMUGI  VILLAGE ABOUT?</p><p>This is a Maasai village which brings all members of the community together,through culture and traditional dance.All is aimed to bring conservation our wildlife as a matter of priority.The structure of the village is supposed to be circular in shape,with traditional Maasai huts.There will be accomodation for our guests who would like to spend wit us in the village;either as tourists or volunteers to help in wildlife and general environmental conservation.Maasai people are known for their outstanding and stylish,unique culture.Many people have always wanted to experience it at its best and this is the best place to have that;we plan to organize traditional Maasai weddings,rites of passage and many other cultural things that were and are still practiced in Maasailand.So,we welcome people from all the world to visit this grand project and have the best experience of a life time,.</p><p>It is my plan to bring members of the community together under my project.There are special conservation education program-mes which i am planning to develop covering all members ,starting from young children,adults and the elderly members.This will go a long way in making sure that the entire community is aware about conservation and why it is important.</p><p>Already,i have been able to identify a group of Maasai warriors who will specifically deal with conservation of wildlife.The team is composed of 25 members and will spread the message of conservation,through traditional dance and culture.In this, i intend to reach the youth.They are very important in this campaign,since they are ones being paid cheap and misused by big poaching cartels,to go to the bush and slaughter our wildlife.The same group of warriors will also preach peace,healing and reconciliation so that we can have a tranquil society that lives in harmony across the country;hence be able to look after the valuable,pride and heritage(wildlife)The same dance project can benefit youth through employment since,they can visit hotels,tour resorts offer entertainment and get pay.This will reduce the idleness among the youth which has always made them turn to illegal acts like;drugs,violence with robbery and <b>Poaching.</b></p><p><b>Campsite project:</b>This particular region is endowed with a lot of resources;a beautiful scenery and wildlife.However,it is sad to note that this community here is still lingering in poverty while they have resources with untapped potential that can be turned into cash and help earn a descent living.The Maasai community here,is continuing to depend on pastoral ism as a way of earning  life,something which is not able enough to sustain their lives.The huge cloud of poverty has made them desperate,hunt  animals in the bush because of lacking food and also some of them secretly collaborating with poachers from other places of course under cheap pay to destroy our wildlife.It is my plan therefore to have this campsite project,where tourists can visit,eat,camp,have camel rides and cultural experience.The income generated will go to help the community in starting empowerment programmes;improving health facilities and education.So disheartening to that pregnant mothers here,walk more than 5 kilometres to the nearest health center.small children also walk long distances to few,under-resourced schools in an environment full of wild animals like elephants,leopards,lions etc.Funds from the campsite and donations from willing friends will help improve such services.Employment opportunities will also crop up  e.g room attendants,shop keepers,tour guides,chefs,drivers ,house keepers etc.This will go a long way in reducing poverty and  motivating locals to own up conservation of wildlife,since there are benefits associated with it.</p><p>Beadwork project..Maasai people are known to have the best ,excellent ,colourful bead work in the world.It is made by women and small girls in the village.Under my project, i plan to bring all women together,,form a group and create an account under the ecovillage umbrella.They will be making their products and i will liase with friends to  help source local and international markets.Those women will get empowerment through the money generated from the work of their hands as opposed;to being dependent on their husbands who have nothing enough to give,apart from sharing poverty.Conservation still is the main priority since,from the benefits,the women will realise that it is the same wild animals that have brought them together for fruitful projects as such.</p><p>In short,there are many good things that am planning for the community.It is just a matter of time and support from willing friends;that will make it a success.</p><p>At the moment,i have just rolled out the project.There is much to be done,especially the first phase of building Maasai huts in the village.With your support,i will be able to start the building the first phase of 20 Maasai huts;paying and feeding the workers.Also equipping the village with necessary items like solar panel installation ,water tank purchase .etc.</p><p>Let us move!It is time to<b> conserve nature for peace and sustainability......!!!</b></p><p><br/></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>For a  start,we need 5000 US Dollars.</p><p><b>USD 2400-Labour cost</b></p><p>10 workers for 3O days,each paid 8 dollars a day</p><p>10x30x8=2,400USD</p><p><b>USD 900-FOOD</b></p><p>10 workers for 30 days,each spending 3 dollars a day</p><p><b>USD 1000-PURCHASE OF TENTS &amp;KITCHEN STUFF</b></p><p><b>USD 700-FENCING OF THE SITE,PURCHASE OF A SOLAR PANEL,WATER TANK,2 COMPUTERS,2 CAMERAS and TRANSPORT COST.</b></p><p><b>What do you get in return?</b></p><p><i>As a friend we will design the best cards for you with beautiful wildlife photos.Also send you great photos of  the outstanding nature,that will make your walls colorful.Under your request,since in the Maasai village we plan to make bead-work;we could avail some as a gift for your kind contribution.If you have a business,we could advertise for you here in our school visits and community forums across the country.</i></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Your donation,will surely make an impact in the whole world;not here

despite going to school has maintained his traditions and culture;i felt it important to bring the lost chemistry,friendliness between human beings and wildlife back.It is much disheartening that the menace of poaching has continued to put our world in the risk of wildlife extinction.The number of rhinos and elephants estimatedly in our country is decreasing every second.This has been caused by the poor relationship environment;involving residents living around the wildlife regions and wildlife.Community no longer owns conservation of wildlife as it used to do before.The government and other stakeholders have left community in matters wildlife protection,which has given poachers a gap to sneak through and butcher our wild animals.WHAT IS OLOIMUGI  VILLAGE ABOUT?This is a Maasai village which brings all members of the community together,through culture and traditional dance.All is aimed to bring conservation our wildlife as a matter of priority.The structure of the village is supposed to be circular in shape,with traditional Maasai huts.There will be accomodation for our guests who would like to spend wit us in the village;either as tourists or volunteers to help in wildlife and general environmental conservation.Maasai people are known for their outstanding and stylish,unique culture.Many people have always wanted to experience it at its best and this is the best place to have that;we plan to organize traditional Maasai weddings,rites of passage and many other cultural things that were and are still practiced in Maasailand.So,we welcome people from all the world to visit this grand project and have the best experience of a life time,.It is my plan to bring members of the community together under my project.There are special conservation education program-mes which i am planning to develop covering all members ,starting from young children,adults and the elderly members.This will go a long way in making sure that the entire community is aware about conservation and why it is important.Already,i have been able to identify a group of Maasai warriors who will specifically deal with conservation of wildlife.The team is composed of 25 members and will spread the message of conservation,through traditional dance and culture.In this, i intend to reach the youth.They are very important in this campaign,since they are ones being paid cheap and misused by big poaching cartels,to go to the bush and slaughter our wildlife.The same group of warriors will also preach peace,healing and reconciliation so that we can have a tranquil society that lives in harmony across the country;hence be able to look after the valuable,pride and heritage(wildlife)The same dance project can benefit youth through employment since,they can visit hotels,tour resorts offer entertainment and get pay.This will reduce the idleness among the youth which has always made them turn to illegal acts like;drugs,violence with robbery and Poaching.Campsite project:This particular region is endowed with a lot of resources;a beautiful scenery and wildlife.However,it is sad to note that this community here is still lingering in poverty while they have resources with untapped potential that can be turned into cash and help earn a descent living.The Maasai community here,is continuing to depend on pastoral ism as a way of earning  life,something which is not able enough to sustain their lives.The huge cloud of poverty has made them desperate,hunt  animals in the bush because of lacking food and also some of them secretly collaborating with poachers from other places of course under cheap pay to destroy our wildlife.It is my plan therefore to have this campsite project,where tourists can visit,eat,camp,have camel rides and cultural experience.The income generated will go to help the community in starting empowerment programmes;improving health facilities and education.So disheartening to that pregnant mothers here,walk more than 5 kilometres to the nearest health center.small children also walk long distances to few,under-resourced schools in an environment full of wild animals like elephants,leopards,lions etc.Funds from the campsite and donations from willing friends will help improve such services.Employment opportunities will also crop up  e.g room attendants,shop keepers,tour guides,chefs,drivers ,house keepers etc.This will go a long way in reducing poverty and  motivating locals to own up conservation of wildlife,since there are benefits associated with it.Beadwork project..Maasai people are known to have the best ,excellent ,colourful bead work in the world.It is made by women and small girls in the village.Under my project, i plan to bring all women together,,form a group and create an account under the ecovillage umbrella.They will be making their products and i will liase with friends to  help source local and international markets.Those women will get empowerment through the money generated from the work of their hands as opposed;to being dependent on their husbands who have nothing enough to give,apart from sharing poverty.Conservation still is the main priority since,from the benefits,the women will realise that it is the same wild animals that have brought them together for fruitful projects as such.In short,there are many good things that am planning for the community.It is just a matter of time and support from willing friends;that will make it a success.At the moment,i have just rolled out the project.There is much to be done,especially the first phase of building Maasai huts in the village.With your support,i will be able to start the building the first phase of 20 Maasai huts;paying and feeding the workers.Also equipping the village with necessary items like solar panel installation ,water tank purchase .etc.Let us move!It is time to conserve nature for peace and sustainability......!!! What We Need & What You GetFor a  start,we need 5000 US Dollars.USD 2400-Labour cost10 workers for 3O days,each paid 8 dollars a day10x30x8=2,400USDUSD 900-FOOD10 workers for 30 days,each spending 3 dollars a dayUSD 1000-PURCHASE OF TENTS &KITCHEN STUFFUSD 700-FENCING OF THE SITE,PURCHASE OF A SOLAR PANEL,WATER TANK,2 COMPUTERS,2 CAMERAS and TRANSPORT COST.What do you get in return?As a friend we will design the best cards for you with beautiful wildlife photos.Also send you great photos of  the outstanding nature,that will make your walls colorful.Under your request,since in the Maasai village we plan to make bead-work;we could avail some as a gift for your kind contribution.If you have a business,we could advertise for you here in our school visits and community forums across the country.The ImpactYour donation,will surely make an impact in the whole world;not here alone.!When we have an empowered and educated community,it will learn to treasure and value wildlife,hence cases of poaching will decline.Wildlife is important to the environment

Zion Lutheran Church in Pittsfield, Massachusetts is in the midst of a $600,000 capital campaign to raise funds to restore our historic 1892 sanctuary and transform it into a fully accessible, safe, energy-efficient, and flexible community space, the first of its kind in the Berkshires. 

Just imagine: a fully-accessible room (open to everyone!) with vibrant stained glass windows, gorgeous hardwood flooring, and a perfect wainscoted ceiling, partnered with a new, efficient heating system and air-conditioning system, audio-visual hookups, WiFi access, a moveable grand piano, an impressive pipe organ, superb acoustics, and moveable chairs, tables, and platforms that can be configured and adapted for nearly any event.

We need your help! Your contribution to this crowdfunding campaign will help make this sanctuary a community sanctuary: your support will help us replace our fixed pews with comfortable, moveable chairs, as well as add the portable tables, platforms, and other flexible furnishings we need in the space to maximize its community-building potential.

If our capital campaign is successful, the sanctuary at Zion Lutheran Church will become an unparalleled place for the community to gather in downtown Pittsfield. It will become a sanctuary in the truest sense—a place of refuge and a place for community unlike any other in the Berkshires.

The Impact: an unparalleled community space




 


Our vision is a brilliant sanctuary that will be accessible to everyone and completely flexible for a wide variety of community events and activities—and not just a large Easter Sunday worship service or a festive wedding celebration or an intimate Jazz Vespers service—but so much more.



Here are some of our latest ideas as we imagine the possibilities:


• How about an educational (and fun!) movie night co-sponsored by a local nonprofit? But instead of in a cinder block auditorium, how about under the canopy of a gorgeous hardwood ceiling? With a huge parking lot right across the street?
• How about hosting theater rehearsals? And theater performances? With the comfortable chairs and portable platforms right where the director needs them? How about theatre in the round?

<p><span>Students With a mission (SWAM) is a Nigerian based charity that was registered in 2010.  Our aim is to reduce poverty and disadvantage faced by communities.</span></p>
<p><b>SWAM</b> is based in the Kaduna Nigeria with over 1000 members across the world..</p>
<p>In the Nigeria, our <span>programmes promote the interests of disadvantaged members of the community, our main beneficiary target group though not exclusively are refugees, asylum seekers and those affected by HIV/AIDS and Black and ethnic minorities.</span></p>
<p>Internationally, SWAM<span><span> </span>works mainly through a range of community-based organisations and as well as in partnership with a range of development NGOs in the Africa to support its International Programmes. Both in the Nigeria and Abroad SWAM<span> </span>projects seek to address the needs of our beneficiaries by their promoting health, and  socio-economic development and betterment.</span></p>
<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><strong>Our Challenges </strong>include funds, facilities and infrastructures to provide quality care, education and support these children, youths, and women deserve. As we progress with this great vision, we trust God that you would be a part of this noble cause to put a smile on the faces of the less privilaged.<br/><br/>We invite you to be a part of our dream of a greater Nigeria devoid of street urchins, beggars and homeless children and widows labouring for little or nothing in abominable conditions. YOUR $100 CAN SAVE A LIFE</p>
<br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Most African children die from malnutrition, diarrhea and childhood ailments which might be considered common in other parts of the world. In nearly every case, vaccines exist that could prevent the contraction of these illnesses.</p>
<p>""The children of Africa are suffering more than any group ever has in the history of the modern world."" Fr. Roy continues. ""People ask me how long things will continue this way. In many ways, I think the answer to that is mostly up to us. Most of the world has an abundance of food, clean water and medicine -- I am praying that those of us who can -- will reach out to these children who are suffering . . . to send them the help they need to survive.""</p>Giving them better opportunities in life with regards to:<ul>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Portable Water</li>
<li>Shelter</li>
<li>Clothing</li>
<li>Medicare</li>
<li>Education</li>
</ul>
<p>These opportunities will be provided in a home filled with love and care, enabling the children become valuable members of society.<br/><br/><strong>Rehabilitation</strong>: The children would be rehabilitated under the most conducive environment and shown unconditional love.<br/><br/><strong>Reformation</strong>: This would be achieved through education and extra curricula activities. Education is the best investment any child could have. This project is designed to help train the children as far as the university level in any chosen career of their choice, with the help of a counselor.<br/><br/><strong>Reintegration</strong>: Some of the children would be reintegrated into the society through adoption and fostering.<br/><br/>We hope to partner with the Ogun State Government, Corporate bodies, Religious groups and Social philanthropic organisations (for the adoption and fostering process).<br/><br/>We strongly believe these children need to live in a homely environment with lots of love and care, this would enable them adjust well in adulthood.<br/><br/>In addition we hope to remove the stigma attached to the ""orphan status"" by creating a leverage that will promote equality amongst these children and their peers all over the world.</p>

Students With a mission (SWAM) is a Nigerian based charity that was registered in 2010.  Our aim is to reduce poverty and disadvantage faced by communities.
SWAM is based in the Kaduna Nigeria with over 1000 members across the world..
In the Nigeria, our programmes promote the interests of disadvantaged members of the community, our main beneficiary target group though not exclusively are refugees, asylum seekers and those affected by HIV/AIDS and Black and ethnic minorities.
Internationally, SWAM works mainly through a range of community-based organisations and as well as in partnership with a range of development NGOs in the Africa to support its International Programmes. Both in the Nigeria and Abroad SWAM projects seek to address the needs of our beneficiaries by their promoting health, and  socio-economic development and betterment.
   What We Need & What You Get 
Our Challenges include funds, facilities and infrastructures to provide quality care, education and support these children, youths, and women deserve. As we progress with this great vision, we trust God that you would be a part of this noble cause to put a smile on the faces of the less privilaged.We invite you to be a part of our dream of a greater Nigeria devoid of street urchins, beggars and homeless children and widows labouring for little or nothing in abominable conditions. YOUR $100 CAN SAVE A LIFE
    The Impact 

Most African children die from malnutrition, diarrhea and childhood ailments which might be considered common in other parts of the world. In nearly every case, vaccines exist that could prevent the contraction of these illnesses.
""The children of Africa are suffering more than any group ever has in the history of the modern world."" Fr. Roy continues. ""People ask me how long things will continue this way. In many ways, I think the answer to that is mostly up to us. Most of the world has an abundance of food, clean water and medicine -- I am praying that those of us who can -- will reach out to these children who are suffering . . . to send them the help they need to survive.""Giving them better opportunities in life with regards to:
Food
Portable Water
Shelter
Clothing
Medicare
Education

These opportunities will be provided in a home filled with love and care, enabling the children become valuable members of society.Rehabilitation: The children would be rehabilitated under the most conducive environment and shown unconditional love.Reformation: This would be achieved through education and extra curricula activities. Education is the best investment any child could have. This project is designed to help train the children as far as the university level in any chosen career of their choice, with the help of a counselor.Reintegration: Some of the children would be reintegrated into the society through adoption and fostering.We hope to partner with the Ogun State Government, Corporate bodies, Religious groups and Social philanthropic organisations (for the adoption and fostering process).We strongly believe these children need to live in a homely environment with lots of love and care, this would enable them adjust well in adulthood.In addition we hope to remove the stigma attached to the ""orphan status"" by creating a leverage that will promote equality amongst these children and their peers all over the world.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hello.  My name is Mary Anne DeZur.  I designed a device called <strong>Time for Change</strong>™ for my son, Lou, who was diagnosed with Juvenile Diabetes when he was just 14 years old.  Keep reading, because it turns out the device can also be used by anyone who needs to take a medication or a shot, or remember to do something every so many days.  If you still think this doesn’t have anything to do with you, I can relate.  You see, when Lou’s pediatrician told us he had Juvenile Diabetes, I didn’t know anything about diabetes, let alone there are 2 very different kinds called Type 1 (aka Juvenile Diabetes) and Type 2.  No one in either of our families had diabetes.  Lou was a healthy kid!  He wasn’t overweight!  It didn’t matter.  Lou’s story is worth hearing, because Type 1 diabetes strikes both children and adults AT ANY AGE.  It comes on suddenly, causes dependence on injected or pumped insulin for life, and carries the constant threat of devastating complications such as kidney failure, blindness, nerve damage, amputation, heart attack, stroke, and pregnancy complications.  Type 1 diabetes strikes 80 people a day in the U.S. alone.  In the U.S. alone, a new case of Type 2 diabetes strikes every 30 seconds.</p>
<p>After a year of painful daily insulin shots, Lou was upgraded to an insulin pump (he’s called a “pumper”).  Now Lou had more control over when, where, and what he could eat because his insulin was always with him.  But as wonderful as graduating from 3 insulin shots a day to wearing an insulin pump was, it had its downfalls; like losing track of changing and rotating the site where the pump tubing connects to his body, every 3 days.</p>
<p>Lou clips his insulin pump onto his belt.  Thin tubing carries the insulin from the pump to his body.  He injects the end of the tubing into his thigh (his site).  Every 3 days, Lou has to change his site, just like every pumper does.  This means removing the old tubing and injecting new tubing to a different site.  When Lou wasn’t changing his sites on time, his legs were not healing, sites became very painful; his body wasn’t absorbing insulin correctly, and a few times his pump actually stopped working.  No matter what we did, we kept losing track of when the 3 days were up. </p>
<p>To solve this problem, we invented <strong>Time for Change</strong>™.  Shaped like an hourglass with a magnet on the back, it sits on the front of our refrigerator.  The top reminds Lou when he has to change his site and the bottom reminds him when he changed it last (so we really know how much time is running out).  Every time Lou opens the frig, he sees his reminder.  It reminds all of us in the house so we can be his support group.  Amazed that it actually worked for Lou and for the whole family to know his schedule, we gave prototypes to other pumper families and they loved them!  Younger pumpers took more responsibility for changing their sites when they could control their own timer on their own frig.  Lou kept a timer on the frig in his college apartment.  It helped him manage his diabetes and change his sites more often. </p>
<p>We’ve also created a keychain version of <strong>Time for Change</strong>™.  It can be attached to car keys and younger kids can attach one to their backpacks, teddy bears, or dolls.  It’s a cool little gadget I designed to empower our little diabetics; and it’s a convenient accessory older diabetics will appreciate, especially when traveling.</p>
<h3>PLEASE SEE PHOTOS ON GALLERY TAP AT TOP OF PAGE</h3>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We just received approval on our 2 pending patents.  When this Indiegogo campaign is successful in reaching the funded goal, molds for both versions of <strong>Time for Change</strong>™ will be manufactured and production will begin.  The goal is to put these timers in the hands of other diabetics worldwide.  Distributing them through retail pharmacy chains would be one way, but the cooler way would be to hawk <strong>Time for Change</strong>™ to the health care and insurance industry for providers to advertise with their logos and then give away for FREE to the public as a promotional product.  So if anyone out there can make a connection for us, we appreciate the leg up!</p>
<p>I shopped around to 6 local manufacturers to produce<strong> Time for Change</strong>™.  Approximate costs include:</p>
<p>$27,850:  Tooling for magnetic version<br/>$27,850:  Tooling for keychain version<br/>$  1,200:  Add’l. CAD drawings<br/>$13,350:  First production run<br/><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">$  6,323:  Processing Fees  <br/></span>$76,573:  Total pledges needed</p>
<p>I’ve tried to create some unique perks to win you over to our side.  Hopefully they will make you smile, but more desperately, they will make you pledge to our cause.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is this cause so important?  Why should I invest in you?</strong></h3>
<p>Pledging your hard-earned money to our cause, impacts so many more people than just us.   I created <strong>Time for Change</strong>™ as a solution to a real life problem.  Nearly 26 million Americans have diabetes in the U.S.  Diabetes currently affects 366 million people worldwide and is expected to affect 552 million by 2030.  (American Diabetes Association.)</p>
<p>My heart breaks for my child because of this ridiculous and deadly disease.  At times I am out-of-my-mind with grief for Lou and what he has to deal with every single day of his life; knowing that if he does not deal with it the right way, he will die.  For a Type 1 diabetic, something as simple as a severe <em>low blood sugar</em> from <em>too much</em> insulin, left untreated, will lead to a seizure, then a coma, and ultimately death.  A severe <em>high blood sugar</em> from <em>not enough</em> insulin, left untreated, will lead to ketoacidosis, which can end in kidney failure, coma, or death.  That’s the seriousness of being a diabetic and being responsible for making sure you get the correct amount of insulin pumped in to your body to cover every single little morsel of food or ounce of drink you put in your mouth.  And it’s not just what an insulin-dependent diabetic eats.  Their diabetes reacts to everything in daily life; like if the weather is cold or if it’s hot; physical exertion; puberty; hormones; stress; a little cold; the flu, emotions; and the list goes on.  Don’t even get me started on the needles.  Imagine having to give your little baby or child 3 or more shots of insulin a day and test their blood sugar 6-10 times a day by poking their fingers with a very sharp needle (don’t believe those commercials that say it’s painless – it’s a sharp needle breaking your skin!).  Or imagine being an adolescent or young adult or old adult and having to give yourself those shots or having an insulin pump connected to you every waking minute.  It’s not very glamorous.  All Type 1 diabetics, JustLikeLou.com, never get a break from any of this and that’s what’s heart breaking.</p>
<p>3 million Americans have Type 1 diabetes, just like Lou.  But not just Type 1 diabetics are wearing insulin pumps these days.  Many Type 2 diabetics use insulin therapy, and many wear insulin pumps.</p>
<p>Your investment in our cause is also a forever investment in funding the current research that is getting closer to finding the cure for diabetes.  As a family, we are making the life-long commitment to donate a portion of every<strong>Time for Change</strong>™ sold, to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).  Stretching across nearly 20 countries, JDRF is the largest charitable supporter, funding research to cure, treat, and prevent Type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>I have one more reason why this cause is so important . . . he’s in the other room, changing his site.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Many times I’ve wanted to donate $ to a good cause, but just didn’t have any to give.  If you are in the same boat, but you still want to help, you can!  Just spread the word about our cause.  Use the Indiegogo share tools to email, twitter, or facebook our link to everyone you know.  We thank you for your support!</p>
<h3><strong>What happens to my money if this Indiegogo campaign does not reach the funded goal?</strong></h3>
<p>We’re not giving up, even if we don’t get the money we need to start production on at least one of our designs.  The money will be banked while we pursue the balance of funds from other avenues.</p>
<h3><strong>What will you do with the money if it goes over your goal?</strong></h3>
<p>The goal I set will purchase the 2 molds and a very small first production run.  Any extra money will also be put into the project to go towards advertising, marketing, packaging, shipping &amp; handling, and other manufacturing costs, etc.  If our fabulous supporters pledge some crazy, insane amount like some of the other projects, we will start with a bigger first production run and also use the money to promote Juvenile Diabetes awareness within the school system.  Lou was actually publically humiliated in high school by a teacher who didn’t think he should be drinking a fruit juice in his class, even though Lou was experiencing a low blood sugar and was unable to make it to the nurse’s office.  The teacher was not aware of the complications Juvenile Diabetes inflicts.  My awareness campaign would also make students aware of the symptoms of Juvenile Diabetes.  Because the symptoms are very common and are not usually recognized as warning signs for diabetes, students and their parents often times ignore them until the student needs hospitalization.  Way-over-the-top funding will be used to create an awareness campaign that could save a child’s life.</p>
<h2>Thank you for listening to our story.  We would love to hear your family’s experience with Diabetes.  How did it start for you?  How are you doing now?  Leave us a comment or write to my email.</h2></div>","Hello.  My name is Mary Anne DeZur.  I designed a device called Time for Change™ for my son, Lou, who was diagnosed with Juvenile Diabetes when he was just 14 years old.  Keep reading, because it turns out the device can also be used by anyone who needs to take a medication or a shot, or remember to do something every so many days.  If you still think this doesn’t have anything to do with you, I can relate.  You see, when Lou’s pediatrician told us he had Juvenile Diabetes, I didn’t know anything about diabetes, let alone there are 2 very different kinds called Type 1 (aka Juvenile Diabetes) and Type 2.  No one in either of our families had diabetes.  Lou was a healthy kid!  He wasn’t overweight!  It didn’t matter.  Lou’s story is worth hearing, because Type 1 diabetes strikes both children and adults AT ANY AGE.  It comes on suddenly, causes dependence on injected or pumped insulin for life, and carries the constant threat of devastating complications such as kidney failure, blindness, nerve damage, amputation, heart attack, stroke, and pregnancy complications.  Type 1 diabetes strikes 80 people a day in the U.S. alone.  In the U.S. alone, a new case of Type 2 diabetes strikes every 30 seconds.

<p>We're starting the campaign to raise enough funds to incorporate with the State of Nebraska as well as file for tax exemption with the IRS (as a 501(c)3).  We've met with attorneys from MEEM Consultants for Creative Endeavors and they have generously agreed to donate half of the required services for us to file.</p>

<li>$400 flat fee</li>
<li>$300 filing fe </li>
</ul><p>It's been recommended to us that it would be wise to have a bit of a cusion financially, which is why our fundraising goal exceeds our legal fees.  Our goal is to raise enough money to file by January 1, 2013.</p>
<p>in addition to achieving tax exemption, our fundraising goals will help support the growth of our lending library, the purchase of teaching aids, and the ever-present costs of printing materials such as flyers and brochures.  </p>
<p>We are completely volunteer driven but are working toward a future in which we can create nonprofit sector jobs for birth workers and other professioals who are dedicated to creating safer and stronger communities.  Our ultimate goal is to restore an age-old model of care- one where community family support is rewarded and sustained by that community.</p>

We're starting the campaign to raise enough funds to incorporate with the State of Nebraska as well as file for tax exemption with the IRS (as a 501(c)3).  We've met with attorneys from MEEM Consultants for Creative Endeavors and they have generously agreed to donate half of the required services for us to file.
Here's the breakdown:

$400 flat fee
$300 filing fe 
It's been recommended to us that it would be wise to have a bit of a cusion financially, which is why our fundraising goal exceeds our legal fees.  Our goal is to raise enough money to file by January 1, 2013.
in addition to achieving tax exemption, our fundraising goals will help support the growth of our lending library, the purchase of teaching aids, and the ever-present costs of printing materials such as flyers and brochures.  
We are completely volunteer driven but are working toward a future in which we can create nonprofit sector jobs for birth workers and other professioals who are dedicated to creating safer and stronger communities.  Our ultimate goal is to restore an age-old model of care- one where community family support is rewarded and sustained by that community.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
Well, many of you already know me as i am posting this to my facebook friends and family.  I hate to even ask for money for myself, and kind of embarrassed but its to the point where i am using all of my funds to move, and am barely getting food into the house.  I havent been able to buy steven any school clothes this year, which we can get by without as he has been fortunate enough to have uncles who give him lots of hand me downs.  Its just been a hard time, a long summer of lots of driving in the car using gas money to keep steven occupied so he dont go into his violent rages and im sure things will look up, but at this point i have nothing left to sell, so here i am asking for your help, anything will help at this point.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have enough money to move in, and to pay the first months rent but after that, its going to be a struggle.  I dont know how i am going to buy food for stevnes lunches at school, and just plain survive.  I think with $500 it should get me ahead to where i will be alright as far as bills, and food.  What i am offering for any donation of at least $10 is a BOOK that i have written about my life with LGS.  Its only about 40 pages, but it really goes into every aspect of LGS, as far as the diets, meds, behaivors, surgeries.  I think it can be very informative to soemone who has a child with LGS, or just for anyone who would like to read what life with a LGS child is like.  For a donation of at least $10 i will send you my book.  It isnt published and isnt in a paperback or even a hardback, its just plain ol paper printed from my computer, but its just the same.  I was hoping to publish it someday, and maybe i will, but for now this is all that i can offer.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
What your donation will do, no matter how small, is it will help me to be able to breathe a little and make sure that i can take care of Steven and other household finances.  Its just been such a struggle lately, out of nowhere, i just dont know how i got to this point, well...i guess the whole move thing plays a big part with having to rent a uhaul, pay for some of the utilities to be turned on which i didnt have at this house cause its all electric.  If i reach my goal, i can get steven a few new pairs of jeans to wear to school since he has outgrown all of his jeans from last summer.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Just keep us in your prayers, i know that everything will work out eventually, but its just this valley we are going thru at the moment, so prayers are most important.</div></div>","Short Summary

</h3><p><b>Nunkui Cakes was born out of three
occurrences: finding I needed to eat gluten-free many years ago, long before
most people had ever heard of gluten; realizing most of the gluten-free baked
goods available tasted like compacted saw dust; and my insistence on having
great-tasting, fresh food. After my doctor gave me that news, I played around
with recipes in the tiny kitchen in my then NYC apartment. For me, an
Italian-American whose mom is a terrific cook and whose dad is a great baker, I
needed one sweet treat that I could enjoy and also share with friends and
family who can indulge in any desserts they choose. An elegant cake was born,
a phenomenal flour-less chocolate cake that is loved by the gluten-free
and gluten-full alike! </b></p>
<p><b>The growing demand for gluten-free foods and
encouragement from friends in the food business have spurred me to take my
business to the next level, to go beyond baking for friends and begin supplying
the food market. Restaurants and high-end stores are ready and waiting to carry
Nunkui Cakes and your support will allow me to supply to them. Step two:
supplying corporate food services at companies that feed their employees.
Currently I am equipped to make only a few cakes at a time and the market is
demanding that I increase production. Your donations will go toward the
purchase of a larger commercial mixer, pots and pans, local organic
ingredients, space and storage in a larger commercial kitchen, and goods to
package and insulate our cakes for delivery. Funds raised, along with profits
from sales, will enable us to get some momentum. The more we raise, the more
likely we will grow steadily and not have to engage in another campaign in the
future. Even if we don't reach our goal, the funds we receive will enable us to
grow, just at a slower pace.</b></p>
<p><b>Nunkui Cakes will be sourcing ingredients from
local organic farms and local businesses, supporting local economies,
strengthening local agriculture, and minimizing carbon footprint. The chocolate
we use supports the indigenous people who farm it through Fair-trade and again,
we source it locally. We've started in the San Francisco Bay Area and plan to
have future locations elsewhere. Would you like Nunkui Cakes to be available

<p><b>I started thinking about starting this
business when an acquaintance called and invited me to Thanksgiving dinner. She
mentioned that her daughter, then 19, had loved the chocolate cake I brought to
the 50th birthday party of a common friend. I reflected and realized that
friend was now 55. So her daughter, a 14 year-old girl with undoubtedly many
other things on her mind, remembered that cake for 5 years. Cynthia, who
lived at a distance, was invited to my home for a dinner party. She was tired
the day of a party and called to decline the invitation. I told her I was
serving ‘The Cake,’ and she replied, ""I'm gettin' in the car,"" and
she did. Laura, a guest at a holiday party heard raves in the kitchen,
tried the cake and responded, ""I don't even like chocolate and I love this
cake!""</b></p>

felt a connection with Nunkui and feel her support always and so I honor her in

It's a tiny day spa on the second floor of the Emergency Arts building on Fremont Street in Downtown Las Vegas, Nevada. Since Feetish opened in February 2013, I've been joyfully pampering my facial and body treatment clientele -- and I've also been getting a steady stream of requests for nail services, too. It makes complete sense: Feetish, feet, amazing pedicures. I get it. So long story short, I just spent seven months in nail school. I'm taking my state exams within the next few weeks, and I'm on track to be fully licensed and set up by May. Why I Appreciate Your Support Immensely:Licensing fees, equipment and supplies are not inexpensive. 
I require a brand spanking new cosmetology establishment license that includes permission to perform nail services. 
You'll appreciate high quality supplies like OPI nail polish, Gelish and IBD gel polish, nice scrubs, paraffin wax, a large bolster, and other sundry items required to perform kick-ass manis and pedis.

<p>
</p><p></p>
<p>Palm Springs-based comedian,
community volunteer and all-around do-gooder Shann Carr owns an RV
affectionately named “Gertie.” Gertie had a life changing adventure taking a 13,000-mile comedy tour
across the US and she touched lives wherever she showed up!  Sadly, soon after the tour, Gertie had a breakdown on her way home from Vegas! Now, Shann and her friends
want to get Gertie’s powers for good back on the road and we need your
help! </p>
<p></p>Where Gertie goes, smiles happen!  When we get Gertie up on her feet, we intend to use her to support everything from collecting food donations for local food
banks, to transporting crated pets to and from pet adoption locations, and shuttling
visitors to fundraising parties and events.   We want Gertie to be available for use by non-profit organizations for the nominal cost of her actual operation, as well as affordably rentable for business and pleasure.  Everything from a doing real shuttle gig at Modernism Week, to being a community Center's pride float, or taking Shann out on another little comedy tour.  Gertie's destiny is to do well while doing good. <p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Gertie Needs and What You GET!</h3><p>
</p><p>The currently pink, sunglass-wearing, rhinestone emblazoned, Gertie needs a mechanical and cosmetic makeover!  The Friends of Gertie have set out to raise $15,000 to transform her this summer, so
she is fresh and hip to hit the road when season returns in October. </p>

I have luckily been chosen to head up to Thursday Island in Queensland along the Torres Strait to help out with communities in need, with partaking in building community projects, listening and being part of the culture and completing any other activities that are set. For people who don't know Thursday Island, it is populated to around 2,610 people, where many communities filled with indigenous Australians and Torres Strait islander natives, these people live a very simple life without the things we take for granted like running hot water when we want it and also a large amount of food supply. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The whole trip is around $2500, I have other people, like my parents contributing, but that still isn't enough money for me to go. I need serious people who want to help me but most definitely want to help communities like the one up in Queensland and I want people to understand that helping me will affect the outcome of help needed for their communities. </p>
<p>what you get from me receiving funds is that knowing that i will be helping communities in need and that you helped me get there with your kindness, thoughtfulness and generosity which what those communities need. you also get a sense of accomplishment because sometimes we constantly search for ways to help people but don't know how and helping me go on this exploration will definitely be a good opportunity to help others.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The impact of sending me funds for this trip is that not only will you feel satisfied of helping others but that i will be helping people with tasks that take a lot more will power. Another impact which plays a role in this trip is that this is an experience in which i may not get the opportunity to do at this age again. Experiencing how other less fortunate people live and helping so that i can take away a good morale and mindset which will set me in the right direction for the future. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>obviously there will be challenges and risks which take part in this trip; with a change from an environment that i am used to and experiencing different cultures face to face will be difficult. To overcome these barriers, myself and 4 other boys will be participating in this trip together and to be a team, to help each other out when we think we can't do something and keep moving forward for the result which those communities desperately need and want. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I know that most likely that some people can not donate at this time which is totally acceptable, but what you can do is just spread this around to anyone you might think will have an interest in supporting me and the people i will be helping. the smallest donation goes a long way in helping me partake on this trip. i honestly mean that even a $2 donation would be great because it all adds up at the end. </p>
<p>if by any chance i can't reach my goal, the money which has been donated will most definitely be going towards my trip, because as i said before, the smallest amount is greatly appreciated. </p>

For people who don't know Thursday Island, it is populated to around 2,610 people, where many communities filled with indigenous Australians and Torres Strait islander natives, these people live a very simple life without the things we take for granted like running hot water when we want it and also a large amount of food supply.    What We Need & What You Get The whole trip is around $2500, I have other people, like my parents contributing, but that still isn't enough money for me to go. I need serious people who want to help me but most definitely want to help communities like the one up in Queensland and I want people to understand that helping me will affect the outcome of help needed for their communities. 
what you get from me receiving funds is that knowing that i will be helping communities in need and that you helped me get there with your kindness, thoughtfulness and generosity which what those communities need. you also get a sense of accomplishment because sometimes we constantly search for ways to help people but don't know how and helping me go on this exploration will definitely be a good opportunity to help others.

  The Impact The impact of sending me funds for this trip is that not only will you feel satisfied of helping others but that i will be helping people with tasks that take a lot more will power. Another impact which plays a role in this trip is that this is an experience in which i may not get the opportunity to do at this age again. Experiencing how other less fortunate people live and helping so that i can take away a good morale and mindset which will set me in the right direction for the future. 

  Risks & Challenges obviously there will be challenges and risks which take part in this trip; with a change from an environment that i am used to and experiencing different cultures face to face will be difficult. To overcome these barriers, myself and 4 other boys will be participating in this trip together and to be a team, to help each other out when we think we can't do something and keep moving forward for the result which those communities desperately need and want. 

  Other Ways You Can Help I know that most likely that some people can not donate at this time which is totally acceptable, but what you can do is just spread this around to anyone you might think will have an interest in supporting me and the people i will be helping. the smallest donation goes a long way in helping me partake on this trip. i honestly mean that even a $2 donation would be great because it all adds up at the end. 
if by any chance i can't reach my goal, the money which has been donated will most definitely be going towards my trip, because as i said before, the smallest amount is greatly appreciated.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

All of our APBS barbers want to come together to catapult this business to the forefront of Sci-Fi fantasy cuts in the area. Our barber-team knows that each of us carry the same responsibility toward growing the business and satisfying our customers. </p><p><b>Behind the Scene Business Practices</b></p><p>At APBS we feel that good barbers have a memory for all of their clients; names, clothing, shoes, and hair. If a customer visits a first-rate barber regularly, the barber will become familiar with the shape of the customer’s head, texture of their hair and will know how to cut and style their hair just the way the customer likes it. Customers will be able to walk in and the barber will call them by name and ask if they want the usual. A good barber will listen to the customer’s woes better than any bartender, and the barber will know the names of the customer’s spouse and children. The whole idea is that a customer should look forward to their next haircut. For prospective customers that are new in the APBS neighborhood or are not satisfied with their current barber, the first thing they should do is ask people that know us and our shop about the up-to-date, out-of-this-world hair styles. We are sure they will recommend us. We would ask new customers to especially seek out referrals from people in our area who always seem to have creative-haircuts--We think they will recommend us too. New customers will find that we are not the same as the unisex cut places. We are a place for relaxation, conversation; a more creative, non-conforming establishment. We are all about helping people feel, look unique, and confident. Most people have found that APBS barbers are the artists that they will want to trust their unique looks to. We are a group of barbers supremely confident in our ability to shape hair into the look the customer has been waiting for. Our confidant barbers will look their customer in the eyes, smile, and give them a firm handshake when entering the shop. In addition, customers should have a barber who can confidently tell them what would work best for them depending on the customers requests along with their face shape and structure. Advising our customers is something that the APBS barbers are especially good at doing. Barbers without much experience or confidence in their craft will do exactly what the client says, even if what the client asks for will look unappealing. A good barber will have the confidence to speak up and offer suggestions to the customer to help guide them to something more suited for their face and will provide the client with the best outcome and unique appearance. We pride ourselves on everything being handled electronically. Our client leaves the salon looking outstanding--Ready to conquer the world and convinced that APBS is terrific! Now the paperwork; the part we used to hate. Well, not anymore. With our new unique Barbershop software, we're in complete control - effortlessly. It's almost too good to be true. The Barbershop’s System asks a few questions, the receptionist fills in the blanks, clicks and incredibly, there it is! ‘The perfect bookkeeping system.” The simplicity of our software must have been its own mother of invention. The programmers started out with a very simple idea--To make Barbershop software that has lots of features, but very simple to use. So simple that our receptionist doesn't have to keep one eye on the screen and one eye on the instruction manual; and simple enough that the user doesn't need a degree in computer programming to operate it! It even makes a non-typist comfortable at the keyboard. But the most important thing is our books are in order, our promotions happen on time, invitations for the free birthday cuts go out as needed, inventory is always well stocked, and the barber is left to have fun cutting hair and enjoying their work.</p><p><b>Promotions:</b></p><p>•	Free birthday haircuts with I.D. – this will be the best way to get the City talking about the shop.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Matthew Ward, and my wife's name is Erin. We currently reside on the East side of Saint Paul, Minnesota with 2 Italian greyhouds, 1 golden retreiver and 2 cats.  I was very close friends with Erin""s brother in Highschool, and that is when I met her. We went our seperate ways and reconnected through facebook (of all places) a few years down the road. We hit it off and fell in love. We were married in the fall of 2010, and over these past few years we have have adopted our animals. Our animals are a huge part of our lives, and couldn't imagine a day with out them! But we want to expand our family on a human level as well. Ever since the beginning, we have talked about adopting our own children. Erin was adopted herself and sees adoption as the biggest calling she has ever had, and we both have wanted to adopt since we were teenagers.</p>
<p>Erin has traveled to many places around the world. She has experiences that most people will not have their lifetime. She loves children and has a desire to help kids in need. Just out of college, Erin completed an internship at Walt Disney World expanding her horizons. During her travels, Erin developed an affection for children with special needs and children with out the comfort and safety of a family unit. Erin loves to volunteer for the under priviledged. A couple of years ago, she was offered an opportunity to give back to the community working with Americorps. She completed 1 year of service volunteering with families as a PCA for children with special needs. She is thankful everyday for that experience. Erin continues to volunteer, and will continue to do so through out her entire life.</p>
<p>After Highschool, I went to school off and on for about 2 years. Upon the completion of my second year, I decided I was going to follow one of my dreams of being in the military. I enlisted in the U.S. Army and joined the Infantry. I was medically discharged after completing infantry school, came back home and worked for about a year. My experience in the military was one that I will never forget. It gave me the skills to succeed in life and teach others to do the same. The military is responsible for the increase in my cultural awareness. It expanded my horizons, and taught me that I am stronger than I thought, and with a little will power, determination, and heart I can accomplish the goals I set out before me. After working for about a year after the military, I knew that I had to finish school to get where I want to be in my life. During my first semester back in school, I studied abroad for the summer in Mexico. Traveling to different orphanages, I saw the amount of unwanted children and I knew that my wife and I could provide a loving home for these kids. I am now in the process of completing my B.A in criminal justice.</p>
<p>There are so many kids out there in need of a home. During our research, we have found that many kids are passed over for specific needs that should not make them unadoptable. We have found that the amount of HIV positive children waiting for homes is catastrophically high. With the amount of strides that modern medicine has made in the HIV epidemic, it is possible for these kids to live normal lives with possibly minimal special medical care. We want to give a kid that is passed up due to the lack of knowledge on the HIV virus a life worth living.</p>
<p>We decided that we wouldn't talk about children for atleast 1 year after our wedding to allow us time to just be married. After our 1 year anniversary, we started the adoption talks and are starting to look into the process. International adoption is about $33,000 dollars, that is why we are asking for your help! Help us a give a child a loving home.</p>

***While you can begin using your perks as soon as the campaign is complete at our Espresso Cart, we'd love it if you could wait to redeem your perks until we open the full cafe, projected for February 1st.  That way we can keep your contribution working for us!***

The Full Cafe is Almost Complete
With the mission to bring people together and launch movements, Awaken Cafe is in the final push to open our new doors in downtown Oakland (Broadway @15th).
The new Awaken Cafe will be a green community hub, espresso bar (serving FOURBARREL Coffee), microbrew and wine bar, local and organic eatery, and event venue.  Our new beautifully designed space will have plenty of seating and be open all day 7 days a week.  It will be a place to meet, commune, and hatch ideas for Oakland's next movements.
While we're doing a chunk of the work ourselves, we have employed a dozen different East Bay contractors.  We're reusing tons of materials from the old cafe, purchasing green and reused whenever possible, and doing business with local companies.  We're keeping our costs low, while trying not to sacrifice quality and attention to detail.  


We'd Like Your Support
We wish we could invite you and the rest of our community to be investors and own a little piece of a local, independent business that will make a real difference in our community.  But we can't.  Business finance law prohibits us from selling equity to the public (change is on the horizon in the form of H.R. 2930 which just passed the House of Representatives), which is what brings us back to indiegogo for your support.

We've already raised the bulk of the capital needed to finance this project from a small circle of friends and family, and a smaller Indiegogo campaign earlier this year.  As the project nears completion, we are raising the final $10,000 through this campaign to find some interesting old furniture, installation of our reclaimed oak floors, concrete counter tops and other special details. 
We've got some great perks at several different levels of participation.  We invite you to join us in creating an amazing local economy in downtown Oakland.  Making a contribution will do more than help Awaken Cafe, it will help support the thriving local community of independent business and artists in downtown Oakland.
Thank you for your time and your attention.  We're honored to have your support.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p> We are Damola Rufai (a graduate from Howard Univerity's undergraduate architecture program) and Ebikiri Aboro (a graduate student of University of Pennsylvania's Software engineering program), together we hope to impact the way you discover and share content online. This idea was born from the noticeable rise in online sharing culture today.</p>
<p>  A lot of us love to share things that we deem cool or important but we also love to discover new things that add to our scope of the world. The thing about sharing in most of today's world though is that most of the content shared is usually curated from a single perspective, its one source generating content for a host of others;opposing that idea is what led us to this project. </p>
<p> Creating a way for shared content to become multifaceted, to comprise of more than one perspective, and for sharing to become more of a conversational exercise. A lot of thought went into how we could make that possible and finally the idea for <b>amalgam</b> surfaced. A free web app that would allow multiple users to create sharing hubs called <b>amalgams. </b>An amalgam is essentially a collection of posts gathered into a bundle. They can be created by a single user or multiple users (preferable and a lot more fun). Think of each one as a bag of m&amp;m's or trail mix but for digital content. </p>
<p> This is not a blog aggregator though, its more specific and selective than that. In every amalgam is an interconnected network of users simultaneously sharing content in real-time with each other. Perhaps the greatest thing about amalgams is the fact that there's no telling how far each one can go because contributors to an amalgam have the ability to invite people that might find the posts relevant and those new people also have the opportunity to post content in the amalgam. This way there's almost always an element of surprise, you never know what you might learn or who you might meet in an amalgam. </p>
<p> There's also no limit to the amount of amalgams you can simultaneously participate in, no limit to how much you can discover and learn from so many different sources. We've so far been working on the GUI (which you can see samples of below and in our gallery) and back end development in Ruby on rails. We have a lot more to do but we are really enthusiastic about this idea and have the determination to see this through to the end</p>

<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> We want this app to be something that really enhances your online sharing/learning experience. We also hope that it makes the idea of sharing more social, fostering better interaction and even attaining a level where even groups of trusted educators, artists and news agencies can create amalgams that are open to the public to discover, share and participate in. </p>
<p> An environment where everything shared is a bit of everyone. The vision is to meet our goal and have this project done in the upcoming months after we are funded so that you all can see the result of your belief in us, if we are not able to reach our funding goal though we will use part of the money to develop what we can of the app and use the rest to make sure we deliver on all the perks promised to those that support us, the beta testing invite perks might take longer because we'd have to find another source of funding before we can get the application to beta but let's hope it doesn't come to that, we hope that you all are just as enthusiastic about this idea as we are and are stoked to see it come to life.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> To really get this project to work like we'd want it to work, it will require feedback from you guys, funding for marketing, and development of the project, right now it's two of us working on the GUI and coding of the app but eventually we will need more hands on deck and your funding will go a long way to help us achieve that. Part of the funding we recieve will also definitely be designated to perks for you guys. </p>
<p> Some of the perks we have for you include cool digital promotional material that can be used as posters, stickers or postcards, beta testing invites for you and your friends, getting credit on the website for being a supporter once its done. Since our project is about sharing we're also using this opportunity to share the work of an artist that we really admire, Nour Tohme (<a href=""http://nourtohme.com/typolettering/draw-me-a-songtm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://nourtohme.com/typolettering/draw-me-a-songtm/</a>). Check out a sample below. Her artwork will be included in the perks available to higher tier supporters. If we're able to exceed our campaign goals we will definitely be dishing out more perks to you guys and we'll also implement more cool features into the app.</p>

</div>
<br/>On December 17, 2011, we brought together 30 Greeks of all ages and 
backgrounds to imagine the Greece we wish to create and leave to future generations. It was a powerful day of 
participatory conversation, collective visioning and practical, hands-on
 learning. Our next step is to <span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>widen
 the field of participation and 
the scope of our skills, create new actions, learn and practice 
collaborative leadership.  Your financial support will be a direct 
investment is bringing together citizens who care, innovators, new 
leaders to meet and collectively move from protest to enterprising to 
systemic change.<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">What is possible 
when we tap our collective resources - our energy, heritage, family and 
land-based wisdom, innovative ideas, modern technologies and ancient 
myths - <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">to create a new participatory pathway towards a culture of 
governance and living in Greece that sustains both people and planet? </span></span><br/> <br/><font size=""4"">A Pivotal Moment</font><br/>Greece,
 like the rest of the world is at a pivotal moment in history.  As a 
nation, we stand at a precarious edge, instigated by an economic crisis 
connected to a global financial system that we now know is not 
sustainable. <br/><br/>As our current systems rapidly disintegrate, and we
 witness increasing unemployment, poverty, suicide rates, and despair we
 also see local initiatives being sparked and new forms of active 
citizenship beginning to flourish. As a naturally enterprising people, 
Greeks hold a treasure chest of traditions, ideas and abilities that if 
awakened and catalysed, can pioneer a new sustainable future - not just 
for this country but for a changing Europe.<br/><br/>We believe we can 
re-frame â€œcrisisâ€ to potential, re-vitalize the values of democracy 
towards an new world that is aligned with deeply sustainable human and 
ecological values.<br/> <br/><font size=""4"">Katalysing Change</font><br/>To
 ""catalyse"" in Greek means to move towards solutions.  As Greek 
citizens, we are already catalysing our own solutions in how we are 
responding daily to the massive challenges that are already present. 
However, these creative responses remain disparate and at this point, 
they lack coherence.  <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;""></span>KATALYSIS
 is a systemic change process initiated by a group of us, committed 
Greeks and internationals who work with participatory methodologies, 
social innovation and arts. We believe that as local citizens and global
 citizens, we hold the key to a renewed Greece. <br/><br/><font size=""4"">KATALYSIS aims to:</font><br style=""font-family: times new roman;""/><ol style=""font-family: times new roman;"">
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Illuminate emerging ideas</span> and 
catalyse new connections that lead to social innovation, enterprising 
and entrepreneurial activities and that support a generative spirit and 
vision in the country.  </li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Create and host gatherings</span> and 
spaces that move us collectively from the current paralysis, through 
despair, towards hope and into the belief that we can ourselves create 
new socio-economic thinking, values, practices and skills.  </li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Invite people to remember, reclaim, re-imagine </span>who we are and want to be for ourselves and as members of the world community.</li>

collective protest to collective enterprising.</span></span><br/><br/> We will do this by creating:<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-family: verdana;"">1.  An Art of Participatory Leadership Learning Event:</span><br/>A
 3-day training for up to 45 new innovators, active citizens, artists, 
business and community leaders and those ready to step up into new forms
 of leadership and innovation that are aligned with the Greek psyche and
 culture.<br/><br/>Funds will allow Greeks of all ages and income brackets
 to participate and learn with and create new realities with a field of 
innovators from movements here and in other parts of the world.<br/> <br/><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-family: verdana;""> 2. A Collective Conversation in the Commons/ Agora event (Î‘Î³Î¿ÏÎ¬):</span><br/>An
 art-based, conversational marketplace to bring together 200-300 people 
in a collective conversation for networking and connecting to see a 
bigger picture and inspiration for creating a collaborative future. And 
create a mapway for concrete next steps and our further actions.<br/> <br/>These
 events will act as ""doorways"" for those who are searching for another 
way to participate and make a difference in their own futures, beyond 
protesting or dependence on current institutions.  These people are the 
""social transformers"" who, when connected to one another, can scale up 
their initiatives and potential.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">THANK YOU!!!</span><br/><br/><br/><font size=""3"" style=""font-family: verdana;"">A Glimpse of the Bigger Picture of KATALYSIS (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">stay tuned!</span>)</font><br/><br/>This
 initiative creates a long term systemic transformation initiative with 
key building blocks that will act on a viral basis. Those who 
participate, step up, learn new skills, practice them and transfer them 
to their contexts are the katalysers. We will begin in Athens with 
satellite locations in Rhodes and the Volos area and then spread 
throughout the country as people learn, practice and transfer their 
learning to their own communities, and other locations.<br/> <br/>Our systemic transformation initiative will work on three levels:<br/><br/>1.    
 K (ÎšÎ±Î¹Î½Î¿Ï„Î¿Î¼Î¯Î±) Innovating , Enterprising &amp; Research - Supporting 
new ideas into fruition, proto-typing and learning together; competition
 for new ideas that can then be scaled out.<br/> <br/>2.     A (AÏ†ÏÏ€Î½Î¹ÏƒÎ·) 
Connecting and Imagining -  Agora Events which are large-scale 
multi-stakeholder gatherings and networking opportunities.<br/> <br/>3.    
 T (Î¤Î­Ï‡Î½Î·) Inspiring and Learning - Leading-edge thinking and practices,
 trainings and workshops and the use of Arts for social change.<br/> <br/>We

hosted by the Living Wholeness Practice, SoL Greece & Synergy

On December 17, 2011, we brought together 30 Greeks of all ages and 
backgrounds to imagine the Greece we wish to create and leave to future generations. It was a powerful day of 
participatory conversation, collective visioning and practical, hands-on
 learning. Our next step is to widen
 the field of participation and 
the scope of our skills, create new actions, learn and practice 
collaborative leadership.  Your financial support will be a direct 
investment is bringing together citizens who care, innovators, new 
leaders to meet and collectively move from protest to enterprising to 
systemic change.What is possible 
when we tap our collective resources - our energy, heritage, family and 
land-based wisdom, innovative ideas, modern technologies and ancient 
myths - to create a new participatory pathway towards a culture of 
governance and living in Greece that sustains both people and planet?  A Pivotal MomentGreece,
 like the rest of the world is at a pivotal moment in history.  As a 
nation, we stand at a precarious edge, instigated by an economic crisis 
connected to a global financial system that we now know is not 
sustainable. As our current systems rapidly disintegrate, and we
 witness increasing unemployment, poverty, suicide rates, and despair we
 also see local initiatives being sparked and new forms of active 
citizenship beginning to flourish. As a naturally enterprising people, 
Greeks hold a treasure chest of traditions, ideas and abilities that if 
awakened and catalysed, can pioneer a new sustainable future - not just 
for this country but for a changing Europe.We believe we can 
re-frame â€œcrisisâ€ to potential, re-vitalize the values of democracy 
towards an new world that is aligned with deeply sustainable human and 
ecological values. Katalysing ChangeTo
 ""catalyse"" in Greek means to move towards solutions.  As Greek 
citizens, we are already catalysing our own solutions in how we are 
responding daily to the massive challenges that are already present. 
However, these creative responses remain disparate and at this point, 
they lack coherence.  KATALYSIS
 is a systemic change process initiated by a group of us, committed 
Greeks and internationals who work with participatory methodologies, 
social innovation and arts. We believe that as local citizens and global
 citizens, we hold the key to a renewed Greece. KATALYSIS aims to:

Illuminate emerging ideas and 
catalyse new connections that lead to social innovation, enterprising 
and entrepreneurial activities and that support a generative spirit and 
vision in the country.  

Create and host gatherings and 
spaces that move us collectively from the current paralysis, through 
despair, towards hope and into the belief that we can ourselves create 
new socio-economic thinking, values, practices and skills.  

Invite people to remember, reclaim, re-imagine who we are and want to be for ourselves and as members of the world community.
 Your financial support will be a direct investment in:Supporting New Leaders and Innovators to Meet, Learn and Take Action Together to transform the energy of 
collective protest to collective enterprising. We will do this by creating:1.  An Art of Participatory Leadership Learning Event:A
 3-day training for up to 45 new innovators, active citizens, artists, 
business and community leaders and those ready to step up into new forms
 of leadership and innovation that are aligned with the Greek psyche and
 culture.Funds will allow Greeks of all ages and income brackets
 to participate and learn with and create new realities with a field of 
innovators from movements here and in other parts of the world.  2. A Collective Conversation in the Commons/ Agora event (Î‘Î³Î¿ÏÎ¬):An
 art-based, conversational marketplace to bring together 200-300 people 
in a collective conversation for networking and connecting to see a 
bigger picture and inspiration for creating a collaborative future. And 
create a mapway for concrete next steps and our further actions. These
 events will act as ""doorways"" for those who are searching for another 
way to participate and make a difference in their own futures, beyond 
protesting or dependence on current institutions.  These people are the 
""social transformers"" who, when connected to one another, can scale up 
their initiatives and potential.THANK YOU!!!A Glimpse of the Bigger Picture of KATALYSIS (stay tuned!)This
 initiative creates a long term systemic transformation initiative with 
key building blocks that will act on a viral basis. Those who 
participate, step up, learn new skills, practice them and transfer them 
to their contexts are the katalysers. We will begin in Athens with 
satellite locations in Rhodes and the Volos area and then spread 
throughout the country as people learn, practice and transfer their 
learning to their own communities, and other locations. Our systemic transformation initiative will work on three levels:1.    
 K (ÎšÎ±Î¹Î½Î¿Ï„Î¿Î¼Î¯Î±) Innovating , Enterprising & Research - Supporting 
new ideas into fruition, proto-typing and learning together; competition
 for new ideas that can then be scaled out. 2.     A (AÏ†ÏÏ€Î½Î¹ÏƒÎ·) 
Connecting and Imagining -  Agora Events which are large-scale 
multi-stakeholder gatherings and networking opportunities. 3.    
 T (Î¤Î­Ï‡Î½Î·) Inspiring and Learning - Leading-edge thinking and practices,
 trainings and workshops and the use of Arts for social change. We
 will cross-pollinate the learning - On-line web-based, interactive 
conversational and other learning events and take this learning into 
Phase 2 of prototyping and scaling out the innovations and new ideas. You are most welcome to contact us at: katalysis.greece@yahoo.gr  ~ Looking forward!",0.0,0,"6 Campaigns

<h3>Bio</h3>
<div>My name is Patrick Nicolas , I'm a young canadian studying at UQAM University in accounting ( not really what i wanted but for my dad that was the only program for me). I'm living in the most beautiful and culturally diverse and hospitable city in the world  (need to think twice before getting a serious relationship ;-) ) </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Hist<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">ory </span>
</h3>
<div>I was searching for a product in the summer of 2012 and it was impossible to find it anywhere. I asked a few people and it was hard for my surroundings to answer me . I told myself  ""<i>I know there is someone out there who's selling this product and he knows there are people looking to buy it too but there is one thing missing and its the ""<b>connection </b></i>"" . From that moment, I decided to built a Classified adds Website <a href=""www.tagtroc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TAGTROC</a> based on a social network platform completely free. I would like to give people the opportunity to exchange goods and services among themselves for free . </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Tagtroc philosophy is simplicity and the priority of images . </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>TagTroc is
a complete and practical social network, characterized by a spirit of
collaboration and business acumen. Easy to use, this dynamic forum for
discussion provides an opportunity for each member to create a network of
contacts throughout North America which is absolutely free. </p>

<br/>
</div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Reviews / Feedbacks</h3>
<p>The positive feedbacks that I have received for the project encourages me to forward with confidence. People in general, really like the concept and approach . </p>
<br/><h3>Financing</h3>
<div>TAGTROC was launched in June 12,  2014  in beta version . I have invested  all my savings in the project because I strongly believe in it, and I want to create a better economic community, city and State . I want to give people another opportunity before going right to the store or shop to satisfy their needs. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Sometimes I wonder and ask myself Is the project worth the try? I will challenge the big names like (Craiglists , Backapge , Kijiji and more) It's gonna be David against Goliath . What if I fail!! But I remember that David won his battle and with all these positive feedbacks, I decided ""you know what, let's go"". Now we are at the most difficult stage of the project ""Promotion"" It's hard to promote a project without money but it's not the only solution. </span><br/>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>There are 4 ways to help us realize the project:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>1.- We are inviting you to <a href=""www.tagtroc.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sign up</a> and tell your friends, family to subscribe to your profile and share the page to promote TAGTROC. (worth more than money)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>2.- Like our Facebook page , invite your friends to like and share it (worth more than money)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">3.- Give us advice and suggestion to improve the Platform. (worth more than money)</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">4.- Give us any amount to promote it ( I personally prefer  1 , 2 &amp; 3 ;-) ) but feel free to take option 4 . </span></div>
<div><br/></div>
<h4>Why this amount of money ?</h4>
<div>The cost associated with a site like this goes well beyond the amount of money required to make it successful. Money will be used for the following: promoting the TAGTROC platform around the US &amp; Canada , servers fees , development of applications, Social Media promotions,  recruitment of talented web developers, office space , marketing promotion ect. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h4>Other ways to help .</h4>
<p>If you have other options to support the project, feel free to contact us . We will appreciate any kind of help you can bring us. </p>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We welcome all support. Send us a private message on TAGTROC profile or Email us at info@tagtroc.com</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Why others who tried, failed?</h3>
<div>There
 are many other small adds sites  online and none of them have managed 
to shake up the big names. Why? The reason is simple, they do not come 
with a  product that is innovative and different. They all try to 
resemble each other instead of standing out from their competitors. We are doing something completely different <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<div>We do not want to generate a regional or provincial recession because people will buy less from the big companies and will think TAGTROC first. Ok , I'm kidding may be not so harsh as a recession, but we want to have a strong impact on every daily  life (environmental, ecological, recycling ). </div>
<div><br/></div>

</div></div>","Bio
My name is Patrick Nicolas , I'm a young canadian studying at UQAM University in accounting ( not really what i wanted but for my dad that was the only program for me). I'm living in the most beautiful and culturally diverse and hospitable city in the world  (need to think twice before getting a serious relationship ;-) ) 

History 

I was searching for a product in the summer of 2012 and it was impossible to find it anywhere. I asked a few people and it was hard for my surroundings to answer me . I told myself  ""I know there is someone out there who's selling this product and he knows there are people looking to buy it too but there is one thing missing and its the ""connection "" . From that moment, I decided to built a Classified adds Website TAGTROC based on a social network platform completely free. I would like to give people the opportunity to exchange goods and services among themselves for free . 

Tagtroc philosophy is simplicity and the priority of images . 


TagTroc is
a complete and practical social network, characterized by a spirit of
collaboration and business acumen. Easy to use, this dynamic forum for
discussion provides an opportunity for each member to create a network of
contacts throughout North America which is absolutely free. 





Reviews / Feedbacks
The positive feedbacks that I have received for the project encourages me to forward with confidence. People in general, really like the concept and approach . 
Financing
TAGTROC was launched in June 12,  2014  in beta version . I have invested  all my savings in the project because I strongly believe in it, and I want to create a better economic community, city and State . I want to give people another opportunity before going right to the store or shop to satisfy their needs. 


Sometimes I wonder and ask myself Is the project worth the try? I will challenge the big names like (Craiglists , Backapge , Kijiji and more) It's gonna be David against Goliath . What if I fail!! But I remember that David won his battle and with all these positive feedbacks, I decided ""you know what, let's go"". Now we are at the most difficult stage of the project ""Promotion"" It's hard to promote a project without money but it's not the only solution. 


There are 4 ways to help us realize the project:

1.- We are inviting you to sign up and tell your friends, family to subscribe to your profile and share the page to promote TAGTROC. (worth more than money)

2.- Like our Facebook page , invite your friends to like and share it (worth more than money)


3.- Give us advice and suggestion to improve the Platform. (worth more than money)


4.- Give us any amount to promote it ( I personally prefer  1 , 2 & 3 ;-) ) but feel free to take option 4 . 

Why this amount of money ?
The cost associated with a site like this goes well beyond the amount of money required to make it successful. Money will be used for the following: promoting the TAGTROC platform around the US & Canada , servers fees , development of applications, Social Media promotions,  recruitment of talented web developers, office space , marketing promotion ect. 


Other ways to help .
If you have other options to support the project, feel free to contact us . We will appreciate any kind of help you can bring us. 


We welcome all support. Send us a private message on TAGTROC profile or Email us at info@tagtroc.com

Why others who tried, failed?
There
 are many other small adds sites  online and none of them have managed 
to shake up the big names. Why? The reason is simple, they do not come 
with a  product that is innovative and different. They all try to 
resemble each other instead of standing out from their competitors. We are doing something completely different 


Impact
We do not want to generate a regional or provincial recession because people will buy less from the big companies and will think TAGTROC first. Ok , I'm kidding may be not so harsh as a recession, but we want to have a strong impact on every daily  life (environmental, ecological, recycling ). 

We are offering a better Website than all others out there. Our first goal is to allow people to exchange their goods and services. 

So people let's spread the word and advertise TAGTROC. You need to be a part of the project . Hurry up and sign up to start sharing and posting any great product you have home !


If you like the project, do not hesitate to show your appreciation by giving us any amount of money or better yet, work with us to improve the Website. Thanks for taking the time to get acquainted with us. I look forward to hearing from many of you.

Crew USA</b>!!!  </p>
<p>My name is Cordell McGary II, and I am the owner of Eating Well
with Chef Cordell (<a href=""http://www.chefcordell.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.chefcordell.com</a>).  For the past 5+ years, my
company has focused on accentuating healthy eating via community cooking
classes and demonstrations, Personal Chef service, public speaking (and the
like) around the country.  Personally, I have always been a passionate
advocate for FRESH food access for all neighborhoods, but more specifically
food deserts, which are defined as urban neighborhoods and rural towns without
ready access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food. </p>
<p><b>The Soup Crew USA</b>, a group comprised mostly of volunteers, is on
a mission to <b><i>disseminate at least 10,000 HOT SOUPS across Chicago through the
winter months</i></b>, starting in January.  Whether or not you’re a Chicago native,
I'm sure that you know that it gets veeeery COLD here during the winter; hence
our moniker ""The Windy City"".  During this frigid season, our
streets are covered with people who are homeless, hungry and in need of a
number of basic necessities that you and I are accustomed to having in place.
 Regardless of financial, social or class ""status"", NO ONE
should have to go hungry or be cold; <b><i>we are all in this race together: the
HUMAN race</i></b>. ""Giving"" and ""being of service to others""
is at the core of <b>The Soup Crew USA</b>, and we want to START to play our part by
providing HOT SOUPS twice per week, at 4 locations across Chicago, throughout
the winter months.  In order to reach this goal, <b><i>WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!
 </i></b></p>
<p>Your donations to this mission will help feed and warm 10,000
residents of ""The Windy City"" who are in desperate need of
sustenance, hope, warmth and the feeling of someone caring about their
well-being.  In my travels I've seen wonderful transformations of people's
hearts, minds and life directions by acts of kindness from others.  It's
probably warm in your car, office and home right now, but it's <b><i>cooooooooold</i></b> on
these streets.  Help us help someone stay warm today; it may do the same
for your heart too.</p>

Crew USA!!!  
My name is Cordell McGary II, and I am the owner of Eating Well
with Chef Cordell (www.chefcordell.com).  For the past 5+ years, my
company has focused on accentuating healthy eating via community cooking
classes and demonstrations, Personal Chef service, public speaking (and the
like) around the country.  Personally, I have always been a passionate
advocate for FRESH food access for all neighborhoods, but more specifically
food deserts, which are defined as urban neighborhoods and rural towns without
ready access to fresh, healthy, and affordable food. 
The Soup Crew USA, a group comprised mostly of volunteers, is on
a mission to disseminate at least 10,000 HOT SOUPS across Chicago through the
winter months, starting in January.  Whether or not you’re a Chicago native,
I'm sure that you know that it gets veeeery COLD here during the winter; hence
our moniker ""The Windy City"".  During this frigid season, our
streets are covered with people who are homeless, hungry and in need of a
number of basic necessities that you and I are accustomed to having in place.
 Regardless of financial, social or class ""status"", NO ONE
should have to go hungry or be cold; we are all in this race together: the
HUMAN race. ""Giving"" and ""being of service to others""
is at the core of The Soup Crew USA, and we want to START to play our part by
providing HOT SOUPS twice per week, at 4 locations across Chicago, throughout
the winter months.  In order to reach this goal, WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!
 
Your donations to this mission will help feed and warm 10,000
residents of ""The Windy City"" who are in desperate need of
sustenance, hope, warmth and the feeling of someone caring about their
well-being.  In my travels I've seen wonderful transformations of people's
hearts, minds and life directions by acts of kindness from others.  It's
probably warm in your car, office and home right now, but it's cooooooooold on
these streets.  Help us help someone stay warm today; it may do the same
for your heart too.

What We Need & What You GetWe are in need of $18,000, which will cover expenses including:
Food 
Kitchen rental
Equipment
Transportation
Labor (minimal, but for the cooks)
Marketing materials
IF WE DON'T REACH OUR GOAL, we will still feed as many as we can with what we have available to us.  IF WE GO BEYOND OUR GOAL, we will pay the volunteers a stipend for their time.In return, you will receive one of the wonderful perks listed here =====>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Tom Dickinson and I am on the Autism Spectrum.  I am also a Culinary School Graduate, A Professional Chef, and Two Time Cookbook Author, The Contributing Chef to Autism Today TV, and the Chef Instructor at Aim Higher Incorporated in California.  And to put it bluntly, I need your help.  </p>
<p>Being a self advocate for Autism I have advocated for adults on the spectrum and all adults with special needs to learn how to cook fresh meals for themselves and not rely on fast food, frozen dinners, and processed junk because I believe that anyone can cook a simple delicious meal for themselves and my campaign is to be able to reach as many special needs adults and kids as I can and that's why I need you. </p>
<p>What I want to do is to be able to offer cooking classes for special needs adults at a minimal cost to them.  And with your help we can do that.  Imagine the potential of people cooking for themselves and believing in themselves not just in cooking, but in all aspects of life as well.   </p>
<p>With your help, we can change lives.  We can make a difference in the life of someone instead of relying on microwave burritos from a frozen package, they can cook in their kitchen independently and live a healthy life full of confidence, independence, and quality food.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>To get this going and to do it right, we need $200,000.  Why so much, first and foremost, we need a reliable vehicle to be able to go on location to different areas to set up cooking classes for special needs adults.  We need cooking supplies and portable burners that they can cook on.  We need knife kits so these students can learn proper knife skills and safety in the kitchen.  We want every student to be able to wear a chef outfit so they can feel inspired and excited to cook.  And also, we need to be able to purchase good food product so they can learn how to make great meals for themselves.  </li>
<li>I'll be honest with you.  I don't have a lot to give in return except for this.  If you choose to contribute to this campaign, the greatest perk that you will ever receive is knowing that you have changed a life.  You've helped someone learn how to take care of themselves.  You have become a part of the journey to build confidence, increase independence, and improve quality of life.  </li>
<li>If my chance we don't reach our goal, that's okay, because the money will still go to reach out to special needs adults and help them to learn how to be great home cooks, no matter how much money is raised.  </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What this all means in a nutshell is this.  By helping to raise money for this campaign, with our help we are going to change the way that people look at adults with special needs.  It's going to change their life into thinking that all they can do is play on the computer and that's it.  It's going to make them healthier, happier, and they are going to be able to take care of themselves.  And I know some are thinking ""He just wants a new car.  It was first on the need list.""  No!  That's not it.  Right now my wife and I are carrying around cooking supplies in an old 98 Saturn to different sites to teach people how to cook and we are willing to do that.  But this isn't about me.  This is about the betterment of people's lives.  Whether it be someone with Autism, Down's Syndrome, or whatever.  This isn't about making them into chefs, this is about teaching life skills and creating something awesome.  Thank you.  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>And if you guys can't contribute money right now, that's okay.  But please, do share this campaign with others so they can be a part of something awesome to build up the lives of hundreds, and potentially thousands of special needs adults who want to learn how to take care of themselves so please share and thank you.  </p></span></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary
