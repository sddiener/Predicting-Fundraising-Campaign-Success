It's about hats! The fashion-accessory which over centuries has had various styles. Our product in this case is a mixture of different styles for women, which can bring to mind the 30's, 70's and also earlier times. 








But in this case it is the use of materials with a modern twist that has given the hats a new image, which in this case is neither ceremonial nor the usual wool bonnet; instead it's an object that can enhance your image!


Materials include high quality Boiled Wool and Jersey made by one of the best brands in the world; the Austrian Moessmer. 




We also use certain delicate fabrics in various band types around head to avoid irritating the forehead and face.






The most interesting part of all that we have brought in a modern way is a detail that was not being used anymore: The velette.







But by plasticizing the velette we have obtained a hard tissue, a rigid reticulated plastic tissue:



Using the velette in this way reveals the face like in the old days, but by a modern twist which gives the hat a much more sporty theme, though still elegant. 






What is unique about this object is that it can have your daily usage according to whatever dress code you're using; Ceremonial, formal, semi-formal, informal or casual, no matter what you choose for your daily outfit you can easily level up your public image.


Please also see the photo gallery.
Sizes & Colors



Sizes are: S (54/56), M (56/58), L (58/60). Numbers indicate the circumference of the head. Putting the measuring tool on the forehead and doing a closed circle going towards back of the head and returning,

About The Goal

Hi, My name is Ernie Moreno I am the owner and artist of www.tattoomyshoes.com
I have multiple examples of each of my shoes at my site, so I encourage you to visit me to see what is possible on a pair of shoes!

As a former tattoo artist I wanted to share the art-form with people that may love the art, but are not wanting a lifetime commitment to one design, I also wanted to stop filling notebooks and sketch pads with designs that were just going to sit and gather dust

The reason I started this campaign is to first and foremost share my art, secondly to order more shoes to be able to continue to jump start my business. I want to order 200 pairs of shoes so I can pass along the savings to those that participate in this campaign
I am offering my tattooed shoes at a considerable savings to what you would be able to get them otherwise, The Vans style shoes I use are high quality and allows me to really get the detail that others that do similar shoes lack.
I use high quality shoes and art supplies that will last as well as stay vibrant
 Where will my money go?
 
100% of the funding will go to ordering 200 pairs of shoes, this will cover everything from manufacture to shipping.  I was recently interviewed for Texas Country Reporter and I want to be able to meet the anticipated demandnce the shoes are received I will start creating the works of art on the shoes in order of the pledges, I guarantee you will not be disappointed in the quality of the shoe or the artwork.

If I do not reach my total goal of $2500 I will make a smaller shoe order and still honor the pledges made

Why Pledge?


Be on the ground floor of the new business that this will help jump start.
Get a one of a kind work of art that you can wear and enjoy on a daily basis
Each pair of shoe is made especially for you, no two pairs are ever the same, each pair is also hand signed and dated. These shoes will be numbered to show that your shoes are unique to this project I have made hundreds of shoes so far and you can see examples at my website www.tattoomyshoes.com
 I hope to get shoes out as soon as the order arrives from the manufacturer. Typically it takes 3 months from the placing of the order to the time of arrival.
    
Examples of Perks!!
Artist's Choice
At this level you I pick  your design for you
Specify male or female and I will do the rest!!
This let's my imagination run wild and I usually create my best designs 

Day of the dead
These are my most popular designs, No 2 are ever alike you choose color and embellisments

Japanese Traditional
This is my favorite form of art, I love the imagery and the bold designs

American Traditional
These are BOLD designs that have stood the test of time

Comic Book and Anime
Choose from Spiderman, Batman, or any other Game or anime character
 
Mix and Match
Get 4 pair when you purchase 2
I make these interchangeable so you can have multiple pairs by mixing them







Risks & Challenges  The risks involved are minimal the biggest issue will be in the time you get your shoes.

unfortunately if you want your shoes as soon as the project is funded this will not be the case, as I stated above I will honor all pledges in order as soon as the shoes arrive from the manufacturer. once shoes arrive I will immediately start on the shoes and post progress as shoes are shipped to each person.

With sport.</h3> <p>Between 2010 and 2020 global fiber consumption is likely to increase by 30%. That will be over 96 million tons. From that, there are millions of tons of nylon waste, which often end up in our environment and oceans.<br/>As a result, fabric and plastic waste, as well as old fishing nets are floating in the seas and endanger our environment and the animals that live in it. More than 1200 kilometers of fishing nets are ending annually in the European seas alone.</p>
<p>With our product we have found a way to support cleaning the seas, protecting our animals and the environment and stand up for fair work conditions.<br/><br/>In addition, the unique ECONYL® regeneration process recovers precious raw material that would be otherwise wasted and saves the extraction of virgin raw material normally used for nylon. The regeneration process gives new life to material that would otherwise be wasted (e.g. in landfills, nature).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Millions of people train each day, play in teams and clubs and visit professional sports events. If we establish a sustainable solution for everyone, we can work together to achieve something great.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Our Vision

Sustainability does not have to remain a niche in sports.
We would like to equip individual athletes, teams and clubs with ecologically and socially fair produced sportswear.
We combine ecological materials, such as recycled fishing nets and biological cotton, with a social production process involving work therapy in Germany.With our products, we are proposing an alternative path in the sportswear sector.This will provide new opportunities for athletes, clubs and sponsors, who are publicly committed to sustainability, animal and environmental protection, as well as social production by wearing our clothes.
 
 
What is Re-Athlete all about? What are our values?
 
   Recycling.Environmental and animal protection through recycled nylon materials (e.g. old fishing nets, used old carpets, plastic components) also from the world's oceans.
 
   Biologically.Our cotton comes from Europe and is certified according to GOTS.
 
Sustainable.   Sustainable materials, short trade routes, plastic-free packaging, use of eco-electricity, ethical investments.
 
   Social.We promote various forms of work therapy in our production.
 
   Handmade - Made in Germany.               ALL our products are made locally. No ""fair trade"" or mass production.
 
Clean the seas and the Earth from waste. Stand up for a fair production. Save the planet.Join the Movement.Re-Athlete

With sport. Between 2010 and 2020 global fiber consumption is likely to increase by 30%. That will be over 96 million tons. From that, there are millions of tons of nylon waste, which often end up in our environment and oceans.As a result, fabric and plastic waste, as well as old fishing nets are floating in the seas and endanger our environment and the animals that live in it. More than 1200 kilometers of fishing nets are ending annually in the European seas alone.
With our product we have found a way to support cleaning the seas, protecting our animals and the environment and stand up for fair work conditions.In addition, the unique ECONYL® regeneration process recovers precious raw material that would be otherwise wasted and saves the extraction of virgin raw material normally used for nylon. The regeneration process gives new life to material that would otherwise be wasted (e.g. in landfills, nature).
 
Millions of people train each day, play in teams and clubs and visit professional sports events. If we establish a sustainable solution for everyone, we can work together to achieve something great.

We attach great importance to a regional and socially fair production.For this reason, we have our textiles made in Germany involving work therapy.This means that people with mental disorders, physical or mental disabilities are brought to working life. The work serves as a therapeutic tool. In this way, people with limitations are given the opportunity to become part of the society.For our first collection, we are working together with a regional workshop for people with psychiatric or challenging backgrounds. We will support further forms of work therapy in the future. 

 
 
Risks and challenges With the money spent on the campaign, we finance our first production.We would also like to develop further products for other sports.

Our goal is to bring sustainability to all athletes in different sports. We want people to realize that cheap alternatives and brands leave their mark on our planet - both on ecological or social factors.There is still no sports brand that offers an ecological and social solution for the general public.

Market research has shown that interest in providing safer methods of monitoring individuals in need and the safety industry surrounding is rising, and we believe that your help small or large will help in creating a global safety impact like none other.

<p><b>STORY</b></p>
<p>à l'aise is a concept that originated from a simple logo
designed by AB Benmiloud in 2011. It went from a cool word, to a concept
idea, to a logo. With time, the concept became deeper and developed more
texture. With reflection, the vision naturally expanded. The supreme epiphany
was that à l’aise represents full-circle balance. In design through life, the
concept of balance is the most divine state of existence. Like building a
house, with a strong foundation and an underground structure, along with beautiful,
appeasing aesthetics. à l’aise is reached once the exterior (texture) is in
balance with the interior (depth), whilst the left (logic) is balanced with the
right (creativity). A brick, the fundamental of all construction, represents
the harmonized design The 8 ‘stem cells’ that rise from the brick consists of
the essential units, or ingredients, to advance in the journey… ‘stacking
bricks’. Realistically, this translates to creating beautiful design through a
beautiful life, as ‘cool’ inside as out, rising progressively to the light. This
essence of this journey is sharing a positive experience with the world. Definitely
a “New Age” concept, one by one, unit by unit, the experience will spread.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>MISSION/VISION</b></p>
<p>à l’aise (AH-LEZ) is a lifestyle and design brand that seeks to elevate
the standards of life and design, while spreading love through crafted
experiences. We want to reach everyone that can relate to a façade of this vision,
and eventually the entire spectrum. Our first focus (MISSION1) is the art-form
of TISSU design, creating clothing and accessories for the male and female,
using organic and recycled materials. Currently in the
""Experimentation"" phase of growth, the team and workspace is set up
in Fort Lauderdale, FL. We are actively and consistently recycling/designing
clothing, on top of sculpting the foundation for AH-LEZ. With still the DÉMO
Package (December 16, 2015) &amp; the DÉMO 2.0 Update (March 16. 2016) to the
released, the brand and organization is still in construction. The plan is
to launch a first physical location in the South of France in the Fall of
2016. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>JOURNEY/OBSTACLES</b></p>
<p>In order to work with difficulties and obstacles, we designed
the trajectory for the growth of AH-LEZ to include an experimental
phase. Constantly taking calculated risks and learning from mistakes, this
is still a young venture. As the resources slowly accumulate and the team
builds, tangible expenses are always the most tedious in the creative/artistic
world. With the aim of the “à l’aise” vision, it is key that we rally as many
individuals as possible - the love and support is key. Financial donation,
amongst other forms of aid such are resource recycling, constructive feedback
and spreading the movement, are tremendously crucial for the growth of AH-LEZ.
With the help of all, “à l'aise” can be experienced by all. Everything falls
into place at the right moment, as long as heart and eyes are kept open. We
have imagined an ideal state and we will strive to reach it.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>INVESTMENT</b></p>
<p>For
Brand development in between the first experimental package “BETA”, and the
“DÉMO” Package release, WE NEED YOUR HELP. This fundraiser is part of the
à l’aise “ÉXPERIMENTATION” Phase. As the brand is growing, we have developed
this project as a sign “open arms” to financial donations, one of many ways you
support the vision. The accumulative rewards for donations are diverse yet
essential, exclusively sculpted for this fundraiser campaign. So to make the
idea and campaign worthwhile, we created a creative donation/exchange process, a

<h3><b>This  Textured Bonded Leather jacket and apparel is ...</b></h3>
<p><b>1) Made from premium Quality High Grade Lamb Leather .</b> Since the hand feel of the jacket is maintained very soft, in spite of the fact that sweater is bonded to leather. This is only possible with selection of   high grade lamb leather. This can only be done if the we use Lamb gloving and has no covering on top to maintain the natural look of the leather .</p>
<p><b>2) Backed by a 10 year guarantee.</b> We're so confident that our Designer look textured Bonded Leather Jacket be the most durable jacket . In spite of the fact that it is a designer jacket but has been taken care that the bonding will last for ever.</p>
<p><b>3) Made in India.</b> India is the among the fastest developing country and has the capability to develop the best of the quality and price. Developing a concept is not that important but developing commercially which buyers can afford is important , and this is what we have manage to achieve. </p>
<p><b>4) Sold wholesale.</b> By offering our jackets directly via  <strong>Indiegogo</strong>  we are able to cut out the retail channel and offer you a jacket that would usually retail for $1400-1500+ at only $200-400. This price is only for the <strong>indiegogo backers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>5) Get rid off your heavy, bulky jackets and sweaters - </strong>These are unique jacket where the sweater is bonded to leather and are light weight. So these are  not just  fashionable and trendy but comfortable as well.  </p>
<p><strong>6) Perfect Fit - </strong> Normal Jackets don't fit properly over heavy sweater. Either its tight over heavy sweater OR loose fitted without sweater . Now GET RID OF SUCH ISSUE. Our jacket fits perfectly as there is no separate lining/ no extra sweater . Just a perfect fit. Moreover we offer what no company can offer- <strong>Customized order - made to measure.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483267404/et31etfcu6f84fq0lehz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>This campaigns is really important to us,  as we every year develop lot of innovative and creative design but could not get it across to the world due lack of fund to promote it.

<h3><b>How the jacket is made?</b></h3>
<p>The Textured Bonded leather Jacket is made from the high grade lamb gloving leather, as the feel and touch cannot be achieved with lower grade Lamb Nappa(with pigment covering on Top). First the leather is shaved to a very minimum required  thickness so that the knitted sweater texture is very well visible on the top which is  the beauty of the Textured bonded  leather Apparel.</p>
<p>Then with a very special technique  it is bonded to Knitted Sweater.<strong> The beauty of this bonded concept is that, heat is not applied to bond the leather with knit which keeps the sweater and leather soft</strong> .As on application  of heat, leather has the tendency to get Hard. </p>

2) Backed by a 10 year guarantee. We're so confident that our Designer look textured Bonded Leather Jacket be the most durable jacket . In spite of the fact that it is a designer jacket but has been taken care that the bonding will last for ever.
3) Made in India. India is the among the fastest developing country and has the capability to develop the best of the quality and price. Developing a concept is not that important but developing commercially which buyers can afford is important , and this is what we have manage to achieve. 
4) Sold wholesale. By offering our jackets directly via  Indiegogo  we are able to cut out the retail channel and offer you a jacket that would usually retail for $1400-1500+ at only $200-400. This price is only for the indiegogo backers.

6) Perfect Fit -  Normal Jackets don't fit properly over heavy sweater. Either its tight over heavy sweater OR loose fitted without sweater . Now GET RID OF SUCH ISSUE. Our jacket fits perfectly as there is no separate lining/ no extra sweater . Just a perfect fit. Moreover we offer what no company can offer- Customized order - made to measure.

How shipments are made     Express shipment DHL / FedEx/UPS/TNT   are employed for shipping all orders. Express shipment means that the consignment is traceable and can be tracked. During this entire stretch, it is possible to track the package, with the courier tracking number provided by the express shipment company. The courier tracking number is provided by us, once your parcel is shipped. This facility helps you to keep a close-watch on the movement of your shipment, towards its final destination. The entire shipping process is traceable; hence the customers can get their parcels right at their door-step as per their convenience and without any hassles.In case it is not possible for you to sign and collect your shipment at the probable date of arrival of your shipment, you can certainly leave a note on the door directing delivery to a neighbor, who can sign for the package on your behalf.If no one can sign for the delivery on your behalf, Express courier will leave a note with shipment number and a contact number so that you can call them and arrange for the delivery.Lost & Damage during ShipmentIn the rare cases of lost and damaged goods during the shipment, buyer should immediately notify the courier within the first 24 hours after the delivery and file a formal claim. All evidence and documents must be retained as proof. The courier may investigate the claim before compensation can be assessed. Buyer should also notify us immediately to help process the claim..
Re-delivery & Failed Delivery
FedEx, UPS, and DHL attempt to deliver the shipment for up to three times. If delivery still fails, the express couriers will attempt to contact buyer via phone number and email. If buyer still fails to take delivery, the goods may be returned to us. .Re-deliveries and returns to sender due to delivery failures usually incur significant delays. In any circumstances, we are not  responsible for such delays, failed deliveries, wrong shipping addresses provided by buyers, and any other situations that we  is not at fault.If buyer fails to take delivery, the goods shall be held at buyer's sole risk in all respects. In such a case we , acting on buyer's behalf and at buyer's expense, may store, insure, protect, and resell the goods for the buyer.
Customs Duties
Many countries offer duty-free or reduced duty for importing goods from certain countries. For example, there is no import duty or tax for importing consumer electronics goods from Hong Kong to USA. Many countries offer duty-free allowance for gifts and small quantity imports from most countries.We will provide the basic export documents and information, including commercial invoice and packing slip, for customs clearance at the designated country. For small to medium shipment using express couriers, we  may help buyer to clear the customs as a courtesy.We will help buyers minimize their customs duties and will cooperate with them to satisfy their requirements legitimately. However we are not responsible for customs duties, fees, and other taxes imposed by the consignee's or buyer's countries. We are  also not responsible for informing the customer or consignee about their own country's import regulations, taxes or duties.In any circumstances, customs clearance is buyer's responsibility,  We  recommends buyers to consult with their countries' customs authority before importing any merchandise in large quantity to minimize customs duties and avoid delay. For bulk order kindly order separately to get better prices. All bulk order will be send through proper custom clearance.If the shipment is held or impounded by the customs in consignee's country because the customer or consignee refuses to pay customs fees, duties, or taxes, buyer will assume all additional fees and penalties associated with such an act.",35.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Precise Cut</h3>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1188839/files/20150201163125-gif__1_.gif?1422837085"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Our Partner</h3>By partnering with <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jwsoft.nfcactionlauncher"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TRIGGER</a>, one of the most popular NFC programming apps available, the ASSET Wallet capabilities are endless.

<p>For example, simply program your chip to turn on your Bluetooth, turn off Wifi, and open Pandora. Now when you enter your car, simply tap your NFC enabled phone on ASSET and go! The uses are infinite and best of all... it can be tailored to your life. </p>
<h3>From Idea to Life</h3>It's always a rare opportunity that an idea can turn into a reality. Throughout our adventure, we have reworked and redesigned multiple times before we finally found our ideal design. <br/><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FP5AnvoS3A08%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DP5AnvoS3A08%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FP5AnvoS3A08%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Will NFC work with your phone?</h3>
<p>The ASSET Wallet works with <b>Android</b>, <b>Windows</b>, and <b>Blackberry</b> phones with NFC capabilities. Current iPhones do not support NFC but can work with NFC enabled adapters and cases. Though the iPhone 6 and 6+ do have NFC, Apple has locked it down to be used for only Apple Pay.</p>
<p>To find out if your device is compatible, check out the <a href=""http://www.nfcworld.com/nfc-phones-list/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">list of NFC phones and tablets</a></p>
<p></p>
<h3>RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Security</h3>
<p>Worried about RFID thieves? Don’t be. The Asset completely blocks RFID signals. Safe, stylish and simple! Radio Frequency Identity Theft is a form of identity theft using wireless machine to receive your credit card information in close proximity. With the Asset's aluminum plates, the frequency is completely blocked and you are safe from RFID thieves.</p>

First off, we want to say THANK YOU for taking the time to learn more about ASSET. We, at LionNFC, embrace the vision of designing everyday consumer products to be the sleekest and smartest they can be with the integration of modern technology.


Black and Silver Asset




Red Asset

Violet Asset


Blue Asset

Gold Asset



The Collection


Perks













What is Asset?



The ASSET WALLET is a sleek wallet constructed out of two ultra thin Aluminum 6061 grade plates with 2 NFC chips integrated in each wallet. 





What can the Asset do?



And so much more! 

The Design
We chose high grade aluminum for the Asset because of its light weight (~ 1/3 the weight of steel), non-magnetic (RFID-resistant), and rust resistant properties. Each wallet is anodized with a bright metallic color. 

It's less than 4mm thin and weighs 1.40oz
 


Gold Asset with 4 credit cards and cash



The Precise Cut

Our original idea for the Asset was a money clip, but we disliked that we had to remove everything to get the card or item you wanted most. Not anymore. With our hexagonal cutout finger groove, you can now easily access any card. 



Place your ID on top, for example, and when you get carded at a club, you can now easily pull it out, put it back, and be on your way to a fun night. 
Slide your cards in easily with an internal beveled edge. 


The Perfect Size
Made in the same dimension as a credit card for the perfect fit.


The Band

Throughout a one year period, we have visited numerous manufacturers and ran elastic tests to find the most durable and elastic bands that will last a long time. By using a wider 1.5” band, we achieve security for your cards and the ability to hold those extra things we all carry. 




Holds Cash Securely








For Those Extras


What is NFC?
NFC or Near Field Communication is the ability to transfer data by establishing a radio communication with two devices by tapping them together. No batteries, no cords, no fuss! 
The NFC Chip we use is made of high quality plastic. It is a high capacity, high range chip, that allows transfer even by tapping through your jeans. No need to take your ASSET out of your pocket. 
High Quality Plastic NFC Chip


What's better than 1 NFC chip? 2 NFC chips!

Program each chip with personal or business information you wish to share. For example, program one side to launch your LinkedIn profile, and the other to share your personal contact. 


Our PartnerBy partnering with TRIGGER, one of the most popular NFC programming apps available, the ASSET Wallet capabilities are endless. Their app gives you the ability to open your favorite applications, or even create a group of functions. 


For example, simply program your chip to turn on your Bluetooth, turn off Wifi, and open Pandora. Now when you enter your car, simply tap your NFC enabled phone on ASSET and go! The uses are infinite and best of all... it can be tailored to your life. 
From Idea to LifeIt's always a rare opportunity that an idea can turn into a reality. Throughout our adventure, we have reworked and redesigned multiple times before we finally found our ideal design. 


Will NFC work with your phone?
The ASSET Wallet works with Android, Windows, and Blackberry phones with NFC capabilities. Current iPhones do not support NFC but can work with NFC enabled adapters and cases. Though the iPhone 6 and 6+ do have NFC, Apple has locked it down to be used for only Apple Pay.
To find out if your device is compatible, check out the list of NFC phones and tablets

RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) Security
Worried about RFID thieves? Don’t be. The Asset completely blocks RFID signals. Safe, stylish and simple! Radio Frequency Identity Theft is a form of identity theft using wireless machine to receive your credit card information in close proximity. With the Asset's aluminum plates, the frequency is completely blocked and you are safe from RFID thieves.


Come join us to bring Asset to full production!Your pledge will go towards materials, manufacturing, assembly, and shipping on a large scale. If the goal is met and barring any setbacks, everyone who loves technology and simplicity will have an ASSET!

<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>About This Project</strong></p>
<p>Many of you have watched and supported me
as I have devoted my life toward a profession as an independent designer. Those
years of work have built up to now – creating my debut collection and launching
my career. I have previously dedicated much of my time to the many aspects of
building and running a successful business in this field. Meanwhile I have been
designing and sewing one piece at a time, purchasing two yards of fabric, one
zipper, one spool of thread at a time. Most of my pieces were available in one
size only. This project will allow me to create a complete collection, produce
size runs and provide a full inventory available for sale, and to restock as
items sell. Where I previously had a handful of pieces for sale, I will now
have a collection that I am proud to stand behind.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1311872/files/20150320183228-pepperwindow.jpg?1426901548"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>Since my mother taught me to sew as a
child, it has been my one passion. I love the tactile experience of fabric,
needle and thread. I love the mechanics of patterning. I love the creativity of
design. I love the absolutely limitless exploration before me that fabric
provides as a medium to the utilitarian art form of clothing – art that you
wear and use, art that expresses your soul and uplifts your spirit. I love the
concept of walking poetry.</p>
<p>Having my own business allows me to be both
creative and to exercise the skills I have spent so long learning. It allows me
the freedom to express myself with this art form and also to create a balance
of work and life wherein I spend my days loving what my hands are doing; where
I know my purpose in the world. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong>About PostScript</strong></p>
<p>PostScript is about intrinsic value. It’s
about things that are cherished. I named my clothing line PostScript because of
the reminiscence that is conjured when you think of a handwritten letter to a
loved one. I create each of my pieces as something to be cherished. </p>
<p>It is also about the beauty of women. I
don’t ascribe to that stereotype that women must look a certain way to be
beautiful, as is commonly found in the fashion industry. You are beautiful as
you are because you are a woman, and our diversity is our strength. I do not
create clothing to make women beautiful – but rather to adorn their given
beauty, to enrich their confidence in that. Because every woman deserves to
walk proud. My hope is that in my clothing you feel as beautiful as you deserve
to. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Until Now…</strong></p>
<p>I have, with much help from my business
coach Jenny MacLeod, created many designs, built my sewing studio, gained
experience in both tailoring custom garments for women and learning to develop
my off-the-rack garments to fit a variety of women. I have learned the
legalities and technicalities of owning a business, developed habits of
time-management when working from home, built my website PostScriptApparel.com,
sold at farmers markets, and been privileged to have my work sold at Sassafras
boutique. </p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Why I Need Your Help</strong></p>
<p>The final step to launching my career is to
create this, my debut collection. With the solid inventory that this provides I
will be able to carry my work to a bigger audience, and to take advantage of
the opportunities that I am blessed to have already knocking at my door to sell
my work. </p>
<p>The bare minimum I need to produce this
collection is $6900 (Which will be 6400 after Indiegogo fees). This will mostly go to
materials, and will also compensate me for the time I take off my café job to
work on this, pay for a part-time employee to assist me, and cover the costs of
a look book of this collection to send to you, my supporters, so that you can
see the fruits of your contributions. </p>
<p>If I reach $10,800 (10,000 after fees) I
will have more freedom with my materials, my time, and more time with my
employee. </p>
<p>And if I get as far as $12,900 (12,000
after fees) I will have a runway show to premier this collection. To have my
first runway show of my first collection would be an absolute dream.</p>
<p>The collection will be finished and
available for sale this June. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>What Will This Collection Look Like?</strong></p>
<p>My inspiration for this work is the balance
of structure and flow; architecture verses water. I have chosen a simple, clean
color palette in whitescale to better show the designs. The song Across the
Universe by the Beatles has been a common theme in my design process and the
beautiful imagery therein I hope to portray in this collection. I’ve been
thinking a lot about raw sensitivity, feeling your breath, and always, walking
poetry. I am using this opportunity to really explore and develop my design and
patterning abilities. </p>

<p><strong>How Will Helping Me Make a Difference?</strong> </p>
<p>I am here because I have followed in the
footsteps of bold adventurers before me – and I want to exemplify to my peers
that they too can be successful in their craft, and to take every opportunity I
can to support them along the way; to continue with the trunk shows that I with
my sister Carmel have been hosting to give artists in our neighborhood a leg up
in showing and selling their work, to share my knowledge with interns as I was
blessed to learn in my internship, and as my business grows to provide jobs for
others going down this path. This is not a solo enterprise; this is one piece
of a community, of a movement. </p>

<p>As the poet Ranier Maria Rilke advised an
aspiring poet:</p>
<p>“There is only one thing you should do. Go
into yourself. Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it
has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart<i>; confess to yourself whether you would have to die if you were
forbidden to</i> <i>write</i>. This most of
all: ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: must I write? Dig into
yourself for a deep answer. And if this answer rings out in assent, if you meet
this solemn question with a strong, simple ""I must"", then build your
life in accordance with this necessity; your whole life, even into its humblest
and most indifferent hour, must become a sign and witness to this impulse.”</p>
<p>I would have to die if I could not do this. If I couldn’t do
it for a living I would do it in all my spare time. If I won the lottery I
would spend all my time doing this. It is my skill and my craft, my heart and
my soul, and with your help I can take the final step toward making it my
livelihood. </p>
<p>I could not have made it this far without the support I’ve
received all along the way from dozens in my community and family. Thank you
with all my heart, for it is each one of you who has made all the difference. </p>

<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">
<p>Worthy Village builds pathways out of poverty for women and
children in Guatemala by providing economic opportunity, healthcare, and
education. To accomplish this mission, we have established partnerships with
more than 50 skilled women artisans living in the impoverished villages
surrounding Lake Atitlan. Our artisan partners sell their wares to tourists, but profits are not sufficient
enough to pay for basic needs. <b>That's where we come in. </b></p>
</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1328673/files/20150326104558-Guatemala_31.jpg?1427391958"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>We are guided by the belief that our artisan partners know best what they need to help change their circumstances for the better. Over the past three years, our team has made half a dozen trips to Guatemala to meet with these women, hear their stories, and gain a better understanding of how we can best impact their lives. Fair wages, access to basic healthcare, and income to support their children's education are among their highest priorities.</p></span></div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Need</h3> <p>Despite years of chronic instability and civic strife, Guatemala is a place of fiercely resourceful people who honor traditions, welcome visitors, and speak candidly about their lives. Sadly, women are among the most marginalized communities here. Unleashing their economic potential is central to growing their voice, improving their lives, and ultimately, strengthening their communities. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1328829/files/20150326111349-622A3079.jpg?1427393629"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In a country where ten dollars feeds 40 people, our impact has the potential to be huge, but only if it's sustainable.  <b>That's where you come in.</b> </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Your Gift Will Do</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Earlier this year, with seed funding from some generous
individuals, we were able to commission a collection of scarves and handbags and pay our artisan partners a fair wage for their work. Our next step is to establish
an online marketplace for this collection. Profits will enable us to continue purchasing products, thus providing our artisan partners with a stable source of income. Surplus profits will go towards supporting two key initiatives: healthcare and education. </p>
<p></p>With your help we will accomplish the following within the next year:</div><div><br/></div><div>
<ul>
<li><p>Develop a sophisticated website and online marketplace for selling Worthy Village products. </p></li>
<li><p>Lead at least three organized trips to Guatemala with physicians, teachers, and student volunteers.</p></li>
<li><p>Broaden our Healthcare Initiative to reach 1,000 individuals with basic healthcare education in first aid, hand washing, CPR, oral hygiene, safe sex practices, nutrition and exercise (healthy living).</p></li>
<li><p>Launch an after school program that provides students with tutoring, English language instruction, homework help, and extracurricular activities.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a home base office in Panajachel so that our team can work more closely and consistently with the people we serve. </p></li>
</ul>
<div>As a young organization, Worthy Village is spearheaded by two unpaid Directors, one of whom was born and still has family in Guatemala. The rest of our staff, two of whom live in Guatemala, is comprised of committed volunteers with professional backgrounds in fundraising, strategic planning, healthcare, international relations, and business development. </div>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1328895/files/20150326113412-622A3272.jpg?1427394852"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We are at an exciting place in our evolution as an organization and are focused on ensuring our
own sustainability so that we can make the greatest impact possible. The proceeds from this campaign will help kickstart those efforts.</p>
<p>Finally, we have worked hard to establish a community of trust with our artisan partners, who firmly believe that our efforts will substantially improve their lives.  <b>We refuse to let them down.</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<div>The postcard and pictures below are from our most recent trip to Guatemala! <span style=""background-color: initial;"">The scarves and handbags are all handmade by our artisan partners using traditional techniques passed down from generations of women. When you make your donation, you'll be given a series of prints and colors from which to choose. </span>

Worthy Village builds pathways out of poverty for women and
children in Guatemala by providing economic opportunity, healthcare, and
education. To accomplish this mission, we have established partnerships with
more than 50 skilled women artisans living in the impoverished villages
surrounding Lake Atitlan. Our artisan partners sell their wares to tourists, but profits are not sufficient
enough to pay for basic needs. That's where we come in. 



We are guided by the belief that our artisan partners know best what they need to help change their circumstances for the better. Over the past three years, our team has made half a dozen trips to Guatemala to meet with these women, hear their stories, and gain a better understanding of how we can best impact their lives. Fair wages, access to basic healthcare, and income to support their children's education are among their highest priorities.

    The Need Despite years of chronic instability and civic strife, Guatemala is a place of fiercely resourceful people who honor traditions, welcome visitors, and speak candidly about their lives. Sadly, women are among the most marginalized communities here. Unleashing their economic potential is central to growing their voice, improving their lives, and ultimately, strengthening their communities. 


In a country where ten dollars feeds 40 people, our impact has the potential to be huge, but only if it's sustainable.  That's where you come in. 

What Your Gift Will Do


Earlier this year, with seed funding from some generous
individuals, we were able to commission a collection of scarves and handbags and pay our artisan partners a fair wage for their work. Our next step is to establish
an online marketplace for this collection. Profits will enable us to continue purchasing products, thus providing our artisan partners with a stable source of income. Surplus profits will go towards supporting two key initiatives: healthcare and education. 
With your help we will accomplish the following within the next year:

Develop a sophisticated website and online marketplace for selling Worthy Village products. 
Lead at least three organized trips to Guatemala with physicians, teachers, and student volunteers.
Broaden our Healthcare Initiative to reach 1,000 individuals with basic healthcare education in first aid, hand washing, CPR, oral hygiene, safe sex practices, nutrition and exercise (healthy living).
Launch an after school program that provides students with tutoring, English language instruction, homework help, and extracurricular activities.
Establish a home base office in Panajachel so that our team can work more closely and consistently with the people we serve. 

As a young organization, Worthy Village is spearheaded by two unpaid Directors, one of whom was born and still has family in Guatemala. The rest of our staff, two of whom live in Guatemala, is comprised of committed volunteers with professional backgrounds in fundraising, strategic planning, healthcare, international relations, and business development. 




We are at an exciting place in our evolution as an organization and are focused on ensuring our
own sustainability so that we can make the greatest impact possible. The proceeds from this campaign will help kickstart those efforts.
Finally, we have worked hard to establish a community of trust with our artisan partners, who firmly believe that our efforts will substantially improve their lives.  We refuse to let them down.

The Perks
The postcard and pictures below are from our most recent trip to Guatemala! The scarves and handbags are all handmade by our artisan partners using traditional techniques passed down from generations of women. When you make your donation, you'll be given a series of prints and colors from which to choose.

From one store to the next, many of the styles seem exactly the same. TucciPolo is very different. Each one of our creations was made with innovation in mind. Our goal is to stand out from the crowd and provide you with a high-quality, unique shoe that you cannot find anywhere else.</p><p>The Message</p><p>Do you have any idea how much a great shoe means when it comes to conveying a message to the public? Wearing any of our selection of shoes will help you stand out and tell the world that you deserve the finer things in life and you are not going to rest until you get them. Not only is this a remarkable personal motto, but it mirrors the message we convey to everyone who shop from us.</p><p>Quality</p><p>These days, it is easy to walk into any store and find shoes that were made by a machine. It is far more difficult to unearth shoes that are well made and crafted by hand. Every stitch it takes to make one of our shoes is perfect; from the first to the last. When you spend your money, it is important that the price reflects the quality of the item you are about to receive. These are expensive shoes and they are worth every cent.</p><p>Another thing that you are usually unclear on when buying shoes is how long they have sat around waiting for a new owner. Materials like suede and leather start to wear down over time. This is never a concern when shopping from us. Every pair of shoes is made to order. This does mean that you will need to order at least two weeks in advance of your event to ensure a prompt delivery, but you will know that they were not collecting dust before you decided to make a purchase.</p><p>Customization</p><p>If you come across any of our shoe and it is not exactly as you would like, you can get in touch with us to discuss making changes. We truly care about the satisfaction of each and every customer, so can go the extra mile. Every time you shop from us, you can customize a creation that will make your items like no other. Not only will you be the best dressed in your social circle, but you will have items that no one else does.</p><p>Accessories</p><p>Do you need a fashionable belt to go with the customized shoes you just ordered? Does your beau need a matching wallet or card holder to make his ensemble complete? Everything you need is at your fingertips at TucciPolo. There will not be any reason to scramble about trying to find what you need at different places; TucciPolo is your final stop.</p><p>Returns</p><p>You have probably encountered this issue in the past. There are some luxury shoe stores that will not allow returns, even if the items have not been worn. This is no way to treat someone who commands the finer things in life. If you receive the shoes you ordered and they are not to your liking, you can feel free to return them for a refund or exchange. Just because you have money, that does not mean that you should be forced to waste it on unwanted items.<br/>Our promise is that you you will certainly not be disappointed shopping from us.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509070016/t7o2wi8uzpcccgbkifj2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>1.

If applicable, duties and local taxes will be charged by the appropriate authority at the destination country. Please determine these charges locally.All orders both domestic and international will ship from our US facility.InnovationOne thing you may have noticed when buying shoes is the lack of variety. From one store to the next, many of the styles seem exactly the same. TucciPolo is very different. Each one of our creations was made with innovation in mind. Our goal is to stand out from the crowd and provide you with a high-quality, unique shoe that you cannot find anywhere else.The MessageDo you have any idea how much a great shoe means when it comes to conveying a message to the public? Wearing any of our selection of shoes will help you stand out and tell the world that you deserve the finer things in life and you are not going to rest until you get them. Not only is this a remarkable personal motto, but it mirrors the message we convey to everyone who shop from us.QualityThese days, it is easy to walk into any store and find shoes that were made by a machine. It is far more difficult to unearth shoes that are well made and crafted by hand. Every stitch it takes to make one of our shoes is perfect; from the first to the last. When you spend your money, it is important that the price reflects the quality of the item you are about to receive. These are expensive shoes and they are worth every cent.Another thing that you are usually unclear on when buying shoes is how long they have sat around waiting for a new owner. Materials like suede and leather start to wear down over time. This is never a concern when shopping from us. Every pair of shoes is made to order. This does mean that you will need to order at least two weeks in advance of your event to ensure a prompt delivery, but you will know that they were not collecting dust before you decided to make a purchase.CustomizationIf you come across any of our shoe and it is not exactly as you would like, you can get in touch with us to discuss making changes. We truly care about the satisfaction of each and every customer, so can go the extra mile. Every time you shop from us, you can customize a creation that will make your items like no other. Not only will you be the best dressed in your social circle, but you will have items that no one else does.AccessoriesDo you need a fashionable belt to go with the customized shoes you just ordered? Does your beau need a matching wallet or card holder to make his ensemble complete? Everything you need is at your fingertips at TucciPolo. There will not be any reason to scramble about trying to find what you need at different places; TucciPolo is your final stop.ReturnsYou have probably encountered this issue in the past. There are some luxury shoe stores that will not allow returns, even if the items have not been worn. This is no way to treat someone who commands the finer things in life. If you receive the shoes you ordered and they are not to your liking, you can feel free to return them for a refund or exchange. Just because you have money, that does not mean that you should be forced to waste it on unwanted items.Our promise is that you you will certainly not be disappointed shopping from us.1. Back us!

The earlier we receive back the survey the faster all products are sent to production.What happens if the project gets pushed back past the delivery date?With crowdfunding we are expected to deliver a product that can otherwise take months to deliver. While we will do our best to deliver on the estimated time frame, we also want to make sure we produce a quality product that you are extremely satisfied with. However, if any set back arise that could delay production, we will always be transparent and keep you all up to date.Trouble making a payment?We're sorry to hear that! If you're having trouble making a payment, please reach out to IndieGoGo's Customer Happiness Team at support@indiegogo.com.

<h3>This is Our ""Why""</h3>
<p><strong>A Glimpse Into Michelle:</strong></p>
<p>Hi! I’m Michelle! I was born and raised in the ‘burbs of the Nation’s Capital (in Maryland, not Virginia). I was raised to work hard, get good grades, go to college, and work. I eventually I found my way off to law school, and I currently work for the Government (as many in this area do). In this unreasonably expensive area, I’ve become accustomed to living paycheck to paycheck and sucking up the Monday blues EVERY.DAMN.WEEK just to get by.</p>
<p>In December of 2015, I gave birth to my son. From the day I first laid eyes on my son, I knew I had to be happy for him and for me. Shortly after giving birth, I was plagued with severe post-partum depression. My day job, which was not fulfilling in the least, did not help my situation. I needed to reinvent my world. I needed to spend more time with my son. I needed to do something that made me happy. So, with a little encouragement from my bestie, I started selling clothing through a popular direct sales brand. I found that I became addicted to matching outfits, taking pictures, and being creative again (as law school has a tendency to take any creativity away from you), while helping other women find their beauty through clothes. However, I want a little bit more. I want to be able to live and work by my own rules, and create my own world of clothes and fashion. I want FREEDOM!</p>
<p>This is what has led me to co-founding Up-Rising Clothing, LLC. I am happy working with my best friend, being creative, designing and playing with clothes, helping others feel beautiful in their own skin, being able to live and work by my own rules, and spending more time with my son and husband, while helping amazing artists advertise their creations through the world’s most popular commodity – clothing.</p>
<p><strong>A Glimpse Into Amanda:</strong></p>
<p>Do you ever find your mind wandering off and wondering ""is this as good as it gets?"" At 31, I find myself sitting at a desk job (don't get me wrong it pays the bills) day in and day out and feel myself withering away.  I worked hard to get to where I am, but now that I am here the challenge is gone. The fire inside my heart has dwindled to an invisible flame. I'm sure there are many who can relate to the 9-5, checking in on that time clock and counting down the minutes until you're able to check out. This isn't the way life is supposed to be!! </p>
<p>For as long as I can remember, I've been a dreamer; and for the same amount of time I have been on the constant pursuit of happiness. Aren't we all?? By having this state of mind, I've taken many risks, some offering rewards and some offering up the greatest life lessons. The interesting part now, is you ALL get to experience and follow along on this journey, this risk, that Michelle and me are embarking upon. Neither one of us have degrees in business, we definitely aren't rich, but we are determined. There is no option for failure; we came to succeed. We're just two average gals, who love art and believe in the constant pursuit of happiness .</p>
<p>We have started on this journey in the hopes of making our own lives better – to live out our dreams – but also to help artists live out their dreams and for our customers to feel beautiful in amazing clothing! I hope that you will all join us on our journey through self-exploration, self-love, and happiness! So join us, this is the beginning of our UP-RISING!</p>

To make you feel empowered, inspired, confident and comfortable on and off your yoga mat and giving you the extra push we sometimes need in life to accomplish our dreams.4. Designed & Tested with CareEach pair of PI Yoga Pants is designed with care. Inch by inch we are perfecting them to fit just the way they are supposed to and we test them out in the wild before even thinking of releasing them on our website (in hot humid Bali streets, during long airplane rides, at various yoga classes, etc). We tested Pi Yoga Pants on over 100 women of all different ages and sizes to design them true to size. Take a look at our size chart here. We are also happy to provide online fit consultations to make sure you pick your perfect size and style. Our MissionPI is a boutique line of yoga, travel & lounge wear designed in California and ethically handmade with love from the tropical shores of Bali. They’re so comfortable, you will never want to take them off!By purchasing PI, you are supporting our mission to:1. Empower women & men of all body types and shapes to feel confident on and off their yoga mat with form flattering and comfortable clothes. Did you know the average American woman is a size 16? Though most yoga clothing companies only offer pants up to a size 12...PI is inclusive of different body types. Our body is not just about a size. We come in all shapes, too! The way PI Yoga Pants are built really accommodates all body types. We are bringing our mission to life with a wide variety of sizes including petite, tall, regular, large, and now plus size which fits size 18-24! 2.

We work hand in hand with organizations that are actively helping to protect our oceans. See more about our efforts HERE.Our StoryPI was created when a young California yoga enthusiast quit her job to travel the world for a year. Her name is Larissa Miller. She felt spiritually connected with the culture in Bali and was devastated to see so much of the coral reef destroyed. Today, her dream to make a positive impact became a reality. PI donates 10% of net profits to sea turtle conservation. Traditionally sea turtles are the symbol for inner empowerment.Why the name PI?  There are few things on this earth that have universal meaning. The curious nature of the magical mystery number Pi is something that goes beyond mathematics and is universally recognized. Pi symbolizes infinity and living proof that something can continue on infinitely.The symbolism of the sea turtles and the mystery number align with the mission of the brand to empower and inspire women and men of all shapes and sizes to continue infinitely in the direction of your dreams.Larissa Miller, founder of PI Customer FeedbackOur pants have been put through the test of daily life since May, 2016.

<p>Hello my name is Paula Callejas and this is my story :)</p>
<p>When you first step out onto that sandy beach, take it all in. Breathe in a deep breath, look out at the waves, and realize just how lucky you are.

<p>If you want to make the most of your day at the beach – or anywhere else – you need to look your best. Fashion can go a long way toward that end, but it is up to you to accept it. At Paula Callejas swimwear, we specialize in luxury swimwear. Drawing influence from a variety of sources, we produce top-quality pieces for women who can tell the difference. In all our products. We are using a fabric called power mesh in order to reduce the appearance of the waistline.</p>

<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>We have come to you, Indiegogo, for help raising $25000. This start-up capital will cover the costs of manufacturing, marketing, and distributing the initial run of Paula Callejas swimwear products. As a thank-you, we plan on sending out samples of our clothing to all our contributors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>For any new fashion company, the most daunting challenge is locating and connecting with an audience. Our plan is to do our best to produce attractive, luxury swimwear that speaks directly to a specific group of people.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Meet the Jevelo Coin</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496309077/oowo3avkolzncpkcdcha.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My name is Kristian Saarikorpi, and I am a Master Goldsmith by profession. My family consists of my wife, Kirsti, who is a jewelry designer, and two lovely daughters, Aurora and Serafina. We live in Finland in a village called Fiskars, which is famous for, amongst other things, its orange-handled scissors.</p>
<p>I have worked in goldsmithery for over 25 years as a goldsmith, designer, and as an entrepreneur. I founded my own company, Saarikorpi Design Ltd, in 2000 after I graduated as a Master Goldsmith and felt that my job wasn’t providing me with sufficient professional challenges.</p>
<p>I have always been a little different than the average goldsmith. Right from the start it was clear to me that the combination of modern technology and expert handicrafts was my thing. This combination allows me to do things that I would have been unable to do before, and also, as a designer, I am able to inhabit a world where the only limitations are my own imagination. I have made jewelry using 3D printing and CNC techniques for over 17 years already, and my current Jevelo project relies heavily on my extensive experience in this area.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496398765/xsgkpl596nx5m1o9js12.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My entire career as a goldsmith is based on designing and making unique and bespoke jewelry for people. In my work, I have noticed how important and meaningful jewelry can be to people and how much they are willing to invest in that jewelry. Telling stories and expressing emotions via jewelry is important to people, but the techniques used in specialised goldsmithery often make this difficult and, unfortunately, expensive. Creating a unique and bespoke piece of jewelry usually involves the work of many people, which makes the process long, challenging, and expensive.</p>
<p>With this in mind, I began to consider: shouldn’t everyone have the right to have meaningful and unique jewelry made just for them, but somehow more easily and cheaply? Having a unique piece of jewelry made shouldn’t be solely for the richest of us. We all have the same need to express our feelings in the way that suits us best.</p>
<p>In my own jewelry designs, I have always disliked the idea that my jewelry would be valued simply according to the amount of gold or diamonds. I have always strived to imbue my jewelry with a deeper meaning, often by way of design, and thus make it more special and meaningful for the wearer.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496399298/bltt41wm7kymv4bqta9c.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>My mission in the Jevelo project is to give everyone the chance to design unique jewelry that is important to them, and to be able to buy it at mass-production prices.</p>
<p>The Jevelo concept is also an extremely ecological way to produce jewelry. Not a single piece of jewelry is made without reason, rather every piece that is produced has been ordered by someone. We use 100% recycled gold and 80% recycled silver.</p>
<p>We need funding in order to make the Jevelo brand well known. We have created a completely new business model within goldsmithery and therefore we do not have any direct competition because the Jevelo idea is absolutely unique. This is also a challenge for us! We cannot really be compared to other companies using the same type of business model, and therefore we have to work very hard to get people to believe in us and trust that what we say is actually true and also possible.</p>
<p>We also need money for product development so that we can offer our customers better and more innovative tools or creating jewelry.

</div></div>","Meet the Jevelo Coin
 

My name is Kristian Saarikorpi, and I am a Master Goldsmith by profession. My family consists of my wife, Kirsti, who is a jewelry designer, and two lovely daughters, Aurora and Serafina. We live in Finland in a village called Fiskars, which is famous for, amongst other things, its orange-handled scissors.
I have worked in goldsmithery for over 25 years as a goldsmith, designer, and as an entrepreneur. I founded my own company, Saarikorpi Design Ltd, in 2000 after I graduated as a Master Goldsmith and felt that my job wasn’t providing me with sufficient professional challenges.
I have always been a little different than the average goldsmith. Right from the start it was clear to me that the combination of modern technology and expert handicrafts was my thing. This combination allows me to do things that I would have been unable to do before, and also, as a designer, I am able to inhabit a world where the only limitations are my own imagination. I have made jewelry using 3D printing and CNC techniques for over 17 years already, and my current Jevelo project relies heavily on my extensive experience in this area.

My entire career as a goldsmith is based on designing and making unique and bespoke jewelry for people. In my work, I have noticed how important and meaningful jewelry can be to people and how much they are willing to invest in that jewelry. Telling stories and expressing emotions via jewelry is important to people, but the techniques used in specialised goldsmithery often make this difficult and, unfortunately, expensive. Creating a unique and bespoke piece of jewelry usually involves the work of many people, which makes the process long, challenging, and expensive.
With this in mind, I began to consider: shouldn’t everyone have the right to have meaningful and unique jewelry made just for them, but somehow more easily and cheaply? Having a unique piece of jewelry made shouldn’t be solely for the richest of us. We all have the same need to express our feelings in the way that suits us best.
In my own jewelry designs, I have always disliked the idea that my jewelry would be valued simply according to the amount of gold or diamonds. I have always strived to imbue my jewelry with a deeper meaning, often by way of design, and thus make it more special and meaningful for the wearer.

My mission in the Jevelo project is to give everyone the chance to design unique jewelry that is important to them, and to be able to buy it at mass-production prices.
The Jevelo concept is also an extremely ecological way to produce jewelry. Not a single piece of jewelry is made without reason, rather every piece that is produced has been ordered by someone. We use 100% recycled gold and 80% recycled silver.
We need funding in order to make the Jevelo brand well known. We have created a completely new business model within goldsmithery and therefore we do not have any direct competition because the Jevelo idea is absolutely unique. This is also a challenge for us! We cannot really be compared to other companies using the same type of business model, and therefore we have to work very hard to get people to believe in us and trust that what we say is actually true and also possible.
We also need money for product development so that we can offer our customers better and more innovative tools or creating jewelry. The tool for Jevelo Coin products is already at an advanced stage, and we will get it finished within the Indiegogo project timeframe so that we can start to deliver products very soon after the end of the project.
Jevelo jewelry is of high quality and competitively priced. We hope that you, as a satisfied customer, will pass on the message. We want as many people as possible to be able to fulfill their dreams with Jevelo.

“Jevelo Coin” is our new product. It’s a coin with the picture of your loved one, your own picture, or something completely different. Pretty cool idea, don’t you think? Both sides of the coin can be personalised; there is space in the centre for the picture which is circled with an area for text. After hearing about the idea, a friend of mine said that he would order a coin with his two greatest idols: on one side, Bob Marley, and on the other, Stephen Hawkings; the only limit is your imagination.
The coins come in steel, silver, gold and platinum. The dimensions of the coins are 25.70 x 2.00mm, but the gold and platinum coins will also be available in a smaller 17.00 x 1.30mm size.
The coins will be delivered as orders are received, and as production capacity is still limited at this stage, waiting times could stretch into next year. It’s worth ordering quickly.
Soon after the end of the project you will be sent a unique code for your coin and a link to the tool where you can design your own coin. The code is used during the purchase process to zero the sum in the shopping basket.
We are in an “in demand” mode, so if we don’t reach our goal, nothing in particular will happen. We will still deliver products to those who have ordered them, and we will simply receive a little less attention than what we set out to get: there is, therefore, virtually no risk.

As the decade drew to a close, the lion lost its voice and fell dormant, waiting for the day when it could return to prominence once more.<br/><br/>Fast forward nearly 100 years to a scene that unfolded in the heartland of Switzerland's watchmaking tradition. Three young watch enthusiasts happen to stumble upon an antique shop in the cobbled streets of Zurich and are instantly drawn to the LEJON in the shop window. Intrigued, they step inside. The watch is equally functional and simple – a refined timepiece with an edge. The lion on the dial commands an unmistakable presence. Hence, they could not leave the shop that day without it. <p></p>
<p>Released once again, the lion begins to stir. Fascinated by the watch's elegance and unique design, the three decide to delve deeper into its heritage. The three vow to revive the forgotten brand. Driven by their passion for timepieces, they set out to unite the brand's authentic heritage with a dynamic design that captures the zeitgeist of the era: “Impeccably classic but unmistakably contemporary”. The LEJON’s timeless strength is given a new lease of life. Hear the king of the urban jungle roar once again. LEJON - heritage reborn.</p>

Imagine wearing a watch with an authentic vintage style that evokes a rich history, but also features an unmistakably stylish and contemporary design. Imagine a dynamic new generation of watch enthusiasts discovering their own distinctive way of appreciating tradition – and looking towards a bright new future. Imagine LEJON.Our vision is to create a watch that is rich at history, features a timeless design, the highest quality and all that for an affordable price.The LEJON unleashed its roar for the first time during the Roaring Twenties, when it shook the very foundations of the brand's history. As the decade drew to a close, the lion lost its voice and fell dormant, waiting for the day when it could return to prominence once more.Fast forward nearly 100 years to a scene that unfolded in the heartland of Switzerland's watchmaking tradition. Three young watch enthusiasts happen to stumble upon an antique shop in the cobbled streets of Zurich and are instantly drawn to the LEJON in the shop window. Intrigued, they step inside. The watch is equally functional and simple – a refined timepiece with an edge. The lion on the dial commands an unmistakable presence. Hence, they could not leave the shop that day without it. 
Released once again, the lion begins to stir. Fascinated by the watch's elegance and unique design, the three decide to delve deeper into its heritage. The three vow to revive the forgotten brand. Driven by their passion for timepieces, they set out to unite the brand's authentic heritage with a dynamic design that captures the zeitgeist of the era: “Impeccably classic but unmistakably contemporary”. The LEJON’s timeless strength is given a new lease of life. Hear the king of the urban jungle roar once again. LEJON - heritage reborn.



Our new collection features 4 base unisex watch models, dedicated and named after our homebase's - Zurich, Switzerland - most famous and unique areas.
We didn't just want to celebrate LEJON's rich history - to us, it was also important to give the watch some modern key features - our amazing strap system allows you to play with your creativity, to fine-tune and adjust your watch to your styling and to build a watch that is right for a gala dinner, the office, a noble restaurant, your favourite Irish pub or perfect for the every day use.

[DISTRICT1]
Bahnhofstrasse - is Zurich's answer to New Yorks 5th Ave, Paris Champs Elysees or Londons Oxford Street. Sophisticated, metropolitan, timeless, powerful and as the watch - a fusion of yesterdays elegance with todays latest trends.



[DISTRICT2]
Enge - is very similar to Zurich's District  One - the biggest difference is that the time is turning slower, the streets are dominated by beautiful old stone buildings. District Two is noble, elegant, classy, timeless. 




[DISTRICT5]
Langstrasse -   known as Zurich's most famous nightlife street, the center of the redlight district and our company headquaters. It's dark, minimalistic, elegant, impulsive, beautiful, mysterious, wild, passionate and diverse.



[DISTRICT8]
SEEFELD -  located right next to the beautiful lake of Zurich. This area is all about the lake - water, sailing, swimming, sun , outdoor fun and enjoying the sundown. The watch is representing the importance of the lake to the people of Zurich. 




We are very proud to announce our strong partnership and involvement with DRAHTZUG (www.drahtzug.ch) - which is a beautiful integration program that allows 300 severe mental handicapped people to participate in the world of employment. Drahtzug is our official logistics and quality control partner.

We believe we’re very well placed to be a channel between exciting labels and people who want to buy from them (take a look at our <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/theglasspineapple/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> for the evidence). However, we recognise that every venture has risks and challenges. Perhaps the biggest challenge we face is ensuring that our website is fit to cope with demand and incorporates the new technology we are planning to use to make our buying experience better.

Agnes NordenholzWe also believe that there’s a place in fashion for promoting a kinder and more collaborative approach that embraces diversity, inclusivity and openness without any compromise on aesthetics and style. You don’t have to be a certain age, skin colour or size to wear innovative pieces and look amazing –  we think it’s time to stop telling people that you do.AraroseWhere will your money go?We’re looking to raise £45,000 - it's a pretty ambitious target (eek) but the reality is that there's a lot we can do with whatever we are able to raise.£0 - £5,000- expand the coverage we provide of emerging fashion talent, geographically and in terms of the numbers of designers we can reach and the volume of coverage we can provide via the website and social media.- invest in our own shoots, giving new designers exposure, creating images with a wider range of models of different body sizes (right now it's almost impossible to find images of 'normal' body sizes we can use) and using up and coming photographers.- start developing our website to make it a better showcase for emerging and independent fashion with features that make it easier for fashion lovers to discover new finds.£10,000 - £25,000- create regular editorial featuring unknown designers and more diverse models and getting it out into the world where it can start broadening perceptions.- work with a number of emerging designers, offering a fairer deal, helping them to overcome the obstacle of up-front production costs and giving them a platform through which to sell.- vastly grow our emerging fashion coverage and begin to make a difference to how new fashion is presented and the bodies it is presented on.- establish the foundations of a graduate competition that will give exposure to newly graduated fashion talent.£25,000 - £40,000- fully develop our online store to make buying more immersive and enjoyable, a way to discover new brands, make the right purchase and get inspired. This will include features such as integration of online changing room tech, video and images for every product and in-depth information to enable you to really engage with the brands.- fully stock our store with the collections of emerging designers and independent labels who would otherwise be hard to find and buy (images on this page are just a few of the brands we plan to work with).- fund the production of 1 x graduate collection per year.- become a comprehensive creator, generating fashion content that drives our message of more ethical and sustainable choices, promoting unkown names, body positivity, diversity and inclusivity - without compromise on aesthetics or style.£40,000 - £45,000- begin the development of our app, which will connect those who want to make a difference in fashion and help bring fresh talent into the industry and give people a chance.Iden DenimNew talent Katie Anne McGuigan shot by photographer Kerry Curl for us at Fashion Scout SS18What’s in it for you?Perks!

Clio PeppiattRisks and challengesOur store has been three years in the making. That’s three years of travelling to showrooms around the world, fashion weeks, designer studios and graduate shows and being exposed to a very wide range of emerging talent. We believe we’re very well placed to be a channel between exciting labels and people who want to buy from them (take a look at our Instagram for the evidence). However, we recognise that every venture has risks and challenges. Perhaps the biggest challenge we face is ensuring that our website is fit to cope with demand and incorporates the new technology we are planning to use to make our buying experience better. We also face the usual challenges of any clothing retailer in terms of ensuring supply and delivery at the right time and buying seasonally six months ahead. At The Glass Pineapple community is really important to us – so if you can't support us financially, don't worry, you're still welcome. If you want to help spread the word about our campaign to your friends and family then we value that hugely too.Coralie MarabelleThe brands in our videoThese are just a few of the fantastic designers and brands we've found in recent years.Iden Denim: great fitting jeans in premium denim fabrics that don't cost the earth.

Bosom Galore is a<b> UK manufactured</b> luxury lingerie brand that specialises in small band and large cup sizes from <a href=""https://bosomgalore.com/our-size-range/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">26E to 34H</a>.<br/><br/>We were <a href=""https:="" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">founded by Katy</a>, a fellow small band and large cupped women who longed for luxury lingerie. However, with a 28 band size, such lingerie didn't exist in her size; the luxury lingerie industry doesn't cater for <i>this size range.<br/><br/>""Of the few brands that offer small band and large cup sizes, their styles are frumpy or garish and composed of cheap fabrics that are coarse against the skin. I wanted something that is elegant, sophisticated and comfortable to wear""</i><br/><br/>
<p align=""center""></p><p align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1365069/files/20150408011221-Untitled-3.png?1428480741"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/></p>
<p>With
a background working in mental health, Katy approached her designs from a customer's perspective, creating what she wanted from her lingerie.<br/></p>
<p>For the past 4 years we have worked meticulously to develop two high quality lingerie designs; our <a href=""https://bosomgalore.com/product/amelia-bra-antique-pink/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amelia</a> and <a href=""https://bosomgalore.com/product/classique-bra-red/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Classique</a>. Composed of premium fabrics these items
provide a whole new level of comfort…</p>
<p><b><i>“Before Bosom Galore, I didn't know what high quality luxury lingerie
 felt like. I didn't know what I was missing. Now, for the first time 
in my life I can enjoy the
experience of luxury and I
could never go back! I am 100% converted…I’ve learned that
it’s an investment in my comfort, happiness and self-esteem""</i></b><br/></p>

<br/>We saved, borrowed and begged to fund the development and manufacture of our first Bosom Galore lingerie collection, consisting of her <a href=""https://bosomgalore.com/product/classique-bra-red/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Classique in red</a> and <a href=""https://bosomgalore.com/product/amelia-bra-antique-pink/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amelia in antique pink</a>, now available to buy via our <a href=""https://bosomgalore.com/shop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">online shop</a>. <br/><p></p>

<br/><b>We all deserve to experience luxury</b><br/><p>We believe that luxury lingerie has the power to boost 
confidence and mood by offering beautiful fit, shape and comfort, and we feel that women of all shapes and sizes should have access to this experience. <br/></p><p>We are starting with small band and large cup sizes with the aim to expand our size range to provide luxury for all sizes currently neglected by the lingerie industry.<br/></p>
<p><b>Education</b><br/>Lingerie satisfaction relies on sufficient support and comfort 
which is established through understanding how a bra should fit, and in 
particular, wearing a tight enough band. With our continually updated guidance and articles on our website, from our simple <a href=""https://bosomgalore.com/the-perfect-fit/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fitting guide</a> to our <a href=""https://bosomgalore.com/bra-size-calculator"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bra size estimator</a>, we aim to help women gain the very best from their lingerie.</p><p></p>

<p><br/>We feel that it is important to support the UK manufacturing industry; the jobs it creates and the communities it supports. <br/></p>
<p>We are therefore very proud that all of our Bosom Galore lingerie is <a href=""https://bosomgalore.com/uk-manufacture/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">manufactured in the UK</a>. <br/></p>

However, with a 28 band size, such lingerie didn't exist in her size; the luxury lingerie industry doesn't cater for this size range.""Of the few brands that offer small band and large cup sizes, their styles are frumpy or garish and composed of cheap fabrics that are coarse against the skin. I wanted something that is elegant, sophisticated and comfortable to wear""

With
a background working in mental health, Katy approached her designs from a customer's perspective, creating what she wanted from her lingerie.
For the past 4 years we have worked meticulously to develop two high quality lingerie designs; our Amelia and Classique. Composed of premium fabrics these items
provide a whole new level of comfort…
“Before Bosom Galore, I didn't know what high quality luxury lingerie
 felt like. I didn't know what I was missing. Now, for the first time 
in my life I can enjoy the
experience of luxury and I
could never go back! I am 100% converted…I’ve learned that
it’s an investment in my comfort, happiness and self-esteem""



We saved, borrowed and begged to fund the development and manufacture of our first Bosom Galore lingerie collection, consisting of her Classique in red and Amelia in antique pink, now available to buy via our online shop. 



We all deserve to experience luxuryWe believe that luxury lingerie has the power to boost 
confidence and mood by offering beautiful fit, shape and comfort, and we feel that women of all shapes and sizes should have access to this experience. We are starting with small band and large cup sizes with the aim to expand our size range to provide luxury for all sizes currently neglected by the lingerie industry.
EducationLingerie satisfaction relies on sufficient support and comfort 
which is established through understanding how a bra should fit, and in 
particular, wearing a tight enough band. With our continually updated guidance and articles on our website, from our simple fitting guide to our bra size estimator, we aim to help women gain the very best from their lingerie.


We feel that it is important to support the UK manufacturing industry; the jobs it creates and the communities it supports. 
We are therefore very proud that all of our Bosom Galore lingerie is manufactured in the UK. 
Please see below a sneak peak behind the scenes of our UK manufacture.



Our aim is to provide women with a glorious array of beautiful lingerie in a variety of styles, colours and sizes. Our long term plans are to provide maternity, mastectomy. swimwear and supportive nightwear in addition to dramatically expanding our size range.The first step towards achieving these goals is producing our summer collection.

Our summer collection consists of our Classique in striking teal silk and black lace and our brand new black Louise harness style. 


The product development and manufacture of our launch has exhausted all of our available funds. We therefore need your help to manufacture our summer collection. Please help us in our  mission to provide gorgeous lingerie in a wide range of sizes and styles that has the power to elevate comfort and raise self-esteem.
 


Your support will enable us to buy the components and manufacture of our summer collection.
Our components will cost £1,600: 

40 metres of rather expensive silk
40 metres of our black Louise fabric

300 metres of high quality soft lace

1,000 meters of various elastics (all in different widths)

600 bows
600 hook and eyes
200 meters of wire casing
250 pairs of wires
500 rings and slides
And a few other little bits and bobs that go into lingerie e.g. foam, mesh etc.


UK manufacture will cost £7,500

232 bras
120 knickers
120 shorts
120 thongs

Indiegogo's fee of £900:
The remaining £900 will be reserved for Indigogo's 9% fee.




By pre-ordering our stunning summer Classique in Teal or our gift vouchers at reduced 
prices you will be supporting not only the UK textiles industry but our 
pursuit to provide all women with quality lingerie.Please take note of our size range.

We understand that not everyone is in a position to offer financial support. However, if you would like to support our business and ethos please help us by spreading the word of our brand and funding campaign via word of mouth, social media and any other means that you can think of. Please help us to reach women who would genuinely benefit from our lingerie.We would like to take this opportunity to raise awareness of the following organisations that are very close to our hearts.

CoppaFeel! is a breast cancer awareness charity set up 
by Kristin Hallenga in 2009. At 22 Kristin was told she was “too young 
to get breast cancer”. This meant that her cancer was diagnosed late and
 could only be treated, never cured.

<h3><strong>We face two major challenges:  </strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p><i>1.  Cost of shipping and handling</i></p>
<p>Currently, we do not have the most efficient model to ship directly from printing, which drives up costs and shipping time.  We want to get our prices as low as possible and customers' products to them as quickly as possible!  </p>
<p><i>2.  Obtaining wholesale maternity clothes.  </i></p>
<p>The maternity active wear niche is currently dominated by one or two primary players, so it's very difficult to find the right maternity shirt.  Thus, we either need to create our own garments or purchase in VERY large bulk from a specialized manufacturer.  This is a foreseeable future as our company grows.</p>
<div><h3> </h3></div>
</div></div>","At one point all pregnant women experience that awkward pregnancy stage where people aren’t quite sure if you went overboard on donut Wednesdays at the office.  That’s what inspired our brand.   ""It's all baby"" serves both moms and moms-to-be with active wear and tees that are perfect for being out and about, going to the gym, or lounging on the couch eating hot wings and pickles (or in my case cheese and mayo sandwiches).  
We initially catered to maternity, however we've expanded to include both expectant and non-expectant mothers to better serve our audience.

Right now our selection is small, but like that baby bump we have room to grow!  We currently need backings for a small inventory.  Our ultimate goal is to expand the maternity portion of our line. To start, your backings can help out with:

 Note: Any funds beyond our target will go back into the business and toward expansion.  
Maternity shirts
Comfortable, breathable, and stretchy with side-rouching


 
    
Tanks and Tees
Perfect for non-expectant moms and early pregnancy

<p><strong>Did you know?</strong></p>
<p>Over 70% of earth’s surface is covered by water, but 97% of this water is in our oceans.  Only  1% of earth’s water is readily fresh and attainable. Each WaterSply bracelet contains a drop of ocean water in the central blue bead featuring our logo, to raise awareness of this extreme imbalance. Furthermore, 10% of our global population doesn't have access to clean water.  That's over 700 million people who are suffering day in and day out without access to our most basic need!  Even worse, a child dies every 90 seconds due to a water related illness.   </p>
<p><strong>Our Story:</strong></p>
<p>In 2009, co-founder and CEO of WaterSply, Jon Berry’s determination to start a social venture was sparked after hearing a lecture from the Founder and CEO of Charity: Water, Scott Harrison. Berry became aware of the ongoing water crisis that affects more than 700 million people around the globe.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t quite wrap my head around the idea that so many people could not obtain their most essential need: Water. There I was, complaining about what my mom was making for dinner, while hundreds of millions of people continue to suffer from the inability to obtain clean water,” Berry says.</p>
<p>Our goal is to unite people across the globe with our stylish, ocean-water filled bracelets to create a sense of togetherness that can overcome this worldwide crisis.  Every product that we come out with will be created with the same goal.  To put an end to our earth’s water crisis we call upon you! It will take recognition and action from millions of people around the world, and it starts here. </p>

Last year, the magic moment happened – several hundred backers across the world and platforms supported our first campaign, giving Gnomon a boost in life and engendering the history of a new brand in independent watchmaking – a one-hander inspired by the real sundial of ancient times.   The most important thing we learned in the process of this fascinating journey is that dreams can come true! And yet, as long as there are people in the world who appreciate our efforts and share our vision, the desire to create will never disappear. You have given us a chance; now we are offering you a new watch that will diversify your collection and, we hope, will be remembered by each of you for a long time!   

 
Please meet our freshest creation and the ultimate manifestation of a Solar Lab watch — the single-hand automatic Umbra timepieces. We traversed the whole school of creating watches – gathering like-minded people willing to put faith in us, sending the first Gnomons to their first owners, receiving a lot of positive feedback and gratitude, studying all the stages of production, and gaining new important experience. Now we are ready for more! :) There are no better endorsers of our watches than satisfied supporters, who received our first Gnomons and shared their positive feedback with us. Feedback from the first campaignBut enough beating around the bush. It's better see it with your own eyes! If you're intrigued, let's proceed!  ""Umbra"" means ""shadow"" in Latin and is a direct reference to the inspirational sources we drew upon. It connects the idea of shadow play on ancient sundials to contemporary technologies and an up-to-date wristwatch format.SILVER UMBRA WATCH Imagining a new look for our follow-up collection, we wanted to make the new watch look the way it might be found in the exhibition halls of ancient times or at historical dig sites as contemporaries of antediluvian people. We closed our eyes and simply tried to imagine how your regular patrician would look in our watches. And here's the result!  The initial line-up for the Umbra series consists of three models — Silver, Black, and Rose Gold. We chose these color combinations as a nod to materials used in artisanal crafts and sculptures in Ancient times, including marble, granite, copper, and alabaster.BLACK UMBRA WATCH Alabaster and marble were source materials for making statues and sculptures during the most ancient of times. Copper is considered to be the first metal used in artisanal work and in creative endeavors of people from the distant past. The pitch blackness of granite stone was used to decorate and build with style and power, and this is also reflected in the Umbra color way range.The renewed design refers to a layout of a common ancient sundial. The time disc is only partly visible, since sundials are “functional” only from dawn till dusk, and the design refers to this part of the day. Working on the watch, we studied a lot of images and notes of the well-know historical examples of sundials of the past and found new sources of inspiration for our watches, thanks to ancient designers from civilizations across the world :) In the Umbra look you can find references to such sundials as created by Anaximander of Miletus, the sundial of the Valley of the Kings, designs suggested by Aristarchus of Samos and even the relic Chinese sundials from Han and Zhou dynasties’ epochs.ROSE GOLD UMBRA WATCH  Now that we've finished with the introductions, why not learn more about the concept behind Umbra?Our first series of watches was based on the simple but very charming and entertaining idea of embodying an ancient sundial in a wristwatch-shaped object. Considering how much people liked our previous Gnomons, this time we decided to work on improvements and implement unrealized ideas, and to enable you to look at the sundial from a totally different angle and integrate it in your everyday carry.  With each of our watches we want to offer to all watch enthusiasts not only a custom design, but also a fresh look at time itself. That's why the time disc that constantly rotates on the dial is moving backwards, defying tradition, as if the time is flying through the sundial's surface. However, it won't make it more difficult for you to tell the time – with a little practice you'll be reading minutes as if you had been wearing it for ages!  The new collection has become even closer to the initial concept, turning the watch face into the ultimate sundial representation, both in its design and function. The gnomon-style single hand stands still, serving as a shadow pointer as well on the authentically-crafted dial resembling actual ancient time-tellers.  Telling time is a piece of cake – see for yourself! And this is not all that Umbra can offer you! ;) We want your watches to look decent and appropriate in any situation, so we have erased the boundary between casual and luxury, combining classical techniques, modern solutions, handmade elements, and motifs that are typical of overpriced watches. Yes, we offer you a new experience in the perception of time, but at the same time we make sure that you are as comfortable and familiar with it as possible.  We are pleased that, as independent watchmakers, we can afford to make our timepieces look the way they were intended. Given the handcrafted and almost antique appearance of our watches, we try to add as many small details and nuances to the design as possible. Each one is a stroke in the overall canvas of the signature Solar Lab style that we want you to experience.We have slightly modified our trad case, which was created from scratch for the Gnomon series – now it has become more practical and convenient. The back lid is decorated with zodiac engraving and transparent tinted glass matching the color of the model and revealing the mesmerizing work of the automatic movement.  The Umbra dial develops the ideas of our previous project and shows the time with the help of a fixed gnomon needle located above a polymer disc, with a texture and palette referring to materials that ancient architects worked with – marble, precious metals, and granite.  Once again, Umbra revealed that it was not the simplest watch in design. Changing the very principle of telling time allowed us to make our new chronometers even more multi-layered and monumental. The dial consists of several application layers and volumetric elements that work organically with each other and were selected for you through a method of many months of trial and error. We hope our design research will make you happy! :) Another important feature is the new straps. The silver Umbra is accompanied by a coffee-colored strap; the gold, by the colors of dark chocolate with an aged texture; while the black one has inherited the everlasting classics – a stylish black strap. All straps are stitched and made of whole pieces of leather, so you don’t need to worry about the strap getting torn or becoming unglued. The main thing is to treat it carefully! ;)  Speaking of straps... Considering the feedback from the previous campaign, we decided to work on our straps to make your experience with Solar Lab even more pleasant. We think we were able to achieve that goal!  Yes, we changed the supplier. This time we are being helped with the production of our Umbra straps by the world-famous Chicago tannery Horween! One of the values aspired to by our team is to make watches with more soulfulness and with less a feeling of cold factory production. Horween leather straps were the perfect solution. All straps for your future watches are made by hand from premium cowhide, tanned and aged in Horween workshops. Chicago leather is remarkable for its properties: being durable and thick, it remains soft and supple, which is very important when used in watch straps. The Horween name is a guarantee of quality with which you can feel confident about the life of a strap after long wear. Among the clients of Horween, which has been in business for more than a century, are such powerful names as Timberland, Rawlings, Wilson Sporting Goods, Brooks Brothers, Hanover Shoe, and dozens of other distinguished customers who have trusted the leather company for decades. Now included among them is Solar Lab! :)  Let's summarize everything you learned about our new watches. :)   Umbra is an automatic mechanical watch in a one-hand format, working on a disk system and referring to the ancient sundial in its design. The starting line-up consists of three characteristic models, in black, white, and rose-gold.   Each watch is made of lightweight 316L steel – thanks to this they feel almost weightless and offer maximum wearing comfort. The color on the Rose Gold and Black models is applied by a durable vacuum-deposition method that will last you for many years with proper care of the watch. Designed from scratch for our Gnomon series, the case is protected by solid mineral glass with a sapphire coating and is water resistant for 5 ATM. For precise time-telling, we chose an automatic Japanese-made Seiko automatic gear.   More detailed specifications of the new collection can be found below.Case Diameter: 43 mm   Case Thickness: 11 mm Band Material: Cowskin Horween leather (Made in USA) Band Width: 20 mm narrowing to 18 mmTotal Weight: 60 gram Case Material / Buckle: 316L Stainless Steel with IP coatingCrystal: Sapphire Coated Movement: Seiko NH35 AutomaticWater Resistant: 5 ATM / 50 Meters Thanks to the reach that crowdfunding platforms grant to young entrepreneurs, we are able to offer our backers the most attractive price on any Umbra watch.

It was a cold winter night. The moon just completed a cycle and turned full and on this particular night, I died. </p><p>The experience cannot be defined by words. Those who have been initiated by shamans to the use of sacred medicine would maybe understand this.  But yes, on that night, I died. Not literally, but symbolically.</p><p>Overnight, all the knowledge, all the beliefs, ll the securities, all of that made this world and me 'ME', felt suddenly, as intangible as the stories that parents would tell their children to fall asleep. Yes, on that night, the old me died and as the light of dawn came through, a new world was birthed in me with new hopes, new dreams, new perspectives. </p><p>Yes, I was reborn. </p><p>The changes did not come into my life as suddenly as the visions. They came in slowly and progressively. It started with lots of emotions felt also physically. For instance. I started feeling my heart again. It's a funny observation, but actually, how often do we consciously feel it's beat and it's warmth? Then, I saw my usual habits become unnecessary and almost too heavy to pursue. The need to 'reprogram' came quite naturally.</p><p>Slowly, progressively and steadily my entire life changed so then by the middle of the year of 2017, I was no longer lead by my emotions, but rather I was existing as them. The new friends, old souls an communities that I met on the road, they were all involved in at least one creative, artistic or community oriented project. </p><p>Meeting these people who inspired a new vibration of connecting, a new structure of living felt like I was finally starting to come home to my soul.  I felt inspired, held and nourished. I really wanted to be like them. And after another year of exploration and learning, this project came into existence. </p><h3><strong>ABOUT OUR PROJECTS</strong></h3><p><strong>How they came into existence and why it is important for us to see you join the movement</strong></p><p>Throughout the years of 2017 and 2018, I evolved and immersed myself within the ‘spiritual’ and ‘conscious’ community. I got to witness and experience the life of one who seeks for personal growth and a healthier lifestyle. Through the process, it struck me that people [myself included] went for so many mindful changes in their lives, yet seemed to have forgotten the most obvious element, the one that they’d carry on them all day, everyday : their clothes ?! </p><p>How could this be ? </p><p>There are three basic needs that man possesses : food, clothing and shelter. The global textile and clothing industry is bound to be big as it fulfills the second basic requirement of the human race. It is worth $480 billion at present and is expected to reach $700 billion, shortly. This is because people are being increasingly conscious of the way they dress. It has become a means to create an impression and represent one’s personality.</p><p>But what not many people know, is that the textile industry is also one of the most pollutant releasing industries of the world. Surveys show that nearly 5% of all landfill space is consumed by textile waste. Besides, 20% of all freshwater pollution is made by textile treatment and dyeing. And another alarming fact; Surveys show that cotton consumes the highest amount of harmful pesticides and fertilisers, yet it is one of the most common fabrics that is on offer, and that we wear. </p><p>And I’ve not yet mentioned the inhumane conditions in which employees usually work in. Did you know for example, that typical hours for a textile industry employee range from 10-18 hours per day and up to 80 hours a week, and require additional overtime hours to meet strict company deadlines ?! How could this be tolerated by anyone ? It’s modern age slavery. </p><p>Yes, there are a number of dysfunctionalities out there in the world, that are in serious need of being addressed if we are to stay in this world for much longer. But out of the many, I found myself needing to cover this one as a start to my new personal sense of responsibility to cover the many.  This one is enormous. </p><p>Also, to the question : How could this be ? I found in my researches that it was not so much about a lack of options, because there are number of ethical and sustainable fashion brands out there.  But I found that after the cost and designs of the products, people would actually take the step for the change, if they were diligently informed about the consequences of their choice, and if they had a genuine feeling of contributing to a good cause, with an even stronger feeling of being part of something bigger than themselves.</p><p>This is why Bridging Worlds and One Earth One Tribe came into existence. They are here to occupy space by addressing the particular points of education and belonging. This is why it is important for you too to join the movement and to support us One Earth One Tribe. Together, let’s we can make the change happen. </p><p> </p><h2><u>BRIDGING WORLDS </u></h2><h3>A  UNIQUE FASHION LABEL THAT’S REALLY WORTH YOUR SUPPORT</h3><p><strong>In a sentence, what is Bridging Worlds about ? </strong></p><p>Bridging Worlds is a fashion label that holds the vision to re-humanize the textile industry with an approach that is ethical and sustainable, in alignment with the ‘slow-fashion revolution’. </p><p><strong>How does Bridging Worlds stand out from other ethical and sustainable fashion labels ? </strong></p><p>At Bridging Worlds, we have an overarching for wholeness that leads us to choose :</p><p>- To select natural fabrics that also don’t require any intensive and damageable process to the environment to produce. Hemp, Linen and Tencel being the main materials.</p><p>- To support small local business in Thailand where we source our fabrics and most of our accessories. </p><p>- To  dye our fabrics accordingly to Thai traditions with elements of nature that are grown locally : including bark, flowers, …</p><p>- To embroider by hand the patterns as this is also part of Thai culture. </p><p><strong>Why does Bridging Worlds want to collaborate with tribal tattoo artists ? What is the main message behind this ? </strong></p><p>According to tribal customs and traditions, receiving a tattoo marked the passage into womanhood and manhood. Often times, these tattoos depicted a social status, a family identification and a spiritual message. Receiving such a tattoo was seen by the community as very important. </p><p>At Bridging Worlds, we see so much value in these practices that we wanted to, in a way, transfer these intentions to our clothing and brand. This is why we’ve invited international tattoo artists to join our project and design the patterns to our garments.</p><p>You’ll find that each of our garments have a unique style and story to tell. At the same time, they all emphasize on the same powerful message : </p><p>That you are all Queens and Kings, Goddesses and Gods. Sovereign. Free. Liberated. Belonging to the greater family of One Earth One Tribe and indissociable to the One Consciousness.</p><p><strong>What other causes will you be supporting with Bridging Worlds ?</strong></p><p>Bridging Worlds is openly and actively supporting :</p><p>- Disenfranchised populations. In this case, we’re showing our support to the hilltribe people of Thailand with a job opportunity that is fairly paid and that also empowers them in their traditions.</p><p>- Women’s Rights with a policy based on Equal Rights. In result, most of the key and strategic positions are being occupied by women, this came to be on the basis of their professional and human skills, regardless of their gender.</p><p>- LGBTQ Rights. In effect, we are very happy to be collaborating with two talented members who are also actively engaged in the LGBTQ community.</p><p><strong>What is the SCOE Foundation ? And what’s the relationship with Bridging Worlds ? </strong></p><p>SCOE Foundation stands for Spiritual Court of Equity Foundation,</p><p>It is an organization that upholds a gateway of spiritual ethics and truth to then support and facilitate the redistribution of land for projects and living structures that work in true alignment with Earth Mother, the Rights Of Nature and Universal Love. </p><p>The SCOE foundation will facilitate alliances between the Earth and those communities who's projects and visions set a foundation for ancient and balanced living practices in true relationship with the Earth, relationships that support the earth, educate the people, enliven and enrapture all sentient beings through visionary art, music, plant medicines, permaculture, ecology and sustainable systems of living being, ascending and dying. </p><p>Indeed, Bridging Worlds believes in the return of a Golden Age and is here to support The Event that will bring us back home, to ourselves. Bridging Wolrds will now work in Partnership with The SCOE foundation to raise funds, create partnerships and also Bridge communities who are driving the movement home in alignment with the true Rights of Nature. Bridging Worlds will be raising funds for the foundation through the sales of it’s garments.</p><p> </p><h3>INVEST IN BRINGING CLOTHING TO THE HOLISTIC / HEALING DEPARTMENT</h3><p><strong>The main function of clothing today</strong></p><p>The primary use of clothing is to cover our bodies and to afford a protection from heat and cold. They have derived into a use to please the eye and express a lot about one’s status, personality and occupation.  </p><p><strong>Bridging Worlds’ end goal is to take clothing to a holistic level by infusing crystal into it’s fabric. But we need your help.</strong></p><p>This is probably Bridging Worlds most unique and exciting aspect.</p><p>There exists a process that allows this alchemy to take place. For now, it is mostly used in Nano engineering for other purposes. But Bridging Worlds wants to experiment this for it’s own goal of bringing another form of healing to the people.</p><p>Our experimentation is based on the knowledge gathered around the healing properties of crystals. Indeed, for thousands of years, ancient civilizations have utilized the power of crystals to release mental, physical and spiritual blockages, thus facilitating the free flow throughout the body. On a cellular level, our bodies are made up of mineral silicon-dioxide. Because of this, we are naturally receptive to the vibrations of crystals as they transmit, reflect, store light and receive energy. So, when crystals are placed directly on our body, they have a powerful vibratory effect that surges from the crystal to you. And according to the law of physics, thoughts direct energy and energy follows thought.</p><p>We want our crystal energy garments to serve as a tool to help the thoughts of your consciousness connect with your body. </p><p>This is an opportunity for you to invest in an exciting new venture, a way of wearing that will uplift and empower both the wearer and maker. Join us on this venture. </p><p> </p><h2><u>MORE DETAILS ON THE SOCIAL ENTERPRISE</u></h2><p><strong>How is Bridging Worlds setup ? </strong></p><p>Bridging Worlds is a social enterprise that is setup as an online business and that will start it’s  production in Thailand.</p><p><strong>Who is Bridging Worlds target audience ?</strong></p><p>Bridging Worlds' target audience is :</p><p>- The 20 to 45 years old men, women and non binary.</p><p>- People who identify with the New Age / Vegan / Conscious Movement</p><p>- People with hobbies and passions for spiritual gatherings and festivals, eco travels, visionary art, holistic and alternative healing.</p><p>- People politically engaged in human and animal rights,  in community projects and  environmental causes.</p><p><strong>What is Bridging Worlds marketing strategy? </strong></p><p>Bridging Worlds will sell mostly online (80%) through our website : <a href=""http://www.oneearthonetribe.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.oneearthonetribe.org</a>  Facebook and Instagram.  Bridging Worlds will expand it’s market with :</p><p>- Sales in markets and in festivals.

It was a cold winter night. The moon just completed a cycle and turned full and on this particular night, I died. The experience cannot be defined by words. Those who have been initiated by shamans to the use of sacred medicine would maybe understand this.  But yes, on that night, I died. Not literally, but symbolically.Overnight, all the knowledge, all the beliefs, ll the securities, all of that made this world and me 'ME', felt suddenly, as intangible as the stories that parents would tell their children to fall asleep. Yes, on that night, the old me died and as the light of dawn came through, a new world was birthed in me with new hopes, new dreams, new perspectives. Yes, I was reborn. The changes did not come into my life as suddenly as the visions. They came in slowly and progressively. It started with lots of emotions felt also physically. For instance. I started feeling my heart again. It's a funny observation, but actually, how often do we consciously feel it's beat and it's warmth? Then, I saw my usual habits become unnecessary and almost too heavy to pursue. The need to 'reprogram' came quite naturally.Slowly, progressively and steadily my entire life changed so then by the middle of the year of 2017, I was no longer lead by my emotions, but rather I was existing as them. The new friends, old souls an communities that I met on the road, they were all involved in at least one creative, artistic or community oriented project. Meeting these people who inspired a new vibration of connecting, a new structure of living felt like I was finally starting to come home to my soul.  I felt inspired, held and nourished. I really wanted to be like them. And after another year of exploration and learning, this project came into existence. ABOUT OUR PROJECTSHow they came into existence and why it is important for us to see you join the movementThroughout the years of 2017 and 2018, I evolved and immersed myself within the ‘spiritual’ and ‘conscious’ community. I got to witness and experience the life of one who seeks for personal growth and a healthier lifestyle. Through the process, it struck me that people [myself included] went for so many mindful changes in their lives, yet seemed to have forgotten the most obvious element, the one that they’d carry on them all day, everyday : their clothes ?! How could this be ? There are three basic needs that man possesses : food, clothing and shelter. The global textile and clothing industry is bound to be big as it fulfills the second basic requirement of the human race. It is worth $480 billion at present and is expected to reach $700 billion, shortly. This is because people are being increasingly conscious of the way they dress. It has become a means to create an impression and represent one’s personality.But what not many people know, is that the textile industry is also one of the most pollutant releasing industries of the world. Surveys show that nearly 5% of all landfill space is consumed by textile waste. Besides, 20% of all freshwater pollution is made by textile treatment and dyeing. And another alarming fact; Surveys show that cotton consumes the highest amount of harmful pesticides and fertilisers, yet it is one of the most common fabrics that is on offer, and that we wear. And I’ve not yet mentioned the inhumane conditions in which employees usually work in. Did you know for example, that typical hours for a textile industry employee range from 10-18 hours per day and up to 80 hours a week, and require additional overtime hours to meet strict company deadlines ?! How could this be tolerated by anyone ? It’s modern age slavery. Yes, there are a number of dysfunctionalities out there in the world, that are in serious need of being addressed if we are to stay in this world for much longer. But out of the many, I found myself needing to cover this one as a start to my new personal sense of responsibility to cover the many.  This one is enormous. Also, to the question : How could this be ? I found in my researches that it was not so much about a lack of options, because there are number of ethical and sustainable fashion brands out there.  But I found that after the cost and designs of the products, people would actually take the step for the change, if they were diligently informed about the consequences of their choice, and if they had a genuine feeling of contributing to a good cause, with an even stronger feeling of being part of something bigger than themselves.This is why Bridging Worlds and One Earth One Tribe came into existence. They are here to occupy space by addressing the particular points of education and belonging. This is why it is important for you too to join the movement and to support us One Earth One Tribe. Together, let’s we can make the change happen.  BRIDGING WORLDS A  UNIQUE FASHION LABEL THAT’S REALLY WORTH YOUR SUPPORTIn a sentence, what is Bridging Worlds about ? Bridging Worlds is a fashion label that holds the vision to re-humanize the textile industry with an approach that is ethical and sustainable, in alignment with the ‘slow-fashion revolution’. How does Bridging Worlds stand out from other ethical and sustainable fashion labels ? At Bridging Worlds, we have an overarching for wholeness that leads us to choose :- To select natural fabrics that also don’t require any intensive and damageable process to the environment to produce. Hemp, Linen and Tencel being the main materials.- To support small local business in Thailand where we source our fabrics and most of our accessories. - To  dye our fabrics accordingly to Thai traditions with elements of nature that are grown locally : including bark, flowers, …- To embroider by hand the patterns as this is also part of Thai culture. Why does Bridging Worlds want to collaborate with tribal tattoo artists ? What is the main message behind this ? According to tribal customs and traditions, receiving a tattoo marked the passage into womanhood and manhood. Often times, these tattoos depicted a social status, a family identification and a spiritual message. Receiving such a tattoo was seen by the community as very important. At Bridging Worlds, we see so much value in these practices that we wanted to, in a way, transfer these intentions to our clothing and brand. This is why we’ve invited international tattoo artists to join our project and design the patterns to our garments.You’ll find that each of our garments have a unique style and story to tell. At the same time, they all emphasize on the same powerful message : That you are all Queens and Kings, Goddesses and Gods. Sovereign. Free. Liberated. Belonging to the greater family of One Earth One Tribe and indissociable to the One Consciousness.What other causes will you be supporting with Bridging Worlds ?Bridging Worlds is openly and actively supporting :- Disenfranchised populations. In this case, we’re showing our support to the hilltribe people of Thailand with a job opportunity that is fairly paid and that also empowers them in their traditions.- Women’s Rights with a policy based on Equal Rights. In result, most of the key and strategic positions are being occupied by women, this came to be on the basis of their professional and human skills, regardless of their gender.- LGBTQ Rights. In effect, we are very happy to be collaborating with two talented members who are also actively engaged in the LGBTQ community.What is the SCOE Foundation ? And what’s the relationship with Bridging Worlds ? SCOE Foundation stands for Spiritual Court of Equity Foundation,It is an organization that upholds a gateway of spiritual ethics and truth to then support and facilitate the redistribution of land for projects and living structures that work in true alignment with Earth Mother, the Rights Of Nature and Universal Love. The SCOE foundation will facilitate alliances between the Earth and those communities who's projects and visions set a foundation for ancient and balanced living practices in true relationship with the Earth, relationships that support the earth, educate the people, enliven and enrapture all sentient beings through visionary art, music, plant medicines, permaculture, ecology and sustainable systems of living being, ascending and dying. Indeed, Bridging Worlds believes in the return of a Golden Age and is here to support The Event that will bring us back home, to ourselves. Bridging Wolrds will now work in Partnership with The SCOE foundation to raise funds, create partnerships and also Bridge communities who are driving the movement home in alignment with the true Rights of Nature. Bridging Worlds will be raising funds for the foundation through the sales of it’s garments. INVEST IN BRINGING CLOTHING TO THE HOLISTIC / HEALING DEPARTMENTThe main function of clothing todayThe primary use of clothing is to cover our bodies and to afford a protection from heat and cold. They have derived into a use to please the eye and express a lot about one’s status, personality and occupation.  Bridging Worlds’ end goal is to take clothing to a holistic level by infusing crystal into it’s fabric. But we need your help.This is probably Bridging Worlds most unique and exciting aspect.There exists a process that allows this alchemy to take place. For now, it is mostly used in Nano engineering for other purposes. But Bridging Worlds wants to experiment this for it’s own goal of bringing another form of healing to the people.Our experimentation is based on the knowledge gathered around the healing properties of crystals. Indeed, for thousands of years, ancient civilizations have utilized the power of crystals to release mental, physical and spiritual blockages, thus facilitating the free flow throughout the body. On a cellular level, our bodies are made up of mineral silicon-dioxide. Because of this, we are naturally receptive to the vibrations of crystals as they transmit, reflect, store light and receive energy. So, when crystals are placed directly on our body, they have a powerful vibratory effect that surges from the crystal to you. And according to the law of physics, thoughts direct energy and energy follows thought.We want our crystal energy garments to serve as a tool to help the thoughts of your consciousness connect with your body. This is an opportunity for you to invest in an exciting new venture, a way of wearing that will uplift and empower both the wearer and maker. Join us on this venture.  MORE DETAILS ON THE SOCIAL ENTERPRISEHow is Bridging Worlds setup ? Bridging Worlds is a social enterprise that is setup as an online business and that will start it’s  production in Thailand.Who is Bridging Worlds target audience ?Bridging Worlds' target audience is :- The 20 to 45 years old men, women and non binary.- People who identify with the New Age / Vegan / Conscious Movement- People with hobbies and passions for spiritual gatherings and festivals, eco travels, visionary art, holistic and alternative healing.- People politically engaged in human and animal rights,  in community projects and  environmental causes.What is Bridging Worlds marketing strategy? Bridging Worlds will sell mostly online (80%) through our website : www.oneearthonetribe.org  Facebook and Instagram.  Bridging Worlds will expand it’s market with :- Sales in markets and in festivals.

 ABOUT THE CROWDFUNDINGHow much funds are we raising ? And what will the funds be used for ? We are raising $ 20 000. This will be used accordingly :- $500 to get the last patterns and prototypes done and finish our first collection called Samsara.- $500 to experiment infusing crystals in fabrics.- $800 to pay for the design of our logo.- $700 to pay for the trademarks : business name and logo.- $3,000 to help us start with our online marketing strategy including Facebook ads.- $1,500 to purchase a camera that will allow us to put online our own / high quality photos and showcase our clothing line. - $1,000 to hire the services of a branding expert. - $200 to finish paying off the service of the videographer who created the promo video- $6,500 to purchase the bus that will transport our products from festival to festival in Australia.- $4,000 to pay for the material and labor to build our market stall.- $1,000 to pay upfront the first 3 festivals in Australia- $500 to pay for the Thai visasWhat is the main risk and challenge that Bridging Worlds could encounter ?The main challenge that I see for Bridging Worlds today, is keeping up with time frames and delays in the production and exportation. It’s true : Thailand has really a timing of its own. It is very much cultural and quite widely spread in the mentalities. Thai people have a popular saying describing this, which is ‘Sabai Sabai’ meaning : Relax, there’s no need to rush.The best way that I’ve found to overcome this challenge was to adopt a business model that is in alignment with the slow fashion industry. In this scenario, it is understood that the production is based on schedules that are more flexible. However, we will have at least 3 people on the mission of monitoring the most important deadlines. The main risk for Bridging Worlds, is to see new laws  voted by Thai government that would be this enterprise more difficult . We are operating legally in Thailand, in partnership with an association who comes in support to the hill tribe people by providing them with warm clothes for winter. This association has expanded their social and humanitarian mission by incorporating our production in their mission. Also, the best way that I’ve found to overcome this risk, is by keeping our production small in Thailand (with 4 tailors max) and expanding our production in Nepal where the culture and use of hemp is worldly known. Furthermore, Nepali people are also looking for opportunities to rebuild wealth and community after the 2015 Earthquake.  IN CONCLUSIONA LAST CONFESSION Before coming to the conclusion, I want to share with you that I feel very happy, proud, excited, humbled and in aw by the birthing and evolution of Bridging Worlds, One Earth One Tribe and SCOE Foundation. Looking back at the work that has been accomplished in less than three months, it’s quite impressive and really incredible ! Support came in very early, with for example, $1,500 of financial aid that came in before any prototype was  designed. Today, the community supporting these projects have spread to four continents. I can only link this phenomenon to the facts that these projects are coherent with an offer that is in alignment with our time and need for change. Also, these projects come from a place of Love. They all are about ‘giving back’ : giving back to the people, giving back to Mother Earth. I believe that these projects speak to peoples’ souls like it does to mine. Of course, there is space for progress and betterment. But this is where we are at today. I have trust in these projects like I have faith in us. We will succeed.  ALL KIND OF HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED INCLUDING TECH SUPPORT AND DONATION OF MATERIALYes, we want to raise $20,000 and we are very grateful for your contributions. Every dollar is important to us. THANK YOU. At the same, we invite everyone to join us on Facebook and Insragram to follow our progress.

It makes or breaks the look, whether we want to admit it or not. Wearing the same old belt, every single time, gets boring, devaluing the time you put into your individual style. We all know this struggle. That’s why reversible belts are more enticing: they give you choices.Unfortunately, reversible belts are far and few between, especially when you have those that need you to unhook the adapter from the strap to change your buckles. Those reversibles will mess up your leather straps, wearing down over time.In order to look interesting every time you step out of the house, it’s necessary to own multiple belts at once. However, it's definitely costly.

A reversible leather belt with interchangeable designer buckles. Your styles will never be limited ever again. More choices, more styles. Your belt will always stand out from the crowd, no matter where you go! The ARconnector is well designed and easy to use, holding the strap and buckle between the two like a bridge. The ARconnector adapts to all 35mm belt sizes. Made with PA6, one of the toughest plastic material in the industry, it is ultra-light in design, giving you the unique ability to go through security checkpoints without ever having to take off your belt. ARconnector comes standard with all straps. The interchangeable buckles are made with Zinc-Alloy to safeguard the best quality. Our buckles come with clips on both sides, allowing you to switch back and forth among the buckles you have onto the strap, depending on your outfit. We have varieties of options, from standard style buckles to designer buckles that complement whatever you’re wearing. The more buckles you own, the greater your fashion freedom. All of our straps are made of leather with different designs and colors on both sides. The strap comes with ARconnectors designed to attach all ARbuckles, offering flippable styles to match your outfit every way you want it.    Team ARbelts is always looking for better solutions.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey ya'll, I'm Max and I'm an Actor and teaching artist living in Los Angeles and I want to share with you what I've learned while traveling the world! I've had the honor to teach students from Costa Rica, to China, Brazil to NYC, Boston to Florida and even here in Los Angeles. The journey’s been amazing and I still learn every day!

<strong><u>Christia Visser</u></strong>﻿<strong> - (32A) M</strong>y bust is 32A and bottom 8, sometimes a 10... As you can imagine, I always have to buy different sizes for top and bottom when I buy a bikini... Except with Jini bikinis ❤ it does not matter how I twist it, the fabric always naturally falls to my body, so I get to wear it however I feel comfortable on any given day :) I love it!</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524880962/p5tcsra5j7g22ygklnex.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>
<u>Jessica Viljoen</u> - (36A)  I have too many styles to have a favorite. Every time it's a new style! Hahaha! The top is a perfect it. I choose the style for my mood if I want a ""little"" cleavage I choose a V cut style, if I feel like embracing my obviously flat chest I choose a different style.  I have never been one to wear a Brazilian cut bikini because I have a bigger but and don't like showing it off! But I love my jini because it has not elastic so no butt fat roll. I feel more confident than ever and will wear my jini every beach holiday!</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524881020/elwezhvabi7bfibghyq9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3> </h3><h3>
<u>Melody Kiang</u> - (36B) Jini bikini is a comfortable and versatile piece every girl should own in their closet. Growing up, I have always struggled with my weight and had to buy several different bikinis in different sizes. Now, I don’t have to worry about buying multiple bikinis as this one will adjust to my body shape. I feel sexy and confident in this bikini because it’s comfortable, easy to style and most of all, flatters any body size and shape!</h3><h3> </h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524881042/cqp7q1nbtk0cfvixce89.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3>
<u>Elizabeth Du Plessis</u> - (36C) The Jini Bikini is absolutely amazing. I have always struggled with finding a bikini top that fits properly and that covers all the necessary areas because i am on the bigger side. They fit soooo well and make you feel super comfortable because of the great quality and PERFECT fit.

Well done Nani!</h3><p> </p></div>","- This revolutionary patent bikini was designed for each and every woman out there, to fit her unique body type and to ensure comfort.- The broad straps allow various designs so that each woman can find the perfect fit for her body and mood.  The unique designs allows for a One Size Fits All, so you don't have to worry about your Jini not fitting perfectly. Twist, knot or wrap the straps around your body to create different styles as a Top or Bottom.- You don't have to fit in a JINI, the JINI will fit your body perfectly.                                        This makes it the ONLY bikini of its kind.       - JINI's design is special, because it works with your curves.  Instead of having normal straps, the JINI's straps are broad and specifically shaped to provide support and comfort while you soak up the sun and have fun. - The JINI bikini has two full pieces of fabric that are stitched together with a double sewing technique using spandex thread, which guarantees that the JINI will be able to stretch, twist and fold to your needs and desires.- This means you are guaranteed to have a high-quality bikini that won't rip or tear.- This Bikini also allows you to insert cups if needed. - Jini is the perfect bikini while you are pregnant, seeing as your bikini will fit you every step of the way and your body will be changing. - We recently launched JINI in South Africa, with our focus on helping all women find their perfect bikini, because we know women of all shapes and sizes love to wear bikinis. And YES she is a Grandmother!!  ^^^^^^- We would love to let everybody know about our JINI, and this is why we need your help.  Just imagine women all around the world being able to find and wear a bikini that really fits their body shape and mood! If you cannot contribute to this, it is all right.  All we ask of you is to help us spread the word -Please share our Indiegogo page with our friends using one of the Share bottons on this page.Feel free to visit our facebook and Instagram page or website.Facebook page:  www.facebook.com/jinibikini/Instagram: @jinibikinis Drop a Like and Share, or Tag a friend who would love this!Website:  www.jinibikini.com We would love to hear from you. We invite you to be part of our dream.  Let's get the word out, because every woman deserves a JINI. What women from all over the world had to say: 
Christia Visser﻿ - (32A) My bust is 32A and bottom 8, sometimes a 10... As you can imagine, I always have to buy different sizes for top and bottom when I buy a bikini... Except with Jini bikinis ❤ it does not matter how I twist it, the fabric always naturally falls to my body, so I get to wear it however I feel comfortable on any given day :) I love it! 
Jessica Viljoen - (36A)  I have too many styles to have a favorite. Every time it's a new style! Hahaha! The top is a perfect it. I choose the style for my mood if I want a ""little"" cleavage I choose a V cut style, if I feel like embracing my obviously flat chest I choose a different style.  I have never been one to wear a Brazilian cut bikini because I have a bigger but and don't like showing it off! But I love my jini because it has not elastic so no butt fat roll. I feel more confident than ever and will wear my jini every beach holiday!  
Melody Kiang - (36B) Jini bikini is a comfortable and versatile piece every girl should own in their closet. Growing up, I have always struggled with my weight and had to buy several different bikinis in different sizes. Now, I don’t have to worry about buying multiple bikinis as this one will adjust to my body shape. I feel sexy and confident in this bikini because it’s comfortable, easy to style and most of all, flatters any body size and shape!  
Elizabeth Du Plessis - (36C) The Jini Bikini is absolutely amazing. I have always struggled with finding a bikini top that fits properly and that covers all the necessary areas because i am on the bigger side. They fit soooo well and make you feel super comfortable because of the great quality and PERFECT fit. The different styles make it so much fun to wear and you can find the proper style to fit your build super easily, depending on how much coverage you want. I would recommend Jini Bikini to anybody trying to find a great fit for ANY size. I will never buy any other bikini again. Thanks JiniB

One of us fellows was responsible for carrying and guarding the room key for a day.

In case he lost the key again, he would have to carry around an even heavier 3-kilogram bucket of sand attached to the key for an entire day. Obviously, nobody wanted to lose the key anymore and we needed to safely guard our key. That is where my friend and I came up with an idea and we decided to simply attach the key with a string directly to our belt or pants. By doing so, we made sure it did not fall out until we got back to the dorm room after our training.

<p>J.o.a.n. Atelier was created by Vicky Adegbola, a Nigerian American who grew up in Columbus, Oh. Frustrated with the aesthetic of affordable womenswear options available in the fashion industry, she decided to create her own brand that would offer unique statement pieces and stylish essentials at a reasonable price. J.o.a.n. stands for jaunty, optimistic, audacious, and natural--the characteristics of our customer. </p>
<p>One imperative aspect of our brand is that we have meticulously crafted imagery that increases the representation of women of color.  In general, the fashion industry has struggled with adequate representation of women of color in their ads, social media sites, and runway shows. We seek to make fashion accessible and approachable. Also, our garments will conform to the curvier body type to help alleviate the common frustrations they face in the dressing room.</p>
<p>In addition to providing bold contemporary garments, we are producing our garments in Nigeria to help create more job opportunities. Being a Nigerian American, it is important that we do not forget our roots and we do everything we can to help our community. </p>
<p>With your help, we will be able to provide affordable fashion to women everywhere while increasing the opportunities for skilled artisans who deserve to be able to provide for their families.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge is completing production in Lagos, Nigeria from the United States. Although we are highly involved in every aspect, we also depend on our liaisons based in Lagos, Nigeria to oversee the manufacturing. Also, the high shipping costs to get our product from Nigeria to the United States creates an ongoing hurdle for our company. The best way to overcome these challenges is to make at least two trips per season to ensure the manufacturing process is going smoothly and that we deliver a quality product.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! And thank you for visiting/supporting my campaign. My name is Roshonda Coleman and I'm a salon professional of 20+ years. When I first starting doing hair I had 2 goals attached to my career. The first was to own my own salon, of which the Lord has opened the door for me to accomplish. The second was to launch my own product line, which is why you're here, right?</p>
<p>During my time as a stylist, I've watched the hair industry transform. Client needs have change, thus the demand changed as well. One thing that is important to my customers is all around health; but specific to my arena, healthy hair. We are in a new era where clients are very educated on which products are good and bad for the hair, which is AWESOME!</p>
<p>One of the biggest changes within the last 10 years to the hair industry is embracing the natural hair that the Lord has given us. Which has transcended into changing the culture of our workplaces and day to day dealings.

Hello! And thank you for visiting/supporting my campaign. My name is Roshonda Coleman and I'm a salon professional of 20+ years. When I first starting doing hair I had 2 goals attached to my career. The first was to own my own salon, of which the Lord has opened the door for me to accomplish. The second was to launch my own product line, which is why you're here, right?
During my time as a stylist, I've watched the hair industry transform. Client needs have change, thus the demand changed as well. One thing that is important to my customers is all around health; but specific to my arena, healthy hair. We are in a new era where clients are very educated on which products are good and bad for the hair, which is AWESOME!
One of the biggest changes within the last 10 years to the hair industry is embracing the natural hair that the Lord has given us. Which has transcended into changing the culture of our workplaces and day to day dealings. I would have to say that 95% of my clientele has shifted to natural hair, of that, approximately 80% prefer to still have a sleek ""relaxed"" look. Which is why I specialize in Silk-Presses. 
My product line is vistal in nature, giving you the sleekest, softest, shiniest Silk-Press and on the opposite end, the conditioner gives you a very defined Wash N Go that doesn't give in to shrinkage. 
Your support of this campaign is a very important part of the official launch of this product. Your pre-order will kickstart the mass production of this wonderful product line. With that said, I would like to say thank you in advance for all your help. I appreciate you! 
 
God Bless you

<h3>A Quick Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi! I'm Lori Novis, Founder and CEO of Mango Fish Art™ and its new Proud of U.™ division. I've been playing with art since I was 3, and have been a librarian for almost 20 years. I learned how to make jewelry 10 years ago before moving to the tiny and beautiful island of Culebra, PR.</li>
<li>My husband and I relocated to western Massachusetts in 2016 and I discovered that the <strong>poverty rate</strong> is high in this region -- 40% of the students with whom I worked in northwestern MA are living at poverty level; 99% of our Holyoke Public School students are on free- and reduced-lunch; and 13% of residents in western MA are living at poverty. </li>
<li>
<strong>Helping others</strong> has been at my core since I was a child. More than 45 years ago, my second- grade teacher commented on my report card that I would assist other students who were struggling after I finished my work. She mentioned that I had deep compassion and empathy for students that were having problems. I was only 8 years old. </li>

<li>We are offering some fun and unique perks depending on your level of giving ... Mango Fish Art™ magnets, coffee mugs, a postcard 10-pack highlighting photos of Culebra and Puerto Rico's beauty, taken by Mango Fish Art™ founder, Lori, a handcrafted Red, White &amp; Blue Proud of U.™ bead, and some secret perks! Special perks will be available if you share our campaign and your referrals raise money. </li>

<ul>
<li>There is a curtain of hidden poverty in America's rural towns and cities, and women and their children are most subjected to financial stress.

<li>As a public librarian in a tough NJ city, I saw firsthand the positive affect of <strong>mentoring</strong> on our high school library pages ... a few of our young adult employees are now successful and happy adults in part because of the informal mentoring they received from librarians and library staff. </li>
<li>We have the wonderful opportunity of positively contributing to not only individuals, but to Holyoke, MA, a city that faces economic development challenges and all of the toughness that accompanies it.

become a catalyst of change that is desperately needed in the golf industry.  By
connecting the sport to its future players, we aim to become a trusted and recognizable
golf and sports apparel brand.  The fact is, the game has been suffering from an aging baby boomer population coupled with years of limited support around attracting younger players. However, there are some very specific areas of
growth that have emerged and currently injecting new life into the sport. 
Those growth areas all align with <b><a href=""www.prodigygolfer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PRODIGYGOLFER®</a></b> apparel.  They include; <b>younger
generation players, female, and multi-cultural.</b>  The timing is right for a fresh new generation to get
introduced and grow with their style and their game.  The future of the
game depends on the younger generation and I am passionate about making a
contribution to the game.</p>
<p><b><u>Milestones:</u></b></p>
<p><b><u>2014:</u></b>
Soft launched at 2014 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando, FL.</p>
<p><b><u>2014:</u></b>
Validated the need in the market and received feedback from both end-user customers and commercial customers that
helped shape our latest designs and color stories.</p>
<p><b><u>2014:</u></b> Started to make waves in the golf apparel industry by partnering with one
of the U.S.'s strongest PGA sections, the Southern California PGA (SCPGA)
section. Through that partnership, we were the title sponsor for 3 of their
2014 Junior Golf Tour tournaments.</p>
<p><b><u>2015:</u></b> We
have also had a successful 2015 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando, FL this past
January by landing the most awarded golf facility in the US as a new customer right
next to some of the game’s major apparel brands.</p><p>We are currently filling orders for our current delivery called the “Tee It Up” collection as well as taking pre-orders for our upcoming releases called the “Pin Seeker”, “Medalist” shirt collections as well as our most recent release, our “Champ” skort collection.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246697/files/20150224161214-2015_PGA_Show_Booth__4080.jpg?1424823134"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1246699/files/20150224161236-3.jpg?1424823156"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Leveraging my
experience and knowledge for solving complex problems, I foresee several
critical hurdles that will need to be overcome. </p>
<p>First, there is
a barrier of entry into the golf industry which has traditionally been
dominated by major ""adult"" apparel brands.  </p><p></p>
<p><b><u>-- Answer:</u></b>  A major difference and
advantage we have over them is that we are being born into this specific
demographic.  This benefit allows us to remain closer to our customers and
focus on a customer base that is loyal, independent and cost conscious.  The majority of brands in the golf industry began as adult brands and will
always focus on that demographic in order to keep their market positioning
among their peers.  For us, this leaves the door open for the opportunity to become the
leader in the young adult/teen segment.</p>
<p>Second,
the cost associated with creating brand awareness and educating the industry buyers requires various strategies.  These
strategies include end users, pro shop managers,
resorts, specialty and big box retailers merchandisers.  </p>
<p><b><u>-- Answer:</u></b>  We were sought out by
and eventually partnered with the same firm that brought both
Softspikes® and <span>SkyCaddie® to their mainstream market leadership
positions. With their almost thirty years of selling to the golf industry, we
are leveraging their expertise and relationships to open and educate the above mentioned customer sales channels
for us.</span></p>
<p>Third, the cost of production requires a significant financial investment. </p>
<p><u><b>-- Answer:</b> </u> Up to this point,
I have bootstrapped everything.  This is where your investment comes in.
 In order for us to keep opening doors and offering unique new apparel to
aspiring golfers and generating a new targeted revenue stream for retailers,
we will need your support.</p>
<p>All
of these hurdles can be addressed and overcome with your support and contribution.  If you cannot contribute, we ask that you help carry our message to your friends, family and colleagues.</p>
<p></p><p><b><u>FAQ</u></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Where is the apparel and accessories made?</b><br/>
Our shirt and head-wear collections are both designed in Orlando, FL. Shirts are
manufactured in Colombia.  Our head-wear is made primarily in China with the exception of our #GIMMIE (White/Black) hat which is made in Vietnam. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b>What is your apparel and accessories made of?</b></p>
<p>All of our products are all made
from 100% polyester.  With the exception
of our #GIMMIE hat, our hats are made of 100% polyester.  Our #GIMMIE (White/Black) hat is made in Vietnam and is made of a 50% Polyester / 50% Cotton blend.</p><p><b>When are the perks expected to ship?</b><br/>
We will fulfill perks in the order they are received. We are aiming to start
fulfillment according to current and future delivery dates.  If a product is currently available, we will
ship it right away to you.  If a product

direct impact on bringing a “NEW ALTERNATIVE” to the legacy adult brands but at affordable prices.  Together, we can bring a new younger look
and attitude to the beautiful and storied sport of golf.Our mission is to inspire
confidence, individuality and fun through an apparel brand that they can “call
their own”.  We are looking to raise
$30,000 to be put towards production costs (i.e. – promoting, fabric costs, cut
and sew costs.  In addition to our current ""Tee It Up""
Collection"", we are looking to produce 2 more shirt collections and 1
skort collection.  To give you an idea of just the factory costs
associated with a single ""collection"", I have broken it down for you
8 styles (4
Male/4 Female) x Min Order Qty (MOQ) of 400 units x freight = Approx $30,000.
* This cost includes
hang tags, care tags, bar coding and production man hours.We are excited to offer unique and exciting
perks for each level of contribution ranging from receiving apparel pieces and
accessories to having the opportunity to become a designer and determine a color scheme for a single
shirt design on a future production (We will provide available color options).
All funds collected through your contributions
will go directly toward ongoing production costs, as well as, continued marketing efforts
to create brand awareness.
With your help, PRODIGYGOLFER® can
become a catalyst of change that is desperately needed in the golf industry.  By
connecting the sport to its future players, we aim to become a trusted and recognizable
golf and sports apparel brand.  The fact is, the game has been suffering from an aging baby boomer population coupled with years of limited support around attracting younger players. However, there are some very specific areas of
growth that have emerged and currently injecting new life into the sport. 
Those growth areas all align with PRODIGYGOLFER® apparel.  They include; younger
generation players, female, and multi-cultural.  The timing is right for a fresh new generation to get
introduced and grow with their style and their game.  The future of the
game depends on the younger generation and I am passionate about making a
contribution to the game.
Milestones:
2014:
Soft launched at 2014 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando, FL.
2014:
Validated the need in the market and received feedback from both end-user customers and commercial customers that
helped shape our latest designs and color stories.
2014: Started to make waves in the golf apparel industry by partnering with one
of the U.S.'s strongest PGA sections, the Southern California PGA (SCPGA)
section. Through that partnership, we were the title sponsor for 3 of their
2014 Junior Golf Tour tournaments.
2015: We
have also had a successful 2015 PGA Merchandise Show in Orlando, FL this past
January by landing the most awarded golf facility in the US as a new customer right
next to some of the game’s major apparel brands.We are currently filling orders for our current delivery called the “Tee It Up” collection as well as taking pre-orders for our upcoming releases called the “Pin Seeker”, “Medalist” shirt collections as well as our most recent release, our “Champ” skort collection.
Risks & Challenges:
Leveraging my
experience and knowledge for solving complex problems, I foresee several
critical hurdles that will need to be overcome. 
First, there is
a barrier of entry into the golf industry which has traditionally been
dominated by major ""adult"" apparel brands.  
-- Answer:  A major difference and
advantage we have over them is that we are being born into this specific
demographic.  This benefit allows us to remain closer to our customers and
focus on a customer base that is loyal, independent and cost conscious.  The majority of brands in the golf industry began as adult brands and will
always focus on that demographic in order to keep their market positioning
among their peers.  For us, this leaves the door open for the opportunity to become the
leader in the young adult/teen segment.
Second,
the cost associated with creating brand awareness and educating the industry buyers requires various strategies.  These
strategies include end users, pro shop managers,
resorts, specialty and big box retailers merchandisers.  
-- Answer:  We were sought out by
and eventually partnered with the same firm that brought both
Softspikes® and SkyCaddie® to their mainstream market leadership
positions. With their almost thirty years of selling to the golf industry, we
are leveraging their expertise and relationships to open and educate the above mentioned customer sales channels
for us.
Third, the cost of production requires a significant financial investment. 
-- Answer:  Up to this point,
I have bootstrapped everything.  This is where your investment comes in.
 In order for us to keep opening doors and offering unique new apparel to
aspiring golfers and generating a new targeted revenue stream for retailers,
we will need your support.
All
of these hurdles can be addressed and overcome with your support and contribution.  If you cannot contribute, we ask that you help carry our message to your friends, family and colleagues.

When we started three years ago, we quickly noticed that our jewelry found a home with hard-working professional women. Why might you ask? Our customers demand both luxury and practicality, and that's exactly what we deliver. From our tiny shop, we have gained traction locally and are quickly gaining popularity in the Southeast US. Now we need your help to let all strong successful women nationwide experience jewelry that will enrich and keep up with their busy lives.








MaterialsJewelry that feels incredible to wear is the jewelry you'll never want to take off. That’s why we only use natural gemstones, the highest quality freshwater pearls, and sterling silver.



CraftsmanshipWe are proud to share in the tradition of American craftsmanship. Each of our pieces are handcrafted with the utmost attention to detail in our workshop on the banks of the Mississippi River. 
Luxury We know you've worked hard and that’s why we want our jewelry to be something you can cherish. You deserve this luxury!
PracticalityNot only do we design for beauty, but for functionality and durability as well. Our jewelry is constructed for every occasion for any woman on-the-go.
Durability... We Guarantee it All of our pieces are designed to be worn each day and be passed down to the next generation of extraordinary women. That means we guarantee each piece for life.






Successful, confident women come in all shapes, sizes, backgrounds and professions. Each day we are inspired by our customers, who lead incredibly busy lives as career women, mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, girlfriends, best friends, volunteers and leaders in their community. 

This is why we are committed to showing real women role-models from our customer base instead of fashion models. Not only does this help promote a positive image of what a confident woman is, it inspires other customers to live their lives to the fullest.

Over the past three and half years we have grown from our tiny storefront on a Main Street to a fast growing brand throughout the South. We'd like to take our new collection to women nationwide. Now we need your help. 



Producing the Collection

We are proud to be a part of the tradition of American-craftsmanship. As our popularity grows we need to ramp-up to support larger volume orders internally as well as work with other American made manufacturers to create our unique designs. Your contribution will help us expand our internal and external production capability.
Taking the Show on the Road
The best way to sell a collection is to hit the road and sell it! Your contribution will help us as we book trunk shows in key markets and recruit bloggers, style editors, style mavens and stylists to help bring our brand to successful women nationwide.

</div></div>","Dear contributors, We are an internationally operating couture label, established in 2006 by Dutch designer Ingeborg Steenhorst. This October we are going to launch an unique fashion and music production called 'Back To Roots'. This production will feature our new Men & Women couture fashion line for 2016, accompanied by a music soundtrack. Our goal is to get funding to create the new couture collection and present it through a multi disciplined fashion show with live music, dance and mesmerizing visuals.   We want to make the world a better looking, enjoyable and healthier place by creating beautiful fashion, great music and stopping deforestation by supporting a good cause: The Stand for Trees organization! 
Who are we?We are a Dutch couture label operating from our own atelier/workshop in 's-Hertogenbosch.  Ingeborg Steenhorst Couture is hand-dyed, hand painted, screen printed, 
feathered, elegantly tailored and richly decorated,all intended to turn the 
wearer into a rocking star!  Our main designer and label founder Ingeborg Steenhorst, is a well known name in the world of custom made couture outfits and accessories. Her unique style and eye for detail has made her become most successful in the fields of couture clothing, headpieces and fashion accessories, to even bespoke couture bridal designs. Her stunning creations are worn by female politicians, celebrities and international rock stars such as Floor Jansen  (Nightwish), Cristina Scabbia (Lacuna Coil), Simone Simons (Epica), Dianne van Giersbergen (Xandria) and many others!

Back to RootsWith Back to Roots we are going to present our new 2016 Men & Women couture line and music soundtrack through a multidisciplinary fashion show. Beautiful catwalk models will be supported by live music and dance, all framed by state of the art video visuals. The soundtrack will be exclusively composed for Back to Roots by Basecamp Audio, under musical direction of Ivo van Dijk (Karmaflow 'the world's first rock opera videogame & Equilibrio 'the rock opera'), with composers Sophie Ansems and Colin van der Lei. The entire soundtrack will be performed live by conductor/drummer Ivo van Dijk, guitarist Rob Willemse (Cirrha Niva), bass guitarist Daniël Huijben (11th Hour, ex-Cirrha Niva), Lisette van den Berg (Scarlet Stories, Karmaflow, Epic Rock Choir), Monique Op Heij (Seventh Sin), Laura Guldemond ( Generation Lost, Epic Rock Choir) and violin player Sophie Ansems (Karmaflow). The video visuals supporting the fashion show will feature graphics and photo art created by Ingeborg Steenhorst. The video production will be co-produced by Tom de Wit of the Imagineering Suite. 



By supporting us, you're not only helping us to realize our goals, you are also making the world a better place by saving trees!



The ConceptThe 'Back to Roots' concept is mainly based on two things; as a couture label that partially operates in the alternative music scene, the new couture line of designer Ingeborg Steenhorst will be inspired by the attitude and styling expressions from iconic bands in the heavy music scene over the past decades. By blending in alternative subculture with exclusive couture designs, she is literally going back to her roots! The other reason for chosen this concept title, is because designer Ingeborg is very committed to approaching fashion in a sustainable way. This shows in often using reused antique fabrics and garments, laces, beads and unique embroideries. 
Sustainable Couture Fashion and Stand for TreesThe entire couture collection will be hand-sewn at the company’s own atelier in 's-Hertogenbosch. This minimizes the production of waste and excess materials, while ensuring good and controlled working conditions. We have decided to take this sustainable approach one step further, by supporting the Stand For Trees organization!

A little glimpse of our atelier in 's-HertogenboschStand for TreesThe Stand For Trees  Organization is an innovative
 campaign that enables individuals to take real action to stop forest loss: the number one cause of
species extinction and second-leading cause of CO2 emissions globally. To stop
this trend, Stand For Trees has developed the REDD+ program to
'reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation'. This model allows
consumers to buy Stand For Trees Certificates that protect a specific piece of endangered forest. For every 10 dollar that you help us raise for the Stand for
Trees, we are able to purchase 1 certificate. Every certificate
will prevent
a tonne of CO2 from being released into the atmosphere. For more
information regarding Stand For Trees, please have a look at standfortrees.org


The Fashion Show We will present the new couture collection with a multidisciplined fashion show   in music hall De Effenaar in Eindhoven on the 17th of October. The show will be the special opening act of FemMe Event. A two-day festival paying a tribute to women in rock & metal on and off of stage, headlined by Lacuna Coil and Therion.  Please note that the fashion show is part of this festival for which only day-tickets are available. If you are interested in only visiting the fashion show, you can get a refund on your day-ticket if you leave the venue within 30 minutes after the fashion show.  Tickets for FemME can be purchased online through the official Effenaar website.The show contain live music, dancers and couture fashion!






Why help?Not only do we want to
make the world a prettier place, we also want it to become a healthier place
where we, you and our children can enjoy unique fashion and great music in a
beautiful, better world! Our goal is to raise enough money to create and  present our  new collection in an amazing way with a multi disciplined fashion show.  However, just asking support for our project alone
doesn't feel right. By supporting us, you are not just becoming a part of our
fashion design & art project, in fact you are also helping us to prevent deforestation of rain forests.  We will use a part of the donated fundings to buy Stand For Trees Certificates and help to  stop deforestation and safe rainforest. 

What do we need?Creating a collection and organizing a multidisciplinary fashion show unfortunately doesn't come cheap. This is a little overview of what we can do with your support;- Buy fabrics and materials to create the collection- Pay the models, musicians and dancers a honest fee- Have the show filmed and have an after movie created for you to enjoy- Buy Stand For Trees certificates and safe rainforestThe following official after movie of the Ingeborg Steenhorst fashion show 2015 'Adrenaline' gives you an impression of what we can do with your support.

<p><span>Tindra Tales is the retelling of centuries old Icelandic folktales. It is a modern take on an old idea! Remember the book came with an accompanying record to play along while you read? We're going to bring that idea into the 21st Century. </span></p>
<p><span>There will be two books: one for children telling the classic stories,  and one for adults using Iceland's famous nightlife to spice things up a little! We have been collecting stories and now are ready to finalize them by incorporating interviews with Icelanders of all ages who have been asked to share their favorite folktales.</span></p>
<p><span>The storybook's backdrop will be stunning photographs taken in Iceland, brought to life by one of a kind illustrations allowing us mortals to see into the usually invisible Huldofolk world. A CD will be included, filled with a soundscape captured in Iceland, original music discovered while travelling the island, and narration of the story. </span></p>
<p>The collection of the artists' various contributions to the modern folktales will provide the reader with more than just a book... it will be <i>a multi-sensory experience able to be enjoyed over and over. </i></p>
<p><b>Target Audience:</b></p>
<p>These books will be of interest to many different groups as it is part classic tale, part art book, part multimedia experience. The following is a partial list of groups that will want a copy of this book in their home, office, studio and classroom:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>children of all ages: the CD narration option will meet the literary needs of each child, enabling him/her to grow with the book. </li>
<li>parents</li>
<li>ammas and avis/grandmas and grandpa</li>
<li>photographers</li>

Who is Tindra Tales?
Five artists and professionals from Canada and Iceland have come together to participate in the Tindra Tales Project. 
Team members are all accomplished artists and professionals in their own disciplines and have come together, each offering their specific skilsl to the project. The Tindra Tales artists objective is to develop and produce two coffee table worthy books that will be something you want to look at, listen to and read, over and over!
Introductions:
Illustrator Disa Kauk is a graphic facilitator based out of Toronto, and has been running her successful business since 2008.
'Disa' is actually the nickname of her Icelandic great-grandmother, Herdis Petra Helgason Innes! When asked about a favourite folk or fairy tale, Disa was quick to share that she prefers more realistic tales, nothing too sanitized! The Yule Lads, an elf tale, is one of her favs. www.dscribe.ca

Photographer Hugh Conacher is also a lighting designer whose work is appreciated locally, nationally and internationally. 
Although he isn't actually connected to the island by blood, he has definitely caught the Icelandic bug having worked there in the past. Hugh's daughter said he always encouraged reading at home. When asked what was on the bookshelves as a child, she shared a memory of her father reading her the ancient Greek myth of Persephone.

Producer and Sound Coordinator Angela Chalmers lives in Winnipeg with family scattered through Manitoba's Interlake area.
In the past, Angela worked as an actor. Recently, she co-launched a documentary production company that uses audio and video to capturing family stories and tell social issue triumphs. Of Icelandic descent, Angela grew up hearing Icelandic folk tales and fell in love with them. www.aihproductions.com

Project and Writing Consultant Mary Skanderbeg spent years coordinating on of Manitoba's biggest events - the provincial elections! Prior to that, she spent over 10 years working as one of the first special needs teaching assistants in Winnipeg's public schools.Of Icelandic heritage, Mary is now an Amma (Icelandic for Grandma) 10 times over! Recently retired, she moved to Gimli, MB and now divides her time between consulting, travelling, babysitting and revisiting her passion for creative writing for children. A much requested favourite by her - The Princess and the Nut-pea.

How will the project be completed?
The project is divided into four phases:

1.  Research and
Fundraising: 

This is the phase we are completing right now. Research has included:




Learning about Icelandic folktales
Working through the logistics of executing the project's development and design
Putting together the most incredible team

Our primary focus from now until the end of August will be to continue with fundraising and prepare for Iceland. (April 2015-August 2015)



2.  Development:

All team members will have a role to play during the Development phase:


With the support of Jon Gustafsson, Hugh Conacher and Angela Chalmers will travel to Iceland to gather the photographs, stories and sounds needed to begin creating the books. Partnerships will be explored for distribution and future development of the books in Icelandic.
Disa Kauk will develop and hone her own technique to be used while illustrating on top of the photos being gathered.

After identifying themes for the stories, Mary Skanderbeg will begin sourcing specific folktales we will use. (September 2015-November 2015)


3. Design and Edit:
Materials will be compiled, story will be completed and the layout will be finalized. The Tindra Tales stories will then be edited. (December 2015-May 2016)
4.  Production and Distribution:
The Tindra Tales books will be printed using the highest of quality in everything. As these books have such a broad audience base, distribution will be a large task best conquered at the appropriate time by the most qualified people. (June 2016-November 2016) 
We are currently aiming for a November 2016 launch and distribution date - just in time for the 2016 holiday season!


Looking Forward
 The Tindra Tales project has great potential for future endeavors - whether that is more Icelandic tales, tales from another country or the development of additional presentation formats of the books we will be creating. Join the team and be there from the start!Potential Challenge

Our ability to maintain the timeline outlined above will be determined by our ability to raise the money needed to complete each phase of the project.

AK Jewellery Design is a new company that produces lovely, elegant well-made
pieces of jewellery that aren't mass produced but also aren't wildly expensive.<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I create jewellery for discerning women who want to feel wonderful. We use quality materials because, much like the best ingredients produce the best food, using the best quality gems, silver and gold, leads to the loveliest jewellery.</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">      </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The company has got off to a great start, using savings and borrowing money, but I really want to grow the company and <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">develop it, and I’d love you to be involved.</span></p>
<p>I'm not expecting
anything for nothing, and if you pledge money you’ll receive jewellery worth
more than the money you pledge, along with a certificate, newsletter,
invitations and the chance to see our new designs, and meet the designer (and even have a range of jewellery named after you or your loved one - take a look at our amazing rewards &amp; perks). <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">  </span></p>

<p><b>A bit more about AK:</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I have always loved fashion &amp; design and started going on jewellery courses a few years ago, keen to design and make my own pieces. What started as a fun way to spend the evenings developed into an obsession! Loads of design courses, art courses, certificates and years of practice and I found people always asked me where I got my jewellery from. When I said I made it, they were amazed...so I decided to set up my own company...just a small organisation, operating from the conservatory.</span></p>

<p>My primary aim was to fill the gap. To create beautiful, simple, elegant <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">jewellery for women aged 40+ who are not catered for by many current </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">companies who focus on mass production of cheap jewellery for younger women. I also wanted to make sure that the jewellery was </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">affordable!</span></p>

It sits directly on your skin so is close to you physically as well as emotionally. And it can stay with you for a lifetime. The best items of jewellery are like small pieces of art. They reflect how you feel and represent who you are. And they make you look absolutely gorgeous in the process!</span><br/></p>

<p><b>What do we do that's different?</b></p>
<p>Every collection I produce has a lovely story behind it. My jewellery is driven by art and creativity. It's not wacky and unwearable, and neither is it monstrously expensive. It's just a bit different.</p>
<p>For example, there's a range called Daisy Crazy which <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">burst into life after I went rushing through London one day, and dashed through Hyde Park. It’s a very elegant park, and at the Kensington end of it there were mainly people dressed in a business-like manner…speeding through with their mobile phones pressed to their ears, locked in their own corporate worlds.</span></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p>Then, on the grass to the side, I saw a group of young women making daisy chains. The scene was beautiful – ­ gorgeous sunshine and rich, green grass, with the women all wearing light summer colours as they smiled and created.</p>
<p>Every daisy chain they made, they placed onto their friend’s head, wrist or around their neck…each looking more ethereal and more lovely with every additional daisy chain.</p>
<p>They were so happy in one another’s company and so ‘in the moment’ – a million miles away from the hustle and bustle just outside the park.</p>
<p>It was enchanting, and reminded me of the beauty and simplicity of nature and the loveliness of female friendship.</p>
<p>I wanted to try and recreate some of that feeling in jewellery, so I dragged myself  away and designed a range of silver and gold daisy jewellery that could all be worn together…like the daisy chains on that lovely summer’s afternoon in the park, or on their own – as one, simple elegant piece inspired by loveliness and tranquillity in a busy life.</p>
<p>How lovely to have a formal suit, and a hectic, busy life, but have a simple silver and gold daisy necklace or earrings to remind you that nature is around every corner, and female friends are valuable and special.</p>

AK Jewellery Design is a new company that produces lovely, elegant well-made
pieces of jewellery that aren't mass produced but also aren't wildly expensive.

I create jewellery for discerning women who want to feel wonderful. We use quality materials because, much like the best ingredients produce the best food, using the best quality gems, silver and gold, leads to the loveliest jewellery.      

The company has got off to a great start, using savings and borrowing money, but I really want to grow the company and develop it, and I’d love you to be involved.
I'm not expecting
anything for nothing, and if you pledge money you’ll receive jewellery worth
more than the money you pledge, along with a certificate, newsletter,
invitations and the chance to see our new designs, and meet the designer (and even have a range of jewellery named after you or your loved one - take a look at our amazing rewards & perks).   

We'd love you to get involved in a project that's creative and artistic but based on solid business sense!
 
A bit more about AK:
I have always loved fashion & design and started going on jewellery courses a few years ago, keen to design and make my own pieces. What started as a fun way to spend the evenings developed into an obsession! Loads of design courses, art courses, certificates and years of practice and I found people always asked me where I got my jewellery from. When I said I made it, they were amazed...so I decided to set up my own company...just a small organisation, operating from the conservatory.

My primary aim was to fill the gap. To create beautiful, simple, elegant jewellery for women aged 40+ who are not catered for by many current companies who focus on mass production of cheap jewellery for younger women. I also wanted to make sure that the jewellery was affordable!

 
Attributes


The jewellery is modern, pretty and easy-to wear. We use sterling silver and fine silver as well as precious stones and 22k gold. The price points are reasonable - most items in our collection can be bought for under £50, and there are no items on the site for over £150.

 
Why jewellery?
Jewellery can be amazing: it can be vibrant, personal and enchanting. It sits directly on your skin so is close to you physically as well as emotionally. And it can stay with you for a lifetime. The best items of jewellery are like small pieces of art. They reflect how you feel and represent who you are. And they make you look absolutely gorgeous in the process!

Why are we on IndieGoGo?
I need to expand the business but don't want to borrow from a bank, because I love the idea of the project being led and molded by those who love and wear the jewellery. 
   
What do we do that's different?
Every collection I produce has a lovely story behind it. My jewellery is driven by art and creativity. It's not wacky and unwearable, and neither is it monstrously expensive. It's just a bit different.
For example, there's a range called Daisy Crazy which burst into life after I went rushing through London one day, and dashed through Hyde Park. It’s a very elegant park, and at the Kensington end of it there were mainly people dressed in a business-like manner…speeding through with their mobile phones pressed to their ears, locked in their own corporate worlds.


Then, on the grass to the side, I saw a group of young women making daisy chains. The scene was beautiful – ­ gorgeous sunshine and rich, green grass, with the women all wearing light summer colours as they smiled and created.
Every daisy chain they made, they placed onto their friend’s head, wrist or around their neck…each looking more ethereal and more lovely with every additional daisy chain.
They were so happy in one another’s company and so ‘in the moment’ – a million miles away from the hustle and bustle just outside the park.
It was enchanting, and reminded me of the beauty and simplicity of nature and the loveliness of female friendship.
I wanted to try and recreate some of that feeling in jewellery, so I dragged myself  away and designed a range of silver and gold daisy jewellery that could all be worn together…like the daisy chains on that lovely summer’s afternoon in the park, or on their own – as one, simple elegant piece inspired by loveliness and tranquillity in a busy life.
How lovely to have a formal suit, and a hectic, busy life, but have a simple silver and gold daisy necklace or earrings to remind you that nature is around every corner, and female friends are valuable and special.
Daisy Crazy:       
Use of Funds:

Incase you're wondering what we will be doing to grow the business...these are our plans:
1. I need to bring in two apprentices who I can train in jewellery making, as well as an assistant to organise fulfillment and the day to day business of AK Jewellery

2. PR: I need to get out there and make sure everyone knows about us, and what we're doing. This is one of the critical areas of setting up a new business, but it's so hard to spend money on it when you're trying to keep costs down.
3. Marketing: We want to retain a PR firm for crucial times, like leading up to Valentines Day, to make sure our lovely jewels are in people's minds when they're thinking about buying presents
4. Social media: We need to do a social media blitz with video / images / website links
5. Accounts: Yep - the boring side. But we need to bring on an accountant to make sure this side of the business is in order. 
6. Buying: In order to keep things fresh and exciting I need to get out there and source the right materials and come back with stones & gems that are exactly right for us. I also need to be able to start buying in bulk in order to get the best deals possible.
7. Business: I need expert advice on how to position and run the business.
  
Please join us! We have lots of exciting plans, but we need investment to get them off the ground. Thanks for your time!

<p>I had travelled widely and always took the opportunity to view old watches wherever I was able, and seeing the state of some of these elderly beauties, lying unloved and unwanted in the face of the quartz revolution saddened me.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>I have developed a worldwide customer base, with a superb feedback rating, and I wish to further develop this marketplace with more diverse and upmarket timepieces, as these are much sought after in more recent times, as collectors have been drawn back into the mechanical, quality watch market, and India is a good place to find these.</p>

<h3>SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESS</h3>
<p>As a small business owner it is incredibly hard to struggle in the market and get your products seen. Many artists own and manage multiple online shops, attend a million craft fairs, and approach local shops to carry their goods with the hopes of making a living and having their work reach your hands. Artists typically sell their work at a wholesale price making anywhere from 20-50%  profit on the goods they make with no guarantee they are making it to consumers. Other times they are asked to give work for free in return for marketing or social media. The Beehive Box wants to combat this. Creatives need and should be making a living for the work they make and The Beehive Box plans to support artist income EVERY step of the way.

<h3>KNOWING WHAT YOU SPEND</h3>
<p>From buying and selling cards first hand I know how much people love paper products. The one thing that confused me was how people sourced their cards. My own friends were often guilty of this and were always apologising  for giving me a ""cheap"" card for occasions they bought at the local drug store ten minutes before a party. What they didn't realise is they were paying the same amount for their cheap card as they would from a handmade local maker or small shop. The average card is fairly expensive and many people do not realise how much that money adds up after a while. The Beehive Box plans to source and curate cute and adorable products at a fair and reasonable price. So your cost is the same as stopping by a local CVS but we come to you. This also means you will now be the cool person at the party who brought the adorable card. Your friends and family will thank you. </p>

<h3>HAVE FUN</h3>
<p>I am obsessed with box subscriptions. I know they are the rage right now but that is because of their awesomeness. It is an affordable way to receive unique products you never knew about. What I love about The Beehive Box is it the gift that keeps giving. Many of the cards or products inside the box can be given as gifts or for occasions. They are also for YOU! Let's be real. I am going to keep a lot of it. Frame some prints/cards, get some new notebooks, and discover some artists you never knew. </p>

 My name is Marisa and I own The Fuzzy Bee Paper Company, an online paper store illustrated and printed in Glasgow, Scotland. For many years I have offered a monthly card subscription in my shop and always dreamed of expanding this part of my business. I am finally achieving this goal by launching The Beehive Box, a tiered subscription service of locally curated, handpicked and awesome illustrators and makers that come right to your door. Beehive Box has 3 principles: 



Our 3 Beehive Principles






SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESS
As a small business owner it is incredibly hard to struggle in the market and get your products seen. Many artists own and manage multiple online shops, attend a million craft fairs, and approach local shops to carry their goods with the hopes of making a living and having their work reach your hands. Artists typically sell their work at a wholesale price making anywhere from 20-50%  profit on the goods they make with no guarantee they are making it to consumers. Other times they are asked to give work for free in return for marketing or social media. The Beehive Box wants to combat this. Creatives need and should be making a living for the work they make and The Beehive Box plans to support artist income EVERY step of the way. Anytime an item is purchased in a box or our online shop they will be receiving at minimum 50% profit. 



KNOWING WHAT YOU SPEND
From buying and selling cards first hand I know how much people love paper products. The one thing that confused me was how people sourced their cards. My own friends were often guilty of this and were always apologising  for giving me a ""cheap"" card for occasions they bought at the local drug store ten minutes before a party. What they didn't realise is they were paying the same amount for their cheap card as they would from a handmade local maker or small shop. The average card is fairly expensive and many people do not realise how much that money adds up after a while. The Beehive Box plans to source and curate cute and adorable products at a fair and reasonable price. So your cost is the same as stopping by a local CVS but we come to you. This also means you will now be the cool person at the party who brought the adorable card. Your friends and family will thank you. 



HAVE FUN
I am obsessed with box subscriptions. I know they are the rage right now but that is because of their awesomeness. It is an affordable way to receive unique products you never knew about. What I love about The Beehive Box is it the gift that keeps giving. Many of the cards or products inside the box can be given as gifts or for occasions. They are also for YOU! Let's be real. I am going to keep a lot of it. Frame some prints/cards, get some new notebooks, and discover some artists you never knew.

ethical. Finally ,she  focuses her ideas and projects believing  that

N3RNatalia
Rachel Radwan-Richard, the creator of N3R was born and raised in
Warsaw, the capital of Poland. Her mother is Polish and her father
has Canadian and Native American roots. Natalia has been a very
creative person since a very young age. She did a lot of artistic
activities in the pass that helped her develop her passion for art
and fashion. Her biggest inspiration is her mother Wanda, who
introduced her into the Opera world. The Polish National Opera
specially, gave this young designer the inspiration to explore her
artistic skills.

The
creation of N3R and what is actually N3R?N3R,
the name of the brand ,is basically  inspired by the name of the
creator: Natalia Rachel Radwan-Richard.
But there is also a deeper meaning to it ,since it also stand for
three basic and descriptive concepts. Recycle, Re-use
and Reduce.
Those three words really express the direction Natalia wants her
current and future collections to take. One of the most important
things when she creates, is the use of recycled fabric. She really
cares about the environment and believes that there are so many ways
to look fabulous, while remaining socially conscious and fashionably
ethical. Finally ,she  focuses her ideas and projects believing  that
supporting conscious fashion, folkloric fabrics, recycled items and
the use of local clothing’s can lead to great and inspirational
creations. All these ideals combined together are N3R. As Antoine
Lavoisie said: “Nothing is lost, nothing is created, and everything
is transformed”
The
philosophy of buying local came from the principle of buying is
voting. Our society needs to be more responsible when consuming. The
purpose is not to convince the public to stop buying brand new items,
but to convince them that a more fair, ethical and consciously
purchased fashion is possible while supporting and contributing for
the economy. 

The Goal
If
this project is successfully funded, N3R will be able to produce more
clothing and become more accessible to other cities and costumers. In
order to expand the concept of wearing fair, ethical, and consciously
purchased fashion made with love and recycled fabrics.Why 3000$ ?This amount is necessary for the equipment, for the fabrics, to pay press & publicity and also to pay the seamstress.To

<p>Fashion is ever evolving and now not only what we wear but how we sell it.  More and more teenagers are becoming financially self-sufficient with ecommerce.  Now is the time to start to teach our children innovation, &amp; entrepreneurship.  My passion is fashion and entrepreneurship. It is my goal to create a brand that marries the two to teach your girls to become captains of the industry now.</p>
<p>My name is April Clark and I created my own path to become a fashion &amp; beauty professional.  Nearly 10 years ago I sat on my living room floor and created my first fashion collection.  Fast forward to now I have been a full-time fashion professional for 4 years.  My expertise goes from fashion styling for publications to contributing to the local TV morning show to owning my own nail polish line to authoring style and beauty books.  My passion for fashion pushed me to be a successful entrepreneur.  </p>
<p>I am embarking on a new brand to take my passion for fashion and entrepreneurship to teach and inspire young girls to do what I did but at a much earlier age. Miss April Fashion Girlpreneur is inspired by my family background in the toy business.   My mother was a toy designer for some of the biggest toy companies in the business.  She is known for designing the Carrington baby doll from the hit dram Dynasty and the tummies for two of Care Bears: Cheer Bear and Funshine.   I remember seeing my mother create the best toys designed to teach children. </p>
<p>So I went back to my roots.  </p>
<p>Miss April Fashion Girlpreneur ® is an 18” fashion doll created by, Fashion Stylist and Blogger, April Clark.  Miss April was created to teach girls a creative way to start a fashion and beauty business.  Through different mediums girls will learn how to style, dress and create fashions for their doll.  Miss April will come with a fashion sketch pad, pattern, dress form and accessories to get your daughter in the entrepreneurial mindset to create the fashion collection of her dreams. Miss April will share lessons in:</p>

<p>I am seeking to build a community and following for Miss April Fashion Girlpreneur.  This campaign is about garnering support for the long-haul.  If you “buy in” to this concept now you will buy into it throughout this process.  The funds that I am seeking are to prove the validity of the concept. If 10,000 people back this project that means more to me than the amount of money raised.  I am a successful entrepreneur, I am confident I can raise the funds but I want a community of teens, tweens, creatives, fashion lovers, educators, and entrepreneurs who see the vision and want to support the vision.</p>

<p>With your contribution you will help with the creation of an original doll.

A limited edition pattern for your girls of the Miss April Fashion Girlpreneur jacket and dress is available to contributors.  I designed a t-shirt for the little fashionistas using my favorite catch phrase, ""I am a very stylish girl.""  </p>

Currently we offer our clients 1 year warranty on all custom made garments, and we would like to extend it to a lifetime guarantee with durable fabrics with well executed craftsmanship.
Rewards: 
$25 - $55 donation= customized t-shirt$75 - $150 =  Multi-Media T-Shirt$150 - $300 = Bespoke Jeans$ 300 & up  = Collaborate on one item
    The Impact
We are working with a community organization: Little Creative Class to offer sewing & pattern making classes to underpriveledged kids in New York City. When we meet our goal, we are donating our machines to the organization so that the kids have access to equipment.  Risks & Challenges
 There are risk & challenges with everything, but we are dedicated to reaching our goal by creating events with our peers to raise funds. We have our first showcase this Saturday in Brooklyn & will be diligent and active every step of the way to ensure that we reach our goal.

<div>There will initially be no music in the space because the space is sectioned and shared by other people.

Good day all, My name is O C Thomas from Corby, Northamptonshire.I have started this campaign simply to get essential support for my new shop/ creative centre project I plan to launch in Corby. 
I feel there is a lack of independent stores locally that stock unique fashion, homegrown brands and handpicked hard to find retro/vintage products. I source products that are 100% authentic and not commercial ""lookalikes"" . These products are grade A quality and originate from the 70s 80s and 90s. I will also be offering massive support to local independent brands and upcoming fashion designers.

There is also minimum support, if any, for local people wanting to create their very own clothing brands. I would offer free access to tools, equipment and guidance and this would be a huge benefit for upcoming fashion/ brand designers helping them to create a brand, a product and market it locally. My experience is in printed apparel and using illustrated/ design orientated artwork.

The shop will eventually aim to be a hub of activity and a place that offers quality retro, vintage and independent clothing at decent prices, a relaxed atmosphere and most especially, a new landmark for the town of Corby. It's backbone will focus on supporting upcoming brands and helping them launch their products using the shop as a platform and a foundation to grow.Let's come together and create yet another positive talking point for the ever changing, community strong, small business powerhouse that is Corby Town.

This collection has caught the attention of a few celebrities in the street scene such as Charlie Sloth from Radio 1xtra, rappers from Brooklyn USA and London and even the likes of Jethro Sheeran and his more well known cousin, Ed. 

For the shop project, I, myself, have already gathered enough funds to secure a small space to run the shop from and kick start the business. This will keep me in this space for a solid amount of time, enough to gather a following and upgrade to a larger premises later on.
I will run the online shop and small creative centre from this space,  hold some stock, offer collection and fittings of the products and operate my design work from a small desk. I have also invested in the beginnings of some stock which has been hard because I am yet to gain solid knowledge of my customers buying habits.
I will also be funding my own marketing campaign, website, shop branding and daily running costs.

What I Need Help With.

I have applied to and approached several local funding movements with no luck. I have been told that there is a huge lack of current available funding in Northamptonshire, which to me, seems strange as I always see lots of promotion about it. 
So I am asking for help directly from the people. The people who matter. My potential customers, local communities and genuine people who see a positive outcome in this project. People who know young creatives who will benefit from this and people who can vision the growth and success of this journey in time.
Furniture and equipment is something I cannot afford to fund.I need help to setup a small area free to use for young people wanting to create and produce their own range to sell on the shop. This are will help people brand, design and produce their very own ranges and sell them locally. 
I will make the best use of the space I currently have, fitting everything into a well designed layout, ready to use. The funding will go towards the following:



Shelving units for the clothing ( shoe racks, tall box units and ) 
 X 2 apple macs for the creative area installed with Adobe Cs6 software ( Photoshop & Illustrator) 
 X 1 large slimline desk ( for the creative area) 
 X 2 chairs ( for the creative area) 
 X 2 headphones ( for the creative area)
X 1 digital Canon 60d camera for creatives to photograph/ film their products. 
 Laminate / removable hard flooring for the space. 
X 1 Large mirror and privacy screen ( for trying on items )

X 1 sofa
Light furnishings, lighting and decor ( Including paint and services of graffiti artists, a large rug, lamps and lighting, signage for the shop )
Storage boxes and drawers for tools and loose equipment.






The Thank-you Gifts!

I never expect something for nothing so I would like to offer the following: 
A VIP loyalty card which will entitle you to 20% of ANY purchases, UNLIMITED use, for a period of 1, 2 or 3 months. 
There will only be 50-100 each of these made up and they will not be produced again. 
You will also be given your very own unique online discount code so you can use the same discount when shopping online!
Please see the PERKS section for prices on the thank-you gifts.
Your time period on the card will only start once you have made your FIRST purchase. Your card will be valid for 1, 2 or 3 months after you FIRST purchase has been made. 
    Risks & Challenges

GOALS & OTHER IDEAS.
I have some very specific goals to reach to keep this project fresh and ambitious. I also welcome new ideas and suggestions to improve any part of the project.


An efficient marketing campaign spreading across local venues such as Adrenaline Alley, The Core at Corby Cube, Tresham College, Connect FM, Cabvertising, The Compound and The Rooftop Gallery. Regular paid Facebook advertising targeting the local area within a 15 mile radius based on relevant interests in the arts, fashion, clothing and young people.

A homeless clothing service where homeless people of Corby can access clean daily clothing, donated by local organisations and contributed to by the shop.

A music section promoting local artists and selling copies of their music in the shop. A record section where music lovers can buy exclusive vinyl, dig through the crates and listen to the records on turntables provided in the shop.

</div></div>","Hello there, My name is Max and I am the founder of Woody Comb Co. We produce laser cut and engraved combs that are finished by hand. They are stylish and unique, yet functional and can be taken anywhere. They are all natural, made from Birch wood, 100% sustainable and plastic free. The combs make great gifts for events such as bachelor parties and business promotions (custom engraving available), or can also be used as your new go-to comb! Ranging in styles from a classic comb, hair pick, or even a mustache comb, we provide a product that anyone and everyone can enjoy.



The Surfboard 
About myself; I am a teenage college student majoring in Computer Science. I have always had an admiration for entrepreneurs and their different ways to make a living. After lots of thought and inspiration from my family's entrepreneurship, I came up with Woody Comb Co. The idea behind Woody Comb Co. is to provide a stylish, hand crafted, all natural, grooming comb at an affordable price, without any plastic waste. As of right now we have five different designs and new ones are in development. We plan on making them even more fun and unique!




The Stache 
The problem we face is that our equipment is not large enough to process large orders. On top of that, I am a full time student and work multiple jobs to make ends meet. I have a passion for this company and someday hope to work this business full time. We strive to grow as large as possible and with your help, we can achieve this goal much quicker and launch Woody Comb Co. into the grooming industry!


The Original

Where will your money go?



A larger Laser Machine to process more orders effectively


Research and Development of new materials and designs


Costs of Materials


Improvement of Packaging


Advertisement and Growth






The Pick



What will you get?
As donations increase, donors will receive a selection of combs, custom designs and soon to be made apparel. At set amounts, donors names will be recognized on our website as well!
What if you can't donate?

You could spread the message and make some noise about our campaign!
You can use the Indiegogo share tools!
You can mention us to your friends and family!



The Original With Ribbon Design
Woody Comb Co. has the potential to become a growing trend in stylish grooming products. This company has the opportunity to grow vastly and become more than just a small manufacturer. Spreading the name and the awesomeness of these combs is the key to success. It must be a Woody or else it's not the same! The only thing stopping us is that we do not have adequate equipment or funding for the materials and packaging. With your help we will become a known name and everyone will be talking about their Woody!
I sincerely thank you for your help and support in making my dream become a reality.
- Max

Features of the xWatch and xWatch Lite (xWatch Only Features Appear in Italics):
Available in Black, Red, Blue, Green
 
It's a Phone, or 2 -- The xWatch is an actual standalone phone when you insert a micro SIM card into the watch. Make calls directly from xWatch with no need for a phone. In addition, you can simultaneously pair your existing mobile device to xWatch allowing you make and receive calls from both numbers through one device (xWatch ONLY).

Take Pictures and Video -- xWatch is one of the only smartwatches with a built-in camera and video camera. xWatch camera functionality includes night mode, different camera settings, and the ability to use the xWatch as a remote control to control your Android smartphone camera (great for selfies!)

Blood Pressure Monitor -- keep track of your blood pressure with the built in monitor (xWatch).
Store & Listen To Music -- xWatch’s built-in audio player gives you the ability to listen to music, either stored on your phone, or stored on xWatch’s huge 8GB internal memory, right from the watch on its built-in speaker or you can pair it to bluetooth earphones for more private listening.

Health & Fitness Monitoring -- xWatch can track all of your fitness activity including steps walked, calories burned and more. xWatch is also one of the most convenient devices to use while training. Don’t carry your heavy phone around when running or exercising, instead wear xWatch.
Pair to Any Phone -- Easy pairing to your iOS or Android device using xWatch’s built-in QR code scanner or bluetooth control screen and with xWatch’s bluetooth notifier receive all alerts from your mobile phone on xWatch via sound or vibration alerts (when paired to mobile phone).

x2 Wireless Headset - We have developed the perfect bluetooth headset for the xWatch. It can be used for listening to music, or answering calls. The x2 headset paired with the xWatch is the ultimate combo for working out or anything else you don't want your actual phone for. Stay in touch without a phone with xWatch and the x2 Wireless Headset. 
Apps - get access to 1000s of apps with xWatch.

 

What We Need & What You Get

We are looking for $10,000 in funding to bring this awesome smartwatch to market and make it available to everyone.
Our perks include the xWatch, xWatch Lite, and x2 Wireless Headset
If we do not reach our goal, we will still be manufacturing our product in large quantities and get it out to as many people. 


Why xWatch?
Why is the xWatch Family of products better than other smartwatches:
We want to create a smartwatch that actually can be used like a smartphone for an affordable price so that everyone can own one.

Risks & Challenges
The main challenges/risks we face our the ability to continue getting the rubber blend for the material used in the watch strap. We have backup suppliers and are communicating with them now to make sure that we do not run into this problem.

<div><strong>Size information:</strong></div>
<ul>
<li>Origamo uses American sizes, which usually run larger than Universal sizes used in Europe.</li>
<li>You can use the size grid, to compare with some of your current Tee-shirts or Polos.</li>
<li>For Europe, you should consider taking the Origamo size one notch below your usual universal size.</li>
<li>E.g. Pick an Origamo M if you usually wear a universal L.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the size does not fit, you can contact us during 15 days after the delivery and we will organize:</p>
<ul>
<li>One size exchange in the US</li>
<li>One size exchange or refund elsewhere</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We are happy to insure size exchange, because we really want you to be fully satisfied with your Origamo polo.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please bear in mind anyway that returns have a real cost on our side, hence we would like to encourage you to use the size grid to try to pick your perfect size in the first place.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you very much.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The proceeds of this campaign will be fully reinvested in Origamo's journey to change the Fashion industry for the better.</strong></p>
<p>In practice it means that the funds gathered will be fully reinvested in the development of Origamo’s Organic and Fair Fashion concept.</p>
<p>Specifically, the campaign should help with the three following projects:</p>
<p>First, get Origamo certified under the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) for trading operations and related products.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479336434/qadwdngly6fzyouvv78y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Then, add new colors to the Pacific Collection for the summer! We already have prototypes in Light Blue and Salmon, waiting for funding to be produced... and we would warmly welcome any color idea!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479336960/pmavfy1si4et66fovnao.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Finally, initiate the creation process for two new Organic and Fair designs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organic Pima Tee collection</li>
<li>Organic Cotton Sweatshirt Quarter-zip</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>And that’s it, we have a lot on the plate, but we have already started the change in the fashion industry, let’s keep up the good work.</p>
<p>Join us on this Journey to better Fashion, make Origamo your Organic and Fair clothing brand!</p>

<p>The polos proposed in the perks are produced and on their way to Origamo's warehouse in Cambridge MA.</p>
<p>Hence we believe that the main challenge at this stage is to be able to get the Polos delivered before Christmas outside of the USA.</p>
<p>We are confident that we will achieve this goal, since our founder has lived in three countries over the last ten years, he is used to shipping many things all over the place, and has many helpful relays in each country where the perks are delivered.</p>

After this campaign the Pacific Polos will only be available in the USA.
 


The production is done and is on its way to our home base in Cambridge MA.
It is expected to arrive before the campaign’s end on Dec 12.
Hence we will deliver for Christmas in the US, and we are also confident about Christmas delivery to the other countries where we ship.

Origamo flower embroidered on the chest:

 
100% Origanic Pima Cotton from Peru:

The Peruvian Pima is a luxury cotton, one of the softest in the world because of its Extra Long Staples, and being Organic it has a much a better environmental footprint than conventional cotton.

The cotton used by Origamo complies with the rules of the U.S. and European Organic standards:
 

 
Yarn colored with Eco-Friendly and Non-Harmful dyes:

Your skin and the environment are protected.
Eco-Friendly and Non-Harmful dyes, since the factory which colors the yarn for the Pacific Polo is GOTS certified and OEKOTEX class I certified for the dyeing operations.

GOTS: The Global Organic Textile Standard is one of the most demanding international processing standards for textiles made from certified organically produced raw materials.
OEKOTEX: The OEKO-TEX® Standard 100 is a worldwide consistent and independent test and certification system for the absence of harmful substances for raw, semi-finished, and finished textile products at all processing levels.

 
Australian Mother of Pearl collar buttons:

Origamo selected the Australian Mother of Pearl for its quality and for the sustainability of its production process.
Each of these buttons is unique and has its own iridescent shine, so on top of the distinction touch they add to any outfit, these Australian Mother of Pearl buttons make each Pacific Polo slightly different, and uniquely yours.
There's one extra Australian MoP button on the inside… for life accidents.

 
Double pique knitting:

Double pique knitting, a fabric structure with higher relief than traditional single pique, allowing for a better quality feel while preserving the garment flexibility and avoiding the boxy effect.
 
Reinforced Uneven side vent:

This American style side vent is made with the same color pique tape and very well finished, and it is reinforced with a bar tag to ensure long lasting quality.
 


 
Size information:

Origamo uses American sizes, which usually run larger than Universal sizes used in Europe.
You can use the size grid, to compare with some of your current Tee-shirts or Polos.
For Europe, you should consider taking the Origamo size one notch below your usual universal size.
E.g. Pick an Origamo M if you usually wear a universal L.

If the size does not fit, you can contact us during 15 days after the delivery and we will organize:

One size exchange in the US
One size exchange or refund elsewhere

We are happy to insure size exchange, because we really want you to be fully satisfied with your Origamo polo.
Please bear in mind anyway that returns have a real cost on our side, hence we would like to encourage you to use the size grid to try to pick your perfect size in the first place.
Thank you very much.
 


The proceeds of this campaign will be fully reinvested in Origamo's journey to change the Fashion industry for the better.
In practice it means that the funds gathered will be fully reinvested in the development of Origamo’s Organic and Fair Fashion concept.
Specifically, the campaign should help with the three following projects:
First, get Origamo certified under the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS) for trading operations and related products.

 
Then, add new colors to the Pacific Collection for the summer! We already have prototypes in Light Blue and Salmon, waiting for funding to be produced... and we would warmly welcome any color idea!

 
Finally, initiate the creation process for two new Organic and Fair designs:

Organic Pima Tee collection
Organic Cotton Sweatshirt Quarter-zip

 
And that’s it, we have a lot on the plate, but we have already started the change in the fashion industry, let’s keep up the good work.
Join us on this Journey to better Fashion, make Origamo your Organic and Fair clothing brand!


 

The polos proposed in the perks are produced and on their way to Origamo's warehouse in Cambridge MA.
Hence we believe that the main challenge at this stage is to be able to get the Polos delivered before Christmas outside of the USA.
We are confident that we will achieve this goal, since our founder has lived in three countries over the last ten years, he is used to shipping many things all over the place, and has many helpful relays in each country where the perks are delivered.

The Ocean was truly the only place where I felt like I could let it all go, cry if I wanted, and just be embraced by the beautiful warm winds.  It let me feel closer to my mom, closer to myself, and connected to the life-energy that surrounds us.Like you, I find peace and freedom on the water. Paddle boarding has been my escape and my place of peace and it’s where I reclaim my center.  Today I don’t paddle to escape.  I paddle to embrace all that life is and can be.  And with my H2O pack- I’ve got everything I need! Risks and ChallengesWe are a team of professionals committed to seeing this H20 Pack on every paddle-board in the world! We’ve got “day jobs” but this is our passion.  Liquid Athlete is going to rock the water world some day (we hope) and this is our first foray into Indiegogo. We’re confident that we will meet or exceed our product-backers expectations in regards to top quality, great design and ultimate functionality.We plan to send regular updates to all our backers.For some Indiegogo campaigns, there are challenges in manufacturing followed by shipping delays. This is not an issue with the H2O pack because all the units are earmarked for final manufacturing and shipping within the next 90 days! We’ve had professional experience getting products made and shipped on time before- so you’re not going to see any of the challenges that a lot of newbies would face!Our #1 Goal is to deliver a GREAT design, the highest-quality product ever made for the Paddle-Board enthusiast – and one that exceeds ALL our Backers expectations. You’re going to love it.  We do. We’ve already seen and held a test run of finished, final, manufactured product in our hands.  We’ve tested them ON THE WATER- for weeks! You can be 100% confident in this H2O SUP Pack.  So- help fund our campaign and get a great product. FAQQuestion 1.     Are the H2O Packs really waterproof?Answer 1.     Yes >> You put any of your valuables and your phone in the waterproof compartments and be assured they’ll be safe and dry.                    Question 2.     How do you know my shipping address?Answer 2.     After the campaign ends, we’ll email a one-time survey that will collect your shipping address. We will also ask for your email address for tracking.  We ship via[USPS/UPS/FedEx] and you will get a Tracking Number when your reward ships. International orders need to provide a Phone number for customs. Every other week we will email you an UPDATE that will tell you where the process is and when to expect your reward. Please READ the UPDATES. We don't have time to answer individual requests for updates. You can CHANGE YOUR SHIPPING ADDRESS anytime (up to 48 hours before it ships) by going to the project page and hovering over your chosen reward. Thanks for supporting!                    Question 3.     What are the dimensions of the bag?Answer 3.    The length is 21"". The width at the top is 13” and the bottom is 11”Question 4.     What is the maximum load (weight) for the bag?Answer 4.     10 lbs",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><i>What I need</i></h3>
<p>I need to buy a professional 3D printer because now when bow tie leaves the 3d Printer, sanding is very difficult. And if I can not buy a new one, I will work very slowly to complete each shipment!</p>

<p>All hard bow ties that until now I've seen marketed, are without the forms of real bow tie or they have them but are fragile because are made of ceramic material and these ones cost very much! In one of my country store cost 250,00 € each!</p>

This is something that really seems to be missing in commerce today. I truly appreciate every single client and treat them like  family, for that is what they are. I know without them, my business would not exist. I would like you, as a contributor to become part of that family.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Probably one of the biggest challenges in leather work can be getting the quantities of raw material needed. I buy my Horsehide leather direct from the Horween Tannery, which is one of the oldest tanneries in the country. While it can take as long as 8-12 weeks to receive a batch of leather, I keep a steady order history of leather coming into the shop.</p>
<p>The other issue can be quality hardware. I am sourcing my custom screws and posts from a US based company with a long history manufacturing brass screw hardware. They tend to be a bit more expensive than other foreign based companies, but the fit and finish of their products is outstanding. I feel that it is best to buy quality upfront. </p>
<p>On Exotic hide perks, I have put delivery dates out further to cover delays in getting hides delivered and based on complexity of working with those hides. Obviously I would deliver early if possible.</p>

<b>Footwear Protections BOOTLOONs
</b><p>My name is Debbie Flowers. I am a widowed mother of three with one still at home. I am a hard working and smart  woman. I've worked hard all my life. I had this idea for years and am just now putting my ideas on paper and took the first step to getting a 20 year patent. I hired a patent attorney firm which made promises, and they did just that, made promises. A year has passed and no further than just a lot of paperwork.</p>
<p>I have reached a point of needing help, after spending $5000 for the patent and being informed in 0ctober23rd of this year that I owed them a balance of $6500  and it needed to be paid in full before they could go any further. I can't  work enough hours at the job I have to earn enough to pay them off in the time allotted  and find I need help. So this is the reason I have enlisted Indiegogo's help in funding my project.</p>
<p>In my past I needed footwear protection like<b> BootLoons</b> to give some protections and found none available, except newspaper and wine bottles which provided an invitation to insects and varmints to set up housekeeping. So please help me get to market to give another solution to storing footwear in the closet between wearing them.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Footwear Fashions</b><br/></p>
<p>Clothing fashions addresses a person’s
personal statement of fashionable dress in appearance, which includes footwear.
Quality brands to create your personalized style demand your upkeep attention.
Footwear needs your personal care to get the most use from your investment. <b><i>BootLoons</i></b> are
designed to give your footwear that protection.</p>
<p>For years the inventor of this
technology (Deborah Flowers) has wanted to keep her footwear in good shape
after cleaning and waxing for storage in her closet. … Until the next time for
wearing. Usually they sagged and folded to show fold seams and with use ,
cracked…. <b><i>BootLoons</i></b>
was invented to stop “storage wear”. </p>
<p>For years Deborah Flowers worked
in a field that demanded a lot standing and walking.  Hard on your feet and legs but harder on your
footwear. <b><i>BootLoons</i></b> is designed to give your
footwear assistance while in your closet, but allow good looks and better wear
the next time when worn.</p>
<p><b><i>BootLoons</i></b>  is an inflatable devise that supports and holds your footwear in an up-right position and keeps them up-right so that they wont fold over or sag when in storage, see photo and drawings.  Check out the gallery section in campaign headings.</p>
<p>Your support through this campaign
with funding will assist in funds spent towards final 20 year patent,
proto-type molds used towards production of finished <b><i>BootLoons</i></b>. <br/></p>
<p><b><i>BootLoons</i></b> can also be used as display devises to properly display sandals and boots as it is tan in color, which will not take away from the footwear being displayed.<br/></p>

My name is Debbie Flowers. I am a widowed mother of three with one still at home. I am a hard working and smart  woman. I've worked hard all my life. I had this idea for years and am just now putting my ideas on paper and took the first step to getting a 20 year patent. I hired a patent attorney firm which made promises, and they did just that, made promises. A year has passed and no further than just a lot of paperwork.
I have reached a point of needing help, after spending $5000 for the patent and being informed in 0ctober23rd of this year that I owed them a balance of $6500  and it needed to be paid in full before they could go any further. I can't  work enough hours at the job I have to earn enough to pay them off in the time allotted  and find I need help. So this is the reason I have enlisted Indiegogo's help in funding my project.
In my past I needed footwear protection like BootLoons to give some protections and found none available, except newspaper and wine bottles which provided an invitation to insects and varmints to set up housekeeping. So please help me get to market to give another solution to storing footwear in the closet between wearing them. 
Footwear Fashions
Clothing fashions addresses a person’s
personal statement of fashionable dress in appearance, which includes footwear.
Quality brands to create your personalized style demand your upkeep attention.
Footwear needs your personal care to get the most use from your investment. BootLoons are
designed to give your footwear that protection.
For years the inventor of this
technology (Deborah Flowers) has wanted to keep her footwear in good shape
after cleaning and waxing for storage in her closet. … Until the next time for
wearing. Usually they sagged and folded to show fold seams and with use ,
cracked…. BootLoons
was invented to stop “storage wear”. 
For years Deborah Flowers worked
in a field that demanded a lot standing and walking.  Hard on your feet and legs but harder on your
footwear. BootLoons is designed to give your
footwear assistance while in your closet, but allow good looks and better wear
the next time when worn.
BootLoons  is an inflatable devise that supports and holds your footwear in an up-right position and keeps them up-right so that they wont fold over or sag when in storage, see photo and drawings.  Check out the gallery section in campaign headings.
Your support through this campaign
with funding will assist in funds spent towards final 20 year patent,
proto-type molds used towards production of finished BootLoons. 
BootLoons can also be used as display devises to properly display sandals and boots as it is tan in color, which will not take away from the footwear being displayed.
 

 * Deborah Flowers: CEO  Inventor of BootLoons and will be responsible as
Spokesperson.

* Wallace Johnson: CAO Father of Deborah,
Margie, Carl and Dewayne and Advisor Coordinator of Business Operations.  Was owner and manager of two businesses from
1962 to 1997. Familiar with all the needs and filing of documents of start-ups
and operations of business operations.  


 
* Margie Johnson: CFO
Worked in State Banks and Federal Banks for 35 years in all phases of bank
operations.  Will be Financial Manager
and Electronic Transaction’s Manager for Bootloons.

Manager and Shipping Coordinator for 2 Companies for a total of 12 years and
will be responsible for shipping all BootLoons

<div><i>Challenges</i></div>
<div>BestFootball satisfait le premier point en proposant de nombreux challenges footballistiques. Il y a par exemple des exercices techniques (tours du monde, jongles assis) ou encore des exercices de précision (viser la barre transversale). Pour chacun des challenges sont définis des paliers accordant des points. Par exemple, pour le challenge ""tour du monde"" il faut en faire 1 pour atteindre le premier palier, et 3 pour atteindre le second palier. Ce système de palier est aussi couplé à un système de grades (oulà ça devient compliqué, restez concentrés!!). En effet, en fonction du nombre de points obtenu sur l'ensemble des challenges, des grades (unknown player, rising star...) sont attribués au joueur.  Tout en s'amusant sur les divers challenges, les joueurs identifient ainsi leur niveau et ce qui leur reste à réussir pour atteindre le grade ultime : Legend!</div>

<div>A l’origine du projet, il y a trois entrepreneurs formant un des trios les plus prolifiques d’Europe.
Après MSN ( Messi, Suarez, Neymar) BBC ( Benzema, Bale, Cristiano) il faudra compter sur JNJ (
Jérémie, Nassim, Joris). <br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Nassim, numéro 10</b></div>
<div>
<p>Nassim EZZAKRAOUI, dans la vie c'est un actuaire. Vous connaissez sûrement pas ce métier et on s'en fiche. Car plus qu'analyser les risques, c'est chausser ses crampons et dribbler qu'il aime par dessous tout. Joueur au sport-études de Besançon, il fait le constat qu'il ne progresse pas autant que prévu en club (et oui on a pas toujours ce à quoi on s'attend Nassim!!), mais qu'il apprend au contraire énormément en jouant seul ou avec des amis dans la rue. En 2013, alors qu’il essaie d’être recruté par une université américaine, il
prend aussi grandement conscience du manque de visibilité qu’ont les jeunes joueurs de football
amateur : Bestfootball vient de naître. </p>
<p><i>Atouts : Vision du jeu, accélération du jeu</i></p>
<p><i>Fonction : CEO</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>Jérémie, numéro 9</h4>
<div><p>Jérémie Karege travaille en tant que Business Manager dans le cabinet de conseil Capgemini. C'est aux Etats-Unis qu'il rencontre Nassim et s'intéresse au projet.Sa passion : le foot. Il a pu jouer aux 4 coins du monde et, à défaut d’être un
numéro 9 sur le terrain, Jérémie est avant tout un numéro 9 dans la vie! Et comme tout numéro 9 qui se respecte il n’a qu’une obsession, le but ! A travers son sang-froid qui le caractérise, Jérémie espère marquer ce qui serait son plus beau but : faire de Bestfootball une interface mondialement reconnue. </p></div>
<div><i>Atouts : Placements, Intuition, Vitesse</i></div>
<div><i>Fonction : COO</i></div>
<div><b><h4>Joris, numéro 3</h4></b></div>
<p></p>
Joris HART est étudiant en master d'ergonomie et ingénierie des activités sportives à l'université de Savoie. Ses grandes passions sont le parapente, le foot et... et la programmation web (Et oui entre un saut dans le vide et un match de foot, il a le temps de nous faire quelques lignes de codes)! Après une première tentative de start up dans le football (localisation et création de matchs entre amis), il crée sa plateforme de services (création de sites web pour particuliers). Séduit par le projet Bestfootball et la vision qui l'accompagne, Il s'associe à Jérémie et Nassim en Octobre 2015.<br/>

<p><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Ok une bonne question! Alors on va y répondre avec le sérieux qu'elle exige :)</i><br/></p>
<p>Ce projet est le fruit de notre observation du football, et de notre propre expérience dans ce milieu. On adore notre sport. C'est notre passion. On veut œuvrer à améliorer ce qui peut l'être.<br/></p>
<p>Aujourd'hui, les résultats priment avant tout, même dans les catégories de jeunes. En club, les qualités physiques sont ainsi recherchées au détriment des qualités techniques afin de satisfaire l'objectif de résultats immédiats ; ayant pour effet de délaisser énormément de joueurs à fort potentiel mais dont le physique ne permet pas encore d'être assez efficaces. S'ajoute à ceci le conformisme des entraînements. Cela a pour effet de ""brider"" les jeunes joueurs, qui ressentent cette pression, et tentent donc moins de choses à l'entrainement. Les grandes stars telles que Zidane ont souvent confié elles-même avoir développé leur potentiel technique grâce aux heures de football avec leurs amis. C'est pendant ces heures que le joueur peut s'amuser, laisser libre cours à sa créativité, à la prise de risque et ainsi réellement progresser. Or aujourd'hui les jeunes jouent de moins en moins entre eux (la faute à fifa 16? peut-être ^^) et c'est pourquoi Bestfootball tente de ramener cet état d'esprit, cette envie d'apprendre et de progresser chez les jeunes joueurs.</p>
<p>De plus, les jeunes joueurs amateurs manquent de visibilité et n'ont pas toujours la possibilité de se faire remarquer. En effet, les recruteurs aussi bons soient-ils, ne peuvent pas couvrir tout le territoire facilement. Un très bon joueur peut ainsi louper son match lors de l'unique passage du recruteur... Bestfootball permet à chacun de montrer ce qu'il sait faire et donne la chance aux talents de faire parler d'eux et de se faire repérer.</p>

non plus sérieusement, développer toutes les autres fonctionnalités que l'on espère mettre en place sur notre duo site/application
Rendre l'application totalement utilisable indépendamment du site web
Obtenir le nom de domaine Bestfootball.com
Travailler sur la communication/publicité afin de développer le concept à l'international.





Et puis, grâce à toi encore (décidément tu as un grand rôle aujourd'hui!), on aura un vrai aperçu de l'engouement que peut susciter notre projet et donc de son réel potentiel! 
Alors, si tu partages notre amour du football, notre envie de le transmettre, notre ambition de mettre le plaisir au coeur de sa pratique, et que tu as envie d'accompagner ce projet, n'hésite pas à nous aider !!







C'est vrai on ne vous a pas complètement expliqué. Allez c'est parti !

Les personnes ont deux leviers de motivations quand il s’agit d’apprendre :
le sentiment de bien progresser, et la possibilité de montrer aux autres cette
progression afin de se comparer.




Challenges
BestFootball satisfait le premier point en proposant de nombreux challenges footballistiques. Il y a par exemple des exercices techniques (tours du monde, jongles assis) ou encore des exercices de précision (viser la barre transversale). Pour chacun des challenges sont définis des paliers accordant des points. Par exemple, pour le challenge ""tour du monde"" il faut en faire 1 pour atteindre le premier palier, et 3 pour atteindre le second palier. Ce système de palier est aussi couplé à un système de grades (oulà ça devient compliqué, restez concentrés!!). En effet, en fonction du nombre de points obtenu sur l'ensemble des challenges, des grades (unknown player, rising star...) sont attribués au joueur.  Tout en s'amusant sur les divers challenges, les joueurs identifient ainsi leur niveau et ce qui leur reste à réussir pour atteindre le grade ultime : Legend!







 Duels et classements

Vous attendez notre réponse au deuxième point? Elle est ici :)
Premièrement, Bestfootball permet aux joueurs de se défier entre eux sur le challenge qu'ils veulent!  Voilà, place aux 1 vs 1! 
Ensuite, on a établi plusieurs classements pour que les joueurs puissent se situer quant à leur niveau! Les joueurs pourront se comparer ainsi à leurs amis, ou aux joueurs à l'autre bout de la terre.
J'espère cette partie t'a pas trop fatigué! Il te reste encore quelques lignes si tu veux découvrir les trois personnages derrière Bestfootball :)















A l’origine du projet, il y a trois entrepreneurs formant un des trios les plus prolifiques d’Europe.
Après MSN ( Messi, Suarez, Neymar) BBC ( Benzema, Bale, Cristiano) il faudra compter sur JNJ (
Jérémie, Nassim, Joris). 


Nassim, numéro 10

Nassim EZZAKRAOUI, dans la vie c'est un actuaire. Vous connaissez sûrement pas ce métier et on s'en fiche. Car plus qu'analyser les risques, c'est chausser ses crampons et dribbler qu'il aime par dessous tout. Joueur au sport-études de Besançon, il fait le constat qu'il ne progresse pas autant que prévu en club (et oui on a pas toujours ce à quoi on s'attend Nassim!!), mais qu'il apprend au contraire énormément en jouant seul ou avec des amis dans la rue. En 2013, alors qu’il essaie d’être recruté par une université américaine, il
prend aussi grandement conscience du manque de visibilité qu’ont les jeunes joueurs de football
amateur : Bestfootball vient de naître. 
Atouts : Vision du jeu, accélération du jeu
Fonction : CEO


Jérémie, numéro 9
Jérémie Karege travaille en tant que Business Manager dans le cabinet de conseil Capgemini. C'est aux Etats-Unis qu'il rencontre Nassim et s'intéresse au projet.Sa passion : le foot. Il a pu jouer aux 4 coins du monde et, à défaut d’être un
numéro 9 sur le terrain, Jérémie est avant tout un numéro 9 dans la vie! Et comme tout numéro 9 qui se respecte il n’a qu’une obsession, le but ! A travers son sang-froid qui le caractérise, Jérémie espère marquer ce qui serait son plus beau but : faire de Bestfootball une interface mondialement reconnue. 
Atouts : Placements, Intuition, Vitesse
Fonction : COO
Joris, numéro 3

Joris HART est étudiant en master d'ergonomie et ingénierie des activités sportives à l'université de Savoie. Ses grandes passions sont le parapente, le foot et... et la programmation web (Et oui entre un saut dans le vide et un match de foot, il a le temps de nous faire quelques lignes de codes)! Après une première tentative de start up dans le football (localisation et création de matchs entre amis), il crée sa plateforme de services (création de sites web pour particuliers). Séduit par le projet Bestfootball et la vision qui l'accompagne, Il s'associe à Jérémie et Nassim en Octobre 2015.

Atouts : Collectif, Précis, Travailleur
Fonction : CTO




Ok une bonne question! Alors on va y répondre avec le sérieux qu'elle exige :)
Ce projet est le fruit de notre observation du football, et de notre propre expérience dans ce milieu. On adore notre sport. C'est notre passion. On veut œuvrer à améliorer ce qui peut l'être.
Aujourd'hui, les résultats priment avant tout, même dans les catégories de jeunes. En club, les qualités physiques sont ainsi recherchées au détriment des qualités techniques afin de satisfaire l'objectif de résultats immédiats ; ayant pour effet de délaisser énormément de joueurs à fort potentiel mais dont le physique ne permet pas encore d'être assez efficaces. S'ajoute à ceci le conformisme des entraînements. Cela a pour effet de ""brider"" les jeunes joueurs, qui ressentent cette pression, et tentent donc moins de choses à l'entrainement. Les grandes stars telles que Zidane ont souvent confié elles-même avoir développé leur potentiel technique grâce aux heures de football avec leurs amis. C'est pendant ces heures que le joueur peut s'amuser, laisser libre cours à sa créativité, à la prise de risque et ainsi réellement progresser. Or aujourd'hui les jeunes jouent de moins en moins entre eux (la faute à fifa 16? peut-être ^^) et c'est pourquoi Bestfootball tente de ramener cet état d'esprit, cette envie d'apprendre et de progresser chez les jeunes joueurs.
De plus, les jeunes joueurs amateurs manquent de visibilité et n'ont pas toujours la possibilité de se faire remarquer. En effet, les recruteurs aussi bons soient-ils, ne peuvent pas couvrir tout le territoire facilement. Un très bon joueur peut ainsi louper son match lors de l'unique passage du recruteur... Bestfootball permet à chacun de montrer ce qu'il sait faire et donne la chance aux talents de faire parler d'eux et de se faire repérer.



Ok, parfait c'est ce qu'on espère pour tous ceux qui arrivent jusqu'ici! :)
N'oubliez pas, l'aide financière n'est pas la seule aide possible! Si vous pouvez parler de ce projet et de cette campagne autour de vous (vos amis, les outils de partage Indiegogo, réseaux sociaux ect...) on vous sera ultra reconnaissant! Rien de mieux qu'une bonne publicité par vous ! 
L'équipe Bestfootball vous remercie pour votre attention, et surtout vous tiendra au courant des avancées! à bientôt donc!!
Nassim, Jérémie et Joris

<h3>Heels for a Happier World</h3>
<p>I'm guilty.  You're guilty.  So many of us are guilty. Of buying shoes which we only end up wearing once or twice.  But ........ ""shoe guilt"" can now be a thing of the past.</p>
<p>My name is Shaherazad and I've worked in senior management roles for British retailers for the last 20 years.  Tired of aching feet due to poorly constructed heels I decided to invent a heel which would take me (and women just like you) from the boardroom to the bar with poise, grace and elegance.</p>
<p>100% of the operating profits (the money I make after costs) are invested in to my partnership with GlobalGiving UK who are based in London.  This means that women and girls living in poverty can gain an education thanks to women who are able to buy themselves my luxury heels.  That means when you support Shoes by Shaherazad you are not only rewarding yourself but you are also helping women around the world to find ways to lift themselves out of poverty.</p>
<p>I do not take a salary from the business.  I only take out costs to buy more shoes and market the products.  Your contribution will help me to develop my range further so that together we can help even more women and girls to go to school.</p>
<p><font>This is truly a shopping opportunity without any guilt.  You will love the product and you will love the good deeds you do as a result of buying in to Shoes by Shaherazad.  </font></p>
<p><font>Ditch the guilt and say ""Hello"" to your new heels which you will wear time and time again.  You only have to Google my brand to see how many brilliant independent reviews there are.</font></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is my first Indiegogo campaign and I'd love to raise £1000 to develop more designs</li>
<li>For backing the project, you can get 18 hour heels, jewellery and crystal clutch purses.</li>
<li>50% of every supporter's pledge will go to educate a woman or girl in need (So, £500 to develop new designs and £500 to GlobalGiving UK when I hit my £1000 target).</li>
<li>Should the £1000 target not be met I will top up the gap in funds with a loan.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>These shoes will truly change how you feel about long days and wearing heels.</li>
<li>Imagine.  One shoe, many looks through the interchangeable shoellery straps.</li>
<li>And just look at the happy faces of women and girls who have benefitted from an education due to the profits.  Here's a photo from one of the schools which benefitted in Kenya.  You can read about the many other girls who have been helped around the world at <a href=""http://www.shaherazad.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.shaherazad.com</a> and at <a href=""https://www.shaherazad.com/pages/heels-with-purpose"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.shaherazad.com/pages/heels-with-purpose</a>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All of my product is made in Britain to maintain luxurious standards.  This creates a high cost base but it's important to my brand to be manufactured ethically.  I need to maintain a strong rate of orders to continue British supply and am managing this challenge by raising funds across a number of channels.  Every backer helps.</p>

100% of the operating profits (the money I make after costs) are invested in to my partnership with GlobalGiving UK who are based in London.  This means that women and girls living in poverty can gain an education thanks to women who are able to buy themselves my luxury heels.  That means when you support Shoes by Shaherazad you are not only rewarding yourself but you are also helping women around the world to find ways to lift themselves out of poverty.
I do not take a salary from the business.  I only take out costs to buy more shoes and market the products.  Your contribution will help me to develop my range further so that together we can help even more women and girls to go to school.
This is truly a shopping opportunity without any guilt.  You will love the product and you will love the good deeds you do as a result of buying in to Shoes by Shaherazad.  
Ditch the guilt and say ""Hello"" to your new heels which you will wear time and time again.  You only have to Google my brand to see how many brilliant independent reviews there are.

What We Need & What You Get

This is my first Indiegogo campaign and I'd love to raise £1000 to develop more designs
For backing the project, you can get 18 hour heels, jewellery and crystal clutch purses.
50% of every supporter's pledge will go to educate a woman or girl in need (So, £500 to develop new designs and £500 to GlobalGiving UK when I hit my £1000 target).
Should the £1000 target not be met I will top up the gap in funds with a loan.


The Impact

These shoes will truly change how you feel about long days and wearing heels.
Imagine.  One shoe, many looks through the interchangeable shoellery straps.
And just look at the happy faces of women and girls who have benefitted from an education due to the profits.  Here's a photo from one of the schools which benefitted in Kenya.  You can read about the many other girls who have been helped around the world at http://www.shaherazad.com and at https://www.shaherazad.com/pages/heels-with-purpose




Risks & Challenges
All of my product is made in Britain to maintain luxurious standards.  This creates a high cost base but it's important to my brand to be manufactured ethically.  I need to maintain a strong rate of orders to continue British supply and am managing this challenge by raising funds across a number of channels.  Every backer helps.

Other Ways You Can Help

If you can't help fund us but like what we're doing please do help spread the word.  
We do not need miracles to change the world, we only need each other.

Thank you so much for your support.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>We are PITOT Watches, developing watches inspired by fighter jets.</p>
<p>I'm Thomas, a former RDAF aircraft mechanic, served on F-16 and S-61 rescue helicopters. Later I worked in SAS and Monarch(UK) on Airbus, Boeing, and Gulfstream.</p>
<p>We have run 5 crowdfunding campaigns before to fund the development and production of our first 300 pieces of the F-14 Tomcat inspired watches, and based on these results we managed to attract an investor to help us grow our company and now we can move forward to focus on a new model inspired by the F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">DANISH DESIGN - MADE IN GERMANY</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>PITOT watches introducing fighter jet-inspired watch</h3>
<p>This campaign will help with the production of the prototype of the F/A-18 Hornet inspired watch with swiss mechanical or quartz movement and made in Titanium aircraft quality with a titanium bracelet/black leather strap or titanium bracelet/blue rubber strap for the blue carbon dial.</p>
<p>Our watches are designed in Denmark by a former aircraft mechanic from the Royal Danish Air Force with the help of a swiss watch designer and assembled in Germany.</p>
<p>We work together with a pilot in the US who test-fly our prototype watches in an F5 Tiger jet. We will show cockpit videos later when we have the prototype ready.</p>
<p>With your help, we can grow our company and help us make good quality watches inspired by fighter jets and made for the people who loves fighter jets as we do.</p>
<p>We offer a 50% discount on the expected retail price because we are in the early concept stage, and with your help, we can start the prototype production and also offer you a great deal.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Only 10 of each model with 50% on this early stage</h3>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p>The inspiration for our new aviator watch comes from one of my favorites, the F/A-18 Hornet which first flight was in 1978. It is in service in 8 countries nowadays and the picture below shows a Canadian version called the CF-18. The F/A-18 Hornet is built for navy carrierships and operate as such in the US Navy, other countries like Finland, Spain, and Schweiz use them in the Air Force. The hook and the towbar are disabled via the circuit breakers when not operation on carrier ships.</p>
<p>This watch design is inspired by key features from the F/A-18 Hornet as shown below.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603488470/m8ifthislac3nusgp8gb.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>Here shown a Canadian CF-18 Hornet.</i></p>

<li>Hour/Min hand inspired by the front wings close to the cockpit</li>
<li>The second hand inspired by the pattern on the ejection seat handle.</li>
<li>Carbon fiber dial because F/A-18 Hornet was the first fighter-jet to have carbon-fiber wings.</li>
<li>Black/Yellow colors on dial inspired from the cockpit buttons and instruments.</li>
<li>Watch case inspired by the round shape in general of the airplane.</li>

<h3>Bracelet</h3>
<p>We offer a titanium 22 mm bracelet with pattern references from the tail fins with a 20-degree angle to each side. If you prefer a nice black leather strap for the black dial or blue rubber for the blue dial, we can offer that instead.</p>
<h3>Finish</h3>
<p>Watchcase and bracelet come with a fine brush with polished edges.</p>

<h3>Rear case:</h3>
<p>The manual wind with the Sellita SW510 M comes with a see-through case.</p>
<p>The Quartz battery comes with a closed case, we will come up with a nice engraving that is inspired by the fighter jet.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Materials</h3>
<p>Both the case and the bracelet are made in Titanium. We want to use the EcoTitanium material from the French factory that recycles titanium from leftovers from airplane production, if that is not possible we use the titanium grade 5 airplane quality.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603445219/gazshnetd3hxkwel4fsk.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>picture credit to EcoTitanium factory</i></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need funding for prototype production and offer a good discount compared to the expected retail price.</p>
<p>You get a low price on the F/A-18 Hornet inspired watch made in a titanium case with a titanium bracelet or black leather strap.</p>
<p>The watch comes with a Swiss Sellita SW510 M manual wind movement or a Swiss Ronda Quartz and is assembled in a German factory with high-quality control to reflect the high quality of the fighter jets.</p>
<p>We run this campaign as flexible funding and use all the funding raised for the prototype and development of the watch.</p>
<p>Later in 2021 when the prototype is ready, we gonna run a big crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter together with an agency to fund the production.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Design and research</h3>
<p>The F/A-18 Hornet replaced the F-14 Tomcat in the US Navy and later sold to the airforce and Navy in other countries and are flying in the US, Finland, Spain, Australia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Schweiz, and Canada as CF-18 Hornet. </p>
<p>The F/A-18 Super Hornet, with the square air intakes, is slowly taking over for the F/A-18 Hornet, and the fighter jet used in the new Top Gun: Maverick, has been repainted and are now the first F/A-18 Super Hornet flying in the Blue Angels demo team.</p>
<p>We have based our watch design with inspiration from the F/A-18 Hornet with the round air intakes.</p>

</div></div>","Story
We are PITOT Watches, developing watches inspired by fighter jets.
I'm Thomas, a former RDAF aircraft mechanic, served on F-16 and S-61 rescue helicopters. Later I worked in SAS and Monarch(UK) on Airbus, Boeing, and Gulfstream.
We have run 5 crowdfunding campaigns before to fund the development and production of our first 300 pieces of the F-14 Tomcat inspired watches, and based on these results we managed to attract an investor to help us grow our company and now we can move forward to focus on a new model inspired by the F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet.
 
DANISH DESIGN - MADE IN GERMANY
 
PITOT watches introducing fighter jet-inspired watch
This campaign will help with the production of the prototype of the F/A-18 Hornet inspired watch with swiss mechanical or quartz movement and made in Titanium aircraft quality with a titanium bracelet/black leather strap or titanium bracelet/blue rubber strap for the blue carbon dial.
Our watches are designed in Denmark by a former aircraft mechanic from the Royal Danish Air Force with the help of a swiss watch designer and assembled in Germany.
We work together with a pilot in the US who test-fly our prototype watches in an F5 Tiger jet. We will show cockpit videos later when we have the prototype ready.
With your help, we can grow our company and help us make good quality watches inspired by fighter jets and made for the people who loves fighter jets as we do.
We offer a 50% discount on the expected retail price because we are in the early concept stage, and with your help, we can start the prototype production and also offer you a great deal.
Only 10 of each model with 50% on this early stage
PW18 with black carbon fiber dial
Manual wind with the Swiss Sellita SW510 M movement

Inspired by the Hornet and the US Navy demo team Blue Angels, we made a blue carbon fiber dial version with yellow buttons.

Blue Angels Gallery 

 
Limited to 918 pieces of each model
 
Inspiration
The inspiration for our new aviator watch comes from one of my favorites, the F/A-18 Hornet which first flight was in 1978. It is in service in 8 countries nowadays and the picture below shows a Canadian version called the CF-18. The F/A-18 Hornet is built for navy carrierships and operate as such in the US Navy, other countries like Finland, Spain, and Schweiz use them in the Air Force. The hook and the towbar are disabled via the circuit breakers when not operation on carrier ships.
This watch design is inspired by key features from the F/A-18 Hornet as shown below.
Here shown a Canadian CF-18 Hornet.


Subdials shape inspired by the oval air intakes on the F/A-18 Hornet.
Hour/Min hand inspired by the front wings close to the cockpit
The second hand inspired by the pattern on the ejection seat handle.
Carbon fiber dial because F/A-18 Hornet was the first fighter-jet to have carbon-fiber wings.
Black/Yellow colors on dial inspired from the cockpit buttons and instruments.
Watch case inspired by the round shape in general of the airplane.

 

Titanium case and bracelet, because titanium is strong and lightweight and used for airplane manufacturing. The pattern on the bracelet with a 20-degree angle on the links like the tail fins outward angle.
 

Crown inspired by the engine compressor blades and spinner cone.
 

 
Movement
We are offering both a high-end Swiss mechanical movement with manual winding and also a Swiss Ronda Quartz model. With these 2 solutions, everybody can get hold of this unique fighter jet-inspired design and enjoy the benefit of swiss movements.

Swiss Sellita SW 510 M BH a (manual winding)

Bracelet
We offer a titanium 22 mm bracelet with pattern references from the tail fins with a 20-degree angle to each side. If you prefer a nice black leather strap for the black dial or blue rubber for the blue dial, we can offer that instead.
Finish
Watchcase and bracelet come with a fine brush with polished edges.
Dimensions
Width: 43 mmHeight: 13.5 mmBracelet: 22 mmATM: 10

Rear case:
The manual wind with the Sellita SW510 M comes with a see-through case.
The Quartz battery comes with a closed case, we will come up with a nice engraving that is inspired by the fighter jet.
 
Materials
Both the case and the bracelet are made in Titanium. We want to use the EcoTitanium material from the French factory that recycles titanium from leftovers from airplane production, if that is not possible we use the titanium grade 5 airplane quality.

What We Need & What You Get
We need funding for prototype production and offer a good discount compared to the expected retail price.
You get a low price on the F/A-18 Hornet inspired watch made in a titanium case with a titanium bracelet or black leather strap.
The watch comes with a Swiss Sellita SW510 M manual wind movement or a Swiss Ronda Quartz and is assembled in a German factory with high-quality control to reflect the high quality of the fighter jets.
We run this campaign as flexible funding and use all the funding raised for the prototype and development of the watch.
Later in 2021 when the prototype is ready, we gonna run a big crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter together with an agency to fund the production.
 
Design and research
The F/A-18 Hornet replaced the F-14 Tomcat in the US Navy and later sold to the airforce and Navy in other countries and are flying in the US, Finland, Spain, Australia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Schweiz, and Canada as CF-18 Hornet. 
The F/A-18 Super Hornet, with the square air intakes, is slowly taking over for the F/A-18 Hornet, and the fighter jet used in the new Top Gun: Maverick, has been repainted and are now the first F/A-18 Super Hornet flying in the Blue Angels demo team.
We have based our watch design with inspiration from the F/A-18 Hornet with the round air intakes.

Tail fins are angled around 20 degrees outwards to each side - we use this key reference in the pattern on the titanium bracelet.
The oval air intakes are very significant on the F/A-18 Hornet and have inspired us in the making of the subdials shape. 
The cockpit inspired us to use the black and yellow colors on the dial and the second-hand pattern is a direct reference to the ejection seat handle.
 

F/A-18 Hornet was the first fighter jet with carbon-fiber wings and one of its key features that inspired us to do a carbon fiber dial.
 
After long research and a lot of sketching, we move into 2D using photoshop and when 2D is approved, we start the 3D modeling in Solidworks. 
 
I always start with research and then move on to sketches with pen and paper before the  2D and 3D software. I use Solidworks 2020 and because we are a startup business, it's free for one year. This is a big help! After the 3D drawing, it's time for some 3D printing to get feedback on shape and function before prototype.
 
Timeline

 
Previous campaign
We have used Indiegogo and Kickstarter before to fund the prototypes and production of the F-14 Tomcat inspired watches.

<p><i><strong>About Us</strong></i></p>
<p>We are an artist, ecologist, and textile designer. Our collaboration is inspired by our wide-ranging work in biodiversity, sustainability, historical museum specimens, photography, fashion, and life-long learning. Our first successful collaboration – hand towels featuring insect collections – was to benefit St. Jude. Please support our campaign to help us expand LEA into a full-fledged woman-owned business. </p>
<p><i><strong>LEA’s Mission Statement</strong></i></p>
<p>We transform nature’s fragile specimens into cloth-based modern wearable art for everyday living. We are committed to using materials that are natural, locally-produced, and carbon-neutral, and to supporting other women-owned businesses.</p>
<p><i><strong>The Line</strong></i></p>
<p>The first set of dresses and perks highlight the recent loss of select plant lineages in Thoreau’s Woods. Henry David Thoreau documented the abundant diversity of plants in New England in the 1800s. Scientists have recently revealed through resampling, that some of his plant lineages are now in decline as a result of human influence. The perks for our campaign—pillow covers, hand towels, and masks – feature cyanotype inspired herbarium specimens gleaned from Thoreau’s plant lineages. LEA's entire line is produced and sewn by women.</p>

<p><i><strong>Our Goal </strong></i></p>
<p>Our goal is to launch our line of dresses in 2021. This campaign will provide seed funding for LEA.</p>
<p><i><strong>Give and Get</strong></i></p>
<p>In 2019, we began the initial dress design process featuring Thoreau’s specimens. Then, in early 2020 the pandemic hit, and like the rest of the country, we hit pause. At that point, we decided to respond to the moment: face masks to promote safety, and pillow covers and hand towels to enhance the spaces we were all spending so much time in. We designed these items in the same spirit as the dresses we envisioned; the process, however, required minimal in-person contact among the three of us.</p>
<p>You can support our campaign by purchasing the perks on this site or by simply making a donation. They are additionally available in custom bundles at various levels of giving. At the highest levels, we also include the opportunity to acquire art by Leah Sobsey. </p>
<p><i><strong>Process</strong></i></p>
<p>All fabrics used in our products are printed digitally using non-toxic water-based reactive dyes that are approved by the Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS). This allows us to only print what we need for orders and eliminates fabric waste. The prints have amazing longevity and wash fastness.</p>

We have set our new goal for our third product: COMPLEXNESS.  And so, we are proud to release our new BEHRENS ORIGINAL watch: “THE ALL-ROUND”. </p><p>The rule “all-or-nothing” in watches is obeyed by watch lovers.

However, unlike quartz watches, they are always very heavy and bulky on wrists. And we understand that the size of these amazing mechanical watches can be inconvenient for daily wear.  </p><p>In order to have a nice mechanical watch but with a thin design, we provide the best we can: With the well-designed cutting of the case and the super-high quality dome shape sapphire, our watch provides an incredible slim appearance. The thickness of the watch is only 8.5mm exclusive the dome shape sapphire. With the done shape sapphire the total height will be 13.4mm. </p><p>Every part of our design is uniquely made for reaching our goal: a thin mechanical watch. We have gone under many tests on making a thin, durable watch. Our design team remade the dial part more than five times to remove 10-30C each time. There are no words can fully describe the hardship we had in the process,but we have put our efforts wholeheartedly in making this price-friendly, slim, well-functioned, mechanical watch.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565667034/mnknulh7zwuklmzilnox.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565667045/hva2m4zgegpt2ctmf5cs.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565667062/g9umho2ju6bx4fz8qkuq.jpg"" src=""""/>'</p><p> </p><h3>MULTIFUNCTIONAL - 8 INDICATORS</h3><p>THE ALL-ROUND is multifunctional and is full of ""indicators"" on the dial.

Due to the remarkable hardness of sapphires - 9 on the mohs scale, our watches can hardly be damaged by plain scratches. Thus, we believe that sapphire crystal is the most suitable material for a daily wear.</p><p>Dome shaped sapphire crystal is used to give an ultimately slim appearance to the watch. As sapphire is a hard material (A 6mm thick raw sapphire material is used to craft into a 4.8mm dome shaped crystal), it is beyond difficult to make the dome shaped sapphire. Since it is costly and time consuming (our machine can only produce 3 pieces of dome shaped sapphire crystal max. per day), the yield rate is low.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565667228/vu7rxdcldwdveiejigey.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565667253/qjyswa2l7n2abafka3xf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565667267/tqrz5npswilvvzgo84r2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565667278/ehpo1xrhgqbvp8jbzfbw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>OUR MOVEMENT - MIYOTA 9100</h3><p>Movement is the soul of all watches and that is exactly what attracts all watch collectors.

As such, absolute accuracy is always on our important checklist. We ensure the quality of every part by using strict control testing standards before assembling the watches.</p><p>The testing procedure lasts 7 days</p><p>Day 1 Before assembling the watches, the movement is fully wound (also known as T0) mechanically. The movement is tested in five positions, crown left, crown up, crown down, dial-up and dial down. Then given a rest period of 24 hours(also known as T24) , the movement is tested again in the five positions.</p><p>Day 3 After assembling all the parts together, the watch is put into an auto-winding machine for 1 day. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure in Day 1.</p><p>Day 5 The watch keeps putting into an auto-winding machine. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure on Day 1.</p><p>Day 7 Before packing, the watch is fully wound(T0) and is tested in five positions again.</p><p>All our watches have to pass all of the above procedures before delivery. We make sure that the accuracy of our watches is highly maintained in -20~+20 seconds/day. We tested the watches in more positions than the normal quality checkups do - we tested the watches in 5 positions while the others tested in 3 positions only.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565667382/q5rwdvwdbakcwbwmkkpx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565667398/duyq6srwadkbff4bzo1m.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565667407/na1iqo2mcfe5aroyusjx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>ITALIAN CALF LEATHER STRAP -  INTERCHANGEABLE CATCH</h3><p>We are all perfectionists, we see the pairing of the best leather strap and BEHRENS watches is an obligation.

Our dedication for watch making is clear: The case is made of 316L stainless steel which is widely used in high-end watches. We applied many different production processes to make a remarkable watch case. Multi-polishing methods are applied: including mirror polished on the bezel and the edges of the lugs, horizontal brushed on the sides, vertical brushed on the lugs and circular brush on the back.

NEW COLOR OPTION! THE ALL-ROUND AVENTURINE We are really excited to announce that we have a new color option for ALL-ROUND.We knew that AVENTURINE with its shimmering gold particles is an eye-catching material and is used to create a high-end appearance for a watch dial. We then select to provide the blue AVENTURINE dial for all the backers to choose from. A GROUP OF WATCH ENTHUSIASTSHello! We are the BEHRENS ORIGINAL - a group of watch enthusiasts gathers and create a brand that is based in Hong Kong. We specialized in watchmaking and watch modification, in which we take pride in what we do. Our founder, B.Q.Jack, has more than 15 years in watchmaking - which we genuinely called him a watch factory master. With a group of designers and engineers works perfectly, we keep designing and developing watches every day!  WHAT IS NEW THIS TIME?With the splendid success of THE MOONPHASE campaign on Kickstarter, knowing the fact that we were funded in 6 hours, we want to explore more possibilities in our watches for all actual watch lovers to adore. To make our watches stand-out, we aim at thinking and acting differently from THE MOONPHASE. We have set our new goal for our third product: COMPLEXNESS.  And so, we are proud to release our new BEHRENS ORIGINAL watch: “THE ALL-ROUND”. The rule “all-or-nothing” in watches is obeyed by watch lovers. It could be anyone of you that adore the minimalistic watch -- THE MOONPHASE or THE REIN; but perhaps some of you may want to have something more complex in your watches. Imagine you have a watch allows you to handle every situation like a boss, how awesome would that be? “THE ALL-ROUND” can just turn imagination into reality. A price-friendly, excellently designed with a german style, and equipped with the best multi-functions watch -- that is “THE ALL-ROUND”. We want our watches to be well-made and high-end. Our quality has been acknowledged and proven by 200+ backers and customers all over the world. We are being discussed on many forums and groups organised by watch lovers. You may check out for more comments about our watches’ quality craftsmanship and their design in the link below: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/behrenswatches/moon-phase-automatic-mechanical-watch-by-behrens-o/comments A TASTE OF HIGH-END WATCHWhen making a high-end watch, we obey the following rules which we think is most important for watchmaking. SLIM WATCH - 8.5MM MULTIFUNCTIONAL MECHANICAL WATCHMechanical watches with multifunction are always adored by watch lovers. However, unlike quartz watches, they are always very heavy and bulky on wrists. And we understand that the size of these amazing mechanical watches can be inconvenient for daily wear.  In order to have a nice mechanical watch but with a thin design, we provide the best we can: With the well-designed cutting of the case and the super-high quality dome shape sapphire, our watch provides an incredible slim appearance. The thickness of the watch is only 8.5mm exclusive the dome shape sapphire. With the done shape sapphire the total height will be 13.4mm. Every part of our design is uniquely made for reaching our goal: a thin mechanical watch. We have gone under many tests on making a thin, durable watch. Our design team remade the dial part more than five times to remove 10-30C each time. There are no words can fully describe the hardship we had in the process,but we have put our efforts wholeheartedly in making this price-friendly, slim, well-functioned, mechanical watch.' MULTIFUNCTIONAL - 8 INDICATORSTHE ALL-ROUND is multifunctional and is full of ""indicators"" on the dial. You can get all the information you need daily at a glance-- Mastering everything like a boss.
With the Month, Week, and Date indicator, you will never miss a day of your life.
With the power reserve indicator placed at the top, you can always keep your watch fully powered.
With 24-hour indicator at the bottom (the metallic hemisphere world map), you can set the date in the most convenient way without messing up A.M. and P.M..
The hour, minute, and second hand are clearly shown on the dial, you may check your time in your most familiar way.
We try to avoid useless decoration in our design: Like putting a 24-hour hand over a 24-hour disc; this is meaningless. We make sure everything you need is on the dial, and solely on that.  SAPPHIRE CRYSTAL ONLY - 4.8MM THICKFor producing luxurious watches, we persist to use only sapphire crystal for both sides of the watches. Due to the remarkable hardness of sapphires - 9 on the mohs scale, our watches can hardly be damaged by plain scratches. Thus, we believe that sapphire crystal is the most suitable material for a daily wear.Dome shaped sapphire crystal is used to give an ultimately slim appearance to the watch. As sapphire is a hard material (A 6mm thick raw sapphire material is used to craft into a 4.8mm dome shaped crystal), it is beyond difficult to make the dome shaped sapphire. Since it is costly and time consuming (our machine can only produce 3 pieces of dome shaped sapphire crystal max. per day), the yield rate is low. OUR MOVEMENT - MIYOTA 9100Movement is the soul of all watches and that is exactly what attracts all watch collectors. Our factory has more than 10 years of experience in Swiss and Japan movement watchmaking and watch modification. This time we selected the Miyota 9100 for our movement, which is well-known for its reliability and stability. This Japan movement functions with a frequency of 4Hz (28,800 A/h), 26 jewels, 40-hour power reserve, automatic winding, and a sweep second movement. With a movement of height 5.52mm and 30mm overall diameter, it is super slim. Combining both thin body and functionality, this movement is only used in high-class watches. Although the price of this movement is very high, we persist to provide the best we can. ACCURACY - 7 DAYS, T0, T24 TESTSWatch modification and movement tuning are our central focus. As such, absolute accuracy is always on our important checklist. We ensure the quality of every part by using strict control testing standards before assembling the watches.The testing procedure lasts 7 daysDay 1 Before assembling the watches, the movement is fully wound (also known as T0) mechanically. The movement is tested in five positions, crown left, crown up, crown down, dial-up and dial down. Then given a rest period of 24 hours(also known as T24) , the movement is tested again in the five positions.Day 3 After assembling all the parts together, the watch is put into an auto-winding machine for 1 day. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure in Day 1.Day 5 The watch keeps putting into an auto-winding machine. The watch would be fully wound and be tested with the same testing procedure on Day 1.Day 7 Before packing, the watch is fully wound(T0) and is tested in five positions again.All our watches have to pass all of the above procedures before delivery. We make sure that the accuracy of our watches is highly maintained in -20~+20 seconds/day. We tested the watches in more positions than the normal quality checkups do - we tested the watches in 5 positions while the others tested in 3 positions only. ITALIAN CALF LEATHER STRAP -  INTERCHANGEABLE CATCHWe are all perfectionists, we see the pairing of the best leather strap and BEHRENS watches is an obligation. We provide a high quality fine crafted Italian calf leather strap to give you the most comfortable and pleasant wearing experience. The strap with an interchangeable catch on the lugs side allows you to change your strap without any special tool.For this project we have selected a manufacturer for producing higher grade straps. Our blue will be a more vivid blue than ever; as well as the durability of our straps. Although the cost has increased by 55%, we hope to bring the best onto your wrist. - Environmentally friendly mineral tanning according to the ""Blauer Engel"" guidelines.  MULTI-POLISHING CASECase design is one of the significant symbols of our watches which is also widely loved by 150+ BEHRENS ORIGINAL customers. Our dedication for watch making is clear: The case is made of 316L stainless steel which is widely used in high-end watches. We applied many different production processes to make a remarkable watch case. Multi-polishing methods are applied: including mirror polished on the bezel and the edges of the lugs, horizontal brushed on the sides, vertical brushed on the lugs and circular brush on the back. Although these production methods are long and costly, we aim to give you the best looking, durable, and elegant watch cases. Besides, the four lugs of the case are separately produced; the angle of the watch will be sharp and absolute. Such costly production method could only be found in luxury watches production. DIAMOND CUTTING REFLECTIVE INDEXWe innovated a new method of index making - the Diamond Cutting Index. It is also used in THE MOONPHASE model(our previous Kickstarter project). The index is cut by a diamond cutter 20 times in two directions; thus the surface of the index is a complex obliques. To give the dial a luxurious touch, light is our major resource. With light reflects on the index’s glossy surface from different angles, a rainbow(chrome) color is created. We believe such natural phenomenon will attract many of you. 2-YEAR WARRANTYWe are confident about the quality of our watches - BEHRENS ORIGINAL watches. Each watch is backed by a 2-year warranty. We have our own factory and watch masters performing quality checks and maintenance everyday before shipping. So rest assured, your precious watches are well taken care of and are ready to give you the most comfortable wearing experience! THE TIMELINE THE MODELSpec WHO IS BEHRENS AND WHO ARE WE?We pledged to inherit Peter Behrens’ (14 April 1868 - 27 February 1940) design philosophy on watchmaking.

Something out of this world taking DBZ design to new heights. The funds were raised successfully for this project, so the watches are in production already! Learn more about the new DBZ watches and get one with the special offer, receiving it along with other backers! Meet our freshest addition to the Divided By Zero collection — the space-influenced Gamma series. Gamma is the first time we're using a luminous filling. And it's the first watch in our ranks where luminosity is part of the design itself!Since our first project, we’ve followed the initial concept of scientifically approved design. We calculate every part of the design and construction of the watches with the help of actual mathematicians and engineers, combining pure aesthetics with a pragmatic and appealing look. Each collection is devoted to the greatest minds of the past and the present, honoring their remarkable discoveries that left traces in our history. To capture these amazing moments in a wristwatch format is what we aim to achieve with every collection.The new Gamma series develops the idea even further. It’s the freshest approach to the Divided By Zero concept with new designs, reworked specifications, refreshed case shape, and additional features that are introduced in the series. Look for the decorative luminous filling that shapes and finalizes the look of each model.While working on the final look of the new series, we determined that we want to remove all design boundaries that limited us before. With Gamma we present a wider variety of available options to choose from — from a classic appearance to the most unusual looks that seem to be out of this world. It’s up to you to choose how whimsical your new Divided By Zero watch will look!The Gamma series is using the multi-layered Swiss Super-LumiNova® by Tritec. We chose this company because of their almost century-long history in the creation of afterglow pigments and the superior quality of lume they're so proud of. This luminous material is the best solution for wristwatches, 100% Swiss made and and provides the strongest and colorful afterglow as well as totally safe for health of the wearer.This is our third project, so we’ve received feedback on our previous watch collections. Here’s what some of our supporters tell us about their Alpha and Beta timepieces: Meet the Gamma series NASA Edition! Here's the newest member to the Gamma series — the special NASA edition! The new collection is created with an approval from NASA itself, commemorating their great contribution as the modern conquerors and scholars of Space. Our current project is inspired with Space mysteries, discoveries and studies and we felt that getting the support from NASA on our inverted counterpart to the series would be the perfect thing to do. Now we're proudly present you the exclusive addition to the Gamma series!ARMSTRONG & ALDRIN WATCHThe Armstrong and Aldrin watches are inspired with the famous pair of astronauts that made the first steps of humanity on the moon surface during the Appollo-11 expedition.  SHEPARD & GRISSOM WATCHThe Grissom and Shepard watches are inspired with the out-of-this-world achievements and interestingly similar space biography of Al Shepard and Gus Grissom, the prominent NASA astronauts and commanders.  Learn more about the new models below and pick your favorite!Meet the Bruno model, a reference to schematic and simplistic observations on Space in the past.This model brings you back to the past when people could build their own expectations and ideas about Space, giving birth to beautiful fantasies and harmless delusions, that led to a lot of fascinating folklore tales and stories.The Bruno watch has a minimalist design that resembles a rough model of our Solar system. In the center of the dial is the Sun, with small orbs representing the planets, and blue traces their orbits, including the logo area and the date window. The futuristic landscape looks even more enigmatic with the lights off. We usually name our watches in each collection after famous Ancient and Renaissance scientists. Could we leave our beloved greatest minds of the past out of the picture? Of course not! This model is named after Giordano Bruno and inspired by his research on the Solar system.Looking for something even more unconventional? The next watch is just for you!The Hevelius model is a transparent reference to one of the most famous and spectacular celestial bodies — the Moon, celebrating the everlasting Moon-changing cycle.The moon’s cycle perfectly inspires the design idea — it can be spotted and observed under certain circumstances, and you’re able to appreciate its beauty at night, just as with this watch! To create an optical illusion of volume, the schematic shape of the Moon in its different phases is printed directly on the crystal.The main attraction of the Hevelius is its bold design that features an image of the moon that is waning, partly concealed under the dial. Thanks to the strong luminous pigment on the sky-blue parts of the design, at night and in dark areas you’ll be able to catch the concealing Moon right on your wrist.The Hevelius model is named after the astronomer Johannes Hevelius. He was one of the most notable researchers of the Moon surface, its nature and published the first treatise that was entirely dedicated to Moon as well as was the the author of the first telescopic representation of this enigmatic celestial body.Interested in something more DBZ-like? See the next watch!Designing this model was the greatest challenge. It's really difficult to add a more or less classic watch to a series when you're going all out creatively with other designs. However, looks like we managed to achieve the desired results, so meet the Villard watch.Once again science is our helper! Did you know that gamma radiation could be older than Earth itself? Just like this theory, we see classic watches as the ancestors of any modern designer watch.Preserving Divided By Zero's heritage, this watch offers a standard layout with traditional hour and minute indexes, calculated and designed with an engineering approach and precision. And we simply couldn't avoid adding a small design twist — the dial is engraved with thin concentric circles referring to the dispersion of gamma radiation.This watch is our commemoration to Paul Villard and his notable work in the discovery of the nature of gamma rays.Seeking pure design? Take a look at the last watch in the series!The Hawking model is a conceptual reference to the attempts to find order in the chaotic reaches of Space.Many greatest minds tried and keep trying to understand Space and its rules. The Hawking watch allows you to wear a balanced coexistence of chaos and order on your wrist.The Hawking model offers the aesthetic of combining a contrasting blue concentric texture on the dial with white stitching printed across it. That achieves a mesmerizing effect where one layer corresponds to another, especially with the lume active. Add a cool minimalist impression and you get the most enigmatic watch in the Gamma series!This watch bears the name of Stephen Hawking, the pioneer of the most discoveries about the structure of the Universe, his life’s work now commemorated by our watch.Have you decided which one you like most? Or maybe it's all of them? Read more below about the specifications of the watch series to understand Gamma better.The new Gamma series keeps evolving along with our brand and offers several interesting features and improvements that develop further both the technical aspects and design aesthetics of our watches.The most notable adjustment is the new case that we developed from scratch and shaped after a spaceship’s saucer. It's your navigator for traveling into the deepest corners of the Divided By Zero design! The case has an engineering touch also, bearing several hollow points to make it feel lighter and more comfortable.The back lid has a concentric concave shape to maintain the futuristic look and to add an ethereal feeling. Another accompanying feature is flexible lugs for the utmost comfort in wearing our watch.The watch face has some new features, too! First of all, the Swiss Super-LumiNova® afterglow that completes the design of the dial, highlighting it in the dark.

campaign, I’ll be able to put in an order for a range of awesome plus size
fashions. The closer I get to the funding goal the more diverse that range
could be. As it stands, if I meet the fund-raising goal I’ll be able to get a
D-rail to hang the clothing on, a set of coat hangers, four different styles of
dresses, one style of cardigan and one style of skirt. If I can exceed the
funding goal then I’ll be able to increase the variety of styles. 
Ladies with fuller figures often get frustrated with the
lack of fashion ranges available for them in high street outlets and I want
Ahoy to stock clothing they’ll love, but I need your help to do it.I’ve put together some rewards for you, as a big thanks for
helping to raise the seed capital to get the plus size section under-way. These rewards
have also been sponsored by loyalty card scheme Independent Lancaster,
which aims to promote local independent businesses by encouraging customers to
shop locally rather than at national chain brands. They’re very kindly offering
to give up to two free loyalty cards (worth £20) to people who donate to the
campaign – see the specifics of each reward in the list to the right. These
cards will enable you to get discounts, freebies and special offers at over 42
businesses in and around Lancaster for a whole year, plus as more businesses
support the card over the year you’ll be able to start getting discounts there
too! For more information on the loyalty card you can visit
www.independent-lancaster.co.uk
So please can you help me out? Even just a fiver towards it
would be great. I’d really like to be able to provide a plus sized section, but
I need your help.
Thank you!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns
