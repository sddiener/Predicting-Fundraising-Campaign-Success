<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My names is Elizabeth Short, my husband Peter Short died in 2014 from complications that arose from oesophageal cancer that had metastasised into his lungs. </p>
<p>Peter was the CEO of Coles Express in Australia, and through the connections he made, he was able to obtain the illegal drug Nembutal which gave him peace of mind, knowing he had control over the end of his life. Peter in the final months of his life became a vocal advocate for changing the law so that all Australians with a terminal illness or incurable suffering could have the choice to end their own life, should their suffering and quality of life become unbearable.</p>
<p>Peter’s journey was widely covered in the media and in the documentary film, <a href=""http://www.fadetoblackmovie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fade to Black</a> which is currently being released in theatres across Australia through <a href=""https://au.demand.film/fade-to-black/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Demand Film</a>.</p>
<p>It was Peter’s dying wish that assisted dying laws would become legal in Australia. The state of Victoria will vote on a safe and sensible assisted dying bill during September this year. This legislation has a good chance of being written into law, and will set a precedence for other states to follow.</p>
<p>According to all surveys on this issue, more than 80% of Australians want these laws passed. More than 70% of Australian Christians want to see assisted dying laws passed.</p>
<p>But, there is a vocal minority of pro-suffering, religious extremists who are doing everything in their power to convince Victorians and our politicians to vote against Assisted Dying. These groups include the Catholic Church, Right to Life, HOPE and the Australian Christian Lobby. </p>
<p>These groups are running a campaign of lies, deception, mis-information, baseless made up facts and made up stories to trick people into standing against a compassionate assisted dying law.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We’ve decided it’s time to expose the dishonesty of these religious extremists in a video we’ve made that we need to raise funding for, so that we can literally get it into the hands of every Victorian politician ahead of the vote in September.</p>
<p>We are looking to raise a minimum of $5,000 so that we can manufacture 150 video brochures that will be delivered to every member of the Victorian Legislative Council and Legislative Assembly. Every video brochure is like a greeting card, except it has a 4.3"" video screen and speaker embedded into the card and will play our video.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope that when we deliver this video to politicians, it will help create context around the fear-mongering and scare campaign that's being propagated by religious extremists and will equip politicians to ignore unfounded claims when they are bombarded by targeted extremist lobbying efforts.</p>
<p>We also hope to raise more than $5,000 so that we can invest money in promoting the video through Facebook. We will urge every Victorian who watches this video on Facebook to reach out to their politician to say that assisted dying is an issue they care about want to see legalised.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We only have a short period of time to get the video brochures manufactured before the assisted dying bill comes up for a vote in September. We've already created the video and have everything ready to send to the factory so that we will have the brochures in our hands by the last week of August.</p>
<p>If we don't raise enough money to pay for all of the video brochures, then we will adjust our spend to Facebook and/or a limited amount of brochures that will go to politicians who are undecided on the issue.</p>

While we will accept donations for participating in training, nobody will be turned away at the door for lack of funds. We firmly believe self-defense training is a human right, not a commodity reserved for the rich.“What is Breakaway Autonomous Social Center?”We are a non-profit organization based in Chicago. We exist to help legally run non-profit projects like Haymaker: Popular Fitness and Self-Defense. Our other projects include the Breakaway Autonomous Social Center which hosts a variety of events and serves as a meeting place for progressive activists on the Southwest Side of Chicago. We see the current political climate as one of ethical bankruptcy and of the same uninspiring political routines being played on repeat. We pose a new politics. HAYMAKER is a crucial aspect of our vision.“What if you don’t meet your goals? Can the project be funded without meeting your immediate goal?”Yes! We will still be able to move ahead with the project, however, we will have to do so in an abbreviated form. With less than $50,000, we will not be able to purchase equipment or rent a space with the full range of amenities necessary for a gym. Nevertheless, we have existing space and martial arts can be taught without equipment — we want the best facilities because people deserve to be able to defend themselves!$25 zine bundle! $75 T-Shirt + zine bundle! $100 Anti-Fascist Poster Art! $200 Custom Yoga Mat!$300 track jacket!

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p>A rescue mission is a complex process; the people who run trafficking rings are dedicated professional criminals. Even with the best plan in place, there may be unexpected turns. But our rescue team is comprised of of highly dedicated civilians and expertly trained operators, who have backgrounds that include special forces and field operations. These skilled experts are no strangers to dangerous situations, and are committed to bringing every child to safety. They conduct all necessary fieldwork and evidence collection—including formulating the complex plan of rescue—all in partnership with local authorities. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Immediately after the mission is completed, the rescued children will be taken to a safe house to receive immediate professional aftercare.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Beyond the rescue missions, #ChildRescue has a team of expert volunteers who work with law enforcement agencies across the country to train officers on human trafficking in the United States, and how they can effectively combat it. By building awareness, we believe we can help stop child trafficking before it starts.</span><br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<div>Child Rescue Association of North America was founded in 2007 by the husband and wife team of Stephanie and Jess Larsen to spearhead a lifelong effort to combat child exploitation. Since then, the team has grown into a group of individuals who are equally as passionate. The team also consists of unnamed heroes, the special ops combat vets, intelligence professionals and others whose direct intervention rescues children taken by sex traffickers.</div>

Operator travel & accommodations

Risks & Challenges

A rescue mission is a complex process; the people who run trafficking rings are dedicated professional criminals. Even with the best plan in place, there may be unexpected turns. But our rescue team is comprised of of highly dedicated civilians and expertly trained operators, who have backgrounds that include special forces and field operations. These skilled experts are no strangers to dangerous situations, and are committed to bringing every child to safety. They conduct all necessary fieldwork and evidence collection—including formulating the complex plan of rescue—all in partnership with local authorities. 
Immediately after the mission is completed, the rescued children will be taken to a safe house to receive immediate professional aftercare.
Beyond the rescue missions, #ChildRescue has a team of expert volunteers who work with law enforcement agencies across the country to train officers on human trafficking in the United States, and how they can effectively combat it. By building awareness, we believe we can help stop child trafficking before it starts.

The Team
Child Rescue Association of North America was founded in 2007 by the husband and wife team of Stephanie and Jess Larsen to spearhead a lifelong effort to combat child exploitation. Since then, the team has grown into a group of individuals who are equally as passionate. The team also consists of unnamed heroes, the special ops combat vets, intelligence professionals and others whose direct intervention rescues children taken by sex traffickers.

     ● Actual weight of the unit: 1,7 kg/ 3.7 lb without battery
     ● Color: Silver/ Black


    It is possible to control/ to switch the ADELL with  a IR sensor or with a GSM module or with standard contacts from a (existing) alarm system.
● A IR (infrared) sensor is clear for
everyone - it will switch as a thermal source (human body) is registered.  
● GSM communication  module has following useful features
     ● Communication possibility: GM
Dual band  900/1800 MHz
     ● Programming device:
standard  mobile able to send SMS     ● Standard DC power source of:  10-15
V
     ● Power consumption: 0,2
A by 12 V
     ● Memory: permanent
    As it was written above we have been working on some  ideas 
in the last  3-4 years.  Have looked for various sources, switching
logic and mechanical constructions to find for this time a optimal one.
   Now the products are technically ready and we have 
to fix the inner structure for the best sources/ production  recovery. That means the delivery of  the perfect ADELL units in some weeks.
   Nowadays actual tasks are: 
     ● to finalize the mechanical construction     ●to finalize a
Installation manual in English, German
     ● to organize production lines for
the production
     ● to choose the optimal distant
switching (signal) sources for operation
   In addition the tasks there should
be done:
     ● to add a module to allow the
landlord to see and drive the situation distant by             video or online
     ● to proof  of the water resistant version for outdoor
use
 

Now we need YOUR involvement and YOUR interest.
   Your support will allow us to popularize the SRAD idea, to bring the product
widely on the market - so  we can make
ADELL known and available to all home owners, house owners and millions of
other people who have never before had a possibility to stop (their) burglar(s)
directly.
   So why should you support us?
   You need not more to trust ONLY to Your alarm system
   You need not more to trust ONLY to the Police or the Security company
and hope that they will come in time.
   You alarm system will stop the burglar BY OWN.

 
 YOU will be at last Your UNLIMITED LANDLORD!",2.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our actions are solidarity demonstrations to raise awareness of housing poverty, homelessness and mass food waste: we want people to know that a lot of things are working in a wrong way within this social/economic system and we face these problems day by day when we step out on the streets: we see poverty, starvation, homelessness and the growth of housing difficulties. With our activity, we do not only try to reflect on these problems but we stand in solidarity with all our poorest and unbacked human beings as well, because we believe that the right to food and housing are basic human rights!</p>
<p>FNB Budapest is a community where the teenager punk works together with the young adult who’s just started the drudgery of work in a multi, the foreign university student works together with the grandma, and the grandchildren cook together with homeless activists. This diversity is one of our powers: we have so many different people with different social and cultural background spending their weekends together, working on a common cause.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FNB Budapest stands in solidarity with all the oppressed, pursued, vulnerable or disadvantaged groups of people.</p>

<h3><strong>What do we have to do, what do we need?</strong></h3>

<li>We have to install the water system. There is no water in the space at the moment so we need tubes, taps, water meter, etc.<br/> </li>
<li>We have to install electricity. Although the place is full of cables, not much electricity is running in them, so we have to fix this – not only for the light, but winter is coming and so for the heating system as well.<br/> </li>
<li>We have to get new doors and a window. Again due to time and water, these are pretty much damaged and must be replaced.<br/> </li>

What We Need
 
This campaign’s goal is to collect 2500$ (which is 1800£ /2000€) so our movement can survive!
The situation is that we’ve had to relocate our kitchen and common place quite out of the blue. The renovation of the new place requires loads of work and an enormous amount of money, which totally exceeds our yearly budget (what we use to buy pasta, rice, oil, spices, gas tank, etc). To continue, and to make our kitchen suitable for our actions and our volunteers, we need all the help we can get, so we ask for everyone’s support, anyone who can back us this way.
From your support, we can renovate the walls, install the water system, electricity, get new windows and doors.
 

 
Where are we going?
 
Our previous kitchen was in Élesztő Craft Beer Bar for years. The new place is not far, a place called Food Truck Udvar. This place needs to be fully renovated, and soon it will become our dream kitchen and community space.
We managed to progress already, having a lot of work done.  We teared down parts and layers of the wall that would have come down anyway and moved our stuff there. However, we are very far from the end.
 

 
What do we have to do, what do we need?
 

We have to renovate the walls. Time and leaks had their effect on it. We will take the layers down, and fix it, as a long term solution we would like to install drywall on it or something.

<p>The Adoptee Rights Coalition is a nonprofit all volunteer based group of adult adoptees, birthparents and adoptive parents working together to bring awareness and education to the need for unrestricted access to our original birth certificates. We want all Americans to have unconditional access to their own original birth certificates even if they happen to have been adopted. Nothing more than what every other American in the US has, nothing less.</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;""> </p>
<p>Access to the Original Birth Certificate (OBC) is a matter of state laws. In the US, 41 states continue the practice of sealing adopted children's OBC upon finalization of the adoption. Alaska and Kansas never sealed theirs at all, but the other 48 did, some as early as the 1930's and some not until the 70's. Some sealed records laws, such as NY, can trace their roots back to the corrupt practices of infamous baby stealer Georgia Tann and other unscrupulous lobby groups.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;""> </p>
<p>Right now, unless the adoptee's OBC is in Alaska, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Tennessee, Alabama or, unless the adoptee's birthparents had the knowledge that they could apply for the OBC before the adoption records were sealed, then that adoptee might never see the record of their birth.</p>

<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;""> </p>
<p>Every year the Adoptee Rights Coalition organizes the Adoptee Rights Demonstration. We follow the National Convention of State Legislators as adoption laws are a state issue. Hundreds of ARC supports come from all across the country and even internationally to have their voices heard. As we are small and unfunded, the demonstration, a traditional sign waving, chanting old fashioned protest, garnishes the attention of the state legislators that attend the convention. These are the people that have the power to help us change the out dated adoption laws.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;""> </p>
<p>The Adoptee Rights Coalition volunteers then spend three days working the exhibition hall booth where we interact one on one with state lawmakers in order to education them about the need for updated adoption laws in their states. In our experience, most legislators are unaware that these are issues affect almost 7 million American's every day, but when are faced the facts, are interested in updating their current laws. Legislative changes that allow adult adoptees to have unrestricted access to their birth certificates create bi-partisan support, have a positive impact upon the fiscal budgets of the state, are supported by adoptees, adoptive parent s and birthparents, and are win-win for all involved.</p>

<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get The NCSL Legislative Summit is Aug. 12-15, 2013 in Atlanta, Georgia. In order to have access to the state legislators, we have to purchase an exhibit booth in the main exhibit hall during the conference. We are vying for attention against the huge lobby groups who have giant displays, custom swag to giveaway and are funded by major interest groups. We are, without a doubt, the underdogs of the adoption industry and we are fighting against the big corporations. There is no getting around the cost of the booth.</p>

<p>Please help the ARC BUY THE BOOTH!</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;""> </p>
<p>Through our generous supporters last year, we were able to  fund our booth and we were able to buy updated supplies. We were able to secure our booth this year, but we need funds for our booth supplies, sign making materials and other costs associated with our  booth. We know our supporters will be generous, especially if they cannot physically make it to Atlanta.</p>

<p> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Adoption is supposed to be about what is best for the child. But what happens when that child grows up and is an adult? </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Currently, close to<strong> 7 million US citizens are denied </strong>access to the legal records of their birth because they happen to be adopted. Adult adopted persons in the US are denied access to their Original Birth Certificates, the legal documentation of their birth. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">This is a <strong>violation of their civil rights.</strong></p>

Help the ARC change the laws for millions of Adoptees & their families. Go to http://www.indiegogo.com/Buy-the-Booth. Donate a Dollar & Add Your Name. Your Rights, Your Protest...add your voice, play your part and help BUY THE BOOTH now!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Adoptee Rights Coalition is a nonprofit all volunteer based group of adult adoptees, birthparents and adoptive parents working together to bring awareness and education to the need for unrestricted access to our original birth certificates. We want all Americans to have unconditional access to their own original birth certificates even if they happen to have been adopted. Nothing more than what every other American in the US has, nothing less.
 
Equal Access and Equal Rights.
 
The Impact of The Denied
 
Access to the Original Birth Certificate (OBC) is a matter of state laws. In the US, 41 states continue the practice of sealing adopted children's OBC upon finalization of the adoption. Alaska and Kansas never sealed theirs at all, but the other 48 did, some as early as the 1930's and some not until the 70's. Some sealed records laws, such as NY, can trace their roots back to the corrupt practices of infamous baby stealer Georgia Tann and other unscrupulous lobby groups.
 
Right now, unless the adoptee's OBC is in Alaska, Kansas, Maine, New Hampshire, Oregon, Tennessee, Alabama or, unless the adoptee's birthparents had the knowledge that they could apply for the OBC before the adoption records were sealed, then that adoptee might never see the record of their birth.
 
 
 
Every year the Adoptee Rights Coalition organizes the Adoptee Rights Demonstration. We follow the National Convention of State Legislators as adoption laws are a state issue. Hundreds of ARC supports come from all across the country and even internationally to have their voices heard. As we are small and unfunded, the demonstration, a traditional sign waving, chanting old fashioned protest, garnishes the attention of the state legislators that attend the convention. These are the people that have the power to help us change the out dated adoption laws.
 
The Adoptee Rights Coalition volunteers then spend three days working the exhibition hall booth where we interact one on one with state lawmakers in order to education them about the need for updated adoption laws in their states. In our experience, most legislators are unaware that these are issues affect almost 7 million American's every day, but when are faced the facts, are interested in updating their current laws. Legislative changes that allow adult adoptees to have unrestricted access to their birth certificates create bi-partisan support, have a positive impact upon the fiscal budgets of the state, are supported by adoptees, adoptive parent s and birthparents, and are win-win for all involved.
 
What We Need & What You Get The NCSL Legislative Summit is Aug. 12-15, 2013 in Atlanta, Georgia. In order to have access to the state legislators, we have to purchase an exhibit booth in the main exhibit hall during the conference. We are vying for attention against the huge lobby groups who have giant displays, custom swag to giveaway and are funded by major interest groups. We are, without a doubt, the underdogs of the adoption industry and we are fighting against the big corporations. There is no getting around the cost of the booth.
 
Please help the ARC BUY THE BOOTH!
 
Through our generous supporters last year, we were able to  fund our booth and we were able to buy updated supplies. We were able to secure our booth this year, but we need funds for our booth supplies, sign making materials and other costs associated with our  booth. We know our supporters will be generous, especially if they cannot physically make it to Atlanta.

For the exhibit hall in the NCSL, there are required booth items that are not covered in the initial purchase. This might seem incredibly insane, but it is the way it works. The ARC has always been very thrifty and only purchased the required items including: the carpet under the booth, renting the table and chairs ( we only get two chairs and take turns sitting).  Even the ""official"" garbage pail must be rented. We forgo the $50 garbage pail and use bags that we hide under the table.  In any case,  your contributions a will allow us to purchase what we must. We still will NOT get the garbage pail!
 
 
 
 

Bottom line: Please continue to share the donation campaign on Facebook, on Twitter, on your blogs, in your adoption groups and forums. We are an AMAZING COMMUNITY and together we can do AMAZING things. 


Again, from the bottom of our hearts...THANK YOU!!

Why the Adoptee Rights Coalition?
 
Adoption is supposed to be about what is best for the child. But what happens when that child grows up and is an adult? 
Currently, close to 7 million US citizens are denied access to the legal records of their birth because they happen to be adopted. Adult adopted persons in the US are denied access to their Original Birth Certificates, the legal documentation of their birth. 
This is a violation of their civil rights.
The Adoptee Rights Coalition is a nonprofit all volunteer based group of adult adoptees, birthparents and adoptive parents working together to bring awareness and education to the need for unrestricted access to our original birth certificates. We want all Americans to have unconditional access to their own original birth certificates even if they happen to have been adopted.

<p>In the 2008 war, the village of

then, but the community is slowly returning to life. The children of the

</div><p></p></div>","The Idea


My name is Louino 'Robi' Robillard, and I am a young community leader who grew up in Cite Soleil, Haiti's largest ghetto. Cite Soleil has a rough history: our community is mostly known for the gang violence that has made it the most dangerous place in the country.
But what most people don't know is that most people in Cite Soleil have dreams of peace, and that there are countless young people who are working to build peace in our community every day. They do the hard, thankless work of building community, and they never get recognized for it - and we lose a lot of them to discouragement and burnout.
To address this, last year I came up with the idea for the Cite Soleil Peace Prize, a chance to honor young people making a difference in these tough conditions, and to focus attention on a positive side of Cite Soleil that few people see. Our decision to honor 4 young leaders got local and national attention, and helped inspire other young people to step up and continue down the hard road to building peace.2015 has been especially hard for Cite Soleil: there has been an increase in both violence and the number of innocent people who've been caught in the crossfire. Now more than ever, we need to remind our community that peace is still possible, to not give up hope. So this year, we are planning on organizing the 2nd Annual Cite Soleil Peace Prize to celebrate the young people who are still holding onto the dream - and we need your help to do it.
The Logistics




A Peace Prize Committee has been established this year, and they are developing the criteria for this year's candidates. They will be looking for emerging leaders who are working collaboratively to bring creative solutions to their community's problems. They will be looking for the people who embody the spirit of konbit, a traditional Haitian system of reciprocity and solidarity.  Potential candidates will be nominated by community members, and the final list of 5 will be selected by the Committee. The award will be given out on the 25th of June, 2015.
Our vision is mostly built on the energy of community leaders, but we do need some support to help make this happen: arranging for the award plaques, building a stage in the central square of Cite Soleil, arranging a sound system and program, investing in leadership development activities for the finalists and other nominees. Any additional resources will be invested in community activities that build a sense of unity and solidarity in Cite Soleil. 
The Impact
Last year, we chose four young, emerging leaders who had made great sacrifices and showed great imagination (you can see a video describing them here). After they were awarded the prize, all have become more capable and passionate leaders. Sadrack is expanding the vision for the Cite Soleil Basketball Team, Frantz was highlighted during World Humanitarian Day 2014, Alashkar is emerging as one of the strongest female voices in the community, and Stephen has steered La Difference through one of its most challenging years. I have heard them say that knowing that their actions were recognized - and that the eyes of the community are on them -  was a significant source of motivation.
So this year, we are planning to do this - and go beyond. Not only will we select 5 leaders this year, but we will have a more structured mentoring program to provide support to these young people. We will have more sustained engagement with local media, to get their stories out there and fight some of the negative narratives about Cite Soleil. We will leverage this event to support other initiatives that bring together the people of Cite Soleil in solidarity and unity. 
Sadly, 2015 has been such a violent year that many of the young leaders I know and care about are getting discouraged, and talking to me about giving up. We can't let this happen. Now is the time to show them that their sacrifices are not invisible, their fight is not vain, and their futures can still be bright.

Our activities during 2017 increased rapidly with many projects. Our first fundraising campaign in 2018 sets to begin here, and we hope you will help the people of Yemen to achieve it.Our own resources are limited, however being independent, we have still achieved the trust of the Yemeni people, and have so far carried out many projects with the help of local and foreign donors. The crisis in short during 2017 and 2018Yemen is at the moment the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with 8.4 million people on the verge of famine. Over 1 million is suspected of being infected with cholera, and thousands have died as a result of the war.On top of all that, Yemen was blocked in all entry points in November 2017. Almost nothing from food or humanitarian help could enter Yemen, which led to even more starvation. Those responsible for the war have blocked many int’l human rights organizations from traveling into Yemen. Fighting forces have also blocked food and medical supplies and have imposed restrictions on aid workers. And so it goes on 2018. We can only hope for good, but as a matter of fact, the situation has only got worse. You would think 3 years were enough (1000+ days and counting into the war), but no, the war still goes on, and the biggest losers are the people of Yemen.
Our aim for this Ramadan campaign in 2018Regardless of the purpose of the project, our aim has always been the same - to serve the helpless people. This year we will focus especially on food and medicine.During winter 2017 we carried out a lot of clothing projects for the winter, and this year we will start out by our food and medicine projects again.Our goal for this project will be to reach 30.000 USD in 45 days.We are planning to visit many of the Yemeni governorates, and with your donations we will carry out the projects. All our projects are documented and pictures of them can be found on our website (www.monareliefye.org) or our twitter (@monarelief).Our Campaign will provide funds to help families during Ramadan and after it. $30 can do more than you thinkBy giving a simple amount of only $30, you are helping a whole family for one month. For each $30 donated we can supply the following for a family for a month:Every penny counts. Giving 25, 250 or even $2 - the more we donate, the closer we get to the goal. Hundreds of projects have been carried out since we started and over 40.000 families fed. We believe that in spite of the heavy shelling, no one deserves to die hungry or thirsty. The previous projects were carried out in the governorates of Sana'a, Hodeidah, Hajjah , Marib, Dhamar, Amran, Mahweet and Amant al-Asimah, Aden, Taiz and Saada. Image from 9. september 2017 Previous distribution projectsHave a look at some of our projects during last year and 2016. Food aid baskets to Jewish community’s members in Sana’a - May 2017 Ramadan food aid baskets Sanaa May 2017 Mona Relief Yemen distributing food aid to IDPs in Sana'a April 2017 + many more projects!

<h3>What's The Big Idea?</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to help house Muslim refugees, by sheltering them in our President's egotistical monument to himself, Trump Tower.</p>
<p>By supporting our campaign you're helping make a huge statement - a powerful rebuke to President Trump - while also helping to house the needy, and reminding Americans of their founding creed.</p>
<hr/>
<p><i>/Important notes/</i></p>
<p><i>1. No matter what the outcome of this campaign - all the funds raised will go to helping refugees in America.</i></p>
<p><i>2. We will not be renting the unit from The Trump Organization, so your donations will not be benefitting the Trump family.</i></p>
<hr/>
<p>America was built as a country of immigrants, of refugees, of those seeking out a better and safer life. As the Statue of Liberty says ""Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore, Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""</p>
<p>President Trump has quickly gone to work, attempting to rebuke these ideals that form the bedrock of our nation. His discriminatory ban of refugees (effectively targeting Muslims) from seven nations is especially cruel, and has been implemented with the carelessness that seems to befit his new administration.</p>
<p>Let's show President Trump, and the folks that elected him, that <strong>Muslim refugees deserve the right to live in America as much as anyone else</strong>. And let's do it by using his own gold festooned tower against him.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Let's Get to Work</h3>
<p>We're going to house refugees (ideally a couple or young family), from one of the seven predominantly Muslim countries recently barred from entry to the United States, in Trump Tower.</p>
<p>The President has spent years boasting about the luxurious amenities of this address. Who would be more befitting of those benefits than a refugee who has spent the last months and years of their life fleeing a war torn nation.</p>

<li>Rent at Trump Tower starts at <a href=""http://streeteasy.com/building/trump-tower/35c"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">$4,950/month</a>. We're raising approximately one year's rent.</li>

<li>Not only does this house them near jobs and opportunities (and, gold elevators) it'll also remind Americans that our country was founded on the premise of being open to <i>everyone</i>.</li>
<li><p>We're taking the utmost care to make sure this project beneficiary is secure, and is someone who is not only comfortable living in Trump Tower (the building seems like it might be full of assholes), but will be comfortable with the media scrutiny such a life may entail.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Ancillary Details</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to help house Muslim refugees. If, for some reason, we cannot secure a unit in Trump Tower near the base price ($4,950/mo) we would move on to one of the many other properties that bear his name. <u>Should we fall short of our fundraising goal, or overshoot it, the funds raised will be disbursed to charities and nonprofits that work to assist Muslim migrants in America. </u></p>
<p><i>Won't this help Trump?</i></p>
<p>Nope! While in a perfect world he would have already sold off Trump Tower (ha!) the available units have long since been purchased from him, and are now owned individually.</p>
<p><i>What about security?</i></p>
<p>With round-the-clock NYPD and Secret Service protection, Trump Tower might just be the securest place in New York. Naturally, anyone that chooses to live there, will have to be comfortable with this heavy handed approach, as well as the presence of nearby protestors and gawkers.</p>
<p><i>What about amenities?</i></p>
<p>So glad you asked! If there's anyone that should be treated to a 24-hour concierge, doormen, a fitness facility, onsite landscaped atriums, and views of Central Park, it's someone fleeing a war zone of America's making. Let the Wall Street pricks and nou·veau riche live in Westchester!</p>
<p><i>Who will live in Trump Tower?</i></p>
<p>As part of our launch, we've been in contact with a number of fantastic nonprofits &amp; advocacy organizations. Of particular note is <a href=""http://emergencybnb.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EmergencyBNB</a>, a service that connects refugees with short-term housing. This way, even if we only raise one month's rent, we'll still be able to provide much needed housing to refugees.</p>

Our Story

This is a continuation of our campaign to bring out the murky truth behind the glitz and expensive promotion of the Trump golf and housing complex in Aberdeen. On contacting Brian May about the use of Bohemian Rhapsody to highlight the issues, he responded :

I can see there is a horrible example, here, of bullying the defenceless, by a 
rich man who apparently can buy anyone and anything he wants.  I deplore this 
kind of abuse and feel greatly for Molly and the others who are being ridden 
over by a very selfish man.  And what the world certainly does NOT need is more 
golf courses ! I am disgusted. 

We are a small group of artists creating a new video of Bohemian Rhapsody sung by the amazing 'Spitting Image' style puppet of Donald Trump - those wonderful Spitting Image songs that everyone loved have influenced our idea.  The video has also been inspired by the one which was made by the Muppets.  Puppeteer and Actor, Francis Wright has written the script with appropriate words highlighting some of the issues with satire. Pianist, Dmytro Morykit has arranged the music for piano Tchaikovsky style and filming will take place in January 2012.


This is not an easy time of year to raise funds, but if you are able to contribute even $5 then you will automatically receives updates on the progress and be one of the first to see the video.



The Impact
People need to know the truth behind what has gone on with the Golf and housing complex at Menie and the terrible bullying and harassment which a number of families are continually subjected to by Trump.  With the mass press coverage manipulated by the Trump organisation, very little of the truth is reaching people who would be equally disgusted and ask questions of those in power.

What We Need & What You Get

Our initial campaign allowed us to create the puppet, the lyrics and music for this fantastic video.  We now need to pay for the recording and film studio.  We also need to hire extra equipment for the filming and editing process. The puppet makers, the musician and the puppeteer have all given their professional time for free but there are practical items which have to be paid for and all support is welcome.

Recording and filming will take place in January 2012 and the result will be brilliant, entertaining and people will want to watch it over and over again and pass it on to friends.  This is a great chance to become involved in an event that will highlight an issue which is mirrored elsewhere and causes everyone concern.

Other Ways You Can Help
Please spread the word and post on your facebook page and tell as many people as you can.  If you have any suggestions or think you can help in any way, do get in touch.  We have one purpose: to stand with the Menie families against corporate and governmental bullying. The people yielding the power and money think they can ignore a few individuals but perhaps they will listen to Menie voices.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","Summary

There's never been a more important time for what Ruka Dopomogy does in Ukraine. Because of the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine young people are searching for hope for their future.  In recent months the Ukrainian currency (Hryvnia) has dropped dramatically against the US Dollar (from 8:1 to more than 30:1 at one point) yet income has not increased at all! As a result, summer camp, especially for vulnerable children such as those displaced by the war in the east, is a financial impossibility!
Igor Minenko is President of Ruka Dopomogy, a 17 year old Ukrainian Charity Fund (non-profit). RD has trained hundreds of youth workers in churches all over Ukraine how to build Jesus Focused Youth Ministries.  Before leading RD, he was the youth pastor at one of the largest youth ministries in Kiev.  Under his leadership Ruka Dopomogy has sponsored Summer Youth & Children Camps in western Ukraine since 2010. He also serves as the Director of Youth Alpha Course in Ukraine.
   What We Need

 $29.50 USD will sponsor a child or teenager for one week of summer camp. Last year camp cost 200 Hryvnia  (about $25 USD) per week.  Not expensive, right? Today, that same $25.00 USD = about 600 UAH, and remember, Ukrainian wages have NOT increased. The kids and families we work with, especially displaced children and their families cannot afford a 200% increase. For the amount of money your teenager will spend on snacks and fast food on the way to camp, you can sponsor a Ukrainian Child or Teenager for a week of camp. 
Our camp is small but awesome! Our capacity is only about 60 kids per week and because of time limitations at our venue we can only host 3 camps. Expenses are low because facilities are shockingly sparse and Staff pay their own way. There are no salaries! 85% of your donation (85% of $29.50= $25.00) will sponsor a week of camp for a child or teenager. 15% will be shared with International Teams-US, our parent ministry/US 501c3 based in Elgin, Illinois and cover the cost of using Indigogo and/or Paypal.
Our goal of $5310 will fully fund all three camps at maximum capacity. If we raise more then International Teams and Ruka Dopomogy will help fund additional ministries with refugee and at-risk children.    The Impact

Many of the kids we're ministering with are facing an uncertain future. Many of them have fled their homes in war torn eastern Ukraine and may not ever return. They are stressed and their parents are stressed. You contribution will give them a week of respite in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. They'll sleep in tents, they'll hike the mountains, swim the river, and sing around campfires. They'll practice English, they'll play games and participate in competitions. They'll hear the Gospel every day and they'll be loved and cared for by veteran youth workers from among the churches Ruka Dopomogy has trained. 2015 is the fifth year of our camping ministry. Up until last summer we were seeing a lot of ""repeat"" kids from the churches we've coached. Beginning last summer we started receiving children and teens who were displaced by the war; the need is even greater this summer.    Camp Staff  Our camps are staffed with full-time workers from International Teams and Ruka Dopomogy Staff along with volunteers from local and participating churches. This summer a team of ""World Racers"" (www.worldrace.org) from Canada and the US will serve with us.    Other Ways You Can Help  Spread the word for us through email and all forms of social media.
Pray for us.

<div>  
<div>So many people are asking for Caylee’s story and here goes…..On Aug 21st, Caylee’s father took her to the army hospital ER cause she had been sick throughout the night. He was told that Caylee had a virus cause there was a virus going around and she “must” have it too. NO LAB WORK OR IV FLUIDS were given to her. She progressively worse throughout the day and mommy instincts just told me that something wasnt right. So going with my gut and the advice of my sister in law we took Caylee back to the ER. Well Caylee was gone within an hour of being back in the ER. Caylee was treated like a kid with a common cold. No urgency and as a matter of fact she NEVER got evaluated by the nurse cause he said he didnt want to cause the doc was going to come and do it again. As we were sitting in the room waiting for a doc to come Caylee passed out. I rushed to the nurses station and told them that Caylee had passed out and that we needed a doc asap! They just gave me the blankest stares but no one came to help us. I returned to the room to find Caylee in her dads arm and he was trying to keep her alert by rubbing her back and calling her name….well it didnt work. Caylee went totally limp like a rag doll. I went BACK to the nurses station again and told them that Caylee had passed out and that we needed a doctor….NO ONE CAME!! By the time the doctor and nurse made it to the room my princess had taken her last breath. I saw my baby eyes open the widest I had seen them open in 2 days….I saw life leaving my baby and as a mommy I couldn't help her. The people we trusted to help her didn't and now they are trying to cover up her death. My husband and I watched our baby die and not a sole in the hospital helped her until it was to late. I plan on fighting !! No parent should have to endure what we’ve gone through. No parent should ever be paranoid about taking there child to the ER….no parent!</div>

<h3>The short story of a country hijacked by corrupted political parties</h3>
<p>On June 23, 2013 Albania holds national elections. Nowadays Albanian citizens are called by political parties to vote for the lesser evil. They are offered to vote for the current government coalition that has a history of corruption, oppression and killing of protesters, or to vote for the opposition coalition that has a history of corrupted leaders.</p>
<p>In Albania there is no free media. Every media operator is controlled by opposition political parties or the government. The organized crime has very strong ties with the government and opposition parties and is used to a great extend before elections to fund campaigns and to threaten opponents. Most of the international aid focused on democratization goes to N G Os that are directly or indirectly serving the interests of political parties. Any free grassroots citizen movement is attacked and discouraged.</p>
<p>Citizens are oppressed by the government and opposition political parties. All individuals that work for the public administration of the central or local government are obliged to attend &amp; support the electoral campaign of the government or the opposition. As a result electoral campaigns of all parties are attended &amp; supported by thousands of people that are threatened to lose their job if they do not obey to the party of the central government or the parties of the opposition.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The protest camp on June 21, 2013</strong></h3>
<p>Albanian politicians claim that Albanian citizens support corrupted political parties by voting for them. To show that Albanian citizens disagree with the corrupted political system installed in the country and are not willing to vote for the lesser evil, on June 21, 2013 (36 hours before election day) a protest camp will be set up at the center of Tirana.</p>

<h2><strong>The Time Is Now!</strong></h2>
<p>The case against Rowan Bailey—the traditional midwife who was arrested in March 2013 in Asheville, North Carolina, and charged with felony murder of an unborn child, felony obtaining property by false pretense (in other words, working as a midwife without a license), and felony obstruction of justice (not keeping medical records)—is moving forward.  Rowan was indicted on August 5, 2013, on all three counts, and her next court appearance is set for September 3rd, 2013, when her arraignment &amp; the trial dates will be set.</p>
<p>This case has the potential to secure or trample on women’s reproductive rights in North Carolina and throughout the United States.  If Rowan is found <strong>guilty</strong>, women everywhere will be told that they are not the ultimate decision-makers in their pregnancies and/or their births.  If Rowan is found <strong>not guilty,</strong> women everywhere will know that they are the ultimate decision-makers in choosing how, when, where, and with whom they give birth.  Whether you are a mother or not, midwife or not, woman or not—if you believe that women and families have the basic human civil right of choosing their care providers and the right to refuse medical treatments—this is your chance to get involved!</p>
<p>This case will set precedent for EVERY state in the U.S.!  We have an opportunity to bring dignity, beauty and choice to the birth world.</p>
<p>Certified Nurse Midwives, Certified Professional Midwives, and unlicensed or traditional midwives all need each other.  We need everyone who serves women during their childbearing years to come together to fill the gaps in our maternity care system.</p>
<p>Please donate NOW to ensure that Rowan has the best legal team for her case.  It will make all the difference!!</p>
<h2><strong>Case History</strong></h2>
<p>Wednesday, March 27, 2013, a friend, teacher, mentor, and fellow midwife, Rowan Bailey, was arrested for murder in Asheville, North Carolina. North Carolina prohibits the practice of midwifery by traditional community midwives and Certified Professional Midwives (CPMs). After serving 14 days in jail and then released on $150,000 bail, Rowan remains on house arrest with a GPS monitor.</p>
<p>Pregnancy and birth are the most natural processes in the human experience.  This process has been supported, facilitated, and protected since the dawn of civilization by the midwife.  Today, in the United States, more than 98% of all births occur in a hospital setting: a medical facility.  Just under 2% of births occur out of the hospital, and approximately 1% of births occur at home with a midwife.  We inherently have rights to choose who, where, and how we birth.  For some of us, medical practitioners and surgeons are not the “who, where, and how” we choose. </p>
<ul>
<li>The United States ranks poorly among industrialized nations in maternal and infant deaths.  Babies die in the hospital all the time.  These numbers are unacceptable, yet they persist despite the fact that the U.S. spends the most money in the world on birth technology and interventions.</li>
<li>Midwives provide a choice in birth for families who want less medical intervention, and who want to preserve birth as a rite of passage and a natural bodily process.</li>
<li>The way we birth is a HUMAN RIGHTS issue and we must embrace it with compassion, love, and responsibility. </li>

</h3><p><b>END of the PROJECT</b><br/></p><p>In July 2015,
the <b>Lebanese army evacuated 95 Syrian refugee camps</b> in the coastal area North
of Tripoli. The living conditions of Syrians in the country have become all the
more desperate:</p><h3> <b>“<i>We can’t return to
Syria. Lebanon doesn’t want us. We have nothing left to do but throw ourselves
at sea.</i>”</b> <br/>
</h3><p>Once having witnessed the evacuation of some of the camps, the
residents of Al-Rabia have taken the decision to <b>flee to Turkey</b>. In light of
this, the “Spring Camp” project can no longer be realized.</p>
<p>Because of
the “flexible funding” mode chosen at the launch of this crowdfunding campaign,
we have no way of declining or automatically reimbursing all of the
contributions that have been made, nor can we interrupt the campaign before the
set date of August 19<sup>th</sup>. </p>
<p>We have
decided to keep all collected funds in order to pay for the land's rent for 2016/17.<span> <b> Reimbursing all of
those who may wish to have their donations back is important to us.</b> In order to
enable us to do so, please send us an email at this adress: intothewildance@gmail.com.</span></p><p><span><b>FINE del PROGETTO</b><br/></span></p>
<p>Nel mese di luglio <a href=""http://www.sirialibano.com/siria-2/libano-sgombero-forzato-di-seimila-profughi-siriani.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">l’esercito libanese ha sgombrato 95 campi di profughi siriani </a>nella regione costiera a Nord di Tripoli.

</h3><p>Dopo aver assistito agli sgomberi di
alcuni insediamenti la maggioranza degli abitanti del campo ha deciso di
trasferirsi in Turchia. In queste condizioni il progetto “Campo Primavera”
perde di senso. </p>
<p>A causa della modalità di raccolta fondi scelta all’inizio
della campagna di crowdfunding non ci è possibile rimborsare automaticamente
tutti coloro che hanno contribuito e non ci è possibile chiudere la campagna
prima del termine previsto (19 agosto). Abbiamo deciso di conservare i fondi raccolti per poter pagare l'affitto della terra su cui sorge il campo per l'anno 2016/17.<br/></p>

</div></div>","END of the PROJECTIn July 2015,
the Lebanese army evacuated 95 Syrian refugee camps in the coastal area North
of Tripoli. The living conditions of Syrians in the country have become all the
more desperate: “We can’t return to
Syria. Lebanon doesn’t want us. We have nothing left to do but throw ourselves
at sea.” 
Once having witnessed the evacuation of some of the camps, the
residents of Al-Rabia have taken the decision to flee to Turkey. In light of
this, the “Spring Camp” project can no longer be realized.
Because of
the “flexible funding” mode chosen at the launch of this crowdfunding campaign,
we have no way of declining or automatically reimbursing all of the
contributions that have been made, nor can we interrupt the campaign before the
set date of August 19th. 
We have
decided to keep all collected funds in order to pay for the land's rent for 2016/17.  Reimbursing all of
those who may wish to have their donations back is important to us. In order to
enable us to do so, please send us an email at this adress: intothewildance@gmail.com.FINE del PROGETTO
Nel mese di luglio l’esercito libanese ha sgombrato 95 campi di profughi siriani nella regione costiera a Nord di Tripoli. Le condizioni di vita dei profughi siriani in Libano sono diventate sempre più dure e disperate:

“In Siria non possiamo tornare. In Libano non ci
vogliono. Non ci rimane che buttarci a mare.” 
Dopo aver assistito agli sgomberi di
alcuni insediamenti la maggioranza degli abitanti del campo ha deciso di
trasferirsi in Turchia. In queste condizioni il progetto “Campo Primavera”
perde di senso. 
A causa della modalità di raccolta fondi scelta all’inizio
della campagna di crowdfunding non ci è possibile rimborsare automaticamente
tutti coloro che hanno contribuito e non ci è possibile chiudere la campagna
prima del termine previsto (19 agosto). Abbiamo deciso di conservare i fondi raccolti per poter pagare l'affitto della terra su cui sorge il campo per l'anno 2016/17.
Provvederemo a rimborsare chiunque lo desideri, ma per farlo
vi preghiamo di scriverci a intothewildance@gmail.com.Qui il portavoce del Campo Primavera che spiega perché hanno deciso di lasciare il Libano.
WHAT / The project                                                                            ITALIANO
We are collecting funds to help Syrian refugees build at least  1 house + 1 lavatory /restroom facility in their camp (Mukhayyam al-Rabia / Spring camp, Lebanon). These will be built in straw & mud, a technique that is eco-friendly, low-cost and traditional both in Syria and Lebanon. Houses built this way are safe, comfortable and graceful.If we are able to raise the money that we need to complete constructions, the Syrian refugees living inside the camp: 
will have a common place to stay - inhabitable, fresh during summer and warm in winter,
will have access to restrooms and basic plumbing infrastructure, for themselves and a neighbouring camp,
will have a source of income from labour that would enable them to renew the land’s rent for the next year, and
will master a low-cost and eco-friendly building technique, and own the necessary tools to keep building on thier own.
WHY / Story of the project""As you start to walk on the way, the way appears"" [Rumi]The idea of building houses in mud and straw for a refugee camp occured to Giovanni about 1 year ago, after having spent one night in a hostel built in mud & straw. These houses are traditional feature of cities in both Syria and Lebanon: the center of Damascus is built this way.The Ecolodge Hostel in Taanayel (Beqaa Valley, Lebanon)From March to May of 2014 Giovanni lived with volunteers of the Italian NGO Operazione Colomba in the Syrian refugee camps situated in the North of Lebanon. They got to know a large Syrian family that had escaped from Homs, after a 1 year-long siege of their district. Their homes were destroyed, and they were forced to flee the country. These people had been living in shacks made of wood, plastic or cardboard for over 2 years.In the hostel Giovanni had bought a manual outlining the traditional mud & straw building technique, and he showed it to the inhabitants of the camp. The clan’s matriarch told him that before marrying and moving to Homs she lived in the countryside, where her family had built in this way the home where she grew up.""Her story fascinated me, and I started thinking that it would be great that these people, who had lost their homes to bombs, could build new homes for themselves with their own hands – homes that are healthy, comfortable, graceful and eco-friendly""In mid-April of 2015, Giovanni contacted these families again. They were struggling to pay the land's rent, because funding they were receiving until that moment had stopped. After managing to pay the land's rent until April 2016 through donations, thogheter we decided that it was worth starting to work on this project. As many Syrian refugees in Lebanon, the inhabitants of al-Rabia camp are now struggling to simply survive and offer something to their children. This project is a way to improve the living contitions of these people and create something good out of the war in Syria. If this project will succeed, 65 people could keep living in the settlement until April 2017, they will have a confortable common space and common restrooms and lavatories, and they will learn a building technique that they could reuse on thier own.This will be possible if 500 people could contribute with 10 UDS each.
     If this sounds good to you, please help us.

Saida met her husband when he came to Ramallah to work as a business consultant.
Saleh met his wife while he was working in Jordan.
Christo met his wife Heather when she came to Ramallah to teach at the music conservatory where he also teaches.
Every family has its own unique story. What these families share is the constant fear that they will not be able to continue living together in the West Bank.International law guarantees every human being the basic right to live with their family in safety and dignity.Yet Israel refuses to grant the foreign spouses of Palestinians the right to live with them in the West Bank. Nominally, the Palestinian Authority is responsible for processing applications for family unification, but in fact, all applications have to be approved by Israel. Since 2000, Israel has frozen the review of Palestinian family unification requests. As a result, foreign spouses, and in some cases children, live in the West Bank with short-term visitors' permits or with no legal status at all.Without a residency permit, they live in a constant state of uncertainty and instability. They cannot work legally or get a drivers' license. Every time they are stopped at an Israeli checkpoint they run the risk of arrest and deportation.This is what happened to Ma'an, whose father is Palestinian and mother is from South America. He has been in immigration detention for almost two years! Israel is trying to deport him, although he has lived in the West Bank since he was a toddler. His family unification request, submitted in 2007, was never reviewed by Israel, which therefore considers him an illegal alien.HaMoked is advocating on behalf of these families – normal people whose only wish is to live together, without fear of separation and deportation.

We want to get a moving soup kitchen were we can go out at night and deliver a service to the homeless, We will giving food, clothes, sleeping bags all around London.
We believe this is really needed as there are a lot of homeless people that do get information about services like homeless centres and think that it will be best if we do that service while feeding them at the same time.

Your support will help me carry out this important and desperately necessary work to support women’s rights in India! Although I knew that I would be unable to make ends meet on a local NGO salary (USD 400/month), after spending so many years working and studying to become a human rights advocate, I leapt at the opportunity to take on the systemic injustice and harsh realities discussed in this video in the land where I was born. With the help of this website, I invite you to help make a difference by supporting my grassroots work for the next 13 months. </p>
<p>Various studies in recent years have labeled Indian women the most stressed in the world, subject to some of the highest levels of violence against women (in and out of the domestic setting), and specific to reproductive rights the highest instance of maternal mortality. All of the women of my family have been born and have given birth in India. Furthermore, all of them, with exception of my mother, continue to live in India. I felt compelled to take the position at HRLN as an Indian woman.</p>
<p>Despite some legislative protection of reproductive rights in India, reproductive self-determination is not yet a reality for many Indian women. Many women give birth too early in life, too frequently, and often in situations that are undignified. Reproductive rights work here focuses on: access to health care services including contraception, pre-natal care, institutional delivery, and post-natal care; prevention of forced sterilization of marginalized populations; and efforts to increase knowledge regarding both reproduction as well as basic access to health care. </p>
<p>The Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) is a collective of lawyers and social activists dedicated to the use of the legal system to advance human rights in India and the sub-continent for poor, minority and other marginalized people. I choose to work with the Reproductive Rights Initiative at the Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) due to their commitment to grassroots and individual client work, despite, their paying a fraction of similarly purposed international NGOs.  </p>
<p>With your support, my advocacy can make a difference at both the local and national level. I will manage reproductive rights court cases before High Courts (of States) and the Supreme Court. These cases resulting in good orders can introduce sweeping changes affecting thousands of women at once. By leading fact finding mission to assess and document situation of women and children on the ground and possibly open new Public Interest Litigations (PILs) to support women whose rights the government has blithely ignored. By training local, regional, and national civil society organizations, medical students, lawyers, and judges we hope to make sure that multiple partners can come together to create real change for women in India.</p>
<p>After deciding to pursue a career in international public service, due to the comparative standards of rights around the world, it has been important to me to focus on women’s rights. Women are the most underutilized and effective tool in developing nations, as many reports have shown. Furthermore, I wanted to give back to my country of origin. I was born in India and was raised there and in Mexico, Germany, and the U.S.  Due, in part, to my being raised around the world I have known from a young age that I wanted to be a human rights advocate and humanitarian aid worker.  I have taken every possible step since then to place myself in a situation to achieve that goal. I have a B.A. in Political Science from Emory University, a J.D. in International Human Rights Law and a M.A. in International Development from American University.</p></div>","Please help support women's rights in India by directly supporting a human rights lawyer who has dedicated her post-graduated year to working on key women's and public health issues.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<br/><h5><span>Human Empowerment Network (HEN) serves
 both combat veterans and the needs of communities, based on sound 
ethnographic and cultural analysis. HEN uses defense analytics and 
Special Operations approaches to map the needs of poor or violent areas 
as well as map the skills and knowledge of veterans who need 
interpersonal or material support. This creates a 'horizontal platform' 
in which these veterans find pathways of stability as they help build up
 low-income neighborhoods and entire communities, via their motivation, 
skill and underutilized abilities.</span></h5>We are veteran-owned (I myself served in Europe, Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa). Our idea formed during the Hurricane Sandy relief effort.  We discovered a
nimble, grassroots movement like Occupy Sandy was a more effective humanitarian
venture than large bureaucratic organizations like city government or
FEMA.  It was so significant at one point government relief workers were
directing storm victims to Occupy Sandy.  But the grassroots approach is
not just effective disaster relief.  It is the way forward to bringing
innovative growth.<br/><br/>Education is the most 
vital commodity to our society.  As the world grows more interconnected 
and complicated it is crucial now more than ever. <br/>Institutions
 like public schools are universities play their part, but the most 
important factors are critical thinking, communication, and a global 
perspective.  It is with this impetus we start the Human Empowerment
 Network.  Our mission is to create a platform where information and 
knowledge can be shared in a grassroots movement, fostering sustainable 
innovation for individuals, businesses, and communities.<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> For those with a more detailed interest, here is a breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>The funding we need is for basic start-up capital. We have our projects well in place, as many in Red Hook will testify (including the local VFW post and many lifetime residents), and are simply awaiting funds. While it is a seemingly modest amount for the scale and scope of the impact we are working to make, it is initially modest for a reason: starting small avoids too much preoccupation within neighborhoods on money in an d of itself, enhancing friendly cooperation rather than self-interest and fear of loss with all players involved. In addition, making modest sums go a long way dollar for dollar, in transparent fashion, only enhances efficacy and paves the way for a follow-on rate of return of larger amounts to follow. <br/>
</li>

<p><b>HEN in action</b><br/>
Our first project was in the Red Hook neighborhood of Brooklyn, NY.<br/>
We began by ""mapping"" the community: who are the key leaders, how
does information flow, what are the biggest needs, and where are the hidden assets. 
We found that people communicate and interact through informal
""nodes:"" churches, small stores (bodegas), coffee shops, and<br/>
bars.  We introduced ourselves to the leaders and owners of these nodes,
explained who we are and what we wanted to do, and asked them to get the word
out.  Soon we had many involved residents coming to us.  One of the
biggest concerns was education, especially financial<br/>
education.  Another need was better communication with local government. 
The current incumbent was not serving the neighborhood well, in fact she rarely
even visited.  Finally, we found that, despite many people and
organizations trying to better the community,<br/>
they were not talking to each other and collaborating.  Using our neighborhood
mapping, we created a communication platform to help information flow more
effectively.<br/></p>
<p><b><span>Our Impact</span></b><br/>
We found a local man who wanted to help solve the problem of financial
education, but had never been given the opportunity. Self-taught in economics
and finance, we linked him with a nonprofit that helps at-risk youth to teach a
series of financial literacy classes.  For our first class we hoped maybe
a dozen kids would show up.  Around 50 did.<br/>
To help improve government, we helped a new face who shares our passion for
community development in this year's city council election against the deeply
entrenched incumbent.  He was running for the first time, and faced an
uphill battle, being outspent 5 to 1.<br/>
As an emerging key leader, we used our cultural and network-analytic communication
platform to get the word out about his goals for the community, and despite a
much smaller campaign fund, he won by almost 20 percentage points.<br/>
One of the most exciting initiatives the new city councilman promised was
Participatory Budgeting (PB).  PB allows the neighborhood to decide how a
certain part of the city budget will be allocated, in this case $2
million.  The benefit is two-fold: the money goes to where it is needed
most, and the community is more involved in government, taking an active role
rather than a passive one. One of the biggest concerns about PB is that the
same vested interests will run the show at the expense of the rest of the
community.  We ensured this wasn't so.  Using our same communications
platform, we created a forum that brought together business owners, nonprofits,
local artists, the citizens association, and concerned residents to<br/>
implement PB.  The meeting was a success, and the bulk of the money will
go towards unmet education needs.  But the most important change was the
tone of the meeting.  Before we began our project, neighborhood meetings
were filled with bitterness and a sense of ennui.  Now the tone is one of
optimism and action. No other district involved in the PB program has engaged a
community in this unprecedented fashion, and Red Hook will be a model for
others to follow.<br/>
Our long term goal is to have non-profits allocate their money in the same
fashion.  As we continue to grow, and gain more solid financial traction,
that is exactly what we plan to do.
</p>
<p><span><br/><b>Why we partner<span>  with veterans organizations</span></b><br/>
No community is ""marginalized"" more than our veterans, both as needs<br/>
and resources.  Many organizations are currently doing a noble task of
getting<br/>
them the basic resources they deserve: food, shelter, and in many<br/>
cases, medical support.  That is the first step.  But veterans are
not<br/>
liabilities to our nation.  Far from it. They are assets, with wide<br/>
variety of skills that must be integrated into the private sector.<br/>
And this is where we can assist with the Human Empowerment Network.<br/>
In some instances, we can link them with employers that can teach them<br/>
what they need.  In others, they will be the teachers.  The key is
for<br/>
it to be transparent and horizontal.  The possibilities are endless.<br/><span></span></span></p>

Human Empowerment Network (HEN) serves
 both combat veterans and the needs of communities, based on sound 
ethnographic and cultural analysis. HEN uses defense analytics and 
Special Operations approaches to map the needs of poor or violent areas 
as well as map the skills and knowledge of veterans who need 
interpersonal or material support. This creates a 'horizontal platform' 
in which these veterans find pathways of stability as they help build up
 low-income neighborhoods and entire communities, via their motivation, 
skill and underutilized abilities.We are veteran-owned (I myself served in Europe, Iraq, Afghanistan and Africa). Our idea formed during the Hurricane Sandy relief effort.  We discovered a
nimble, grassroots movement like Occupy Sandy was a more effective humanitarian
venture than large bureaucratic organizations like city government or
FEMA.  It was so significant at one point government relief workers were
directing storm victims to Occupy Sandy.  But the grassroots approach is
not just effective disaster relief.  It is the way forward to bringing
innovative growth.Education is the most 
vital commodity to our society.  As the world grows more interconnected 
and complicated it is crucial now more than ever. Institutions
 like public schools are universities play their part, but the most 
important factors are critical thinking, communication, and a global 
perspective.  It is with this impetus we start the Human Empowerment
 Network.  Our mission is to create a platform where information and 
knowledge can be shared in a grassroots movement, fostering sustainable 
innovation for individuals, businesses, and communities.



What We Need & What You Get
 For those with a more detailed interest, here is a breakdown:

The funding we need is for basic start-up capital. We have our projects well in place, as many in Red Hook will testify (including the local VFW post and many lifetime residents), and are simply awaiting funds. While it is a seemingly modest amount for the scale and scope of the impact we are working to make, it is initially modest for a reason: starting small avoids too much preoccupation within neighborhoods on money in an d of itself, enhancing friendly cooperation rather than self-interest and fear of loss with all players involved. In addition, making modest sums go a long way dollar for dollar, in transparent fashion, only enhances efficacy and paves the way for a follow-on rate of return of larger amounts to follow. 

We are available to donors by phone, email and Skype (or face to face if you are in the area) to explain our business model and funding scheme in whatever level of detail you need. (1) Paying skilled residents of the Red Hook community (especially veterans and older, under-employed residents) to improve their neighborhood and teach valuable trade skills to youth in the process, based on well-defined social impact projects vetted by the community and annotated in a business plan and project writeup, in a transparent manner.

Γιατί τρέχω στον 33ο Μαραθώνιο Αθηνών


Tρέχω με την ομάδα του Eλληνικού τμήματος της Διεθνούς Αμνηστίας, στα 10χλμ και στηρίζω την εκστρατεία της οργάνωσης  υπέρ των δικαιωμάτων των προσφύγων. Τρέχω γιατί δεν θέλω να δω άλλους ανθρώπους να πνίγονται στη Μεσόγειο και το Αιγαίο ή να υποφέρουν στα σύνορα πίσω από τους φράχτες μιας Ευρώπης Φρούριο.


Γιατί θέλω να με στηρίξεις

Στηρίζοντας την προσπάθειά μου  στηρίζεις μια ισχυρή παρουσία της  Διεθνούς Αμνηστίας στην Ελλάδα που σημαίνει μεγαλύτερη πίεση στις ελληνικές και  ευρωπαϊκές αρχές να σεβαστούν τα δικαιώματα των προσφύγων. Σημαίνει στήριξη  των αλληλέγγυων και ακτιβιστών/ριών που δουλεύουν καθημερινά στην πρώτη  γραμμή. Σημαίνει ανεξάρτητη και αξιόπιστη έρευνα που μεταφράζεται σε εκστρατείες ώστε η Ευρωπαϊκή Ένωση να καλωσορίζει τους πρόσφυγες και να σεβαστεί τα δικαιώματά τους. 

Που θα πάνε τα χρήματα;
Τα χρήματα θα πάνε για τη δράση του ελληνικού τμήματος της Διεθνούς Αμνηστίας και ειδικότερα για τη στήριξη της εκστρατείας SOS Europe που κινητοποιέι χιλιάδες ακτιβιστές και ακτιβίστριες στην Ευρώπη και τον κόσμο απαιτώντας το σεβασμό των δικαιωμάτων των προσφύγων. Οι εκστρατείες της Διεθνούς Αμνηστίας χρηματοδοτούνται αποκλειστικά από τις δωρεές των μελών και των υποστηρικτών της.

<h3>The short story of a country hijacked by corrupted political parties</h3>
<p>On June 23, 2013 Albania holds national elections. Nowadays Albanian citizens are called by political parties to vote for the lesser evil.

<p>In Albania there is no free media. Every media operator is controlled by opposition political parties or the government. The organized crime has very strong ties with the government and opposition parties and is used to a great extend before elections to fund campaigns and to threaten opponents. Most of the international aid focused on democratization goes to N G Os that are directly or indirectly serving the interests of political parties. Any free grassroots citizen movement is attacked and discouraged.</p>
<p>Citizens are oppressed by the government and opposition political parties. All individuals that work for the public administration of the central or local government are obliged to attend &amp; support the electoral campaign of the government or the opposition. As a result electoral campaigns of all parties are attended &amp; supported by thousands of people that are threatened to lose their job if they do not obey to the party of the central government or the parties of the opposition.</p>

<h3><strong>The protest camp on June 21, 2013</strong></h3>
<p>Albanian politicians claim that Albanian citizens support corrupted political parties by voting for them. To show that Albanian citizens disagree with the corrupted political system installed in the country and are not willing to vote for the lesser evil, on June 21, 2013 (36 hours before election day) a protest camp will be set up at the center of Tirana.</p>

My journey to Haiti provided me with significant life lessons, and the patience and graciousness the communities expressed for the little amount that we were able to provide was beyond inspiring and enlightening. Last year, one man waited quietly in the clinic for <i>hours</i> to be provided a catheter. Every time I walked by him, he would smile at me, and when I was putting in his information at the end of his long clinic visit, he was just smiling from ear to ear. These communities taught me true resilience, and how happiness sprouts from the simplest of things. And if I cannot aid every person, I will have at least helped one person- even if it is just by making them smile, entering their medical information after a long day at clinic, or offering a bite to eat.<div>

<p>I was truly humbled , and I enjoyed my time so much that I am going back in August 2016. This time I was able to convince one of my dearest friends, Terence Kwan, to join me!</p>

<b>Back in 2009, I, Terence</b>, immersed myself in a Design-for-the-Majority project during college, with the help of grants and non-profit support.  Ultimately, our team traveled to a remote town in Cameroon, Africa (Lebialem) to further refine our concept of a low-cost, quick-to-assemble joinery system.  I uncovered a profound realization during my residency that's since influenced both my life and career, as a person and as a designer.  Over 90% of the human population on this planet is categorized as living below the 1st-world status.  Everyday, those of us in the 'developed-world' (the 10%) find dismay in, what should be, the comforts of our lives, often because we forget there's a bigger human struggle beyond us--taking -our opportunities for granted.  But in the still-developing world, the reality is that most towns and villages may not have things like clean running water, a reliable or existing electrical grid, or access to any health services.  This last service is where I would like to help continue to make an impact for those who need it.<br/><p></p>
<p>It's been 7 years since my experience in Africa and now's a better time than any to go out and help our fellow souls in need.  This August, I'll be joining Rebecca Marcy as we provide health aid to local community patients in Haiti.  </p>

</div></div>","To all of our friends, our families, acquaintances, and anyone else!Last May 2015, I, Rebecca, experienced a trip to Haiti alongside my sister and many other admirable volunteers to help provide healthcare to Do Digue as well as other nearby villages. My journey to Haiti provided me with significant life lessons, and the patience and graciousness the communities expressed for the little amount that we were able to provide was beyond inspiring and enlightening. Last year, one man waited quietly in the clinic for hours to be provided a catheter. Every time I walked by him, he would smile at me, and when I was putting in his information at the end of his long clinic visit, he was just smiling from ear to ear. These communities taught me true resilience, and how happiness sprouts from the simplest of things. And if I cannot aid every person, I will have at least helped one person- even if it is just by making them smile, entering their medical information after a long day at clinic, or offering a bite to eat.

I was truly humbled , and I enjoyed my time so much that I am going back in August 2016. This time I was able to convince one of my dearest friends, Terence Kwan, to join me!


Back in 2009, I, Terence, immersed myself in a Design-for-the-Majority project during college, with the help of grants and non-profit support.  Ultimately, our team traveled to a remote town in Cameroon, Africa (Lebialem) to further refine our concept of a low-cost, quick-to-assemble joinery system.  I uncovered a profound realization during my residency that's since influenced both my life and career, as a person and as a designer.  Over 90% of the human population on this planet is categorized as living below the 1st-world status.  Everyday, those of us in the 'developed-world' (the 10%) find dismay in, what should be, the comforts of our lives, often because we forget there's a bigger human struggle beyond us--taking -our opportunities for granted.  But in the still-developing world, the reality is that most towns and villages may not have things like clean running water, a reliable or existing electrical grid, or access to any health services.  This last service is where I would like to help continue to make an impact for those who need it.
It's been 7 years since my experience in Africa and now's a better time than any to go out and help our fellow souls in need.  This August, I'll be joining Rebecca Marcy as we provide health aid to local community patients in Haiti.  




Community Health Initiative Haiti (CHI) is a non-profit organization responsible for bringing teams together to travel every three months to the same communities in Arcahaie. Its mission, over the past few years, has been to gain solidarity with the people of Arcahaie in order to pinpoint and address their medical and environmental needs. Ultimately, CHI hopes that its presence becomes less and less necessary. It hopes for and works towards a time when the community will be independently stable, with the framework that CHI, its volunteers, and its staff have laboriously and lovingly laid down. Four times a year, a CHI team visits Arcahaie treating both new and return patients from this village as well surrounding communities. With the help of the CHI team in August, Terence and I will aid in providing patients with vitamins, treat them for parasites and STD's, and screen them for chronic diseases. Our doctors will perform minor surgical procedures (pictured above from last year), as well as treat acute diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and dysentery. Many of these diseases when left untreated, could prove to be fatal.

This organization has made glorious strides. This includes (but is definitely not limited to), introducing Gadyen Dlo, a water treatment system that has decreased the rate of diarrhea in these communities from 40% to 1.8%, and providing a 'ReSpectacle station', a new addition which matches patients with potential prescriptions for eyeglasses. 



Each volunteer is asked to raise or provide $1200 (this does not include airfare) which goes towards the most essential of expenses including medicine, salaries for interpreters and nurses, and room and board for the volunteers. Terence and I are hoping to raise $4000 together between both the airfare and trip expenses. 


PLEASE help us help Haiti! Any dollar amount would help us, and if you are unable to help assist financially, SPREAD THE WORD! Share, share, share by word of mouth, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Email, Snapchat, Vine... Okay maybe not that far, but please share as much as possible! We are immensely grateful for any help that comes our way, and any way you can help, matters. 

We are thrilled to be a part of this team!
We thank you a million times in advance for your support,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My mission is to create better laws and policies in states to help people who have been affected by gender power violence.  In 1994, I was a freshman in college and I was attacked from behind, by a stranger, while sitting on my front porch.  It took two decades to identify him and he was a serial rapist. </p>
<p>Once he was finally caught and sentenced, I decided to help my state by looking at legislation and policies KY had and how we could do it better.  Personally, in 2015 and 2016 I have helped to identify and clear the backlog of rape kits and rape kit reform in Kentucky and Indiana.  In 2016, I helped Indiana to pass DNA upon felony arrest, which now allows IN to swab for a DNA profile at arrest.  This has lead to some arrests of serial offenders.  In 2017, I helped to pass a bill changing the definition of rape and sodomy in the state of Kentucky which changes the way these crimes are defined and how offenders will be charged for these crimes.  By showing that these issues are about humans and human needs, it helps validate survivors victimized by crimes.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help to fund travel, accommodations and time spent going back and forth to states to speak with law enforcement, legislators, advocates, prosecutors and communities on the importance of educating about these crimes and look at strategies for creating a better system.</p>

<p><strong>The story of LUCKADAIZIAL</strong> truly begins with my lifelong love of penmanship.</p>
<p><strong>Freehand writing styles</strong> come naturally to me after years of what must be hundreds, possibly thousands of practice hours. Always doodling words, I have an obsession for calligraphy and a passion for typography I would like to share.</p>
<p>In good humour I must mention, without words surrounding me I feel dizzy, not quite myself. When the glance of reading something... anything... a front page or book cover, menu or neon light is missing from my hour-to-hour, I have been known to hyperventilate in a state-of-comical-panic.</p>
<p>Words and I go together!</p>
<div>
<p>I can't explain it other than to say, in some unusual way my minds eye will twist and turn the words I read to create a multidimensional 3D image. From magazine layouts, brochures, logos, advertisements and tag lines, hardcopy or online, letters and pictures will lift and whirl before me like a computer graphic dangling mid-air for my appreciation. So it seems natural that I would begin designing them.</p>
<p><strong>I agree, it is strange seeing LETTERS as THINGS!  </strong></p>

From magazine layouts, brochures, logos, advertisements and tag lines, hardcopy or online, letters and pictures will lift and whirl before me like a computer graphic dangling mid-air for my appreciation. So it seems natural that I would begin designing them.
I agree, it is strange seeing LETTERS as THINGS!  


s a professional Script Supervisor and freelance Story Editor in Film & Television production, I have enjoyed working with teams of terrific talent over the years, each contributing to bring page after page of script (glorious words), dynamic characters and entertaining visuals to your screen. It is magic being a small part of movie production.
Not so surprising, somewhere in the mesh of chasing my career I began to write a little, manuscripts and screenplays but also using true ink to paper my handwriting styles have been used for...
Movie Titles and Opening Credits... Party Invitations... Love Letters... Award Certificates... Movie Props and Cover Designs.
 was inspired by swirls I doodled during a recent lunch in a busy café. As fine lines of pink ink gliding across the clean white paper tablecloth, the characters of this font came to life. 
Oodles of people have suggested, encouraged, almost insisted that I become entrepreneurial... so here I am, knowing unique typeface is needed for the headlines, greetings and content written by millions of people daily. I have to admit it is exciting to see the flourish of my penmanship take form as computerized files. 
I am emerging truly as I am, a .
I truly hope LUCKADAIZIAL becomes an inspiring typeface which helps you succeed. As you can imagine, the typography and engineering with loads of encoding to develop a NEW FONT requires massive effort. Your support is very important in helping to generate Luckadaizial as a legible, smooth and expressive font finding its way in the mainstream of communication.
Constructing a reliable and decorative font with great glyphs, accurate spacing and kerning ready for web use, accessible through HTML 5, (ready for your use) requires capability beyond what I own in both hardware and software.

Easily stated, I need new gear!

 
I also need to buy part-time support from my excellent technical team.
 
 

Your PLEDGES towards raising my goal of $5000 will enable me to complete Luckadaizial initially as...

A MEDIUM weight ALL CAPITAL alphabet packaged with NUMERALS and standard PUNCTUATION, including the important EURO symbol. 
Estimated ALL CAPITAL font release: June 15th, 2012
 
Here's the FONT thing...
Should your pledges exceed $6000 a SMALL CAPS variant will be produced as well.
If pledges embrace $7000 a DROP CAPS variant will also be produced.
The matching medium weight lower case set will join in one month following the initial release, if support tops $12,000. Estimated delivery: July 2012
So that ALL words written in the Luckadaizial font appear ideally dressed...
If you really cheer this endeavour on, the full EUROPEAN ISO 8859-1 Latin (Western) character set will be included should your support reach $18,000.  From there... the sky is the limit.
These funds will generate the complete MEDIUM weight LUCKADAIZIAL font with great technical support onboard to verify the files using rasterized bitmaps and custom built curve tracing software.
Should my $5000 goal not be reached, funds collected will be used for tech resources and I will continue preparing LUCKADAIZIAL for delivery... as best I can.
If letters are not your thing, I encourage you to participate by informing others to take a look! PLEASE spread the word of Luckadaizial with your friends, family and colleagues. Share info on Facebook, Twitter and other favorite websites. There are many ways to help, including the terrific Indiegogo share tools.
 
Take a peek at www.woowords.com my splash page. The site is under construction as I am busy...
FONTILIZING: an expression of great love, the indication of feeling artistically fabulous with the personal design effort of creating unique shapes for each letter of the alphabet.
To the professionals out there... during this campaign...
The Luckadaizial MEDIUM WEIGHT font in embeddable form will be LICENSED for all COMMERCIAL PRINT USE to the pledge holders.
This means, the MEDIUM weight variant in OpenType format is yours for online, hardcopy or real world use when you pledge Luckadaizial Club or higher. However, derivative rights of redistribution, service bureaus or conversion of files to a second party will not be offered. Straight forward, understandable and fair.
This commercial license is MY GIFT TO YOU, to properly thank supporters for being a KEY factor with the Luckadaizial launch. Great fun!
 
Please remember, this font is in the development stage. Files are being carefully rendered, adjusted and perfected daily. In the future, should demand indicate Luckadaizial is a rising star, the Light, Bold and possibly the Condensed styles will be released. Perhaps even as a Multiple Master font!
I am thrilled that WooWords Creative Arts, my little FONT FOUNDRY is producing Luckadaizial. Join in, take part on the adventure by visiting often.
As a surprise, a bonus image from the...
 typography digital files will be displayed every few days here on Indiegogo.
Remember, you may contact me directly at: ddebutler@woowords.com
Should you be placing a pledge, please, forward a fast-email 'Hello' to me so I may confirm your email and/or mailing address as required for you to receive your security download codes, and product.
With Luv & Luck...you are true patrons of the ARTS, be proud!
Thanks,

</p><p>Our Mission: <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Northwest Earth Institute is a non-profit

<p>We believe change should be fun. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">There’s no shortage of information about the
serious challenges facing our planet – and although most people say they would
like to do more, they don’t know where to start.</span></p>
<p>That’s where we come in. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">For 20 years, NWEI has helped make change more
possible, more social, and yes, more fun by helping people connect with their
communities and take action, together. </span></p><p></p><h3>About This Campaign</h3><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">At the core of our work are discussion courses (like the one we are asking to you to fund today!) that give communities a non-prescriptive framework to take action on issues that matter. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Building on our work to advance sustainability and a brighter future at the grassroots level, we turn this spring to tackle the interrelated social issues facing our world. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Heading toward 9 billion people on planet Earth with the fewest regrets demands a holistic approach. T</span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">o act for global prosperity, we need to fully understand the complex systems that impact our everyday decisions. </span></p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Through shared learning and discovery, the NW Earth Institute’s newest discussion course, <b><i>Seeing Systems: Peace, Justice &amp; Sustainability</i></b>, empowers individuals and communities to create real change in their daily lives, contributing to a more peaceful, just and sustainable world. </span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>

<li>While we might not have the most exciting perks in the world, yours is an investment that creates real change in communities throughout the country. It's something you can feel good about -- and something you have a direct stake in.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p><p></p>Before the term ""sustainability"" was embedded in our culture, the NW Earth Institute was building a foundation of civic engagement and community transformation. Every dollar we raise here is put toward not just the funding of a vital educational tool, but toward an education that takes us into the depth of things. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A depth that’s needed more than ever before. Over 145,000 people have participated in NW Earth Institute programs, and local business, higher education and community leaders reference NWEI as a vehicle for positive change.<br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/>You know that Margaret Mead quote?<br/></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/><i>""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.""<br/></i></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i><br/></i>However cliche it may seem, its truth remains. Whether you're looking at the civil rights movement of the '60s or the cultural shift to respond to the real risks of climate change, </span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">never doubt that your community can be the change you want to see in the world.*<br/></i><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i><br/></i>(*Alright, we admit to referencing Gandhi in that one, too.) </span><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Hey, we're a nonprofit -- there are are many ways you can get involved and help! We understand that you might not have cash to contribute. But don't go! Here are some impactful ways in which you can still help:</p><ul>
<li>Make some noise about our campaign! Personal emails, Facebook, Twitter -- it's all good! Share this campaign widely -- peace and justice touch us all and perhaps someone in your network would like to support the cause!</li>

Our Mission: Northwest Earth Institute is a non-profit
organization that inspires people to take responsibility for Earth.
We believe change should be fun. There’s no shortage of information about the
serious challenges facing our planet – and although most people say they would
like to do more, they don’t know where to start.
That’s where we come in. For 20 years, NWEI has helped make change more
possible, more social, and yes, more fun by helping people connect with their
communities and take action, together. About This CampaignAt the core of our work are discussion courses (like the one we are asking to you to fund today!) that give communities a non-prescriptive framework to take action on issues that matter. Building on our work to advance sustainability and a brighter future at the grassroots level, we turn this spring to tackle the interrelated social issues facing our world. Heading toward 9 billion people on planet Earth with the fewest regrets demands a holistic approach. To act for global prosperity, we need to fully understand the complex systems that impact our everyday decisions. Through shared learning and discovery, the NW Earth Institute’s newest discussion course, Seeing Systems: Peace, Justice & Sustainability, empowers individuals and communities to create real change in their daily lives, contributing to a more peaceful, just and sustainable world. What We Need & What You Get
Every single dollar we raise will go directly toward the publication and distribution of our new discussion course book, available for pre-order now! 
While we might not have the most exciting perks in the world, yours is an investment that creates real change in communities throughout the country. It's something you can feel good about -- and something you have a direct stake in.
The ImpactBefore the term ""sustainability"" was embedded in our culture, the NW Earth Institute was building a foundation of civic engagement and community transformation. Every dollar we raise here is put toward not just the funding of a vital educational tool, but toward an education that takes us into the depth of things. A depth that’s needed more than ever before. Over 145,000 people have participated in NW Earth Institute programs, and local business, higher education and community leaders reference NWEI as a vehicle for positive change.You know that Margaret Mead quote?""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.""However cliche it may seem, its truth remains. Whether you're looking at the civil rights movement of the '60s or the cultural shift to respond to the real risks of climate change, never doubt that your community can be the change you want to see in the world.*(*Alright, we admit to referencing Gandhi in that one, too.) Other Ways You Can HelpHey, we're a nonprofit -- there are are many ways you can get involved and help! We understand that you might not have cash to contribute. But don't go! Here are some impactful ways in which you can still help:
Make some noise about our campaign! Personal emails, Facebook, Twitter -- it's all good! Share this campaign widely -- peace and justice touch us all and perhaps someone in your network would like to support the cause!

<h2>Why is it important to get young people to UNCSW?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483483412/eyhxiuoer9um3umkksnt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>For two weeks each year around International Women’s Day on March 8th, thousands of delegates gather at the United Nations in New York City for the Commission on the Status of Women. Faith based organizations such as the Anglican Church send delegates to participate in the Commission.</p>
<p>For anyone who is interested in the important ministry of gender justice, this is the place to learn, connect and engage. Right now in the Church, we need young feminists who have an interest in gender justice to be able to come to UNCSW.</p>
<p>But for young people in Canada, the cost of a week or more in New York City is too high. Right now there is no dedicated funding at any level in our Church for gender justice ministry or UNCSW in particular and so the only way to help young people get there, is for us to do our own fundraising.</p>
<p>The UN Commission on the Status of Women is a wonderful opportunity to support and empower young feminists in the Church. We need your financial gift to help get there.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483483709/xlbuivkxdoblgzemwuhp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Women's organizations and faith leaders for gender justice and endorse our project:</strong></p>
<p>The Anglican Church Women of the Diocese of New Westminster are contributing up to $10,000 towards the travel costs for delegates from that diocese.</p> <p>""It is essential that Anglican youth and young adults are enabled to speak into processes and decision-making that will have a significant impact on their lives and well-being, and to bring the formative values of their faith to a broader arena. Young people are under multiple pressures the world over but have the potential to bring hope and energy to transforming those things which would thwart their own human flourishing and the thriving of others - especially where they are given opportunities to advocate, network and learn from others.""</p>
<p><strong>- The Rev. Terrie Robinson Director for Women in Church &amp; Society </strong></p>
<p><strong>Anglican Communion Office, London, UK</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>""I think it is vital that young women from our diocese attend the UN Commission on the Status of Women, as they will carry that experience into all their future church leadership, as clergy and laity.  I know my early formation with the World Council of Churches and Ecumenical Forum study tours widened my vision of the Church and shaped a lifelong passion for world-wide social and justice issues.  This kind of participation and exposure is essential to the health of the local Church, especially with living out our fourth Mark of Mission: To transform unjust structures of society, to challenge violence of every kind and pursue peace and reconciliation.""</p>
<p><strong>- The Rev. Dr. Lynne McNaughton, Priest, St. Clements, North Vancouver, </strong></p>
<p><strong>Deputy Prolocutor, Anglican Church of Canada</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is the experience of UNCSW like?</h2>
<p>Going to UNCSW is a different experience for each participant. There is so much gender justice work going on all at once, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Talks, panels and presentations hosted by different governments and NGOs.</li>
<li>Visits to national missions to the UN to discuss issues relevant to each national context.</li>
<li>Daily worship hosted by our umbrella group, Ecumenical Women.</li>
<li>Strategy meetings about how we can advocate for the issues that need more attention.</li>
<li>Daily briefings on the progress of the agreed conclusions - the UN document which is negotiated between governments on the priority theme.</li>
<li>Opportunities to meet in regional and special interest groups.</li>
<li>Receptions and cultural presentations</li>
<li>Visits to the UN headquarters.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of this focuses around a different theme each year which runs like a thread through all these aspects of UNCSW. This year the theme is 'Women's Economic Empowerment in the Changing World of Work.'</p>
<p>The UN Working Group on Girls holds an orientation and a youth forum to ensure that young people make the most of their time at CSW. Young delegates from different countries and youth organizations take part in crafting their own statement on the year's theme.</p>
<p>Anglicans also get together regularly to connect with others from across the Communion and with our ecumenical partners. We worship together, share meals, tell stories of our home Churches and countries and write statements together to share our experience with the rest of the Anglican Communion. The Canadian Anglican group has always been very active and it is always exciting to orient new people to this gender justice work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Caitlin's Story about Alice</h3>
<p>Alice has been doing gender justice work in the Church for decades, her whole career in ministry really. She was one of the first women to serve as a parish priest in the Anglican Church of Canada; she was in Beijing in 1995 for the fourth World Conference on Women; she has been to meetings of the Anglican Consultative Council as a part of the International Anglican Women's Network; she has been to UNCSW countless times.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483485518/oyt8igfnsplxkhvo8rdm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I still remember my first conversation with Alice, in 2011 before my first time going to the UN Commission on the Status of Women. She was excited to have a young person (well Church young) as a part of their delegation - like really excited, giddy really. You see, Alice is in her 80s and she wants to make sure that this ministry she has been called to is carried on by younger generations. From this first conversation, her enthusiasm and passion for this ministry was catching. My first experience of UNCSW was a whirlwind, and my main take away was that this amazing experience needed to be shared. That it is important for us to lift as we climb. I want to make this opportunity more accessible, especially for young people.</p>

<p><i>""</i>A few words I can use to describe the entire experience are <i>inspirational, educational and thought provoking...</i>Over the course of the week I had the opportunity to be a part of two different statement writings...It was important, useful and necessary to have the opportunity to bring up our ideas and points of view separate from the work being done by adult delegates.  I personally was pleased to have the opportunity to address the current situation of the LGBTQ community (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans* and Queer) in Canada and specifically that of Trans* women.<i>""</i></p>

<p><i>""A lasting impression of attending the Commission on the Status of Women meetings for the first time is of tears...... lots of tears... pouring freely down my cheeks... Tears of gratitude to be able to participate in something I had dreamed of for years; tears of sadness at the stories and statistics of women's plight around the world, one heard in every meeting and conversation; tears of wonder at the thousands of people from all parts of the globe that cared, that came, that advocated, that dared to believe it could be different, that knew that while some progress had been made there was still a long way to go and were committed to go the distance.""</i> <strong>- Ellen Duffield, participant in UNCSW58, 2014</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How will your financial gift help?</h2>
<p>The group includes people from the Diocese of New Westminster and the Diocese of Niagara. We will be using the money from this campaign to pay for rooms at the YMCA near the UN as well as our food and some incidental costs like the shuttle from the airport and registration fees for events. We also have separate funding for our travel costs for each group, since these amounts are quite different for those from each diocese. This is a ""flexible funding"" project so whatever amount we raise will go to increase the quality and accessibility of the trip. Each participant will also be contributing to the total cost; each dollar we raise will decrease the cost to participants and make it easier for them to participate.</p>
<p><strong>$8550 CAD </strong> ($6,384 USD)  Accommodations for 12 at the YMCA for 7 nights      </p>
<p><strong>$4200 CAD  </strong>Food and Incidental Costs, $50/day/person for 12 people for 7 days</p>
<p><strong>$1250 CAD   </strong>Emergency Fund and Funding Campaign Fees</p>
<p><strong>Total Expenses = $14,000 CAD</strong></p>
<p>Canadian contributors giving $20 or more will receive an official charitable donation receipt for tax purposes through the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster.</p>

</div></div>","Why is it important to get young people to UNCSW?
 

For two weeks each year around International Women’s Day on March 8th, thousands of delegates gather at the United Nations in New York City for the Commission on the Status of Women. Faith based organizations such as the Anglican Church send delegates to participate in the Commission.
For anyone who is interested in the important ministry of gender justice, this is the place to learn, connect and engage. Right now in the Church, we need young feminists who have an interest in gender justice to be able to come to UNCSW.
But for young people in Canada, the cost of a week or more in New York City is too high. Right now there is no dedicated funding at any level in our Church for gender justice ministry or UNCSW in particular and so the only way to help young people get there, is for us to do our own fundraising.
The UN Commission on the Status of Women is a wonderful opportunity to support and empower young feminists in the Church. We need your financial gift to help get there.

Women's organizations and faith leaders for gender justice and endorse our project:
The Anglican Church Women of the Diocese of New Westminster are contributing up to $10,000 towards the travel costs for delegates from that diocese. ""It is essential that Anglican youth and young adults are enabled to speak into processes and decision-making that will have a significant impact on their lives and well-being, and to bring the formative values of their faith to a broader arena. Young people are under multiple pressures the world over but have the potential to bring hope and energy to transforming those things which would thwart their own human flourishing and the thriving of others - especially where they are given opportunities to advocate, network and learn from others.""
- The Rev. Terrie Robinson Director for Women in Church & Society 
Anglican Communion Office, London, UK
 
""I think it is vital that young women from our diocese attend the UN Commission on the Status of Women, as they will carry that experience into all their future church leadership, as clergy and laity.  I know my early formation with the World Council of Churches and Ecumenical Forum study tours widened my vision of the Church and shaped a lifelong passion for world-wide social and justice issues.  This kind of participation and exposure is essential to the health of the local Church, especially with living out our fourth Mark of Mission: To transform unjust structures of society, to challenge violence of every kind and pursue peace and reconciliation.""
- The Rev. Dr. Lynne McNaughton, Priest, St. Clements, North Vancouver, 
Deputy Prolocutor, Anglican Church of Canada
 
What is the experience of UNCSW like?
Going to UNCSW is a different experience for each participant. There is so much gender justice work going on all at once, including:

Talks, panels and presentations hosted by different governments and NGOs.
Visits to national missions to the UN to discuss issues relevant to each national context.
Daily worship hosted by our umbrella group, Ecumenical Women.
Strategy meetings about how we can advocate for the issues that need more attention.
Daily briefings on the progress of the agreed conclusions - the UN document which is negotiated between governments on the priority theme.
Opportunities to meet in regional and special interest groups.
Receptions and cultural presentations
Visits to the UN headquarters.

All of this focuses around a different theme each year which runs like a thread through all these aspects of UNCSW. This year the theme is 'Women's Economic Empowerment in the Changing World of Work.'
The UN Working Group on Girls holds an orientation and a youth forum to ensure that young people make the most of their time at CSW. Young delegates from different countries and youth organizations take part in crafting their own statement on the year's theme.
Anglicans also get together regularly to connect with others from across the Communion and with our ecumenical partners. We worship together, share meals, tell stories of our home Churches and countries and write statements together to share our experience with the rest of the Anglican Communion. The Canadian Anglican group has always been very active and it is always exciting to orient new people to this gender justice work.
 
Caitlin's Story about Alice
Alice has been doing gender justice work in the Church for decades, her whole career in ministry really. She was one of the first women to serve as a parish priest in the Anglican Church of Canada; she was in Beijing in 1995 for the fourth World Conference on Women; she has been to meetings of the Anglican Consultative Council as a part of the International Anglican Women's Network; she has been to UNCSW countless times.

I still remember my first conversation with Alice, in 2011 before my first time going to the UN Commission on the Status of Women. She was excited to have a young person (well Church young) as a part of their delegation - like really excited, giddy really. You see, Alice is in her 80s and she wants to make sure that this ministry she has been called to is carried on by younger generations. From this first conversation, her enthusiasm and passion for this ministry was catching. My first experience of UNCSW was a whirlwind, and my main take away was that this amazing experience needed to be shared. That it is important for us to lift as we climb. I want to make this opportunity more accessible, especially for young people.
""Change is slow,
but if we don't work for change
our granddaughters will have to."" - The Rev. Canon Alice Medcof
 
Here is what some previous participants have to say:

""A few words I can use to describe the entire experience are inspirational, educational and thought provoking...Over the course of the week I had the opportunity to be a part of two different statement writings...It was important, useful and necessary to have the opportunity to bring up our ideas and points of view separate from the work being done by adult delegates.  I personally was pleased to have the opportunity to address the current situation of the LGBTQ community (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans* and Queer) in Canada and specifically that of Trans* women.""
- Evie Byrne, youth participant in UNCSW58, 2014

""A lasting impression of attending the Commission on the Status of Women meetings for the first time is of tears...... lots of tears... pouring freely down my cheeks... Tears of gratitude to be able to participate in something I had dreamed of for years; tears of sadness at the stories and statistics of women's plight around the world, one heard in every meeting and conversation; tears of wonder at the thousands of people from all parts of the globe that cared, that came, that advocated, that dared to believe it could be different, that knew that while some progress had been made there was still a long way to go and were committed to go the distance."" - Ellen Duffield, participant in UNCSW58, 2014
 
How will your financial gift help?
The group includes people from the Diocese of New Westminster and the Diocese of Niagara. We will be using the money from this campaign to pay for rooms at the YMCA near the UN as well as our food and some incidental costs like the shuttle from the airport and registration fees for events. We also have separate funding for our travel costs for each group, since these amounts are quite different for those from each diocese. This is a ""flexible funding"" project so whatever amount we raise will go to increase the quality and accessibility of the trip. Each participant will also be contributing to the total cost; each dollar we raise will decrease the cost to participants and make it easier for them to participate.
$8550 CAD  ($6,384 USD)  Accommodations for 12 at the YMCA for 7 nights      
$4200 CAD  Food and Incidental Costs, $50/day/person for 12 people for 7 days
$1250 CAD   Emergency Fund and Funding Campaign Fees
Total Expenses = $14,000 CAD
Canadian contributors giving $20 or more will receive an official charitable donation receipt for tax purposes through the Anglican Diocese of New Westminster.
 
Who are we & Why do we want to go?
 

""In the Old Testament there are so many examples of empowered women who challenge the standards of their society and advocate for change. As we establish these female role models, I encourage them to transfer this learning and make connections with modern day women. It is so important for young girls to be able to look and see themselves in different female leaders."" - Alicia Armstrong
 

""I am the chair of a committee to organise an event for our leadership class. I’m the only female in the group and it’s hard to be taken seriously and to be seen as a leader. I hope that in the future women will not be subjected sexism in schools and in their workplace."" - Clare Urquhart
""I am keen to be more involved in economic justice and the health and wellbeing and rights of women and children, The wide scope of the UNCSW will give me an opportunity to network and learn what is happening in other parts of the world. I’m looking forward to learning more about advocacy, how I can assist and how I can help motivate and encourage others to be active and involved."" - The Rev. Karen Urquhart
 

""I believe in an ever-loving God who is pure goodness and wants peace and love for all of His children, and I believe that Feminism is a movement which is important to that being lived out in the world. However, I am still struggling to fully understand what that entails for me, and how to tie those together into the way that I live my life and the career that I choose to pursue. I would like to attend the UNCSW61 because I would like to learn more about the inter-connectedness of my faith and my politics, and how to enact that in my life."" - Sierra Robertson-Roper
 

""We learn about economy in socials class but I have noticed the spotlight is always on the men. They did everything. I honestly believe it would be amazing if we could start getting more women in the spotlight."" - Aili Peterson McIntyre
 

""I am very excited about the possibility of being a part of this group with my daughter – to allow her to have the opportunity to begin to think about women’s role in economy, and in the work place. I worry that there is a complacency in younger women today. I worry that they are not investing in feminist discourse or women’s equality. I want to be a part of these conversations with her and to encourage her to think about women and their place as equal participants in the economic world."" - The Rev. Marnie Peterson
 

""What I care most about, what makes me passionate when it comes to feminism, women's rights, and gender equality, is the “traditional” women's roles and the devaluing of the people who do them regardless of gender.  The fact that those jobs are far more important than society seems to realize and that recognition of that fact is needed."" - Willow Martin Seedhouse
 

""My “social justice journey”, as I like to call it,  first started when I was twelve. At this age, I started to attend youth synod and have gone for four years since then. Throughout my four years at youth synod, I have learned about many social justice issues, from local to worldwide...I want to educate myself as much as possible about these issues so that I can do everything I can in my local community to help with them."" - Ceilidh Gibson
 

""The opportunity to go to the UN not only enables us to build solidarity and support networks with people from around the world, but to also build tools that we bring back to our home communities.  Religious communities play a particularly intimate role in the lives of women, and their lived experiences of both oppression and justice.  Participating in the Anglican delegation, committed to accountability and social justice, will shape these resources and tools to the needs of the church.  It also helps to build bridges between the church and the struggles of people in the church that sometimes go unrecognized as ‘church’ issues."" - Jessi Taylor
 

""It is my intention that, by participating in UNCSW61, I will be able to further educate myself, as well as equip myself with the tools to continue to effectively advocate for women’s economic struggles back at home. Across the globe, women must be advocated for, and the state of our rights must change. ""  - Sasha Soden
 

""I believe investing in women’s economic empowerment moves us towards gender equality, poverty eradication and inclusive economic growth...As a sustainable designer I am particularly interested in the designing of systems which could help woman’s economic empowerment in the workplace."" - Sarah Lloyd
 

""I want to attend the UN Conference on the Status of Women to learn. It would be an incredible opportunity to be able to dig deep into some of the issues facing women at home and abroad. I would like to be able to better understand how I can help advocate for and practice gender equality, as well as better understand issues particularly around culture and working women."" - Jacob Muir

Without a wheelchair, Mongezi is restricted to his home, and mostly his bed, unable to push himself around due to pressure sores on his elbows from years of use, and stomach cramps from his body’s position.Mongezi lives in Soweto, a notorious area of Johannesburg where transportation is a challenge for an able bodied person, let alone someone in a wheelchair.  So when he wants to do the things that we take for granted – say go shopping or get a job to support himself – he often struggles because taxis (which come in the form of vans and are the only means of transport in the area) will rarely stop – opting to take the three paying customers for the room that Mongezi in his chair would occupy in the van.What I haven’t told you yet is that Mongezi is a wiz at fixing computers, and thankfully with mobility in his upper body, he is able to continue using these skills to produce some income for himself. The problem is that he is very often taken advantage of – all too often, in the time it takes him to get himself into his wheelchair, his client has collected their computer and left without paying him for his services. Mongezi is supported by the generous aid and assistance of his community, in particular Aaron Langa and his wife Zandi, who out of the kindness of their hearts, help Mongezi with food and support his business.  Aaron has even offered to have Mongezi work out of their home so to help enforce payment.  In return for the Langa’s kindness, Mongezi ensures Aaron’s computer is running smoothly – which is key for the success of his business, ZASUN.  Apart from having a home of his own, Mongezi has big dreams for his community – he wishes to build a rehabilitation center which would provide aid and skill training, create jobs and opportunities for other people with disabilities. Mongezi and Aaron estimate that there are over 100 people living in their immediate community with disabilities and there are currently no resources to help and support them.Mongezi is very likely one of the strongest individuals I have ever met. I have begun to question whether, if I were in his position, I would have a fraction of his strength.  He has faced such adversity, in an unsupportive society, and yet he still greets you, and each and every day, with a warm, friendly and grateful smile.  The mission is to get Mongezi a new wheelchair – a simple thing, that any of us if we found ourselves in his position would likely take for granted, but for Mongezi Khambule means dignity, independence and the ability to support himself and give back to his community.  Please help us. With gratitude.  PS - I understand times are tough, and many of us are on tight budgets ourselves, so if you are unable to donate, please consider sharing this with your networks who may be able to.  Thanks!A summary of where the funds will go is as follows:Any and all funds raised above the fundraising goal will go towards the maintenance fund, insurance and/or an upgrade to a newer, more supportive chair. Mongezi's current wheelchair:The ""new"" (refurbished 2nd-hand) power chair that will be fitted with a custom support pad (right), and allow him to move around much easier:",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

children and heal from the trauma of war.</b><br/>
</p>
<p><b><u>Cause</u></b></p>
<p>The war in Syria – now in its 5th year – has unleashed the worst humanitarian crisis of our time, leaving millions of innocent citizens homeless and vulnerable.</p>
<p>According to the UNHCR, over 15,000 Syrian refugees have found refuge in Armenia since the start of the Syrian war in 2011. Silver lining -- due to Armenia’s urban infrastructure, Syrian refugees in Armenia are urban refugees and not living in tent cities.</p>
<div>
<b><u>Who We Are<br/><br/></u></b>
</div>
<div>#RootsForRefugees is a
nonprofit campaign initiated by the <a href=""http://www.armenianredwoodproject.org/#welcome2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Armenian Redwood Project</a><a href=""www.armenianredwoodproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>to provide subsidized rent to Syrian refugee

<p></p>#RootsForRefugees builds on best practices and is a continuation
of UNHCR’s rent subsidy program that started in 2014 in Armenia, which benefited
hundreds of families. Our partnership was launched in February 2015 in Yerevan
through the same operating partner UNHCR utilized: Mission Armenia NGO. <br/><br/>
<p><b><u>Impact</u></b></p>
<p>Our aim is to augment the absorptive capacity in Armenia to
benefit newly arriving refugees, and other vulnerable families who have taken
refuge in Armenia. The campaign will allow vulnerable refugees to have a safe
sanctuary to raise children.  It also provides a safe place to start the
long overdue healing from the traumas of war.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432854915/scta2dmwxyrb87hhep9b.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>We firmly believe that investments in rent subsidies for
children &amp; families is a sustainable approach in the long-run; even
though it will require continued charitable giving by private donors and its
International partners until these families make adjustments in their lives.

<p><b><u><br/></u></b></p>
<p><b><u>How it
Works</u></b>
</p>
<p>Your charitable donation (minus the
Indiegogo processing fees) will directly go into funding the rent of refugee
families.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For planning purposes we have calculated
that rent subsidies will cost $200 per month, per household on average. That is
about $6.6/day.<span>  </span></p>
<p>Subsidy rates will fluctuate, as
certain households will receive certain rent subsidies based on their immediate
family circumstances and according to intake criteria set up by our partner
Oxfam in the field.<span>  It is also important
to note that $220,000 was raised offline at the beginning of the year from a
combination of grants from Oxfam, Syrian Armenian Relief Fund and various small
family foundations. The #RootsForRefugees campaign goal of $30,000 will
complete the collective commitment of $250,000 made with our partners for
Syria’s refugees in Armenia in 2015. That said, donations raised in this online
campaign are being leveraged 1:7 (if we consider the $220,000 that were raised
already). This also means that the program is already operational and we’re 99
% sure it will happen in 2015!</span></p>

<b>Frequently Asked Questions</b>
</h4>
<p><b>Are you a non-profit?  Can I
write-off my contribution with my taxes?</b></p>
<p><span>Yes, ANMF Inc. [one of
the backers of <a href=""http://www.armenianredwoodproject.org/#welcome2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ArmenianRedwoodProject</a>] is registered as a public 501(c) (3)
nonprofit. Contributions to ANMF Inc. are tax-deductible to the extent
permitted by law. </span></p>
<p><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>If you are a US tax-payer looking to make a tax deductible donation of $75 or more and you are receiving a gift, this will constitute a quid pro quo contribution. </span>We have estimated that the value of each of our gifts will constitute 20% of the value of your donation. Per <a href=""http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Substantiating-Charitable-Contributions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IRS guidelines</a>, a charitable organization must provide a written disclosure to
 donors of a quid pro quo contribution in excess of $75 during its solicitation. A <em>quid pro quo contribution</em>
 is a payment made to a charity by a donor partly as a contribution and 
partly for goods or services provided to the donor by the charity.  <br/><i>
</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How can I get a tax deductible
receipt?</b><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>When you contribute,
you will receive an email from FirstGiving (Indiegogo’s nonprofit payments
processor) confirming your contribution.  This email receipt can be used
for tax deductible purposes. </span></p>
<p><b>How will the funds be used?</b></p>
<p><span>Our <i>approximate</i>
cost breakdown is as follows. Note: the costs below do not account for all
our staff costs as those have been already funded. The costs below are to the
best of our knowledge given our experience to-date.  Affordable housing subsidy economics are not always as simple as this chart makes it seem, but you get the idea.</span></p>

<b>Where are Syrian Refugees renting houses?<br/></b><br/>Unlike
 large refugee ""tent cities"" in other host countries, Yerevan the 
capital of Armenia has hosted the majority of Syria.  There are some 
refugees that are choosing to live in other cities in Armenia as well.  
The program does not put any constraints on the beneficiaries. And since
 most Syrian refugees in Armenia are choosing to live in urban settings,
 they are finding rental units that are suitable to their particular 
conditions (i.e. work, school, budget, household size and public 
transport).<b><br/></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433021635/lkr9e2sdptr8n9tmahw2.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><b>If major development organizations are already supporting you, why should
I help?</b> <br/><br/>To date,
we’ve been privileged to have the support of many generous individuals and
foundations. We have also partnered with Oxfam in Armenia and agreed to match
part of the cost of the rent subsidy program to Syrian refugees in
Armenia.<span> </span><b><span><br/><br/></span></b><b>
</b><p>Our offline
capital campaign in the last 6 months has allowed us to jump start the program
starting February 2015. To finish our commitment for the 2015 rent subsidy
program, we need to raise the last $30,000 from friends &amp; community
members. <br/></p>
<p><b>What happens when we surpass our goal of $30,000?</b><br/></p>
<p>Beyond the
$30,000 mark, all donations, regardless of the amount, will help further our
mission and allow us to reach more refugees. And because all gifts are matched
by our existing donors and partners, your support is leveraged for greater
impact. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>While we have a goal for the 2015 
program of $30,000, almost half of this year has already elapsed, and 
while we have already launched the program in early February 2015 (i.e 
families are already benefiting) we are thinking about 2016 which is 
approaching quickly. </p>
<p><span>In
 the case of a pleasant surprise, where our fundraising goal is 
stretched beyond the $50,000 mark, we will also consider allocating the 
extra funds to extend the program into the 2016 calendar year. </span></p>
<span>Please note that even
 if (somewhat miraculously) a meaningful political settlement and ceasefire inside Syria are 
achieved, Syrian refugees are likely to remain where they are for many 
years; the crisis therefore requires long-term planning on the part of 
refugee host governments in collaboration with global civil society and 
multinational institutions.</span><br/>

Join us in providing a safe sanctuary for Syrian refugees in Armenia to raise      their
children and heal from the trauma of war.

Cause
The war in Syria – now in its 5th year – has unleashed the worst humanitarian crisis of our time, leaving millions of innocent citizens homeless and vulnerable.
According to the UNHCR, over 15,000 Syrian refugees have found refuge in Armenia since the start of the Syrian war in 2011. Silver lining -- due to Armenia’s urban infrastructure, Syrian refugees in Armenia are urban refugees and not living in tent cities.

Who We Are

#RootsForRefugees is a
nonprofit campaign initiated by the Armenian Redwood Project to provide subsidized rent to Syrian refugee
households in Armenia.  The campaign has
partnered with Oxfam Armenia and the Syrian Armenian Relief Fund to augment
rent subsidy vouchers to Syrian Refugees in 2015.




#RootsForRefugees builds on best practices and is a continuation
of UNHCR’s rent subsidy program that started in 2014 in Armenia, which benefited
hundreds of families. Our partnership was launched in February 2015 in Yerevan
through the same operating partner UNHCR utilized: Mission Armenia NGO. 
Impact
Our aim is to augment the absorptive capacity in Armenia to
benefit newly arriving refugees, and other vulnerable families who have taken
refuge in Armenia. The campaign will allow vulnerable refugees to have a safe
sanctuary to raise children.  It also provides a safe place to start the
long overdue healing from the traumas of war.


We firmly believe that investments in rent subsidies for
children & families is a sustainable approach in the long-run; even
though it will require continued charitable giving by private donors and its
International partners until these families make adjustments in their lives.


How it
Works

Your charitable donation (minus the
Indiegogo processing fees) will directly go into funding the rent of refugee
families.


For planning purposes we have calculated
that rent subsidies will cost $200 per month, per household on average. That is
about $6.6/day.  
Subsidy rates will fluctuate, as
certain households will receive certain rent subsidies based on their immediate
family circumstances and according to intake criteria set up by our partner
Oxfam in the field.  It is also important
to note that $220,000 was raised offline at the beginning of the year from a
combination of grants from Oxfam, Syrian Armenian Relief Fund and various small
family foundations. The #RootsForRefugees campaign goal of $30,000 will
complete the collective commitment of $250,000 made with our partners for
Syria’s refugees in Armenia in 2015. That said, donations raised in this online
campaign are being leveraged 1:7 (if we consider the $220,000 that were raised
already). This also means that the program is already operational and we’re 99
% sure it will happen in 2015!






Frequently Asked Questions

Are you a non-profit?  Can I
write-off my contribution with my taxes?
Yes, ANMF Inc. [one of
the backers of ArmenianRedwoodProject] is registered as a public 501(c) (3)
nonprofit. Contributions to ANMF Inc. are tax-deductible to the extent
permitted by law. 


If you are a US tax-payer looking to make a tax deductible donation of $75 or more and you are receiving a gift, this will constitute a quid pro quo contribution. We have estimated that the value of each of our gifts will constitute 20% of the value of your donation. Per IRS guidelines, a charitable organization must provide a written disclosure to
 donors of a quid pro quo contribution in excess of $75 during its solicitation. A quid pro quo contribution
 is a payment made to a charity by a donor partly as a contribution and 
partly for goods or services provided to the donor by the charity.  


How can I get a tax deductible
receipt?
When you contribute,
you will receive an email from FirstGiving (Indiegogo’s nonprofit payments
processor) confirming your contribution.  This email receipt can be used
for tax deductible purposes. 
How will the funds be used?
Our approximate
cost breakdown is as follows. Note: the costs below do not account for all
our staff costs as those have been already funded. The costs below are to the
best of our knowledge given our experience to-date.  Affordable housing subsidy economics are not always as simple as this chart makes it seem, but you get the idea.



















Where are Syrian Refugees renting houses?Unlike
 large refugee ""tent cities"" in other host countries, Yerevan the 
capital of Armenia has hosted the majority of Syria.  There are some 
refugees that are choosing to live in other cities in Armenia as well.  
The program does not put any constraints on the beneficiaries. And since
 most Syrian refugees in Armenia are choosing to live in urban settings,
 they are finding rental units that are suitable to their particular 
conditions (i.e. work, school, budget, household size and public 
transport).
If major development organizations are already supporting you, why should
I help? To date,
we’ve been privileged to have the support of many generous individuals and
foundations. We have also partnered with Oxfam in Armenia and agreed to match
part of the cost of the rent subsidy program to Syrian refugees in
Armenia. 
Our offline
capital campaign in the last 6 months has allowed us to jump start the program
starting February 2015. To finish our commitment for the 2015 rent subsidy
program, we need to raise the last $30,000 from friends & community
members. 
What happens when we surpass our goal of $30,000?
Beyond the
$30,000 mark, all donations, regardless of the amount, will help further our
mission and allow us to reach more refugees. And because all gifts are matched
by our existing donors and partners, your support is leveraged for greater
impact. 

While we have a goal for the 2015 
program of $30,000, almost half of this year has already elapsed, and 
while we have already launched the program in early February 2015 (i.e 
families are already benefiting) we are thinking about 2016 which is 
approaching quickly. 
In
 the case of a pleasant surprise, where our fundraising goal is 
stretched beyond the $50,000 mark, we will also consider allocating the 
extra funds to extend the program into the 2016 calendar year. 
Please note that even
 if (somewhat miraculously) a meaningful political settlement and ceasefire inside Syria are 
achieved, Syrian refugees are likely to remain where they are for many 
years; the crisis therefore requires long-term planning on the part of 
refugee host governments in collaboration with global civil society and 
multinational institutions.


Can I donate from
outside the USA?
Absolutely! Indiegogo
only accepts international credit cards, not bank or debit cards. Unfortunately
we can’t accept PayPal, so the way to donate internationally is with a credit
card.
Can I send in a donation via check/Money order ?
Yes, you can mail your donation to the following :

</div></div>","Who We AreWe are Friends of Refugees, a certified 501(C)(3) non-profit located in Clarkston, Georgia. Since the 1990s, over 50,000 refugees from all over Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and South America have resettled here, hoping to make new lives for themselves and their families. In order to do our part, Friends of Refugees holds the Summer Spectacular, an eight-week long summer camp for the refugee children in our community. The camp is integral because, during the summer months, there is little to no child care. Our all-day camp creates a positive, enriching environment for Clarkston's refugee children to spend their summers.  Last year we had over 109 attend. This year we expect 140! We also take pride in paying our low income student volunteers (older students who have attended camp in previous years) a stipend. This is our way of demonstrating our respect for these young men and women while also showing the importance of a day's work. So, in order to continue and grow Summer Spectacular, we need your help.What We Do & How You Can HelpOur camp runs June 8th through July 31st. We have a variety of fun and educational activities planned for the kids. These activities, and the supplies we need, are broken down as follows:
Field TripsThis summer we plan on making multiple field trips. As of right now we have trips planned to Stone Mountain Park, the neighborhood pool, The Carter Center and a nearby bowling alley and roller rink. We also have a college visit planned for either Georgia Tech or the University of Georgia. These trips cost us the price of gas, snacks and park entry fees.

FoodWe are lucky enough to get 2 full meals a day for each children via a government program. However, we still have to pay out of pocket for all fresh fruit, snacks and drinks.

T shirtsEach year we have a new shirt printed for our students and volunteers. This year's shirt says ""Love holds us together."" Love is our character education theme for the entire Summer Spectacular. Not only is the theme a powerful one, but this encouraging shared apparel also empowers our campers, volunteers, and staff to be part of something bigger than themselves. We, at Friends of Refugees, hope that love shown through respect, honesty, thankfulness, humility, and service will have a ripple effect in the Clarkston community. We are ordering 200 shirts so, at $5 a shirt, they will cost us $1000.

StipendsWe make a point to pay our student volunteers a small stipend as a thank you for all their hard work. So far we have set aside $1000, however, we will immediately increase the stipend amount if we raise above our fundraising goal.
Soccer EquipmentWe're looking for some new soccer equipment that will last, particularly portable goals and new balls.  The world's game is alive in Clarkston as kids from different backgrounds find common ground on the pitch.

Activity StationsAll of our campers receive weekly character education in order to grow spiritually and socially into adults who responsibly contribute to their community, as God created them too do.  We want our kids to have role models and to be role models! In order to do this, we provide craft activities, music instruction, and ""Friday Funday"" breakout sessions.  Each Friday kids pick their favorite activity, whether it be gardening, soccer, basketball, music, etc, and get to enjoy an entire day of it!  We need supplies for all these activity stations.

Last year's peace deal between the Colombian government and FARC (the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) brought an end to a war that lasted over 50 years and claimed the lives of more than 200,000 people. Some 25,000 people have been disappeared, and 5.7 million displaced.
The peace deal is now looking distinctly fragile, and with new paramilitary groups flooding into the power vacuum left behind by FARC, violence against human rights defenders and other vulnerable groups has soared. Moreover, there is growing concern that the right wing ‘Democratic Center’ party - which led opposition to the peace deal - will win general elections in March 2018.
In this worrying context, a group of Colombian human rights organizations campaigning for justice in cases of forced disappearance and state crimes have invited Northern Irish groups to visit Colombia and go on a whistlestop three-city tour to help publicise their cause. Eamonn McCann, who has dedicated much of his life to the Bloody Sunday Justice Campaign, will accompany Kate Nash, whose brother William was killed on Bloody Sunday, and Shauna Moreland, whose mother Caroline was disappeared by the IRA, in a visit to the country in early 2018.
There they will attend a series of campaign events with members of MOVICE (the Movement for Victims of State Crimes), the Nydia Erika Foundation, the Mothers of Soacha and the Orlando Flas Bora Collective (spanish), to share experiences, raise public awareness, and help promote justice in Colombia’s delicate post-conflict situation.

Nestale su u trenu!Kada smo u siječnju 2018. ponudili 500 besplatnih slikovnica o djeci s istospolnim roditeljima ""Moja dugina obitelj""  javnosti, odaziv je premašio sva naša očekivanja! U času smo razdijelili cijelu zalihu slikovnica te istovremeno zaprimili više stotina novih upita za njenim primjerkom. Naša misija je omogućiti besplatnu slikovnicu ""Moja dugina obitelj"" baš svim zainteresiranim građanima i organizacijama te tako doprinijeti stvaranju društva u kojem se od malih nogu uči poštivati različitosti i prihvaćati sve obitelji. Pridružite nam se - pomognite nam osigurati sredstva potrebna za tisak 1000 novih primjeraka slikovnice na hrvatskom i engleskom jeziku, i to u još boljoj, ukoričenoj verziji! Prva slikovnica o djeci s istospolnim roditeljima u Hrvatskoj i regijiSvaka priča ima svoje heroje, naši se zovu Ana i Roko. Vole sve što i njihovi vršnjaci predškolske dobi – sport, igranje s prijateljima i druženje s roditeljima. Roku je omiljeno voće kruška, a Ani jagoda. I naravno da imaju svoje omiljeno godišnje doba. Ipak, po nečemu se malo razlikuju od svojih vršnjaka – Ana ima dvojicu tate, a Roko dvije mame. I znaju da se takve obitelji zovu dugine obitelji.Djelo autora/ice Ive Šegote i Maje Škvorc te ilustratora Borne Nikole Žeželja „Moja dugina obitelj” prva je slikovnica o djeci s istospolnim roditeljima u Hrvatskoj i regiji. Od naročite je koristi upravo djeci iz takvih obitelji jer u njoj mogu prepoznati sebe i svoj svakodnevni život. Uz to, ova slikovnica baš svakom roditelju može pomoći razgovarati sa svojim djetetom o duginim obiteljima i različitostima u društvu koje su dio naše realnosti. Slikovnica za baš svakog zainteresiranog pojedinca i organizacijuBrzina kojom je rezervirano prvih 500 primjeraka pokazala nam je da potreba za slikovnicom koja djecu uči o različitim vrstama obitelji postoji - ostvarimo, stoga, njen puni društveni potencijal!Prvu nakladu tiskali smo uz financijsku potporu Francuskog veleposlanstva u Zagrebu i članova naše udruge i podijelili je besplatno zainteresiranim građanima i organizacijama. Ovom kampanjom cilj nam je tiskati novih 1000 primjeraka slikovnice s tvrdim uvezom na hrvatskom i engleskom jeziku koje ćemo dostaviti svim trenutno predbilježenim građanima u Hrvatskoj i inozemstvu. Vjerujemo da ovom slikovnicom radimo pozitivan pomak u prihvaćanju različitosti u našem društvu, no ne zavaramo se da to možemo sami - potrebna nam je i vaša pomoć. Kako nam možete pomoći?Podupirući naš projekt pomažete u promicanju tolerancije te sudjelujete u širenju vrijedne i važne poruke – poštivanju i prihvaćanju svih obitelji.

</div></div>","Hello!
I'm Big Tim Stiles. I am the writer and self-publisher behind the comic book Gorilla my Dreams (along with my partner in crime, artist extraordinaire Ahmed Raafat) and this here is our latest creation JOSIE: SHARK RIDER FROM SPACE!

JOSIE: SHARK RIDER FROM SPACE is a character Ahmed and I created with a friend of mine, Josie. We decided we wanted to get her on a t-shirt as soon as possible. 
I was ready to release JOSIE: SHARK RIDER FROM SPACE as just another character in my stable of heroes when I started to see news turning up on my social medias about the rape and murder of a number of women on our streets.
I don't need the money that JOSIE: SHARK RIDER FROM SPACE t-shirts could bring in as much as people using the services of the Rape Crisis Centre.
So, these t-shirts and posters will be sold to raise funds for the Rape Crisis Centre.

The Rape Crisis Centre is a non-government, not for profit, feminist organisation working to eliminate sexual violence against women, young people, children, families and men.
They provide:* A 24 hour crisis call out service to police and forensic services every day of the year* A crisis and counselling telephone support service (7 days a week)* Counselling and group work to survivors of sexual assault and their families and supporters* Education, training and professional consultation to agencies and private practitioners
We need your help to raise money for the Rape Crisis Centre.

<h3><u><strong>THE BASICS:</strong></u></h3>
<p>2018 marks the Fifth Anniversary of Abundant Bodies (at the Allied Media Conference in Detroit, MI). This year, Abundant Bodies is once again holding a Network Gathering - a day filled with amazing sessions centered on the experiences of Indigenous, Black, People of Color, Dis/abled, Super-sized, Trans and Queer fat folks to build a more beautiful, body accepting and abundant loving future! </p>
<h3>
<b><u>WE NEED YOU, FATTIE WON KANOBI</u></b>:</h3>
<p>We need your help to fund our presenters, panelists and even host a large-scale event for all our Abundant Bodies attendees at AMC 2018. We need community support in order to make sure all our presenters and panelists can make it to Detroit for the Conference in June and provide some support additional lodging support. At our $1500 goal, we would be able to provide a small stipend for all involved AND host a large-scale event where presenters, panelists, and attendees will have a space safe for fellow beautiful, body accepting and abundant bodies.</p>
<p>Budget Breakdown:</p>
<p>Session honoraria: 6 sessions x $100 each = $600</p>
<p>Picnic/lunch session (food for all participants): $200</p>
<p>Travel support for participants: $400</p>
<p>Large-Scale (Secret, TBA) Event: $300</p>
<p>TOTAL PROJECTED: <strong>$1500.00</strong> </p>
<p>If some of our presenters do not require these funds, we will re-distribute them to participants who can't make it to the conference without more financial support. We will also prioritize workshop presenters and coordinators if we are unable to reach our fundraising goal and any additional funds will go towards fat community activities/track at next year’s AMC.</p> <h3><u><strong>ABOUT ABUNDANT BODIES:</strong></u></h3>
<p>The Abundant Bodies track gathers, shares and celebrates the wisdom and abundance of our bodies. Abundant / thick / fat bodies are the target of so much hate, policing and negativity, even in our organizing communities. How do we unlearn mainstream ideas of what a body should look like and (re)-learn to celebrate the diversity, resilience, wisdom and beauty of all bodies? How can we work together to deconstruct fat stigma and other forms of marginalization while building a stronger inclusive fat community? How can we challenge ourselves to decenter whiteness, capitalism, ableism, cissexism, heterosexism and classism while we explore what it means to be fat?</p>
<p>This track will explore these questions and create spaces to challenge the ongoing ways mainstream media shames and harms abundant bodies. Our goal in our organizing and activism is to create media and practical strategies for resistance, healing and community building. Through workshops, panels and skillshares we will transform mainstream ideas around abundant bodies and create resilient communities utilizing different forms of media such as zines, theater, oral histories, poetry, social media, dance, comics, and art. The topics that sessions will cover this summer include fat sex, afro fat futurism, uplifting fat POC narratives, and much more!</p>
<h3><u><strong>BRING ME THE PERKS:</strong></u></h3>
<p>We have a ton of cool perks to offer you in exchange for some dollar bills &amp; bitcoin. Take a peak at just a few below:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>THE BOTTOM LINE:</strong></u></h3>
<p>We're a bunch of radical fatties looking to change the world (and give others a chance at the mic too) so throw some spare change our way and we can make a difference together.</p>
<p>And hey - if you don't have a dollar to spare, we've been there. Just share our campaign on social media and don't forget to tag us <i>@abundantbodies</i>.</p>

Svaka država ima svoju verziju dešavanja koja se od države do države u potpunosti razlikuje. Ljudski odnosi su trajno narušeni a nacionalizam je ostao glavna ideologija svih državnih politika.Incijativa mladih za ljudska prava osnovana je 2003.godine sa ciljem uspostavljanja odnosa između mladih ljudi koji žive u zemljama bivše Jugoslavije. Kroz programe razmene koji su uključivali edukaciju o prošlosti baziranu na utvrđenim činjenicama i učenje o ljudskim pravima izgrađene su trajne veze među mladima u regionu a njihovo upoznavanje sa “drugim i drugačijim” je većini zauvek promenilo živote.Jedan od sastavnih delova u radu organizacije (Inicijative mladih za ljudska prava) čini aktivistička mreža mladih, koji svoju potrebu da budu aktivni građani izražavaju kroz najrazličitije aktivističke akcije. Svi aktivistički poduhvati, kako u zemlji tako i u regionu, bili su usmereni ka izgradnji društva u kome će svaki građanin osećati zadovoljno, bez obzira na poreklo, nacionalnost, religiju, seksualno opredeljenje.Aktivizmom smo tražili poštovanje prava nacionalnih manjina, ukazivali smo na potrebu da ljudi pamte ljude i njihove priča bez obzira njihovu nacionalnost, kritikovali smo sve političare koji nisu poštovali činjenice utvrđene o sukobima i koji su se služili ratnohuškačkom retorikom i govorom mržnje, tražili smo osudu politike koja je dovela a do ratova, pozivali smo na mir i bili smo solidarni sa drugim ugroženim pojedincima i grupama.Osmoro aktivista i aktivistkinja Inicijative mladih za ljudska prava osuđeno je na kazne od po 50.000,00 din jer su na javnom skupu u Domu kulture u Beški (17. januara 2017. godine) na kome je govorio osuđeni ratni zločinac, Veselin Šljivančanin, organizovanom od strane vladajuće stranke, duvali u pištaljke i izneli transparent sa natpisom “Ratni zločinci da zaćute da bi se progovorilo o žrtvama”. Ovaj čin aktivista je, presudom prekršajnog suda, okarakterisan kao drsko i bezobzirno ponašanje, pa tako i kao narušavanje javnog reda i mira.

 
Aktivisti i aktivistkinje Inicijative mladih nikada neće pristati na političku stvarnost u kojoj su mirovni aktivisti i branitelji ljudskih prava ućutkani, a ratni zločinci zaštićeni ili slavljeni od strane celokupnog državnog aparata – predsednika, Vlade, tužilaštva, sudova i lokalnih samouprava.U Beški smo, 2017. godine, pokušali da ukažemo na nedopustivu podršku koja se od strane vladajuće stranke pruža osuđenom ratnom zločincu Veselinu Šljivančaninu, koji je osuđen za pomaganje i podržavanje mučenja kao kršenja zakona i običaja ratovanja, te da je propustio da zaštiti zarobljenike od zlostavljanja 20. novembra 1991, godine, pre povlačenja vojnika JNA sa poljoprivrednog dobra Ovčara blizu Vukovara.Na tribinu u Beški došli smo sa jednim transparentom, nekoliko pištaljki i jednim fotoaparatom. Kada je došao red da se Veselin Šljivančanin obrati prisutnima, deo aktivista je dunuo u pištaljke a dve aktivistkinje su razvile transparent na kome je pisalo: Ratni zločinci da zaćute da bi se progovorilo o žrtvama. Tokom ove akcije naši aktivisti su fizički napadnuti i nasilno izbačeni iz sale, dvoje aktivista završilo je u Urgentnom centru sa povredama glave, ruke i noge a njihov automobil je bio uništen.Nekoliko dana nakon ove akcije na vrata kancelarije Inicijative došla je grupica pripadnika ekstremno desne organizacije “Alternativa”, tom prilikom su ulazna vrata kancelarije bila oblepljena uvredljivim nalepnicama i porukama.Više informacija o napadu na aktiviste Inicijative mladih za ljudska prava na tribini Srpske napredne stranke u Beški i svim događajima koji se posledično dešavaju, možete pronaći ovde.I danas nakon presude, koja je doneta u najkraćem mogućem roku, naša poruka ostaje ista, naša misija nepromenja a potreba da kreiramo društvo koje vrednuje mir za buduće generacije sve veća.Uprkos svemu nismo ostali nemi na predavanja ratnih zločinaca na Vojnoj akademiji, od momenta izricanja drugostepene presude Vojislavu Šešelju tražimo od skupštine da konstatuje prestanak mandata jer je njegov boravak u Skupštini postao nezakonit.

<p align=""center""><strong>CARTA DE INTENCIÓN</strong></p>
<p>El cuatro de marzo del 2016 escribí un email al periodista Pedro Salinas. Fue la primera vez que le escribía en mi vida. El día anterior había terminado de leer su libro <i>Mitad monjes, mitad soldados</i>, libro publicado el 2014 y escrito con la colaboración de la periodista Paola Ugaz. Al residir en Madrid, no había podido hacerme con el libro anteriormente. Esperé un tiempo hasta que Paola pudo mandarme un ejemplar. Apenas lo recibí, lo devoré en una tarde.</p>
<p>Al día siguiente escribí a Salinas el email titulado: “Obsesiones”. En ese email le confesaba que había leído el libro con intriga, con pasión, pero también con amargura. Estaba claro que esa publicación era el punto culminante de un proceso de varios años y no pocos sacrificios. También le comentaba lo que más me había emocionado de su obra: el compromiso por resolver una historia que llevaba años persiguiéndolo.</p>
<p>En varias ocasiones me he sentido igual. Paola Ugaz, además de periodista ha sido también productora de mis proyectos audiovisuales anteriores. Trabajó conmigo a lo largo de tres años en el proyecto que hicimos en Bagua. Todo lo ocurrido antes, durante y después del 5 de junio del 2009 en el hecho conocido como Baguazo se volvió parte de nuestra vida durante mucho tiempo. De ahí salieron dos películas: el documental <i>La Espera</i>, que llegó a ser vista por más de cien mil personas, y aún se sigue proyectando en auditorios y eventos especiales; y el cortometraje <i>Sólo te puedo mostrar el color</i>, corto que tuvo su estreno mundial en la Berlinale 2014. De Bagua a la alfombra roja de Berlín hubo mucho trabajo y no poco sufrimiento, Paola y mi equipo pueden dar fe de ello. Bagua, sus conflictos, sus enredos políticos, su complejidad social, y las interminables horas de viajes, todo eso fue mi vida durante años y aún hoy lo sigue siendo. Es un tema que nunca dejaré del todo.</p>
<p>Por ello entiendo bien lo que significa que un tema no lo abandone a uno. Eso lo volví a sentir leyendo <i>Mitad monjes, mitad soldados</i>. Lo sentí al leer cada capítulo, desde la introducción hasta el epílogo. Lo sentí al revisar las entrevistas y reportajes que surgieron a raíz del libro. Pero, a diferencia de lo ocurrido con Pedro Salinas, a mí Bagua no me ocurrió personalmente. No lo viví. No lo he sufrí en primera persona. Fue una investigación hecha con tiempo y distancia. En cambio, todo lo que concernía al Sodalicio, Pedro Salinas lo vivió y lo atestiguó de primera mano. De ahí la emoción: el compromiso con una historia que venía arrastrándose por años y que por fin salía a la luz, la sensación de peso terrible que por fin se liberaba en cada una de las personas cuyos testimonios están en el libro. Más que una historia, era una obsesión. Una obsesión por liberarse, y una necesidad de que los culpables sean señalados. Y creo que si hay algo que debemos rescatar siempre de la gente son sus obsesiones.</p>
<p>Leí el libro de tirón y en varias oportunidades me urgía las ganas de hacer algo, de hablar con alguien, de abrazar a alguien, de golpear a alguien. Por fin, escribí a Pedro Salinas y le expliqué que sentía la necesidad de dedicar mi energía y mi tiempo a hacer de este libro una película. Creo que es imprescindible que esta película se haga.

</div></div>","CARTA DE INTENCIÓN
El cuatro de marzo del 2016 escribí un email al periodista Pedro Salinas. Fue la primera vez que le escribía en mi vida. El día anterior había terminado de leer su libro Mitad monjes, mitad soldados, libro publicado el 2014 y escrito con la colaboración de la periodista Paola Ugaz. Al residir en Madrid, no había podido hacerme con el libro anteriormente. Esperé un tiempo hasta que Paola pudo mandarme un ejemplar. Apenas lo recibí, lo devoré en una tarde.
Al día siguiente escribí a Salinas el email titulado: “Obsesiones”. En ese email le confesaba que había leído el libro con intriga, con pasión, pero también con amargura. Estaba claro que esa publicación era el punto culminante de un proceso de varios años y no pocos sacrificios. También le comentaba lo que más me había emocionado de su obra: el compromiso por resolver una historia que llevaba años persiguiéndolo.
En varias ocasiones me he sentido igual. Paola Ugaz, además de periodista ha sido también productora de mis proyectos audiovisuales anteriores. Trabajó conmigo a lo largo de tres años en el proyecto que hicimos en Bagua. Todo lo ocurrido antes, durante y después del 5 de junio del 2009 en el hecho conocido como Baguazo se volvió parte de nuestra vida durante mucho tiempo. De ahí salieron dos películas: el documental La Espera, que llegó a ser vista por más de cien mil personas, y aún se sigue proyectando en auditorios y eventos especiales; y el cortometraje Sólo te puedo mostrar el color, corto que tuvo su estreno mundial en la Berlinale 2014. De Bagua a la alfombra roja de Berlín hubo mucho trabajo y no poco sufrimiento, Paola y mi equipo pueden dar fe de ello. Bagua, sus conflictos, sus enredos políticos, su complejidad social, y las interminables horas de viajes, todo eso fue mi vida durante años y aún hoy lo sigue siendo. Es un tema que nunca dejaré del todo.
Por ello entiendo bien lo que significa que un tema no lo abandone a uno. Eso lo volví a sentir leyendo Mitad monjes, mitad soldados. Lo sentí al leer cada capítulo, desde la introducción hasta el epílogo. Lo sentí al revisar las entrevistas y reportajes que surgieron a raíz del libro. Pero, a diferencia de lo ocurrido con Pedro Salinas, a mí Bagua no me ocurrió personalmente. No lo viví. No lo he sufrí en primera persona. Fue una investigación hecha con tiempo y distancia. En cambio, todo lo que concernía al Sodalicio, Pedro Salinas lo vivió y lo atestiguó de primera mano. De ahí la emoción: el compromiso con una historia que venía arrastrándose por años y que por fin salía a la luz, la sensación de peso terrible que por fin se liberaba en cada una de las personas cuyos testimonios están en el libro. Más que una historia, era una obsesión. Una obsesión por liberarse, y una necesidad de que los culpables sean señalados. Y creo que si hay algo que debemos rescatar siempre de la gente son sus obsesiones.
Leí el libro de tirón y en varias oportunidades me urgía las ganas de hacer algo, de hablar con alguien, de abrazar a alguien, de golpear a alguien. Por fin, escribí a Pedro Salinas y le expliqué que sentía la necesidad de dedicar mi energía y mi tiempo a hacer de este libro una película. Creo que es imprescindible que esta película se haga. Los cines peruanos deben mostrar la historia que el libro ha recogido. El público debe ir a ver esa película y debe comentarla, debe hablar de ella, debe discutirla, debe recordarla. Como los libros, las películas también quedan siempre en la memoria. Es una huella que dejamos en la historia. Pero libros y películas alcanzan fibras distintas. El libro existe, pero hace falta una obra audiovisual tratada con delicadeza que toque esas otras fibras.
Hay un motivo fundamental que me empuja a hacer esta película: la necesidad de hablar que manifiestan las personas en Mitad monjes, mitad soldados. La importancia del testimonio, de la voz.

<p>William Lopez spent more than 23 years wrongly imprisoned.

</div></div>","For many, the holiday season is a constant reminder of how fortunate we are to be with friends and family. But for others, it is simply another occasion they miss because they have been wrongfully convicted and imprisoned. As you celebrate your fortune with friends and family this season, help others earn the same right by donating to our campaign. The Jeffrey Deskovic Foundation for Justice is fundraising to fight for release of the wrongfully imprisoned, reform the criminal justice system and reintegrate those who have been exonerated. We need your help.WHAT WILL YOUR DONATION DO?Your donation is 100 percent tax deductible and will go straight into the operating budget for our 501(c)(3) charity. WHO IS JEFFREY DESKOVIC?Jeffrey Deskovic lost his freedom on January 18, 1991, when, as a seventeen year old, he was sentenced to fifteen years to life in prison for the brutal rape and murder of Angela Correa, his classmate at Peekskill High School. In fact, she was raped and murdered by a crack addict named Steven Cunningham. Police deceived Jeff and subjected him to nearly seven hours of uninterrupted interrogation without food, and without a lawyer or parent present. He falsely confessed after police threatened him and then promised that, if he confessed, he would not be arrested and could go home. He was only sixteen years old.Prosecutors and the medical examiner knew DNA in Angela did not match Jeff. Yet, they concocted evidence to frame him. Jeff spent the next sixteen years in several maximum-security prisons throughout New York State. Meanwhile, Cunningham remained free, and three years after he murdered Angela, he murdered his girlfriend’s sister, a Peekskill schoolteacher named Patricia Morrison. Cunningham’s DNA was deposited into the FBI’s Combined DNA Index System (CoDIS) and matched the DNA in Angela. On March 16, 2007, Cunningham pled guilty to Angela’s rape and murder. At sentencing, Angela’s mother said Jeff was ""blamed and sacrificed like a lamb,” and Patricia’s mother said had police not falsely accused Jeff, her daughter “would still be with us.” Had Cunningham gotten away with murder a second time, Jeff would still be in prison.Jeff’s rape and murder charges were dismissed on November 2, 2006. The judge who freed Jeff admitted “the undeniable fact that nothing can be done in this courtroom here today to erase the pain and suffering endured by you and your loved ones over the past sixteen years.” Jeff was marched into prison at age seventeen and walked out at age thirty-three. His entire adolescence and formative years had been stolen from him. To this day, none of the police, prosecutors or medical examiners who engineered Jeff’s conviction ever have been disciplined or suffered any career setbacks as a result of their misdeeds.After his release, Jeff earned a B.S. in Behavioral Science from Mercy College and his M.A. from John Jay College of Criminal Justice. In March 2012, he launched The Jeffrey Deskovic Foundation for Justice, and donated $1.5M from his compensation to get the Foundation off the ground.Jeff has appeared in local and national media, and spoken at forums across the country. He has spoken at countless academic institutions, nonprofit organizations and community groups, testified before state legislatures, and lobbied high-level elected officials, and made presentations at police academies, judicial conferences, defense bars, and gatherings of prosecutors. He advocates for video recording all police interrogations, changing witness identification procedures, the creation of standardized evidence preservation systems, automatic discovery, an oversight committee for prosecutors, and limits on the devil’s bargain prosecutors make with jailhouse snitches and criminals for testimony against targeted defendants. Jeff is strongly opposed to the death penalty, advocates for its repeal, and fights against its reinstatement, lest the innocent be put to death.THE FACES OF THOSE YOU WILL HELPThe Deskovic Foundation has worked tirelessly to help others who are in Jeff’s position. Here are a few of the men whose lives have been improved thanks to contributions to the Foundation.

While the devastation wrought by this earthquake was thankfully smaller than that of the 2010 earthquake, due to the epicenter location, the impact was felt by hundreds of thousands of people.<br/><br/>The August 14th earthquake had its epicenter near the city of Les Cayes, one of the largest cities in the country with a population of over 70,000 people. In addition, the earthquake affected those in the mountains above Les Cayes, including the hamlets of Duchity and Lakadonie, where I have spent considerable time.<br/><br/>Sadly, due to the inept and deteriorating building style and infrastructure, an earthquake has an outsized impact in a developing country like Haiti. The destruction includes homes and buildings, roads, power lines, and water and sewer pipes. And because of the current political instability and violence in Haiti, getting food, medical supplies, and resources to those in need has become almost impossible. People in these communities are trying to support one another, but they need additional help. This is where we come in.</p><p>My hope is to raise money to send DIRECTLY to people in need. The money will help people pay for food, medical supplies, clothing, and importantly, rebuilding their homes. These are people that I know personally, dozens of them. Many are dealing with the trauma of losing their homes and everything they have, including loved ones, while also having to deal with the challenges of continuing to survive without food, clean water, or shelter.<br/><br/>This campaign will be short because I want to get the money to them as quickly as possible. The campaign will open Thursday, August 26th and close at 11:59pm on Wednesday, September 1st. On that day I will send the money via Western Union to several Haitians in these communities, who will use it for food and water, clothing, and home rebuilding for themselves, their families, their neighbors, and their community.<br/><br/>Disaster relief is a complicated subject, and many have heard horror stories about money going to big organizations based in other countries where the money gets spent on staff and contractors, rather than going to the people in need. This campaign is different. I am not working with any charity or organization, the money will be sent directly to the people in need. These are community members and community leaders in the small hamlets, who will be able to spend the money directly helping themselves and those around them. They need support and many of us have financial support to give.<br/><br/>Thank you all very much! This is something that is very personal to me; and whether you give money or not, please keep the Haitian people in your thoughts (and prayers if you're religious) while they deal with this crisis.  If we can help the lives of some, then they can help the lives of others, and the cycle of support keeps spinning.</p><p>“I want to look happily forward.

We've put together the Hillary Claus Pop-up Holiday Booth, where New Yorkers can come, sit on Hil's lap, and share your wishes big and small. Sure, you could write her a letter and ask for the strength to continue to fight for a better, more inclusive 2018. Or, you could join us at the Union Square Holiday Market in December to get a selfie with a true symbol of giving.<br/><br/>Hillary Claus 2017 is pristine city streets after the first snow.

<li>For 2 days in December, Hillary Claus will pose for pictures (no photographer provided, bring those cell phones!) and listen to your holiday wish list for a suggested donation of $5. All proceeds from the Hillary Claus Holiday Pop-Up Booth will be donated to Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Hispanic Federation's UNIDOS Disaster Relief and Recovery Program for Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.</li>

If I'm going to cry on Hillary's knowing shoulder because only in her lap do I feel truly seen, I want that memory to feel more rich and considered than posing with short Batman in Times Square. And hey, while we're at it, let's go ahead and make it a paid gig for some people who are in the city around the holidays. We are still approaching sponsors and independent in-kind donations to help alleviate these line items.

We serve the thousands of Americans who are denied the presumption of innocence simply because they cannot afford their bail. We leverage community support to grant pretrial release so defendants don’t have to rely on predatory bail bonds.Affordable. Our bail financing is the most affordable option, with no hidden costs or fees. Community-Oriented. The more community support gathered, the more we contribute. Plus, all pledges are returned when the defendant appears in court.Fair. We work hard to ensure our technology is accessible and free of any harmful biases. Why support a bail startup?The bail system in the United States criminalizes poverty and unjustly separates defendants into two groups: those who can afford bail, and those who can't. Defendants who aren't able to pay their bail are often forced to make an impossible decision. They must either wait in jail for months, leaving their families and possibly losing their job in the process; or plead guilty to a crime for which they may be innocent. The problem is widespread. Of the over half a million people incarcerated in local jails nationwide, more than 75% are in jail awaiting trial. Many of these people are not dangerous but remain behind bars simply because they cannot afford bail. How does our platform work?

<p>Sarah:
""I grew up in Turkey and know the rough terrain the refugees are crossing, I know the cities they are arriving in. And I know that
Turkey is not equipped -on its own- to help all the people in need. My family is still living in Turkey and the stories of destitution and living conditions grip me.""</p>
<p>Berni:
""When I heard about what
was happening and saw the pictures I thought, 'That could be me and my family.
Those could be my children.' I know people in my country with Syrian backgrounds. It felt personal to me.""</p>
<p>We are
two moms who felt compelled, by the love of God, to do something to help the refugees in Turkey. We are not professional videographers, or advertisers, or graphic
designers but have seen crowdfunding accomplish a lot with a little so we made
our own campaign.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">(<a href=""http://www.worldvision.org/news-stories-videos/syria-war-refugee-crisis"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">More Facts

families living in camps in Turkey. </p>
<p>The group
Conscience International will be receiving our campaign funds. We have been in contact with them and they are very excited about this independent campaign. Volunteers will
then buy supplies and deliver them to refugees.</p>
<p>Specifically, the funds will
purchase: sanitary pads, diapers, blankets, and socks.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Breakdown

we want the funds to go exclusively to refugees we chose to give out

Summary
We are
Berni and Sarah. 
Sarah:
""I grew up in Turkey and know the rough terrain the refugees are crossing, I know the cities they are arriving in. And I know that
Turkey is not equipped -on its own- to help all the people in need. My family is still living in Turkey and the stories of destitution and living conditions grip me.""
Berni:
""When I heard about what
was happening and saw the pictures I thought, 'That could be me and my family.
Those could be my children.' I know people in my country with Syrian backgrounds. It felt personal to me.""
We are
two moms who felt compelled, by the love of God, to do something to help the refugees in Turkey. We are not professional videographers, or advertisers, or graphic
designers but have seen crowdfunding accomplish a lot with a little so we made
our own campaign.(More Facts
about the Syrian Refugee Crisis)
What We
Need & What You Get
Moms For
Moms is a campaign to raise at least $3,000 to purchase supplies for refugee
families living in camps in Turkey. 
The group
Conscience International will be receiving our campaign funds. We have been in contact with them and they are very excited about this independent campaign. Volunteers will
then buy supplies and deliver them to refugees.
Specifically, the funds will
purchase: sanitary pads, diapers, blankets, and socks.Breakdown
of costs:

One box
of pads = $8*


One box of diapers = $15*


One wool (blend) blanket = $8*


One pair of socks = $1*


*These are the prices per item when bought in bulk. The number of
diapers/pads in the box will vary slightly based on the final brand we end up
buying & based on best prices at the time of purchase.
Perks
Your donations are TAX DEDUCTIBLE! Funds that we raise will be sent directly to a non-profit. Read more here: https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles...?AND...Because
we want the funds to go exclusively to refugees we chose to give out
simple perks. We are running a Flexible Funding Campaign. This means that we receive
donations even if we don't reach our goal of $3,000.
We've
decided to give out perks a little differently. We will be
""unlocking"" perks as we reach certain milestone amounts. Once
'unlocked' any partner in the campaign will be able to get the
new perk.
As perks
we have created PRINTABLES of quotes from the Bible verse in Matthew
25:35-36 where Jesus is speaking and says, “ For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was
thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger
and you welcomed me, I was
naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and
you came to me.’ Then the righteous will answer him, saying,
‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see
you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see
you sick or in prison and visit you?’And the King will
answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one
of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’""You will have personal use rights. So feel free to make the deign into a t-shirt, bag, postcard, or canvas using your favorite online tools for personal use***. Or use it as a computer or phone background. SPREAD THE WORD!We understand that not all of the campaign backers will be of the Christian faith. We are thankful for all donations because the goal here is to help all refugees, no matter what faith they adhere to. We thank you that you decided to join us in doing that. We really appreciate your support. 
The Impact
Your
project will provide dignity, sanitation, and warmth to refugees who are currently
living in very primitive squatter refugee camps.



Blankets can be used as a mat, a coat,
a bag...so many possibilities.


Socks can also be used as gloves.


Sanitary pads allow women to continue
to work and care for their families (read any literature on this - the impact
is huge)


Diapers make a great difference
in sanitation. Those of you who have children or babysit children know how often, especially
newborns, need to be changed. Then imagine not having diapers. Enough said.


You will
also be impacting the Turkish economy. They are bearing a huge burden with the
influx of people. Your donation will provide a boost to locals because we will
be buying local goods.
Risks
& Challenges
-  One challenge will be informing
you about what percentages of funds will go to each item we want to purchase
(how many blankets/diapers/socks…will you be buying). The reason for this is
that numbers in refugee camps fluctuate. We will know exact numbers once the
funds are raised. Compassion International workers will, in real time, assess
needs based on ages/genders/numbers in the camps and supplies will be purchased
accordingly.
-  Why disposable diapers & pads
instead of cloth/alternatives: In doing research we have found that cloth
diapers are hard to wash and are not as helpful as disposable diapers.
Water is not always available and when it is it is not usually appropriate to
be washing waste in the same place you are getting your drinking water.
Other
Ways You Can Help
Everyone
can help: You can get the word out and make some noise about our
campaign. 
-  SHARE our campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or your
Blog!
-  Tell people at your workplace. 
-  Call your local radio station.
-  Put up a flier.
-  Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools!

<h3><u><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></u></h3>
<p>My name is Cheryl, and up until recently I grew vegetables for a living on a small farm outside of Boston. On a long day out in the field a few seasons ago the crew and I started rattling off vegetable celebrity puns. From Broccoli Obama to Rutabaga Ginsburg to George Squashington, we've been on a continuous crusade to turn all kinds of celebrities into vegetables.

BACKGROUND
My name is Cheryl, and up until recently I grew vegetables for a living on a small farm outside of Boston. On a long day out in the field a few seasons ago the crew and I started rattling off vegetable celebrity puns. From Broccoli Obama to Rutabaga Ginsburg to George Squashington, we've been on a continuous crusade to turn all kinds of celebrities into vegetables. These characters initially made small appearances in our weekly news zine and gradually blossomed into a complete art show at our local ice cream shop.  Now, they're going portable in an effort to spread a bit of humor while honoring and supporting those who work towards a more just democracy.

Obtaining refugee status is very difficult in Bulgaria, and the majority of people are turned down. Asylum seekers from some areas of the world stand little chance, regardless of what their stories tell: for example, in five years, none of the refugee claimants from countries like Rwanda, Tanzania, Pakistan, Nigeria or Mali have received refugee status in Bulgaria.  Others with very little likelihood of obtaining status are people from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Armenia, Lebanon and Morocco, among many other countries in Africa and the Middle East. </p>

First of all—how inspired and joyful we feel about the Women's March messages and all the feels we felt, second—how many badass females we know, and third—how we feel we need to band together and stand up for things that are right, like gender equality.</p>
<p>We contacted artists with feminist and female-empowering products to see if they'd like to collaborate, and the answer was a resounding ""F*CK YES!"" And so the Feminist AF Box Campaign was born.</p>
<p>This campaign’s mission is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support artists and small businesses</li>
<li>Donate money to nonprofits with feminist agendas (organizations will be nominated and chosen by artists and backers)</li>
<li>Join together and do something good as supporters of gender equality </li>
</ul>
<p>But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's make sure we're on the same page...</p>

<li>We will also send out a survey asking for artist and backer opinions on what organizations to donate to. </li>
<li>Then Smartass &amp; Sass and everyone involved with the campaign will send those organizations bags of money and virtual hugs for doing such wonderful things! Meanwhile...</li>

<li>Our campaign has <strong>flexible funding</strong>. That means that whether we surpass our goal by 8 trillion percent or only raise $100, THIS IS HAPPENING! All backers will receive rewards and we will donate to nonprofits whether we hit our goal or not. IT. IS. ON.</li>
<li>We already have <strong>OVER 30 amazing artists</strong> collaborating on the campaign, and more are joining every day. Hot damn!! (More info about artists is listed down below.)</li>
<li>
<strong>All products will be related to feminism and female empowerment</strong>: we will be purchasing wholesale products from artists that fall under this wide umbrella. It's all about empowering messages and a whole lot of strong-lady vibes.</li>
<li>Depending on where this thing goes (and we're hoping it gets big!), boxes won't have the exact same stuff—we don't expect artists to produce 8 trillion Feminist AF tote bags if we get 8 trillion badass backers! You are guaranteed a certain dollar value for your box and we will work with all of the artists to determine quantities of product that can be provided in the given timeframe. <strong>TL;DR your box contents are a surprise!</strong>
</li>
<li>Backers and artists will help decide which organization we should allocate funds to and how much. <strong>Everyone will have a say in where donations are allocated, and we'll be able to support more organizations and include smaller ones.</strong>

<p><b>Will I know what products I'm getting?</b><br/>You won't—it's a surprise! What we will do is guarantee the value of your box. For example, if you choose a $50 reward level, you will receive $50 worth of awesome products. We will also make sure that each box has a good variety of types of items.</p>
<p><strong>Can I buy multiple boxes? Will I get duplicate products?</strong><br/>You are amazing! If you buy multiple boxes we will ensure that you get different items. So whether you're gifting one or keeping it all, you'll get an awesome array of feminist shiz.</p>
<p><strong>When will products ship?</strong><br/>Based on our schedule, products will ship in June of 2017. Check out the timeline above for more specifics.</p>
<p><strong>Is shipping included?</strong><br/>In order to provide the maximum donation to feminist nonprofits, we have not included shipping fees in your backer price. Your shipping will be based on your location using pre-determined USPS charges.</p>
<p><strong>Do you ship internationally?</strong><br/>We do! Shipping rates vary by region, and you'll be able to see your specific shipping fee during checkout.</p>
<p><strong>How/When will we decide what feminist nonprofits receive our donations?</strong><br/>Within two weeks after the campaign ends, we will be sending out a survey with feminist nonprofits which are nominated by artists. All backers will get to vote for the nonprofit of their choice, and Smartass &amp; Sass will split donations according to the percentage of votes. For example, if ten organizations get equal votes, each nonprofit will receive 10% of the funds raised.</p>
<p><strong>What if the campaign doesn't reach its goal?</strong><br/>This is a flex campaign, so that means that whether we hit our goal or not we WILL be sending out rewards to participating backers and making donations. Not hitting our goal would be a bit of a bummer because we are really motivated to surpass that target, but we are even MORE motivated to make donations to organizations that matter.</p>

<p>We don't foresee many unplanned challenges for this campaign.</p>

<p>We are in regular contact with the awesome artists who have chosen to collaborate on this project, and we have discussed production times and quantities with them prior to the campaign launch. We hope to continue adding artists as the campaign grows.</p>
<p>We have accounted for all possible fees—we ran a previous Indiegogo campaign, and we package and ship boxes for our gift and subscription service on a regular basis. </p>
<p>Our biggest ""concern"" is that this campaign will blow up and will receive a ton of interest—talk about a great problem to have! Obviously, we'd love for that to happen :) We have created some contingency plans should we need more space and help when packaging rewards for shipment.</p>

</div></div>","Recently, we (the two lady bosses over at Smartass & Sass) were talking about a few things. First of all—how inspired and joyful we feel about the Women's March messages and all the feels we felt, second—how many badass females we know, and third—how we feel we need to band together and stand up for things that are right, like gender equality.
We contacted artists with feminist and female-empowering products to see if they'd like to collaborate, and the answer was a resounding ""F*CK YES!"" And so the Feminist AF Box Campaign was born.
This campaign’s mission is to:

Support artists and small businesses
Donate money to nonprofits with feminist agendas (organizations will be nominated and chosen by artists and backers)
Join together and do something good as supporters of gender equality 

But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's make sure we're on the same page...

From Feminist Goddess Supreme (and UN Women Goodwill Ambassador) Emma Watson: ""For the record, feminism by definition is: 'The belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of the political, economic and social equality of the sexes.'""

 


 

You, your friends, your grandma, your barista—anyone who wants to support the cause and get cool shit—choose a reward level and back the campaign.
When the campaign ends, Smartass & Sass will purchase badass female-empowering products at wholesale pricing from all of the artists involved.
We will also send out a survey asking for artist and backer opinions on what organizations to donate to. 
Then Smartass & Sass and everyone involved with the campaign will send those organizations bags of money and virtual hugs for doing such wonderful things! Meanwhile...
Artists will produce all of the products and send them to us.
Smartass & Sass will package everyone's rewards, toss in some extra goodies, and ship them off to you, your friends, your grandma, and your barista.


 


Our campaign has flexible funding. That means that whether we surpass our goal by 8 trillion percent or only raise $100, THIS IS HAPPENING! All backers will receive rewards and we will donate to nonprofits whether we hit our goal or not. IT. IS. ON.
We already have OVER 30 amazing artists collaborating on the campaign, and more are joining every day. Hot damn!! (More info about artists is listed down below.)

All products will be related to feminism and female empowerment: we will be purchasing wholesale products from artists that fall under this wide umbrella. It's all about empowering messages and a whole lot of strong-lady vibes.
Depending on where this thing goes (and we're hoping it gets big!), boxes won't have the exact same stuff—we don't expect artists to produce 8 trillion Feminist AF tote bags if we get 8 trillion badass backers! You are guaranteed a certain dollar value for your box and we will work with all of the artists to determine quantities of product that can be provided in the given timeframe. TL;DR your box contents are a surprise!

Backers and artists will help decide which organization we should allocate funds to and how much. Everyone will have a say in where donations are allocated, and we'll be able to support more organizations and include smaller ones.

Below is a breakdown of where your dollars go. We have minimized fees to the bare minimum to ensure the biggest chunk of change possible to the chosen nonprofits:


 








After talking to artists, planning around life events, and leaving some wiggle room for any potential complications, we've outlined the following schedule:

Mid-February - March : The campaign is live!
April : We collect any sizing details and other info, along with donation votes.
April - May : Artists work hard to get all the goods made!
June: Products are sent to Smartass & Sass.
Mid-June : We package your goods and send 'em off into the sunset!

 

 

Check out some of the potential products that will be included in the Feminist AF Boxes and the lists of participating artists below! We'll continue to update the images and lists as more artists join.

<p>On December 16, 2012, a middle class
girl, Nirbhaya, along with her male friend was returning home after watching <i>The
Life of Pi</i>. They were tricked into boarding a bus that seemed to be going
their way and that had offered them a ride.</p>
<p>Nirbhaya, was gang-raped with extreme
brutality, and the man was severely beaten as he tried to protect her. It was a
closed bus with tinted windows in which five determined rapists were waiting
for their prey, with their impatience heightened; it is alleged, by the drugs
they had taken.</p>
<p>The battered bodies of the abused pair were
dropped off on a lonely street, and there were reports of people just passing
by, without offering any help or assistance to the abused bodies of the poor
victims. By the time Nirbhaya received medical attention, she was on her way to
death from the injuries, despite specialized medical care in Delhi, and later
on in Singapore.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/808687/files/20140824103549-Delhi-Police-Allows-Rape.jpg?1408901749"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>What if
Nirbhaya had the choice of getting the assistance that would have uprooted the

</div></div>","Here are the facts :
There are more than 600 million women who call India their home. 

A home where in every 22 minutes, one woman gets raped.
With More than 21,000 registered rape cases last year only one fourth of those accused were legally convicted.

Out of these 83% of the cases are still pending
in courts.

Even if these 83% of the cases see the light
of the court, 97% of the rapists will never spend a day in jail.

There was a 300% rise in crime against women in Delhi alone, in the last 12 months.


These facts barely scratch the surface of the brutal and shameful reality hidden beneath the political
veil of the Indian society. With the varying constitutional structure of
legislative distribution throughout the country, there is no symmetric and
systematic system in place for protecting such crimes; neither is there any
relevant step being taken against such crimes and helping the women who have
actually been victims to such horrors! 

In order for us to answer this question, we
would request you to see what these girls have to say about them feeling safe in New Delhi, India.
Courtesy: bluegape.comThe Delhi Gang-rape Case of 2012:
On December 16, 2012, a middle class
girl, Nirbhaya, along with her male friend was returning home after watching The
Life of Pi. They were tricked into boarding a bus that seemed to be going
their way and that had offered them a ride.
Nirbhaya, was gang-raped with extreme
brutality, and the man was severely beaten as he tried to protect her. It was a
closed bus with tinted windows in which five determined rapists were waiting
for their prey, with their impatience heightened; it is alleged, by the drugs
they had taken.
The battered bodies of the abused pair were
dropped off on a lonely street, and there were reports of people just passing
by, without offering any help or assistance to the abused bodies of the poor
victims. By the time Nirbhaya received medical attention, she was on her way to
death from the injuries, despite specialized medical care in Delhi, and later
on in Singapore.What if
Nirbhaya had the choice of getting the assistance that would have uprooted the
need for her to look for a less secure, unsubstantiated mode of transport? What
if there was a helpline number that she could call, that specialized in
assisting women with registered and verified cab services?LiBERATi is founded to be an active participant in the act of protecting women when they are in distress, we want to be the number that they can call and trust 24x7 for any desired need. We want to be an Institution solely established for purpose of assisting them. We want to Empower the Indian woman!We have set
up an organization that literally diminishes the chances of any Indian women
having to face such brutality. By previously conducted surveys and focus groups
by social service organizations and campaign runners, most of the crimes
committed towards women are in isolated areas, at odd hours and most likely when
these women are alone. Statistics tell us, there is a 76% chance that a woman could
be harassed or molested by a person closest to her.
That’s exactly why we need The LiBERATi. That’s exactly why we need to do what needs to be done. And
that’s exactly why with your support, we are sure that we can make a difference.

<p>My name is Laura Jennings.  I am a mother of three and wife to Jon who will be traveling to Haiti in November on mission to help rescue, restore and renew homeless families and orphans in Haiti.  Did you know that some of the most vulnerable children in Haiti are orphans without shelter because they are easily targeted by human traffickers?  As a mom, this makes my heart heavy for those precious ones.  Since I am not in a season of life where I can travel to Haiti with Jon to make an impact, I knew I had to do SOMETHING to help...even if it is just from my computer.  That is when I learned that it costs a mere $6000 to build a home for a family in Haiti and I felt compelled to begin this campaign!  If each of us sacrifices a little something, we can make a huge impact for one family in Haiti!<br/></p>
<p><strong>SO, I am asking each of you to consider sacrificing one of the luxuries that we get to enjoy as Americans (such as $25 at Starbucks, $50 for a pedicure, $100 for a fine meal, or $200 for a designer outfit) and make the CHOICE to fore go that luxury this month in order to support this worthy cause.  A little bit of sacrifice by several can mean a new home/shelter/protection for orphans in Haiti</strong>! <br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

</div></div>","Our Story
My name is Laura Jennings.  I am a mother of three and wife to Jon who will be traveling to Haiti in November on mission to help rescue, restore and renew homeless families and orphans in Haiti.  Did you know that some of the most vulnerable children in Haiti are orphans without shelter because they are easily targeted by human traffickers?  As a mom, this makes my heart heavy for those precious ones.  Since I am not in a season of life where I can travel to Haiti with Jon to make an impact, I knew I had to do SOMETHING to help...even if it is just from my computer.  That is when I learned that it costs a mere $6000 to build a home for a family in Haiti and I felt compelled to begin this campaign!  If each of us sacrifices a little something, we can make a huge impact for one family in Haiti!
SO, I am asking each of you to consider sacrificing one of the luxuries that we get to enjoy as Americans (such as $25 at Starbucks, $50 for a pedicure, $100 for a fine meal, or $200 for a designer outfit) and make the CHOICE to fore go that luxury this month in order to support this worthy cause.  A little bit of sacrifice by several can mean a new home/shelter/protection for orphans in Haiti! 
The Impact

Why homes, you ask? Simple.  The people of Haiti are desperate for homes as thousands live in tents or makeshift shelters. Every time we build a home we: 
1.Provide jobs as Haitians do the work to build the homes.2.Prevent human-trafficking:  the most vulnerable orphans are the main target of traffickers. They are alone, abandoned and desperate. A child now has a place to call home and a community to watch over and protect them.3.Build healthy families.4.Restoring their Hope: When we give the key to a home, you can see the tears well-up in the eyes of these families. Most families assumed they would never have access to a home again. I love seeing these families move their belongings from a tent to a home. It's beautiful, it's redemptive, it's justice.

<p>With this situation at hand, it's nearly impossible for many families to meet their nutritional needs, especially the young children, who need the nutrition the most for proper growth and development.</p>

<p>On 1st October, the Catalonian people will be deciding on their constitutional future. <br/>As part of this process, the Catalonian Government have invited international observers to come and monitor the vote to ensure it is a fair &amp; well-run referendum, and make reccomendations for future elections as to how democracy can be safeguarded, procedures improved &amp; elections run more efficiently.<br/><br/><strong>Who are English Scots for YES?</strong><br/><br/>We are one of the national campaign groups set up during the 2014 Scottish independence referendum.  We campaigned for an indepenent Scotland during that campaign, and folowing the result, we have worked to persuade our community of fellow English-Scots of the benefits of independence.  </p>
<p>During that campaign, we gathered a large membership of experienced political activists, including a number of serving &amp; retired politicians. Our activists participated in interviews &amp; debates acrosss Scotland and worked with national and international media before the referendum day, and then attened polling places, monitored the voting itself, and attended ballot-authentications &amp; counting across the country.<br/><br/><strong>So are you for or against Catalonian indpendence?</strong><br/><br/><strong>NEITHER</strong>.  We are very strictly neutral in this matter.  We support the right of the Catalonian people to have their referendum - and we condemn the Spanish government for their undemocratic actions in the last few days, which are uterly unacceptable...<br/><strong>BUT</strong>...<br/>Catalonian independence is a matter for the people of Catalonia, and ONLY them. <br/>If we are funded to travel to Catalonia to monitor their referendum, we will be strictly neutral third-party observers, working only to monitor the vote to ensure fairness, and provide advice afterwards on how procedures can be improved in any future votes or elections.<br/><br/><strong>What will you be doing</strong><br/> </p>
<p>We propose to take a small team of our activists (4-5) from Scotland to Barcelona on the 29th or 30th September until the 2nd October; we shall travel around Catalonia on the day of the vote, visiting polling places, interviewing campaigners/activists from both sides of the referendum to get their perspective on any issues or problems, and interacting with polling staff to observe whether there are any issues of conern, and monitor the entire process.<br/>If time is permitting, we shall also take meetings with the ""Yes"" and ""No"" campaigns to get their input as well.<br/><br/>Our team will consist of several experienced politicians and activists, including hopefully at least one retired MSP.</p>
<p><br/>Immediately after the vote has concluded, we shall issue a preliminary statement with our thoughts regarding how the vote was handled, any issues that we immediately wish to raise etc.<br/><br/>In the following days, we shall produce a report into the referendum, with any concerns we may have and recommendations for the future.<br/><br/><strong>What do you need?</strong><br/><br/>Money :)<br/>Due to the cost of putting on an Observer Delegation, and given the short time period in which to book flights, hotels etc., we need funds to help run an effective Mission.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, we need approx. £250-300 per delegate for flights &amp; hotels; another ~£200 for car-rental to move the team around and ~£200-300 to purchase ""burner"" mobile phones which can be activated on Spanish phone networks for using to document the entire mission;<br/>Our team will upload regular edited &amp; where legally permissable, live-video to social networks to ensure that not only is democracy done, but that it is seen to be done! Due to the slight but feasible risk to personal devices if any form of disturbance breaks out, it would be preferable to purchase cheap devices specifically for the mission, rather than take personal mobiles, tablets etc. to Catalonia.<br/><br/>Our team will be inputting their own funds as well, and no money will be spent on food or drink (which is to say, this is NOT a wee holiday to Barcelona! We will be working or sleeping the entire 2-3 days.)<br/><br/><strong>Isn't this just a wee jolly for you guys to go to Barcelona? Why should I help?</strong><br/><br/><strong>NO</strong>, it's not.<br/>See above answer - we shall be working almost the entire time from the moment the plane touches down to when we leave 2-3 days later. Monitoring an election is serious, dificult work. <br/>We are asking for funding to help ensure we can do a proper, decent job. During the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum, we were very grateful for the international observers which visited Scotland from across the world, including those from Catalonia.<br/>We think it only right we repay the sentiment by assisting Catalonia in the running of a fair, free &amp; equitible vote.  Self-determination is a sacred right, held by all peoples under the UN Charter Article One, Section Two.  However, democracy does just ""happen"" - it must be nurtered and safeguarded, monitored and protected by Missions such as this.<br/>Your help will enable us to help the People of Catalonia determine for themselves their own future, free of any intereference.<br/><br/><strong>So what happens if this vote doesn't go ahead, or you can't go?</strong><br/><br/>As you may be aware, elements of the Spanish government have sought to stop this referendum going ahead.  As stated above, our belief in the right to self-determination is absolute, and we believe that ruling regime in Madrid will eventually see this as well. But, if this does not happen, and the Spanish paramilitary ""Guardia Civil"" do in fact shut own the vote and arrest all those involved, we will not be able to monitor a vote!<br/><br/>If this happens, any funding we raise here will be used to fund ""English Scots for YES"" activities in Scotland, aimed at pursuing a second referendum for the people of Scotland.<br/>If you are not comfortable with your funding being used for such purposes, please state so in your donation comments; we will endeavour to return such donations to you.</p>

Our activists participated in interviews & debates acrosss Scotland and worked with national and international media before the referendum day, and then attened polling places, monitored the voting itself, and attended ballot-authentications & counting across the country.So are you for or against Catalonian indpendence?NEITHER.  We are very strictly neutral in this matter.  We support the right of the Catalonian people to have their referendum - and we condemn the Spanish government for their undemocratic actions in the last few days, which are uterly unacceptable...BUT...Catalonian independence is a matter for the people of Catalonia, and ONLY them. If we are funded to travel to Catalonia to monitor their referendum, we will be strictly neutral third-party observers, working only to monitor the vote to ensure fairness, and provide advice afterwards on how procedures can be improved in any future votes or elections.What will you be doing 
We propose to take a small team of our activists (4-5) from Scotland to Barcelona on the 29th or 30th September until the 2nd October; we shall travel around Catalonia on the day of the vote, visiting polling places, interviewing campaigners/activists from both sides of the referendum to get their perspective on any issues or problems, and interacting with polling staff to observe whether there are any issues of conern, and monitor the entire process.If time is permitting, we shall also take meetings with the ""Yes"" and ""No"" campaigns to get their input as well.Our team will consist of several experienced politicians and activists, including hopefully at least one retired MSP.
Immediately after the vote has concluded, we shall issue a preliminary statement with our thoughts regarding how the vote was handled, any issues that we immediately wish to raise etc.In the following days, we shall produce a report into the referendum, with any concerns we may have and recommendations for the future.What do you need?Money :)Due to the cost of putting on an Observer Delegation, and given the short time period in which to book flights, hotels etc., we need funds to help run an effective Mission.Broadly speaking, we need approx. £250-300 per delegate for flights & hotels; another ~£200 for car-rental to move the team around and ~£200-300 to purchase ""burner"" mobile phones which can be activated on Spanish phone networks for using to document the entire mission;Our team will upload regular edited & where legally permissable, live-video to social networks to ensure that not only is democracy done, but that it is seen to be done! Due to the slight but feasible risk to personal devices if any form of disturbance breaks out, it would be preferable to purchase cheap devices specifically for the mission, rather than take personal mobiles, tablets etc. to Catalonia.Our team will be inputting their own funds as well, and no money will be spent on food or drink (which is to say, this is NOT a wee holiday to Barcelona! We will be working or sleeping the entire 2-3 days.)Isn't this just a wee jolly for you guys to go to Barcelona? Why should I help?NO, it's not.See above answer - we shall be working almost the entire time from the moment the plane touches down to when we leave 2-3 days later. Monitoring an election is serious, dificult work. We are asking for funding to help ensure we can do a proper, decent job. During the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum, we were very grateful for the international observers which visited Scotland from across the world, including those from Catalonia.We think it only right we repay the sentiment by assisting Catalonia in the running of a fair, free & equitible vote.  Self-determination is a sacred right, held by all peoples under the UN Charter Article One, Section Two.  However, democracy does just ""happen"" - it must be nurtered and safeguarded, monitored and protected by Missions such as this.Your help will enable us to help the People of Catalonia determine for themselves their own future, free of any intereference.So what happens if this vote doesn't go ahead, or you can't go?As you may be aware, elements of the Spanish government have sought to stop this referendum going ahead.  As stated above, our belief in the right to self-determination is absolute, and we believe that ruling regime in Madrid will eventually see this as well. But, if this does not happen, and the Spanish paramilitary ""Guardia Civil"" do in fact shut own the vote and arrest all those involved, we will not be able to monitor a vote!If this happens, any funding we raise here will be used to fund ""English Scots for YES"" activities in Scotland, aimed at pursuing a second referendum for the people of Scotland.If you are not comfortable with your funding being used for such purposes, please state so in your donation comments; we will endeavour to return such donations to you.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns
