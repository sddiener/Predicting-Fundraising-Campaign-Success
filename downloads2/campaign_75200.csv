Detroit SOUP is looking to make the Jam Handy Building (a wonderful open space in New Center that used to be a film studio, among other things) it's new home. Last year we used this enormous space for the two year anniversary and we would like to use it year round for our microgranting dinners. What would be even better is that we would like to help it become a communal use space! In the last year it has been used for art installations, theatrical performances, music performance, beer brewing, urban farming classes, meeting space, film viewing, recital space, practice space, SOUP space, basketball games, etc. <br/><br/>Imagine yourself either putting your idea into practice in the space or engaging an in an event there. Now imagine in the winter, in Detroit.....it’s cold in their! Simeon (he owns the space with his brother Nat) did the math, called a few contractors, and realized that heat could be installed for $6000 and add some electrical and some lights for another $4000, we could have another venue that would be offered to the community to use for low rent or an exchange of something. Wow, really, that’s it? It’s amazing to think of what kind of community impact that space could make. East Grand Blvd. has some amazing potential become a center where art and ideas are growing and happening in the city of Detroit.</p>
<p>Breaking it Down:<br/>Raising $6000 gets the Jam Handy heat for the building<br/>Raising $10,000 gets heat, light and electrical work<br/>Raising $15,000 gets the Jam Handy heat, light, electrical work and SOUND<br/>Raising $20,000 get the Jam Handy all of the above and the ability to pay those bills when they come and the price of using the space does not rise!</p>
<p><br/>We want the space to be a together space. We would love if we raised about another $5000. We could even think about sound and getting an established PA sound system  so that we can all use it to share our ideas. I know all this sharing stuff could sound crazy but we really believe that artists need a venue to share their ideas. This one will be all ages and the community is open to using it whether through a trade, a barter, a swap, or a contribution, the large space will be open for all to use. <br/><br/>So who was Jam Handy and what is this space?! Well, Jam Handy the man was by all accounts quite a character. Before arriving in Detroit and establishing his legendary film studio, Handy had already been suspended from the University of Michigan for sullying the school’s reputation by publishing a colorful cartoon poking fun at a stodgy professor, and established himself as a pioneer in the field of competitive swimming by inventing two swimming techniques (still widely used today) and capturing a bronze medal in the 1904 Olympics despite standing only 5’ 2” tall. Even than more rabble rousing and swimming, Jam Handy’s true passion was visual communication and his prescient belief that it would revolutionize education by--as he stated in one of his many delightfully anachronistic quotes--”putting the hay where the horse can reach it.”</p>
<p><br/>To this end, Jam Handy moved The Jam Handy Organization to Detroit in 1932, locating it on East Grand Boulevard in order to be near his biggest client, General Motors and its 80 affiliated companies. Over the subsequent decades, Jam Handy went on to produce over 25,000 instructional films on seemingly every conceivable subject, including more than 7,000 training films for the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II. If you’re curious about what these films looked like (and you should be!) check out <a href=""http://archive.org/details/jam_handy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://archive.org/details/jam_handy</a>. While the Jam Handy Organization has long ceased to exist and its once sprawling network of buildings lining East Grand Boulevard has mostly disappeared from the landscape, its legacy lives on. Behind the scenes and around the world, numerous technical advancements that continue to shape the contemporary film industry owe their existence to the Jam Handy Organization. And now, here in Detroit, with the ongoing revival of the JHO’s former headquarters and main film stage, another scene--and a whole different kind of Jam Handy production--is taking place.<br/><br/>What is this Detroit SOUP?<br/>Detroit SOUP is a public soup dinner! Pay $5. Learn about creative projects happening in Detroit. Vote on which project to fund with the money raised from the meal that night. It has been happening since February 2010 above the Mexicantown Bakery, currently meeting in Corktown, and soon to make a permanent home. The project gets about 150-200 people at each dinner and the new space will allow for heat and better seating, something the current space does not have. <br/><br/>Everyone wins with your donation. There are some awesome perks in store! Relics of the buildings history, pieces of Detroit SOUP, potential to make the space yours! Anything over $25 we will use $5 towards Detroit SOUP and the November soup dinner to help make the next dreamers project come true!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.2890643049031496""><br/></strong></p></div>","There are many spaces and places around the city.

However, not only did I lose job but also my health deteriorated due to Heart, Blood pressure and Diabetes problems. Furthermore, I have a Stent inserted in my heart due to blocked artery by Elcamino  Hospital Mountain View, California. Due to health issues and being senior citizen I am retired and currently only on fixed income and can hardly can pay for my essentials.  <br/><p>My Home owners falsely accused me of threatening their security guard who confronted me in swimming pool during a hot summer day in August 2011.  He told me to get out of pool while I was at the deep endl. I requested him to please allow me to swim to shallow waters but he got upset and started calling for back up. Because of my heart problem I felt dizzy, had shortness of breath but after struggling managed to get out of the pool before reaching to shallow waters. The reason he did was because he thought I was not resident but the fact is I am a home owner there and proved my residency to them. While he compelled me to get out of the pool, his accomplice, a foot taller than me, chased me with a clinched fist and calling me names. When I complained to Home Owners Association, they instead of taking action against them, slapped me with a hefty fine which I am unable to pay as I am not only on fixed income but innocent too. <strong>I have witness statement to prove that I am an innocent person</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Background</h3>
<p>Ongoing economic tumult has left no one untouched, unscathed. Some, though, have been hit harder than others. I lost my primary source of income on the Friday before Thanksgiving in 2008. Since then, I've applied for jobs, pitched projects, and pursued every lead that crossed my path... all to no avail. Short-term unemployment benefits and some money from a lawsuit settlement bridged the gap for the first two years between my income as a freelance writer and my bare-bones monthly expenses. Despite a vehicle downgrade and personal austerity measures, I continue to run a small deficit each month and no work opportunities seem likely to come my way any time soon.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So, I'm taking a different tack. And I need your help.</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">The Notion</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>One of the things I'm most passionate about is being of service to others, contributing to the greater good. With your support, I can put that passion to good use working with organizations like H.A.R.P., The If Project, and the Charlotte Maxwell Complementary Clinic. With my myriad skills, I can produce web content, coordinate fund-raising, update social media, and more to give these great community service groups an extra set of helping hands.   </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In order to free myself up for this volunteer work, I need to cut my overhead expenses to a level that falls beneath my current freelance writing income. That means not paying rent, because pretty much everything else that can be eliminated is long gone. To achieve this next level of living lean, I want to purchase a cheap, old, reliable motorhome to live in. That way, I can go where I can be of assistance, all the while keeping my ongoing expenses within my current means. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Pitch</h3>
<p>Setting myself up with a motorhome (replete with a few eco-friendly improvements) will cost me somewhere between $5,000 and $8,000. I'm willing to chip in the very measly funds I have because I see it as an investment in my future. Might as well have my money in a tangible resource rather than a low-interest savings account, right? Besides, this is about coming together to do something bigger than any one person.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>For every $20 donated to my motorhome fund, I will volunteer one hour of time to one of the following organizations (you choose!) with fund-raising as a target task. That way, not only do your dollars put a roof over my head, they also get turned into more dollars through my efforts. Me spending, say, 20 hours to produce a benefit compilation album (a $400 value) could generate $5,000 or more for the organization. Put me to work for maybe 40 hours producing a benefit concert (an $800 value) and the revenues could jump to well over $10,000 for the charity. Everybody wins in this game!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If I don't hit the $5,000 goal, I can either hold off on some of the eco refurb or finagle some other way around. (But let's hope it doesn't come to that.)</p>

<h3>The Impact of an Education<br/>
</h3>
<p>In year one, FoodShedProductions will be offering a personalized
education in organic gardening.  August and Marion will be working with
suburban residents who desire an intimate connection with their food
and how it can be organically grown.  The goal of FoodShedProductions is to educate homeowners to be self-sufficient gardeners.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Marion and August of
FoodShedProductions will met potential clients to discuss the style of garden, the best
sites, the corresponding type and quantity of vegetables best suited
for their family and the site, and the number of gardening workshops
desired.  After agreeing on a plan of action the next visit will be
devoted to the construction and planting of a personal garden.  In
addition each resident will receive a compost turner, a seed starter
and a cold frame.  Marion or August will teach/demonstrate how each
tool is effectively used and impart the knowledge needed for your
garden's success. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In
all, home gardens can include the construction of multiple beds, a 24a
x 12a high tunnel, chicken coop and fencing, install drip line
irrigation, and provide workshops on succession and companion planting,
watering, pruning, bed flipping as well as canning, dehydration, and
freezing.   <br/></p>

<p>Since 1999, HELP International has been dedicated to fighting poverty and empowering people through community development initiatives in education, public health and business in some of the poorest countries around the world.</p>
<p>HELP International has been serving in Uganda since 2006, and this summer HELP will send two teams to Uganda to carry out its mission of: empowering people to fight global poverty through sustainable, life-changing development programs.</p>
<p>Teams will serve in Mbale and Lugazi, Uganda and will be comprised of two Country Directors who will lead 20 to 30 volunteers.</p>
<p>In partnership with local community members and organizations, HELP will be working on sustainable development projects that include: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Nutrition and income generation through vertical gardens – </strong>which provide subsistence farming for families that do not own their own land in the Namatala slum near Mbale, Uganda. HELP teams built 10 vertical gardens last year.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>Empowerment through the Proud to Be a Girl Campaign – </strong>teaching the girls of Uganda women’s health, empowerment and self esteem.<br/> <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Potential lives saved through Mbale Blood Drive – In</strong> 2011, HELP teams held a three-day blood drive, which recruited 230 blood donors - potentially saving 460 lives in Mbale Hospitals. HELP is hoping to grow this program in 2012.<br/>  <strong></strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Improving education through teacher trainings – </strong>HELP teams partnered with the Minster of Education to provide teacher training to 338 teachers and hold Mbale’s first science fair, which hosted participants from 48 schools.<br/> <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Improved health care through eye and dental clinics – </strong>in 2011, 94 patients were given eye exams and 32 patients dental exams. Sixty-eight pairs of glasses were distributed, and HELP is hoping to increase these numbers this summer.<br/> <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Clean drinking water through water filters and rain harvesting systems – </strong>more than 2,000 people were provided clean drinking water in 2011, and the need for water sanitation is still great throughout Uganda.<br/> <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Community development through soccer club in Natamala slum - 45</strong> youth were taught leadership skills through this club that we would like to grow in 2012.<br/>  <strong></strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Entrepreneurship through business trainings –</strong> participants are taught basic entrepreneurial and micro-enterprise business skills as well as income-generating activities. <strong></strong>
</li>
</ul><p>However, in order to run these programs and serve the people of Uganda in 2012 – <strong>we need your HELP! </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY UGANDA NEEDS YOUR HELP</strong></p>
<p>Uganda has gotten ample press recently; however, the problems facing the people of Uganda extend beyond Kony. Known as the “Pearl of Africa”, Uganda is rich in natural resources, yet its people remain deeply impoverished and in great need. Illiteracy is common, especially among females. The infant mortality rate is high – 82 deaths per 1,000 live births. 36% of people do not have access to clean drinking water.</p>
<p>The facts surrounding Uganda aren’t all dire. In the 1980’s more than 25% of Ugandans were infected with HIV; however, this rate has fallen to less than 7%. Uganda boasts the most effective national response to HIV/AIDS of any African country. HELP International is hoping to help create more success stories for the people of Uganda. </p>
<p><strong>WHERE DOES MY MONEY GO? </strong></p>
<p>Your donations will go directly towards sustainable development initiatives in Uganda, and every donation will help the people of Uganda! 100% of your donation goes to improving the communities and lives of people in Lugazi and Mbale, Uganda. Any size donation, even $1, helps, and your contribution is greatly appreciated! </p>

</div></div>","What is capoeira?
Capoeira is a game. It's music, movement, history. It's a
philosophy. It's a way of life rooted in the social struggles that came with
the transatlantic slave trade. 

 
Here's a timeline to put us in context:

 


1500         The brutality of transatlantic slavery
begins. Free African men and women are taken by force, packed onto horrid slave ships and
brought to Brazil to work on sugarcane plantations.

1808 
          Capoeira
emerges through the cultural hybridization of enslaved men and women of
the African diaspora. They are able to express their African identity through
dance, music and warrior rituals.
1814 
          Any
form of African cultural expression is prohibited by colonial oppressors.
1888 
          Slavery
is abolished but the disenfranchised Afro-Brazilians continue to use
capoeira as a form of underground resistance.
1889 
          Vicente
Ferreira Pastinha was born and was to be known as Mestre Pastinha, the
most influencial capoeira angola master to exist at the time.
1942            People rediscover the value of capoeira through
its institutionalisation. Mestre Pastinhaâ€™s academy opens and brings forth two
very revered diciples Mestre Joao Pequeno and Mestre Joao Grande.
1982            Mestre Moraes, student of Joao Grande opens the Capoeira
Angola Pelourinho Group (GCAP) in Bahia, Brazil.
1985           Jurandir
Nascimento, along with Cinezio
FÃ©liciano PeÃ§nanha (Cobra Mansa), both students of Mestre Moraes become
pioneers of the group.
1995            Cobra Mansa along with Jurandir  and Mestre
Valmir found the International Capoeira Angola Foundation (FICA) in Washington
D.C.
2012            FICA is now
international in scope. Mestres Cobra Mansa, Jurandir and Valmir travel the
world giving conferences, workshops and lectures year round.


Note: These dates are approximate and may vary depending on the source.

 
FICA in Montreal
Fabrice Koffy, Kseniya Smaryanakis, Celeste Nelson and Ron
Scott collectively lead FICA Study Group Montreal and strive to stay connected
to the source. 

 
Being guided by a capoeira master is crucial to the
development of our young group. Despite our regular trips to Brazil, our
exposure to the art form is very limited. With only a handful of capoeira
angola groups in Canada, we are 1 of 2 in the province of Quebec.

 
Weâ€™ve been giving weekly capoeira angola classes in Montreal
since 2006 and became a study group of FICA just last year. 


What will we do with your donation? 
It is becoming increasingly important to deepen our
understanding of the martial art if we want to continue growing in our
practice. We are a non-profit grass-root collective and all of our profits go back into the
group to pay for space rentals, instruments and hosting workshops.

 
We need $2500 to cover the costs of Mestre Jurandirâ€™s visit. We have already a fifth of this amount and we want to raise the rest with your help.
Expenses for this event include:

Â· Airplane
tickets to and from Montreal 
Â· Accommodation

Â· Food
Â· Transportation
Â· Studio rentals
Â· Remuneration

Why Mestre Jurandir?
Itâ€™s not easy to make a living off capoeira angola and we want to support Mestre Jurandir financially in his mission to preserve the art form. He has dedicated over 30 years to capoeira angola and uses the practice as a tool for social change. He has done work in America with juvenile delinquents, kindergardeners, high school kids and abandoned children in the slums of Brazil. Mestre Jurandir's dedication has even brought him to MoÃ§ambique where he has been twice already to support community-building and youth empowerment through capoeira angola. Mestre Jurandir is a goldmine of knowledge and this is
why want to have him in Montreal. 


What will you gain from giving?
By making a donation, you will get one of the following perks:



A postcard


Maple bonbons


Montreal designer t-shirt


Capoeira CD




 
Plus, by contributing to our cause, you become an active agent
in strengthening our community and help us mobilize capoeira angola to:



develop a sense of community;


empower the youth;


share insight into the Afro-Brazilian culture;

 show how the practice benefits mind, body and spirit.



This is why bringing Mestre Jurandir to
Montreal means so much.

If you believe in our work, spread the word and share
this cause with friends and family! Because it
takes a community to raise consciousness about social injusticesâ€”for us, capoeira angola does just that.

<h2>Help the Concert for the Caring help our communities!</h2>
<h2>The Concert for the Caring is a new and exciting fundraising event, designed to bring caring people together in communities across the country.</h2>
<h2>We have a good start. We have done several concerts in support of various causes, the Haiti earthquake, CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates), and United Way to name a few. Audiences enjoyed the events, comments trend towards “inspiring” and “moving”<strong>-</strong> exactly what we want to hear.</h2>
<h2>The concerts feature the original songs of Atlantic Records legacy artist Morgan Paul. His inspiration has been over a decade of work in the city of Paterson NJ, supporting Food Pantries, Homeless Shelters, and other charities who do the good work, helping those most in need, every day.</h2>
<h2>Morgan Paul found songwriting inspiration in the difficult lives of folks who struggle every day for just the basics, food, clothing and shelter. “It’s complex!”, says Morgan Paul. “At this basic level, just surviving is about as stressful as it gets. Lots of people do what they can to help, only to have something else get in the way. Kids get an education, then they go home to drugs, poor nutrition, and domestic violence, and there goes the education lesson.” Some would find that frustrating, difficult to raise support for, but Morgan Paul saw it differently.</h2>
<h2>To help bring attention to the need, Morgan Paul wrote over 90 compelling and moving songs, each with a story to tell. (Including “Live United” for the United Way, ”Before I Can’t Remember” for the Alzheimer’s Association, and “Where Hope Begins” for Eva’s Village.) As that developed, reviews were favorable. Folks liked the songs and loved the messages. A concert was the next step and it was then that the Haiti earthquake happened.</h2>
<h2>That concert, “People United to Save Haiti” (PUSH) brought together 400 local residents in the Paterson NJ area and they raised over $2000 in donations and sponsorships. Not bad for a first effort. What was immediately clear was that people, LOTS of people, want to help their neighbors.</h2>
<h2>As the economy tanked, the charity world began asking for more and more money, from fewer and fewer donors. That is unsustainable. Eventually, you will lose your big donors and funding will disappear in big chunks. But the regular folks don’t have a lot of money to spare in this economy, they just want to help somehow.  </h2>
<h2>Morgan Paul saw that a local concert event could raise a lot of money, in small individual amounts. Local concerts can attract 1000 or more people. He guessed most folks might afford $20 a ticket for a great night of moving entertainment. He was right. People readily pay $20 for a Concert for the Caring event. However getting the word out to attract 1000 people has been a challenge.</h2>
<h2>Morgan Paul decided to take a leap of faith. To keep the cost of The Concert for the Caring as low as possible, he invested in all of the equipment necessary to put on a show. This, so there would be no charges for sound, lights, and ultimately staging. You see the Concert for the Caring this year has been blessed with a mobile stage! Well it wasn’t always a mobile stage, it was a construction office trailer from 1965. But Morgan Paul saw it differently. With the help of his son, the old structure was removed and the deck became the stage. A new set of axles and wheels, plus several hundred hours of labor, made the dream a reality!</h2>
<h2>But now its time to get the show on the road. That’s where you come in. We are trying to raise $25,000 to get The Concert for the Caring into towns across the North East region in 2013. The money will go to fine tuning the technical side of the show, for basic expenses, and especially for getting the word out that this exciting fundraising event is ready to help raise money and awareness of the needs in every community.</h2>
<h2>So please be generous! Be a part of something big! We see this as the future of fundraising, a way to reach folks who don’t go to Golf Outings, or Gala Dinners, who just want to enjoy a great concert as they help out their communities.</h2>
<h2> As a little ‘thanks’, we will send all donors the original Morgan Paul song,” I Have a Friend” via email. $100+ donors will get the most recent Concert for the Caring CD, 12 songs, dedicated to you or a loved one. $1000+ donors will enjoy all of the above, plus be Morgan Paul’s VIP guest at all 2013 shows. When we reach our goal of $25,000, all donors will be invited to a special Concert for the Caring, in recognition of the generosity of people who truly care and have made a difference.</h2>
<h2>Together, we can make our world a better place!</h2>
<h2>Many thanks!</h2>

<p class=""p1""><strong><em>What is it?</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">RememberWell is a website with two purposes: It functions as an end-of-life library dedicated to ""green"" and alternative choices, plus it offers web space and a template for hosting and creating an online memorial built by the user.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">The site is being produced to help people discover what services are available for their transition or the transition of a loved one. It is a one-stop resource programmed so that the user will have an account enabling him or her to ""like"" their discoveries and return in the future, near or far, to find them neatly organized into easy-to-find categories. Whether you are seeking pre-planning information such as how to choose hospice care or who to call for help with writing your life-story, need-it-now information such as where to find a""green"" casket or a ""threshold"" choir, or follow-up information such as where to find grief support or hand-made urns, RememberWell will make the process an effortless endeavor.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">The online memorial template will allow for service information as well as biographies, photos, videos, guestbooks, and a space to leave offerings such as a virtual flower bouquet. The user can choose if the commemoration is public or private. Yet, unlike social media, all data and information is never shared or sold behind the scenes. We believe in adhering to strict privacy standards.</p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1""><strong><em>Why are we building it?</em></strong></p>
<p class=""p1""> </p>
<p class=""p1"">At the moment, one must spend hours piecing together information regarding eco-friendly, extraordinary end-of-life choices. Oftentimes, one waits until one has to ""deal with it"" to know what his or her options are.

<p> </p>
</div></div>","What is it?
 
RememberWell is a website with two purposes: It functions as an end-of-life library dedicated to ""green"" and alternative choices, plus it offers web space and a template for hosting and creating an online memorial built by the user.
 
The site is being produced to help people discover what services are available for their transition or the transition of a loved one. It is a one-stop resource programmed so that the user will have an account enabling him or her to ""like"" their discoveries and return in the future, near or far, to find them neatly organized into easy-to-find categories. Whether you are seeking pre-planning information such as how to choose hospice care or who to call for help with writing your life-story, need-it-now information such as where to find a""green"" casket or a ""threshold"" choir, or follow-up information such as where to find grief support or hand-made urns, RememberWell will make the process an effortless endeavor.
 
The online memorial template will allow for service information as well as biographies, photos, videos, guestbooks, and a space to leave offerings such as a virtual flower bouquet. The user can choose if the commemoration is public or private. Yet, unlike social media, all data and information is never shared or sold behind the scenes. We believe in adhering to strict privacy standards.
 
 
Why are we building it?
 
At the moment, one must spend hours piecing together information regarding eco-friendly, extraordinary end-of-life choices. Oftentimes, one waits until one has to ""deal with it"" to know what his or her options are. RememberWell aims to make discovering the requisite information so easy that instead of it being a ""have to"" subject, it becomes a ""want to"" subject. No rational, healthy person wants to die but since we all will have to cross that threshold, why not be informed and responsible for your exit? Why not make your passing eloquent and expressive, true to your own taste, and inspiring for all concerned? RememberWell can help you do this and provide help to those caring for they dying.
 
 
Why do we need the money?
 
Implementing the redesign. Coding. Hosting. Marketing. Time. We need the time to research, catalogue, and verify legitimate goods and services. And we want to further add in resources such as material on funeral customs, history, and philosophies.

<h3><strong>THE PROJECT:</strong></h3>
<p><em>A Culture of Coffee</em> is a transmedia project about the history of coffee and the traditions tied to this major world export, from its origins in Ethiopia and deep national roots to its influence around the globe. By harnessing social and visual media, as well as the rare art of book-making, we explore the oft-ignored imprint of Ethiopian coffee across time and cultures. We consider coffee as a cultural good; not just an everyday caffeine fix, but a fixture, in and of itself. </p>
<h3><strong>THE PURPOSE:</strong></h3>
<p>In America, the idea of coffee is often just a quick ""cup of Joe"" from the corner Starbucks, but in Ethiopia, the history of coffee is as rich as its taste.</p>
<p>For centuries, the artfully-practiced Ethiopian coffee ceremony has been a feast for all five senses: seeing the process of coffee-making from roast to grind to cup; the smell of incense and slow roasted coffee; the sound of conversation and feeling amidst gathered friends. The coffee ceremony creates a culture all its own; an opportunity to forge social bonds, share customs and exchange ideas. And it is this experience of making and consuming coffee that is the centerpiece of a beautiful and time-honored Ethiopian ritual. It's what coffee at its finest should do, simultaneously enliven taste-buds and engage communities.</p>
<p>Championing this culture of coffee is now our cause. By exploring the East African country and its deep-rooted relationship with the coffee bean, we hope to bridge cultural divides and open the lines of communication. As we learn the story behind each sip, we intend to bring a little of Ethiopia to the rest of the world.</p>
<h3><strong>THE PLAN:</strong></h3>
<p>Our ultimate goal for <em>A Culture of Coffee</em> is to produce several multimedia productions that celebrate the ancient history and culture of coffee in Ethiopia, specifically its unique coffee ceremony, culminating in an artful coffee table book which will be entitled <em>From Ethiopia with Love</em>. To reach as wide an audience as possible, the project will be produced in multiple formats: short video, PDF, hard copy book and limited-edition pop-up. The intention is to make this production as accessible and media rich as possible, including photographs, illustrations and custom design.</p>
<p><span>However, like the ceremony, itself, the process of exploring Ethiopian coffee culture takes time. </span></p>
<p>As we research and develop our project, we hope to reignite the essential ingredient behind coffee--conversation. Understanding the cross-cultural connection that coffee creates requires the kind of dialogue that we will encourage throughout the course of the project. Through our <a href=""http://cultureofcoffee.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a> and <a href=""http://cultureofcoffee.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> we invite participants to submit <em>original</em> coffee inspired works of art and photography for the opportunity to become potential co-contributors to the project. As we investigate the provenance, traditions and successors of ""buna,"" we want to share our findings and discuss your personal experiences.</p>
<p>For too long, tea has gotten all the glory. Get ready to experience everything that coffee is made of.</p>
<h3><strong>THE FUNDS:</strong></h3>
<p>Your generous contributions for this campaign will go directly towards the research and development. A second campaign will be launched afterward to cover production and distribution of <em>From Ethiopia with Love..</em>. </p>
<p><strong>PHASE 1</strong>: This first Indiegogo campaign launch covers fundraising for research and development. We'll be connecting people to the culture and promoting awareness through the blog and social media. Most of our budget in this phase will be spent on round trip tickets, room and board, while touring the coffee producing regions of Ethiopia (Sidamo, Yirgacheffe, Harar, Limu, and Jimma) where we will learn about, photograph and film coffee at the source.</p>
<p><em>PHASE 2:</em> A return from our research trip in Ethiopia will kickoff the design, production and publishing process, which will include the bulk of the costs from our prospective budget ($10,000 for 100 books). The funds raised in our second phase of fundraising will go toward graphic design, photography, illustration, video production and publishing costs to ensure that the project can be accessed in various formats. </p>
<p><em>PHASE 3</em>: Once the book is completed, any remaining portions of the budget will cover the costs of a book release in order to celebrate the book's launch and give you a taste of Ethiopian culture--and coffee, of course.We'll release the book and deliverables, using the portion of book sale proceeds towards our Ethiopian Cultural Development Corp seed and startup money, which will be dedicated to preserving and advancing Ethiopian cultural heritage.</p>

<h3>Introducing Anzovin Rig Tools</h3>
<p>If you're a CG animator, you're probably familiar with the concept of ""rigging,"" the structure inside a character that deforms it's surface and gives you the controls you'll use to manipulate and pose the character. You're also probably familiar with how maddeningly complex and arcane character rigging can be.</p>
<p>Anzovin Rig Tools (or ART) is a completely new way to rig in Autodesk's Maya that is designed from the ground up to handle the complexity of a modern rig. Our toolset includes:</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/k6sjkAcm0Oo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ground-breaking, spline-based deformation</a> with stretchy, bendable bones that any animator can reshape as needed.</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/GZtvNTzX4YQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Simplified weight painting</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/epN1_dpwmG0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">High-level deformation control</a>.</p>
<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/CtlK5xVeZ1A"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Volume preservation to easily deform thick objects.</a></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.anzovin.com/products/art1maya.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Take a look at the Anzovin Rig Tools website for in-depth info</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>New Rigging Tools for a New Century</h3>
<p>Modeling, dynamics, shading, and rendering techniques have made great strides in the last decade, but our rigging and animation tools have remained largely stagnant. Sure, we've had some evolutionary usability enhancements, but the basic workflow and functionality offered in tools like Maya isn't really much different then it was in the late 90s.</p>
<p>ART takes character rigging into the 21st century. It will be of immense benefit to anyone who needs to rig expressive and believable characters, from students and freelancers who need a fast and easy way to deform their characters, to experienced rigging professionals who want to add high-level tools to their pipeline.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Reinventing the rigging and character deformation process turns out to be pretty expensive and time consuming. We've already worked on ART for more then three years now, but we've still got a long way to go--we need to do optimization, tooling, and GUI building before we can even consider ART to be an alpha product, let alone get it into beta testing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we're a very small studio, so we're continually getting distracted by the stuff that pays the bills--work-for-hire animation and smaller tools (like our new onion skinning toolset and our auto-rigging tools) that are much cheaper to make. If we're going to get ART out in some reasonable time frame, we're going to need some funding that lets us devote focused time and energy to preparing it for release. And that's where you come in!</p>
<p>We're offering discount codes to everyone who helps us push development on ART forward. Not only can you help us get ART into your hands quicker, you can also save money at the same time.</p>
<p>The higher teirs also offer inclusion to our alpha and beta programs. Note that while ART will be available for all platforms that support Maya 2011 and up, the alpha version will be limited to 64-bit Maya running under Windows.</p>
<h3>Our Timeline</h3>
<p>ART is new technology founded on complex algorithms, so it's difficult to be precise about release date. However, if we're able to fully fund ART development, we are aiming to going beta sometime in June for a release this summer. We'll let you know immediately if there are any delays.</p>
<h3>Other Things You Can Do To Help</h3>
<p>If you're not interested in the ART discount, you can also help us by ordering some of our existing products from our store at <a href=""http://www.anzovinstore.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.anzovinstore.com/</a></p>

Our Timeline
ART is new technology founded on complex algorithms, so it's difficult to be precise about release date. However, if we're able to fully fund ART development, we are aiming to going beta sometime in June for a release this summer. We'll let you know immediately if there are any delays.
Other Things You Can Do To Help
If you're not interested in the ART discount, you can also help us by ordering some of our existing products from our store at http://www.anzovinstore.com/",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

~Emily Vanderberg (Founder of E & co.)
Our Story
 
E & co. is designed to help spread awareness about the dangers of street vending in third world countries as well as the effects the recession is still pouring out on our small businesses here in America. It is a voice for the hard working from one nation to another and bands them together in an effort to make a difference in both worlds. 

 
India:
 

FACT: Indian Street Vendors make less and sometimes more than 1 American Dollar a day. (National Policy of Urban Street Vendors- 2009)

United States:


FACT:  Contributing to the growth of small businesses here in America will lower the unemployment rate.(""Poised for Growth, But Not Hiring"" by Emily Maltby)

 



The Impact
 


What if, 1 consumer can help the growth of 3 businesses?
Business #1: We will be scouring the streets of India for talented artisans who work hard to handcraft their own well made products (specifically, Men’s and Women’s Fashion and Travel accessories) using the rich, vibrant textiles India is most commonly known for. 
Business #2
The products will then be brought back to the United States where we will be working with small businesses who have the tools/skills necessary to refine the products and test their durability. 
Business #3:
The line of products will then be available for purchase at my online store, www.eandcompany.com, coming soon (with your help)!
 
 
With each purchase from E & co. ...

The street vendors will receive a percentage of the profit and get the validation and resources they need to further their business or their education, small American businesses get the revenue they’ve been missing and through my online store, the consumer gets beautifully handcrafted, imported Indian items.  


 
Why I'm Qualified for the Job

After receiving my BS in Business Administration and Concentration in Finance, I had the privilege of working hand in hand with women’s fashion designer ” Christina Lehr” for 3 years, managing her wholesale business and helping to open her first retail location in NYC! It was an amazing experience and I feel as though it’s time to express my creative eye, while giving back. 

 


What We Need
 




We need to raise funds for 3 major aspects of this start-up: airfare, the E & co. website (eandcompany.com) and some start up capital to purchase our first round of goods! 




  


Other Ways You Can Help
 


Once the website is up and running there will be a “Donations” page for the street vendors I will be working with in India to whom you can donate to. 100% of all donations made on eandcompany.com will go directly to the street vendor.



I leave you with this...
If you believe in the future of “E & co.” and don’t have the means to support, I ask that you spread the awareness about the dangers of street vending in India, the struggles small businesses face in America and spread the word to your friends and family about “E & co.” as a way to help... oh yeah... and like us on Facebook! :) Thank you so much!!!

</p>
<p>The Double Bucks Program is great way to improve access to fresh and local foods for low-income residents in Durham and to support our local farmers and food producers.</p>
<p>Let us tell you how:</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Research has now shown that a monetary incentives can cause a permanent shift in purchasing patterns for customers using food assistance benefits – and this shift directly benefits food producers. Evaluation of similar incentive programs show: </p>
<p>· An increase in new market customers, repeat customers, revenue, and sales of fruits and vegetables </p>
<p>· About 27% of market revenue comes from federal SNAP benefits and incentive funds.</p>
<p>· 90% of SNAP customers increase or greatly increase their consumption of fruits and vegetables, thus reducing their risk of many diet related chronic diseases.</p>
<p>In other words, the Double Bucks Program has the potential to make positive and lasting impacts in the health of the SNAP/EBT recipients in Durham-- especially for the 5,800 recipients living within a 3 mile radius of the Durham Farmers' Market.

The Double Bucks Program is great way to improve access to fresh and local foods for low-income residents in Durham and to support our local farmers and food producers.
Let us tell you how:
For any amount up to $10, Double Bucks matches whatever SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as Food Stamps) shoppers swipe their EBT (Electronic Benefits Transfer) card for at the Durham Farmers' Market (DFM). 
So, if someone swipes their card for $10, they receive $20 worth of wooden tokens to spend at the DFM. This encourages shoppers to try out the market for their veggies, breads, eggs, cheeses, meats, and more. It is a win-win for shoppers and DFM producers alike...it helps to fill fridges with healthy, local food while supporting small food producers by keeping federal assistance dollars in the community.

<h3>Join us for a night of masquerade fun!</h3>
<p>For a couple years, I have had the desire to throw a New Year's Eve masquerade where people could dress in costume and have fun with others while ringing in the New Year. This year, 2013, I decided it was time to stop thinking about throwing a masquerade and actually *do* it. But it requires money to do just that, and to make it as phenomenal as possible.</p>
<p>The goal is to make this an annual event that everyone can look forward to and that can expand for more to enjoy. </p>
<p>The first thing that was most important was getting a hotel secured for the event, and to find a DJ. Mission accomplished on both counts!</p>
<p>The masquerade will be hosted at the Lancaster Host Resort &amp; Conference Center in Lancaster, PA.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to help offset the costs, there will be a $20 cover charge, but I am also giving the option for people to donate more if they wish to help out with other costs, including decorations and the DJ:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are paying for more than one person as you donate, choose the higher ""perk"" and make a private comment saying that you are paying for the cover charge for more than one person- please include your name and their name(s) so that I can make a note in my spreadsheet.<ul></ul>
</li>
<li>All funding raised goes directly into the event by paying for:
</li>
<ul>
<li>Catering at the hotel</li>
<li>The DJ services of C.F. Star Entertainment</li>
<li>Decor</li>
<li>An additional tip for the bartender since it is a cash bar</li>
</ul>
<li>A $15 supporting donation has been added. This is for people that may want to attend this year but can not, but still want to help. They will receive the following:</li>
<ul>
<li>An engraved champagne flute</li>
<li>Special recognition at the masquerade </li>
</ul>
<li>$20 cover charge covers your cost to attend. This includes your buffet dinner, entertainment for the evening, and a champagne toast at midnight.</li>
<li>Any donations of $25-30, you will receive the following in addition to the buffet, entertainment for the evening, and a champagne toast at midnight:
<ul>
<li>Special recognition at the masquerade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Any donations of $35 or more, you will receive the following in addition to the buffet, entertainment for the evening, and a champagne toast at midnight:
<ul>
<li>An engraved champagne flute</li>
<li>Special recognition at the masquerade </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>I hope that this is just the first year of this event. When I intially decided to go for it while planning, it has always been with the intent of creating a fun and inspiring event that could lead to an annual event people look forward to that just keeps growing each year- both in attendance, costumes, and the level of creativity. </p>

<p>Although Polish kosher products are of high quality and in competitive prices, the producers still lack knowledge of how to make kosher, how to make contacts with companies that grant kosher certificates, as well as, they lack business relations with international dealers. The dealers could help Polish kosher companies to represent them at different fairs all around the world.</p>
<p>Because such firms which do not cooperate with international dealers do not maximize their profits and also the Jewish community cannot buy these local products so easily.<br/>Not only will this two-day fair be a good platform for developing an international networking system between Poles and Jews from all around the world, but also it will be an interesting place for attendees. We will offer a range of lectures on Jewish food tradition and culture –mainly connected with preparation and consumption of meals, presentation of Israeli and Jewish cuisines (traditional food preparation and cooking workshops), and Polish Jewish organizations market, which will help to promote them and find new sponsors for their products.</p>
<p><strong>Mission and aim of the project</strong></p>
<p><br/><strong>Our mission is:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To organize the first kosher food fair in Poland and create a platform for polish and Israeli companies to make new business relations.</li>
<li>To promote both Polish and Jewish companies, their products, as well as to promote some Polish and world restaurants.</li>
<li>To organize workshops concerning a broadly defined Jewish cuisine.</li>
<li>To promote Jewish organizations in Poland and to help in establishing new business relations with prospective sponsors.</li>
</ul>
<p>The beneficiary of the program is a group of Polish companies which produces and supplies the Jewish community in Poland with kosher products. Furthermore, all the Jewish companies from all around the world that are currently looking for an inexpensive, good-quality produce to export or to process will benefit greatly form this program.</p>
<p>The secondary beneficiary is both a group of Jewish organizations in Poland that will be able to promote themselves and to establish new contacts; and some Jewish companies that produce or provide their services in Poland.<br/>The need On the basis of conversations which I have conducted with both representatives of some national and local Polish companies, and with some international Jewish organization which specialize in kosher food , I have collected information and opinions that this kind of initiative would be of great interest. Polish products, especially fruit and vegetables, are competitive to other products available on the international kosher food market. Thus, introducing and cooperating with Polish brands is highly desirable.</p>
<p><strong>Achievements</strong></p>
<p>This project will be the first of its kind in Poland. For last six months it has been in its organizational phase. This means that we have already booked an appropriate venue for this event (Holiday Inn Hotel in Kraków). We have also created: a stand distribution plan, information materials for Polish companies, a website(kosherpoland.pl) ; we have started collaboration with a stand organization company and a catering company (the latter will prepare and wait kosher lunches during the fair).<br/>We have finished an initial talk with some Polish institutions and representatives of the Polish government. Also, we have concluded our initial talks with Polish companies that specialize in kosher food. All parties of the conversations expressed their interest in this project.</p>
<p><strong>When we will call it a success?</strong><br/>The project will end successfully if about 70 Polish companies will take part in it. Furthermore, it will be successful to us if the amount of attendees reaches 300 guests from all around the world.<br/>After finishing the project, we intend to conduct a survey among Polish companies and attendees. The survey will help us to establish a broader picture of newly established business relations, the amount of signed contracts, and post Kosher Expos meetings and business conversations.<br/>Our project is innovative, because it is the first project of this kind in Poland. Never before has there been any kosher show in Poland! While organizing this particular venture, we have established plenty of contacts with representatives of the Polish government, such as: Embassy of Israel in Poland, Polish-Israeli Chamber of Commerce, and Polish-Israeli Parliamentary Group.<br/>Moreover, we have started a cooperation with representatives of some organization and people in the worldwide kosher food industry.<br/>Such a fair is a great opportunity to promote a local Jewish community. It’s a chance to show that the Jewish Kraków is not only revolving around abandoned synagogues or a touristic stopping and sleeping point on the road to Auschwitz, but it is also a place of international Jewish business.</p>
<p>In my opinion, I think that this project is a good depiction of a Jewish start-up, which is not only about broad business aspects, but also about social aspects. Our project is rather innovative in relation to local conditions, but that is not all – it gains from many good practices of fairs that were organized in the USA, Europe or China. It is both a business and a social platform for international relations. By its business factor, this project should be able to self-maintain financially and develop immensily in the future.</p>

<p>Our process of making cider is essentially no different than when cider was made by farmers 100 years ago.  In-season apples are selected, stored for a period of time in a cool environment, pressed into juice, and slowly fermented with yeast.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>We worked with a local Ontario orchard on selecting the specific apple varieties that go into our cider.  The benefit of this approach is that your cider is ultimately only as good as the apples that go into making it.  To create a flavourful cider we purposefully selected a mix of Cortland, Idared and Northern Spy apples as our base.  To help with some of the aromatics we also included a small portion of McIntosh and Empire apples.</p>

<p>For our first year of operation, we’ve pressed 15,000 litres of juice for cider production, which is housed in 3 large fermenters at our production space. With our newly purchased 1000L totes, we’re able to pull off smaller amounts of our cider base and experiment with different infusions to produce some creative offerings that you won’t find on tap anywhere else in Ontario.</p>

<p>I’ve been a home brewer for over 8 years and started making cider simply because I couldn’t find what I was looking for. Cider is a beverage that’s rich in history and tradition- it predates beer and wine.  It’s about farming, it’s about an orchard and honouring the region where it’s grown. I started the Sulker’s Cider journey a year ago and along the way, I got to know some incredible cider makers in Ontario like: Chris from West Avenue, Tariq at Revel, Nick at Pommies and Matt at Applewoods.  They’re forging a path for what cider can be in Ontario, and I want to join this burgeoning movement. My goal is to help realize Ontario’s potential for becoming a region that’s recognized for having incredible cider. Our land makes some of the best apples in the world, there’s no reason why we shouldn’t be known for making some of the most acclaimed ciders out there.</p>
<p>Getting to this place has not been an easy path and I know that running a cidery in Ontario is by no means a get-rich-quick scheme. I hope you share in my vision and will support this campaign. From the bottom of my heart, I appreciate it.</p>
<p>Let’s make some cider!</p>

</div></div>","We've curated some incredible pledge perks for cider lovers with help from our craft cider community friends. FEATURE PERK 1 – TRY OUR CIDER: This is the most important offer for us because it means people are out there trying our cider. Your pledge gives you a chance to grab yourself a gift card for a round of Sulker's Cider from Toronto's best cider bar, Her Father’s Cider Bar & Kitchen on Harbord Street.  FEATURE PERK 2 – GRAB SOME SULKER'S SWAG: We've designed custom Sulker's Swag for our backers. Have a look at what's in store!  – Scroll down for more Pledge Perks –  Our cider is crafted to provide an alternative to an Ontario market dominated by over-sweetened, mainstream import cider.  Made with 100% Ontario apples, Sulker's is focused on pushing the boundaries of what cider can be with quality local ingredients and a creative approach.  If you've ever tried a hard cider and thought it was way too syrupy and sweet, we invite you to try Sulker's Cider.  Here's the deal: the majority of  import brands add large amounts of sugar and flavourings to their finished product with little care for the actual apples they make their cider from. In fact, one of the more popular imports is made from low quality grape juice and is flavoured with apple flavouring. Can you guess which one? 


 

 
 

 
 
Every drop of Sulker's is made from a carefully perfected blend of freshly pressed Ontario apple juice.  We work with some incredible growers in the region and spent a year experimenting until we found the perfect varieties of delicious apples to go into our cider blend. That means when you order a pint of Sulker's, you're ordering the best this region has to offer. 
 
 

 
 
As much as we are focused on making a true-to-fruit cider – we are also focused on experimenting with different ingredients and techniques in our recipes.  Whether it’s the addition of other fruits like cherries or pineapple, or carefully infusing our ciders with unexpected flavours like charred American oak, we are constantly looking to offer unique cider experiences for all seasons.     It all started with a tasting club. To refine our offering, we created a members-only club of food & beverage writers, restaurant owners, brewers & craft influencers. Every month a new batch of cider was delivered, shared online and reviewed. 

 
This important feedback has allowed us to meticulously perfect our recipes, try some radically new flavour combinations and most importantly, build a community of loyal Sulker’s Cider supporters, without whom, we wouldn’t be where we are today. 
 

 

 

Our process of making cider is essentially no different than when cider was made by farmers 100 years ago.  In-season apples are selected, stored for a period of time in a cool environment, pressed into juice, and slowly fermented with yeast.
 

 
We worked with a local Ontario orchard on selecting the specific apple varieties that go into our cider.  The benefit of this approach is that your cider is ultimately only as good as the apples that go into making it.  To create a flavourful cider we purposefully selected a mix of Cortland, Idared and Northern Spy apples as our base.  To help with some of the aromatics we also included a small portion of McIntosh and Empire apples.
 
 
 
For our first year of operation, we’ve pressed 15,000 litres of juice for cider production, which is housed in 3 large fermenters at our production space. With our newly purchased 1000L totes, we’re able to pull off smaller amounts of our cider base and experiment with different infusions to produce some creative offerings that you won’t find on tap anywhere else in Ontario.
 

 

 

 

Join us at our Official Sulker's Cider Launch Party during Ontario Craft Cider Week and take advantage of some great Early Bird savings! We'll be taking over a sunny Toronto patio on Sunday May 28th and ringing in our launch Sulker's Cider style. Hope to see you there- tickets are limited!
 

 
Or immortalize yourself in cider-form with these limited offers!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I come from humble beginnings and spent a lot of time in Laundromats growing up. They were dirty, boring and sometimes unsafe spaces then, and unfortunately, they still are today.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and respect. </strong></p>
<p><strong>It's time that we invest in these underperforming community assets, transforming them into vibrant social hubs that celebrate arts, culture, and community.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It's time that we give opportunity youth an empowering on-the-job training experience to learn and grow from.</strong></p>
<p>Your investment in Social Spin will have a big impact on the people who depend on our Laundromats, and the opportunity youth who work there.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We plan on opening five Social Spin Laundromat locations in 5 years and need your help to kick-start this movement.<br/><br/>We're raising $75,000.</p>
<ul>
<li>$50,000 will be used to help us purchase our first location - an existing Laundromat in need of TLC.</li>
<li>$10,000 would be used for utility deposits.</li>
<li>$15,000 would be used for renovating our first Laundromat, and operational expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p> <br/>We've created amAZing Social Spin swag for contributors, partnered with local artists to create unique gifts and professionals to offer their services, and are ready to wash &amp; fold your laundry in exchange for your contribution.  <br/> <br/>We'll invest any funds raised into opening our first Laundromat. If we do not achieve our goal, we'll reassess our expansion timeline. If we overachieve our goal, we'll accelerate it! <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We all love feeling love. We all love being treated with dignity and respect. We have an opportunity to turn a service that people depend on into a space that creates memories. And, while we're at it, we'll empower our next generation.<br/> </p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our biggest risk is the decline of the Laundromat industry. The industry is declining not because the need is, but because Laundromats are being pushed out of communities to make way for development.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is capital. Purchasing an established Laundromat is expensive. Building a Laundromat from the ground up is very expensive!</p>
<p>We will find a way to launch these laundromats because they are essential for so many in our community and we have a way we can do it better.</p>
<p>We're committed to being a resource for people who depend on Laundromats. Our pie in the sky dream is to purchase land so that we can stay in communities that need us most.</p>
<p>We're committed to making wise capital investments, focused maximizing our resources for the betterment of our customers, our team members, and our community.</p>
<p>As an Arizona-based benefit corporation, we're committed to people over profit.</p>
<p>Your cash contribution is very appreciated.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Other ways to join our movement include</p>
<ul>
<li>Using our wash &amp; fold service. The more customers we have, the more opportunity youth we can train. </li>
<li>Share your time and talent with us, especially as we work to transform our first Laundromat.</li>

</div><p> </p></div>","Housed in funky old church in the Bayou Treme neighborhood, The Church of Yoga is currently being re-built for it's second coming aka REBIRTH!  
IMAGINE THIS: A SPACE WHERE YOU CAN PARTY AND PRAY.  
Make your entrance into Celebration Hall for epic live music classes, Zydeco dancing, gospel, vinyasa, weddings and more. On the other side, enter Contemplation Hall where mantra, meditation, restorative yoga and the study of philosophy awaits. Together this creates a powerful experience of awakening both physically and spiritually.
This is Laughing Lotus' fourth location, alongside New York City, Brooklyn and San Francisco. Laughing Lotus has over 100,000 yogis from all around the world visit the centers year. We have Continually been voted #1 Yoga Center in NYC by TimeOut Magazine and are so excited to expand our centers to New Orleans.
Cosmic Director Dana Trixie Flynn, has been practicing yoga for as long as she’s been going down to New Orleans...for 25 years. Her passion for celebration, music and togetherness are embodied by the spirit and people of New Orleans. The mood of service is alive within the community. Dana shares, ""I know my body was born in SF but my Soul is born right here in New Orleans.""
Check out her instagram @danatrixieflynn to see LOTUS LOVE in action! 

Dana was named “One of the 10 Influential Teachers Who Have Shaped Yoga in America” by Yoga Journal in 2016.

The Church requires a MAJOR reconstruction.

the project is to create the first house in Kyrgyzstan where travelers can
stay for rest for free, deepen to the local life, know more about the local
culture and people. We have chosen a special place for such home – it will be
created on the southern coast of Issyk-Kul, the second largest mountain lake in
the world, in a small village among Kyrgyz mountains. <br/></p><p>The Home for Travelers <b>is a non-commercial project</b>.
It's main goal is to draw the travelers’ interest to Kyrgyzstan and to give them
an opportunity to stay free in one of the most beautiful places of Central
Asia. We want this place to become a new sightseeing and attract more 
travelers to visit our small but amazing country. We want the travelers 
to know that Kyrgyzstan is a country open for new discoveries; a country
 with friendly people and unique culture; a country offering many 
ways for travelling by hitch-hiking, by bicycle, motocycle or car, by 
horse or by foot, and in the Tien-Shan mountains there are hundreds of 
amazing routes for hiking, skiing and snowboarding.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448433260/lzdgyn8snk0nx9fq7q3b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p><p>The Home for Travelers will also play an important role for local people
(we will tell about this later). We want to welcome new people in this house,
talk with them about adventures and other countries, sing songs near an open
fire, cook breakfasts together and celebrate holidays… <b>The Home for Travelers
will be the place with kind atmosphere and spirit of adventures and journeys. </b>This place will not be a ""free hotel"" for everyone desiring to stay at 
Issyk-Kul for free, the house doors will be open for those people only 
whose life is full of journeys and adventures. That is why the Home for 
Travelers project will not be a competitor to local guest houses and 
will not have an adverse impact on operation of the guest houses, as 
their main clients are the residents of Kyrgyzstan and guests from 
Kazakhstan and Russia, who arrive to Issyk-Kul for holidays on the lake 
shore. <br/></p>Our family will implement the project. We have
many friends who are ready to help us with rearranging and finishing of the
house and the adjacent territory. There are travelers, designers and artists
among them, and common people loving to create something new. We are
experienced in construction and finishing works, therefore we do not expect any
difficulties with creation of the Home for Travelers, if you support our
project.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448886760/ecsxhpys242ohfzzypx2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>If someone of

accommodation in the house within certain dates. Within 24 hours we will send

travelers.</span>
<br/><br/><span>When we are absent, the local family or our
friends living there will manage the house and welcome guests. The Home for
Travelers will be not the place where any vacationer at Issyk-Kul can receive
free accommodation and other bonuses. This will be the place for people who are
fond of adventures and travelling and the house’s doors will always be open for
such people.</span></p><p><span></span><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448462811/nq0a2pxkqrlrzisa4pln.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448692574/ph5hbjidzw2zwvy3drvh.png"" src="""" style=""width: 119.713px; height: 115px;""/></b></p><b><br/>Kyrgyzstan provides visa-free regime for 62 countries.</b> This facilitates significantly the access to the country.<br/><br/><br/><p><b><img align=""left"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448692253/ijmenrrzpuvthi4th3wc.png"" src="""" style=""width: 124px; height: 119px;""/></b></p><b>One can find here a unique culture and amazing

We would like you or your friends or friends of your friends or even the people unknown to you to discover the beautiful country of Kyrgyzstan by virtue of the idea which you can support now.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448697456/z39tgpj3wtjolf41hj1w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/></div>","The main idea of
the project is to create the first house in Kyrgyzstan where travelers can
stay for rest for free, deepen to the local life, know more about the local
culture and people. We have chosen a special place for such home – it will be
created on the southern coast of Issyk-Kul, the second largest mountain lake in
the world, in a small village among Kyrgyz mountains. The Home for Travelers is a non-commercial project.
It's main goal is to draw the travelers’ interest to Kyrgyzstan and to give them
an opportunity to stay free in one of the most beautiful places of Central
Asia. We want this place to become a new sightseeing and attract more 
travelers to visit our small but amazing country. We want the travelers 
to know that Kyrgyzstan is a country open for new discoveries; a country
 with friendly people and unique culture; a country offering many 
ways for travelling by hitch-hiking, by bicycle, motocycle or car, by 
horse or by foot, and in the Tien-Shan mountains there are hundreds of 
amazing routes for hiking, skiing and snowboarding.The Home for Travelers will also play an important role for local people
(we will tell about this later). We want to welcome new people in this house,
talk with them about adventures and other countries, sing songs near an open
fire, cook breakfasts together and celebrate holidays… The Home for Travelers
will be the place with kind atmosphere and spirit of adventures and journeys. This place will not be a ""free hotel"" for everyone desiring to stay at 
Issyk-Kul for free, the house doors will be open for those people only 
whose life is full of journeys and adventures. That is why the Home for 
Travelers project will not be a competitor to local guest houses and 
will not have an adverse impact on operation of the guest houses, as 
their main clients are the residents of Kyrgyzstan and guests from 
Kazakhstan and Russia, who arrive to Issyk-Kul for holidays on the lake 
shore. Our family will implement the project. We have
many friends who are ready to help us with rearranging and finishing of the
house and the adjacent territory. There are travelers, designers and artists
among them, and common people loving to create something new. We are
experienced in construction and finishing works, therefore we do not expect any
difficulties with creation of the Home for Travelers, if you support our
project.If someone of
you wants to be a volunteer and help us with the initial works (prior to
official opening of the Home for Travelers) – we will be glad to see you here
and cooperate with you  to establish this wonderful place. The Home for
Travelers will have own web-site, where any traveler can file an order for
accommodation in the house within certain dates. Within 24 hours we will send
our reply to the order received. We will also tell about the project at TripAdvisor, Couchsurfing and other web-resources being popular among
travelers.
When we are absent, the local family or our
friends living there will manage the house and welcome guests. The Home for
Travelers will be not the place where any vacationer at Issyk-Kul can receive
free accommodation and other bonuses. This will be the place for people who are
fond of adventures and travelling and the house’s doors will always be open for
such people.Kyrgyzstan provides visa-free regime for 62 countries. This facilitates significantly the access to the country.One can find here a unique culture and amazing
nature. For example, one can still meet nomads in the mountains here, and the
wild nature is more than meets the eye.Travelling here is cheap! Public transport here
is really cheap, hitch-hiking in the country is practiced, there are cheap eco-friendly products here… These are ideal conditions. It is safe here. For many years of contacts with
travelers from various countries, we have not heard of any case of somebody’s
assaulting on them. The project will
be implemented in several stages.

The first and the most important step is holding
a fundraising campaign to implement the project at Indiegogo. This is the
condition for the project existence. If you can support our project at this
stage, we will appreciate this.The second stage is awareness-raising. After
successful completion of the campaign at Indiegogo we are going to provide the
opportunity for our supporters to watch easily all the news on the project
promotion through social networks and the project web-site.The third stage includes purchasing of a convenient
house in Kadji-Sai and execution of all necessary formalities. We have three
appropriate houses in view. All of them locate at the same street and are for
saleThe forth stage is creative. We will rearrange
the house and its yard, make it to be a real Home for Travelers. Purchase,
delivery and installation of the furniture required will be performed at this
stage too. If you want to visit Kyrgyzstan and help us with this matter – we
will be glad!The fifth stage is the official opening of the
Home for Travelers! We plan to complete all the works by the end of May 2016,
and on the 1st of June 2016 to hold an official meeting.Our goal is to create a place where people from various countries will live together  in comfort conditions. And it doesn’t matter whether you will stay here overnight or for three months – you need to feel comfortable and cozy here. We tried to include into the Must Be List not only the necessary things, but also several additional pleasant bonuses. If you think that our house will miss something, please, inform us, and we will consider an opportunity to add something new to our list. The list of things available for travelers in the house:
Bedrooms

Kitchen

Big room with sofas and books

Places for reading or for making notes

Parking for bicycles (with lockers)

Car parking

Luggage room for big rucksacks 

Equipment rental 

Outdoor shower

Russian bath

WC (of course)

Orchard in the adjacent territory

Arbors for rest in the yard

Hammocks

Wi-Fi and PCs with Internet access
Our
 project will help travelers to become closer to the local community. It
 doesn’t matter, how much time you will spend here – one day, one week 
or one month – you can spend this time profitably for you and others.Familiarize with the life of local community: you can 
learn to bake national bread (lepeshka – flatbread) in a tandoor or to operate Soviet cars; learn to dry 
ecologically-safe fruits or to cook Kyrgyz ethnic foods; you can take part in national holidays!Share your knowledge: 
you can teach the villagers something new – speak your language, cook new
 foods, create the things of household use; you can tell your stories to
 children living here, and may be once someone of them will become a 
traveler like you!You can also help the elderly people. Many of 
them have small gardens. Every summer they pick fresh fruits and sell 
them in a small market in the village center. The money they gain from 
selling their products, help them to live till the next summer. You can assist them in picking fruits and they will very thankful for this!We are sure that establishment of the Home for Travelers will favorably affect the life of the whole village. Owners of small shops and elderly people selling fresh fruits will have more customers; taxi drivers transferring people from the village center to the beach for 40 cents per person will be more demanded; horse breeders arranging non-expensive riding trips to the adjacent mountains will find more clients amongst travelers.While we are absent, one local family will keep the Home for Travelers clean, welcome and accommodate guests in it. They will do this for fixed monthly fee (included into the project budget). Thus, while creating the Home for Travelers, we will also provide several job places for people from Kadji-Sai.The summer tourist season is very important for many people living in Issyk-Kul region, because this is the main period of earning money during the year.An important part of our project is aimed at support of children residing in the village. We have been visiting Kadji-Sai over 15 years, and we should note that the village returns to life: more and more children can be met in its streets today. This summer the village school was repaired and this is good news! We are going to build good playgrounds in various districts of the village because nowadays there is no really good playground for children here. We also plan to restore the football ground and purchase new sports equipment for schoolchildren. If we raise more funds than expected, we will buy for them new textbooks, drawing books, reading books in Russian and Kyrgyz languages.We will care of the environment of Kadji-Sai. Why? Because we love this locality and would like to preserve it for the future generations. Nowadays the most urgent environmental issue can be recycling of waste. And by means of our project we will be able to affect significantly the settlement of this issue. We will set waste containers in the village! This will help to keep wastes in one place till local municipal services arrange its removal to special waste deposit. Currently there are no such containers in the village, and used plastic bags and other wastes are easily wafted away with a big wind. Unfortunately.We will arrange collecting and recycling of waste! Generally, this relates to plastic wastes – bottles and bags, which are wafted away with the wind and accumulated along the village perimeter. We are also planning to remove the waste in the “Eastern Canyon” passing along the village on the East.We will give lectures in the local school concerning the importance of preserving the environment. We would like to tell the children why it is important to throw wastes to special waste cans for subsequent recycling. And also why it is necessary to keep the native village clean and maintain (and even raise vegetation in its territory. We have friends who can give such lectures excellently and they will assist us!Do you use social network services frequently? You can follow up the progress of our project in Facebook, Twitter and Instagram! We are going to register special accounts in these social network services so that you will be able to watch how the first travelers house in Central Asia is created with your assistance. Do you prefer to be aware of the most important things and events? We will send to your e-mail personalized messages with news and pictures on implementation of the project and success jointly achieved! Personal involvement. Would you like to visit us and help personally? That’s great! Since March 2016 you will get a chance to be personally involved in transformation of a standard rural house into a real house for travelers! We will be glad to everyone who wants to come and help to make repairs in the house or to build new facilities. We promise you unforgettable sunsets in Issyk-Kul and friendly atmosphere!This
project is from travelers and for travelers. The ultimate goal of this fundraising campaign  at
Indiegogo is to create something unique in Central Asia. To create a place where
every traveler will feel at home. As to the perks I offer you only the things I
will manage to provide as the organizer. The main part of the perks does not
suppose receiving material values, these are generally about new experience. I believe
sincerely that this is the real need for the people who used to take their
rucksacks and travel to new countries and new places. I will be glad to provide you with
accommodation in my home in Bishkek, help you to get the Home for Travelers
from Bishkek. I greatly appreciate your support and hope for a meeting with you
someday! Perks for you are the special cards for travelers, which will provide 
you with various bonuses when traveling to Kyrgyzstan. Choose any of the
 cards and you will receive it to e-mail within 24 hours from the date 
of your contribution! All cards are sent in both soft and printable 
copies. Therefore, you can use the card yourself or grant it to a close 
person who loves traveling! Attention! You can activate your card and receive a bonus till 2021, so that you have enough time for traveling to Kyrgyzstan!How to get the Home for Travelers (Kadji-Sai village) from Bishkek? You can get it by public transport or by taxi. The cost of public transport ticket is about 6 dollars; a taxi trip will cost from 8 dollars per seat or 50 dollars per car. How much time can one live in the Home for Travelers? It depends on you. If you are a true traveler, you can stay here for one hour or for three months – as you like. Will be any restrictions in the Home for Travelers? Some rules are to be observed in the Home, generally relating to the standards of behavior, ban on smoking inside the house, ban on drugs abuse, etc. We will also adhere to the project idea and try not to allow the project being used by common vacationers desiring to save their money and stay for free accommodation at Issyk-Kul. This house will have a special spirit – the spirit of adventures, travelling, new discoveries, and we will do our best to keep it. How much money do one need to stay in the Home for Travelers? Accommodation in the house will be absolutely free for all travelers. The rest is up to you. The kitchen in the house will be available for everyone, and if you cook yourself, the food costs will amount to 3-4 dollars per day. Why is it worth to support the Home for Travelers project? Because it is cool. Because it is kind. Because it is sincere. This project is dedicated to the people who love life; dreamers and travelers. Irrespectively of their social status, nationality or religion. We would like this project to come true. We would like you or your friends or friends of your friends or even the people unknown to you to discover the beautiful country of Kyrgyzstan by virtue of the idea which you can support now.",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3> <p>Hello! I'm Sarah AKA ""LifeOfCosplay"", and I've been an enthusiastic cosplayer for the last 6 years. I live in DC and have started doing volunteer costume work with children around the area. Some of my greatest passions are cosplay, volunteering, and children... so I've put them all together and started lending my talent to shelters and hospitals for children.</p>
<p>I've come in Disney Princess and hero costumes for themed events, but I've hit a snag: <b>kids don't know who my superheros are </b>(I have Rogue and Invisible Woman). This has led to some awkward conversations, and a lot less enthusiasm from them. Unlike the well-known hero volunteers, it's hard to reach these children, play with them, and teach them valuable lessons when they don't respond excitedly to you.</p>
<p>That's why I've started this campaign:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Raise enough to afford a quality Supergirl costume</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457024675/rcay2zhosgiwnsxhnkie.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>As you might know, buying a  costume can be quite expensive, and that's why I need help with this. I've already found a reasonably priced commissioner. I will purchase the wig from the same store I purchased Rogue's wig from.<br/></p>
<ul> <li>Helping me with this project will allow me to visit underprivileged children as their favorite superhero.</li>
</ul>

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What I need</p> <ul> <li>$850 will cover the  cost of the wig, shipping, the commission estimate price, and a little bit of wiggle room (because final costs are usually higher than estimates)</li>
</ul>

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The caretakers have told our volunteer group that the children act more respectful when our princess or hero squad is there.

<p>There are too many family recipes that are passed down generations but never shared with food lovers.

<p>It all started 5 years ago. My friend, 17 yo boy was a promising dancer, reaching he's goals, living a normal life, like every other person does. He was a break-dancer, until the moment he was diagnosed with ""damage to the nervous system"" illness. It means that all tissues in your body gradually stop functioning. He was forced to quit he's studies at collage, quit he's dancing career and proceed with heavy antibiotics treatment. Unfortunately, the treatment did not have any effect, and 2 years ago he could not walk by him self. At the moment he's not even able to type that message, that's why i'm doing it for him. He lives with he's parents, who take care of him.</p>
<p>The money is needed to start a new treatment, not any kind of operation or anything like that. The money is needed for therapeutic drugs, witch we hope, will help him to recover.</p>
<p>I wish i could give him money my self, but unfortunately i do not have that kind of money.</p>
<p>That's why a am asking for your help.</p>

</div><div> <p>We need only 1000€ to start the treatment.</p>
<p>Any help is invaluable contribution to he's recovery.<br/>All of this money will go for treatment. I do not keep anything to my self.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This new treatment promises that in 3 to 6 months time he will get better.<br/>I can only imagine how devastating it is for a young man who was used to active life, to be struggling in a wheel chair, not even able to take care of him self.<br/>If we could let him know, that society has not abandoned him and is trying to help, that would be really inspiring for him.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risks are that he will never recover and be forced to spend the rest of he's life in a wheelchair, that the treatment will have no effect on him.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Hello, my name is Ernest Pakers. I live in Riga, Latvia. I am trying to help my friend, Alex Lee, with treatment for he's illness.
It all started 5 years ago. My friend, 17 yo boy was a promising dancer, reaching he's goals, living a normal life, like every other person does. He was a break-dancer, until the moment he was diagnosed with ""damage to the nervous system"" illness. It means that all tissues in your body gradually stop functioning. He was forced to quit he's studies at collage, quit he's dancing career and proceed with heavy antibiotics treatment. Unfortunately, the treatment did not have any effect, and 2 years ago he could not walk by him self. At the moment he's not even able to type that message, that's why i'm doing it for him. He lives with he's parents, who take care of him.
The money is needed to start a new treatment, not any kind of operation or anything like that. The money is needed for therapeutic drugs, witch we hope, will help him to recover.
I wish i could give him money my self, but unfortunately i do not have that kind of money.
That's why a am asking for your help.
What We Need & What You Get
 We need only 1000€ to start the treatment.
Any help is invaluable contribution to he's recovery.All of this money will go for treatment. I do not keep anything to my self.   The Impact This new treatment promises that in 3 to 6 months time he will get better.I can only imagine how devastating it is for a young man who was used to active life, to be struggling in a wheel chair, not even able to take care of him self.If we could let him know, that society has not abandoned him and is trying to help, that would be really inspiring for him.
    Risks & Challenges The risks are that he will never recover and be forced to spend the rest of he's life in a wheelchair, that the treatment will have no effect on him.
Unfortunately, i do not know how it will turn out for him, but i'm doing all i can to bring attention to he's situation.

<p>Our goal at D20printing is to
bring high quality custom made shirts to the masses.  Small bands, indie artists, and anyone else
that can’t afford to buy a 500 print run from a major company will benefit from
our services.  We want to create a
company and culture for independent creatives to not only put their brand/work
on to top quality shirts and posters but also creates another avenue of income.
We plan to offer freelance programs to have these creatives work in
collaboration with us to expand what is possible in the realm of print and art
of all mediums. In addition to this we have a few ideas of our own we think
you’ll enjoy.</p>

<p>Brendan Haas, The Armed Forces Foundation (AFF) and The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) are raising money to move and reassemble a solar house donated by MIT students, to the AFF.  Brendan, is an awesome 9-year-old from Kingston, MA, began trading one of his toy soldiers in an effort to ""trade up"" to land, the home could eventually be placed.  After the house has been moved and reassembled, the Armed Forces Foundation will donate the house and land to a well deserving Veteran of our Armed Forces!!!</p>
<p>Here is a link to the house and the solar decathlon which inspired this house to be built <a href=""http://mit.edu/solardecathlon/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">http://mit.edu/solardecathlon/</a> </p>

<p>We understand that this is a huge undertaking, one that may whiles one time to accomplish but we are willing to give it a try. We believe in Brendan and although we were surprised he had reached his goal so quickly the last time, we have no doubt that with his determination he will be able to accomplish his new goal of trading for some land. We're thrilled to partner with the Armed Forces Foundation, which has agreed to help us check out the military service ofthe people who would like to be a recipient of the home. We will post information on how to apply for the house soon. Thanks so much to MIT and the Armed Forces Foundation for this unbelievable opportunity!

<p> K.I.W.I. is dedicated to reconnecting children &amp; youth to nature through adventure-play and mentoring in wild and natural outdoor spaces! Through year-round programming in Toronto's Rouge Valley Park, K.I.W.I., will take participants on a journey of ""discovery from the outside in.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a former lawyer, writer, and long-time volunteer with organizations concerned with the health and welfare of children, building and leading K.I.W.I. is a project that combines all of my passions and skills. I am also an outdoor athlete and have been hiking regularly in the beauty and wonder of Toronto's Rouge Valley for over a decade.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why support K.I.W.I. ?</strong> </p>
<p>There is a growing body of scholarly research that has linked a lack of play in natural spaces within child and youth populations to increases in diabetes, depression, obesity, poor academic performance, attention difficulties, as well as aggression and stress.  Collectively, these negative outcomes have been referred to by the best-selling author Richard Louv, in his book <em>Last Child in the Woods</em>, as ""Nature-Deficit Disorder"".  The research calls for one prescription: regular time spent playing in nature! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to the physical benefits of exercise, nature-play can help increase self-esteem, self-discipline, and provide benefits for psychological, emotional and spiritual well-being.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With your support, together we can make the Kids In the Woods Initiative a resounding success for children &amp; youth in Toronto as they go on a journey fulfilling our motto of  ""Discovery From the Outside In""!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How Can You Help?</strong></p>
<p>K.I.W.I.  is seeking $5000.00 in order to launch and fund our innovative programming.  In recognition of your financial support, your name will be listed on our website in our ""Tree of Discovery"" at one of three levels.  Your entry-level donation of $25 will make you one of our ""Budding"" donors, while a donation of $100 will make you a ""Spring Leaf"" donor, and a donation of $1000 will make you a ""Founding Branch"" donor.</p>

<p>The Veterans Affairs (VA) won’t cover the cost of service dogs assigned to our returning service members for PTSD treatment. The Department of Veterans Affairs will cover the costs of service dogs to help veterans with impaired vision, hearing or mobility, but <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">will not</span></strong> cover canines assigned for mental disabilities.</p>
<p> The costs for training, as well as travel expenses, veterinary bills, and equipment are <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">all</span></strong> funded by private donations. The costs of providing custom-trained dogs are about $20,000 each. The costs are so great only<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong> one of six</strong> </span>veterans get assigned a PTSD dogs because of funding.</p>
<p>Trainers say that for veterans suffering mental disabilities such as PTSD or Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), dogs can be trained to help avert panic attacks and wake them up as they enter a nightmare. The animals can be taught to remind veterans to take medications and alert them if they have left a burner lit on the stove.</p>
<p>One of the Veterans that had gotten assigned with a PTSD dog from the private donations indicated that ""At the VA, what they tend to do is pump you with medicine,""  he also said ""That’s not a solution to any issue like PTSD or anxiety. ""They just kind of numb you. I knew that wasn’t the right choice for me. I was looking for an alternative.""</p>
<p>Because he has been awarded the opportunity to have this life changing friend, this Veteran is regaining his ability to get out of the house and do things like go to the shopping mall, that he has avoided because of the anxiety and hyper vigilance that is common to combat-related PTSD. He sleeps more, functions better in the day, and interacts with more with other people rather than choosing to isolate himself. He’s lost 15 pounds because he is more active. That was progress he had not seen despite years of visiting VA psychiatrists and doctors who prescribed medications for his PTSD symptoms.</p>
<p>I don't understand how we can ask these young men and women to do the things that they are being asked to do and then when their job or task is completed and they have returned just tell them: ""Hey thanks for what you did, now you figure out how to deal with the aftermath of that request.""</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We need your help in getting the word out there to everyone you may know for this COLOSSAL opportunity to give back to these men and women in a very small financial contribution on your part ($1 or more) but a priceless lifetime gift for a chance to reintegrate into the mainstream life that people take for granted each and every day.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We asked them to do a job that most wouldn't be able to do. Now let’s give them the support they really need after they've returned. Help to give back to those who have already served and to those whom are already serving for the protection of our great nation.</p>

<h2>Hi Everyone.  I want to thank you for reading this.</h2>
<h3>I feel I owe an explanation as to why I'm pursuing this new venture called MainMeet... </h3>
<p>Please understand first, that MainMeet is in its infancy. That's why I'm appealing to you here for support and contributions. It's pretty easy.  If you like what I am saying here and want to give small businesses a way to stay in business, then just click the CONTRIBUTE NOW button below and follow the prompts.</p>
<p>MainMeet is a website that will help millions of small businesses everywhere effectively come together with their communities in a fun and engaging way that will help them stay in business.  <a href=""http://www.mainmeet.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mainmeet.com</a>  Take a look and remember, it's in the baby step phase.  That's why I need your help.</p>
<p>The big picture is that I'm taking almost 20 years of experience putting on large events and turning that into a ""MainMeet Movement"" of sorts. At each of my events, the unanimous winners, those who got the most results and success, were always those who practically hosted their own ""mini events"" right within their own exhibits. </p>
<div>What MainMeet is setting out to do is to encourage all small businesses to do something interactive and engaging AT their places of business, not unlike successful exhibitors at trade and consumer events (who are small businesses), in order to create an experience to elicit their true customers.

</div></div>","Hi Everyone.  I want to thank you for reading this.
I feel I owe an explanation as to why I'm pursuing this new venture called MainMeet... 
Please understand first, that MainMeet is in its infancy. That's why I'm appealing to you here for support and contributions. It's pretty easy.  If you like what I am saying here and want to give small businesses a way to stay in business, then just click the CONTRIBUTE NOW button below and follow the prompts.
MainMeet is a website that will help millions of small businesses everywhere effectively come together with their communities in a fun and engaging way that will help them stay in business.  www.mainmeet.com  Take a look and remember, it's in the baby step phase.  That's why I need your help.
The big picture is that I'm taking almost 20 years of experience putting on large events and turning that into a ""MainMeet Movement"" of sorts. At each of my events, the unanimous winners, those who got the most results and success, were always those who practically hosted their own ""mini events"" right within their own exhibits. 
What MainMeet is setting out to do is to encourage all small businesses to do something interactive and engaging AT their places of business, not unlike successful exhibitors at trade and consumer events (who are small businesses), in order to create an experience to elicit their true customers. This site will give them a simple and FREE platform to promote in-store gatherings and events, and invite communities out to support their own local businesses.
The BIG DIFFERENCE with this venture is that I want to use this business as a vehicle to make as many business owners lives better and more fruitful as possible.  That's why we give 50-100% of all transactions on the site to small businesses everywhere to help them stay in business. 
I think that the overall state of affairs would be very different if more successful companies went beyond token donations or charitable affiliations for the sake of publicity, and actually created programs that incentivized businesses to succeed.The impact would be huge. I could go on... 
However, for anyone who knows me, they know I am generous by nature. If you don't know me, then now you know this about me. I like to make people happy. It makes me happy. I just want to be able to help as many entrepreneurs and businesses as I can so that they do not have to go through the stress and heartache of going under. 
 
So in this extremely early stage, please know that my little team and I are working very hard to lay all the groundwork necessary so that in the future, MainMeet can help to change the course in a positive direction for businesses everywhere. 
 
We need to hire a few more very talented people to take MainMeet to a global stage to impact and help as many people as we can, so please give what you can so that we can take control over the destiny of businesses, and more importantly, help the people behind the businesses.
 
Thank you-
Stacy

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Libra House is an emergency shelter for women, with or without children, who are experiencing relationship violence.  Libra House opened in December 1985.  We are located in Labrador, Canada.</p>
<p>- We strive to provide support and shelter to women and children who are experiencing violence or abuse. </p>
<p>-We provide temporary crisis shelter and related services in a cooperative/communal living arrangement for women and children who are victims of violence. </p>
<p>- We assist in the development and improvement of services and facilities to meet the needs of women and children. </p>
<p>- We work to empower women to make their own decisions for themselves and their children.</p>
<p>This Project will see the building of a brand new shelter for us to provide our programs and services for women and children.  For 27 years we have been operating from a building that is far too small for us to be able to do our work effectively.  We need a space that is safe and secure, accessible, confidential and able to create an environment that is conducive to healing from abuse.  For the past 4 years we have been fund raising to make this project a reality and we are now ready to start building.</p>
<p>But we just have enough funds to get the building started.  We still need to raise $100,000 to help us make this an awesome place that includes paving, some storage sheds, landscaping, a playground for children and maybe even a garden for the residence. </p>
<p>This is where we need YOUR help.  We hope to raise $10,000 through Indiegogo towards creating a wonderful outdoor space for our residents and their children.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is what we hope to do:</p>
<p>Building a new shelter is important. But just as important is building a safe and beautiful outdoor area for the women and children who come to us for support.  We want to build a play area for the children, plant some trees and maybe even a flower or vegetable garden for the women.  The more funds we are able to raise the more beautiful we will be able to make our space.</p>
<p>We hope to be able to raise $10,000.00 for this part of the project.  But whatever we are able to raise no matter how much it is will go directly to the landscaping project.</p>
<p>Donors will receive a charitable receipt, some awesome Libra House swag as well a shout-out on our fund raising page: <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/LibraHouseShelter</a></p>
<p>A local artist has written and recorded a song called ""Be Strong Friend' for Libra House.  That song is available for download at <a href=""http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/jacindabealsband"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/jacindabealsband</a>  and it is also available on iTunes.  Some donors may receive a gift of a free download for their contribution.</p>
<p>We will also be adding some surprise perks thrroughout the campaign so keep checking in.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
For almost 27 years we have been offering services to women and children in our Community.  On average we provide emergency shelter to 82 families per year.  We also take hundreds of phone calls each year on our 24-hour crisis line.  Along with our partners in our Community and Region we take pride in the aniti-violence work we do in Labrador.</div>

<p>Dreyma means to Dream, in Icelandic and my goal with the line has always been about embracing the ritual of going to sleep, being asleep and waking up.  First I started by developing a bath and body product line, which focused on winding down from a stressful day with a great bath and a nice candle.

<p>Transplanting Traditions is a vocational agricultural program that works with over 150 refugee adults and children to build <strong>economically viable, environmentally sound, and socially sustainable local agricultural business opportunities for refugees </strong>living in North Carolina.  This project was started in 2007 by The Orange County Partnership for Young Children as a community garden project and expanded into a farm in 2010.The farm is a partnership project with Triangle Land Conservancy and  is located at their 269 acre Irvin Farm.  This unique partnership helps provide a permanently protected space for this program</p>
<p>Transplanting Traditions provides growing space for each family on its 4 acre farm.  In addition, farmers attend agricultural, business and marketing workshops.  We provide over<strong> 72 on-farm workshops and 32 hours of classroom training per year</strong>!  Farmers grow over 20 different crops native to their tropical home countries and each year the farm becomes a tropical paradise of <strong>turmeric, ginger, snake gourd, bitter melon, hibiscus</strong>and so much more.  Farmers participate in marketing their produce through local farmer's markets, CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) and restaurant sales.</p>
<p>In addition the farm is an important <strong>community space</strong> for refugees to learn, share ideas and preserve cultural agricultural heritage while simultaneously transitioning to their new lives in N.C.</p>

<p>The reason our health care costs are through the ceiling is because of the nuclear fallout of the golden-era of the pharmaceutical empire. Now if we can peel that cold dead grip off our throats, you’ll find a preventative holistic, not for profit medical system, slowly surfacing for air. This campaign represents a butterfly effect towards meeting the federal efforts in the middle. Bureaucrats at least understand the crippling effect that our health care system has on the economy, but cannot possibly write any perfect form of legislation that will enact a cascading effect from the top down that will address all the intrinsic issues. If anything, the Patient Protection Act at best, is unknowingly a hallucinogenic last ditch effort before we yield to a universal health care system. For a full scope explanation of this visit: <a href=""http://limetreeholisticadvocacy.com/full-scope/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://limetreeholisticadvocacy.com/full-scope/</a>  </p>
<p>If you are new to the holistic healing realm, welcome; I hope you never have to find out the hard way that any combination of naturopathic, acupuncture &amp; oriental medicine, and chiropractic is far less expensive and less invasive than a path of drugging, steroids, and an eventual path to surgery and some level of impairment (in non-emergency situations.) The newest fascinations in quantum physics prove on multiple levels the basis for the body’s innate genius to heal (<em>Life Force: The Scientific Basis</em> by Claude Swanson, Ph.D. <a href=""http://youtu.be/DEqt8ZhMwJo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://youtu.be/DEqt8ZhMwJo</a> )</p>
<p>Hence, we get to meet vicariously through Indiegogo, I’m Keirsten, the founder of Lime Tree Holistic Health Care Advocacy. I’m implementing Co-Op Advertising opportunities for holistic healers, building provider referral interchanges, and building annual calendar based community outreach programs. These strategies are designed to stretch the limited marketing budget of naturopaths, acupuncturists and chiropractors. Additionally, I teach these practitioners how to maintain the right perspective of a patient’s need to connect with them before their health is decimated. Based upon psychology and limited resources of the average patient, we are creating the groundwork of a not for profit system that is worth paying for because it keeps you well, as opposed to a current system which profits from us being sick.

<h3><strong> </strong></h3></div>","Summary
The reason our health care costs are through the ceiling is because of the nuclear fallout of the golden-era of the pharmaceutical empire. Now if we can peel that cold dead grip off our throats, you’ll find a preventative holistic, not for profit medical system, slowly surfacing for air. This campaign represents a butterfly effect towards meeting the federal efforts in the middle. Bureaucrats at least understand the crippling effect that our health care system has on the economy, but cannot possibly write any perfect form of legislation that will enact a cascading effect from the top down that will address all the intrinsic issues. If anything, the Patient Protection Act at best, is unknowingly a hallucinogenic last ditch effort before we yield to a universal health care system. For a full scope explanation of this visit: http://limetreeholisticadvocacy.com/full-scope/  
If you are new to the holistic healing realm, welcome; I hope you never have to find out the hard way that any combination of naturopathic, acupuncture & oriental medicine, and chiropractic is far less expensive and less invasive than a path of drugging, steroids, and an eventual path to surgery and some level of impairment (in non-emergency situations.) The newest fascinations in quantum physics prove on multiple levels the basis for the body’s innate genius to heal (Life Force: The Scientific Basis by Claude Swanson, Ph.D. http://youtu.be/DEqt8ZhMwJo )
Hence, we get to meet vicariously through Indiegogo, I’m Keirsten, the founder of Lime Tree Holistic Health Care Advocacy. I’m implementing Co-Op Advertising opportunities for holistic healers, building provider referral interchanges, and building annual calendar based community outreach programs. These strategies are designed to stretch the limited marketing budget of naturopaths, acupuncturists and chiropractors. Additionally, I teach these practitioners how to maintain the right perspective of a patient’s need to connect with them before their health is decimated. Based upon psychology and limited resources of the average patient, we are creating the groundwork of a not for profit system that is worth paying for because it keeps you well, as opposed to a current system which profits from us being sick.

<h3>The Community Splash</h3>
<p>My name is Hannah Thomas; I am a senior member of The Ottawa Swim Club. I am currently organizing the first ever Ottawa Swim Club Community Splash. The Ottawa Swim Club Community Splash would expose community members of all ages to the health benefits, safety, and fun that swimming can build.  Everyday ten Americans die of accidental drowning. As member of a swim team, a lifeguard, and a swim lessons instructor this statistic scares me. This event will spread awareness about the seriousness of learning to swim and enjoying the water. If even one life is saved it would be an acomplishment.</p>
<h3>What we Need</h3>
<p>In order to fund this event we are hoping to raise $1000. This is the break down of where the funds will go.</p>
<p>$300- Rental Fee for City Pool</p>
<p>$200- Radio and Newspaper Ads</p>
<p>$500- Prizes for Swimming Events (Free Membership to Swim Team, Free Swim Pass, Free Swimming Lessons, Swimming Gear, t-shirts, and Ottawa Swag)</p>
<p>As part of the Event we are holding community races for swimmers of all ages as well as competitions including the best belly flop and cannon ball.</p>
<p>Sponsors would receive autographed pictures of the champion youth swimmers as well as their name or business name on the back of t-shirts.</p>
<p>If the financial goal is not met, we will charge a small admission to the event of $1. The donations would instead go to the prizes and not the rental fee.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donation would directly affect the youth of my community. Can you think of an easier way to save so many lives?</p>
</div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you do not want to contribute financially, please help by spreading the word! Use the Ingiegogo share tools!</p>

<p>Pie Chicks is a new wholesale bakery on the island of Martha’s Vineyard, which is where I live.</p>
<p>I’ve been baking my whole life and whenever I bring a pie to a potluck or a party people say to me “You should do this for a living”.  So I’m going to.  And I'd love to have your help.</p>
<p>In order for this to really work I need equipment like mixers and refrigerators and bowls and spatulas and pans and stuff that helps me make really good pie.</p>
<p>And you can contribute to my success by being a part of my Pie chicks campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Think of it as investing in your future happiness.</strong></p>
<p>Purchasing two large commercial mixers, a walk in fridge, a refrigerator and a few chest freezers costs about $12,000.  I have found some really great used equipment and I’m hoping to be able to pay off a chunk of this initial capital investment so that my business can really flourish and I can stay focused on the important stuff—like baking really really good pies.</p>
<p>And when you contribute to my campaign you get pie, so it’s really a win win.  Unless you don’t like pie, but I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who doesn’t like pie.  And for those of you who are gluten-free--I will happily substitute a Gluten-Free Crisp in place of any delivered pie.  And for all of my friends, family and fans in the Cleveland area:  I will be home for the holidays and will gladly bake and deliver pies to you then.  If you can wait that long!  I promise you--it's worth it.</p>
<p>And if you really really love pie (like I do) you can come to pie class or have a pie party at your home for all of your friends.  You can even get a pie named after you.  Think of all the pie possibilities!</p>
<p>Anything I reach over my goal will go towards helping me hire a pie helper for this summer season.  Because the world definitely needs more Pie Chicks.  Anything I raise under my goal will help me to pay for my equipment.</p>
<p>I’m pretty certain that pie can save the world.  I’ve written a little piece (piece, get it?) about Saving the World One Pie at a Time.  You can find it on my website at <a href=""http://www.piechicks.com/save-the-world.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.piechicks.com/save-the-world.html</a></p>
<p>My new business is really exciting for me because it lets me combine my education (I have a business degree from Ohio State--GO BUCKS!) and work experience (I spent 7 years at The FARM Institute as the Business Manager and then as the Development Director) and my passion which is baking.  So I’m thrilled to be at this point in my life where I’m ready to take a risk...and make lots of pie for all of you to enjoy!</p>
<p>I’d love your help in spreading the word and getting more pie out into the world.  Please use the easy share tools on Indiegogo and Facebook.  I appreciate your support and generosity.</p>

<p>Fun, Fitness, Education, Relaxation, and Unity. Our goal is to bring the community together through enriching leisure time experiences, while offering a localized family help center. A generalized description for 3 of our departments have been outlined, although, we plan to offer many more programs.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The facility will offer safe, family friendly fun, with an educational twist. Through experience and entertainment, funds will be accumulated, and used for various programs which give back to the community.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Arts &amp; Crafts Department: </strong>With art programs being eliminated from public schools due to budget cuts, and with overworked and underfinanced parents unable to provide their children with private art lessons, we face a future of adults without strong creativity, innovation and problem-solving skills. The arts promote, encourage and provide a safe, exploring experience for children to practice skills that are vital to the rest of their education. How can a child solve a complex scientific problem without the ability to think creatively and be innovative? The effect of art on children cannot be denied or ignored.</li>
<li>
<strong>Food &amp; Nutrition Department:</strong> Children love few things better than playing with food. Having permission to do it is even more exciting. Crafts with food are entertaining and yummy; edible crafts allow young kids to be creative with food in ways they never thought of. Craft time for kids can be fun and tasty with these edible arts and crafts projects. Kids will have a great time playing with their food and then eating their art. These projects can be fun at home or at school, and can even make good party activities.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fitness &amp; Outdoor Activities: </strong>Kids outdoor activities can be a great way to keep your children physically fit  and away from the video games. From scavenger hunts to chasing games and  building projects, there are plenty of ways to keep your children engaged when  they are outside. Playing outdoors can encourage children to become more active, a key point in battling childhood obesity. When children have activities to do outside that they enjoy doing, they are more likely to want to stay outside longer.</li>

</ul></div>","What We Will Offer
Fun, Fitness, Education, Relaxation, and Unity. Our goal is to bring the community together through enriching leisure time experiences, while offering a localized family help center. A generalized description for 3 of our departments have been outlined, although, we plan to offer many more programs.
The Impact
The facility will offer safe, family friendly fun, with an educational twist. Through experience and entertainment, funds will be accumulated, and used for various programs which give back to the community.


Arts & Crafts Department: With art programs being eliminated from public schools due to budget cuts, and with overworked and underfinanced parents unable to provide their children with private art lessons, we face a future of adults without strong creativity, innovation and problem-solving skills. The arts promote, encourage and provide a safe, exploring experience for children to practice skills that are vital to the rest of their education. How can a child solve a complex scientific problem without the ability to think creatively and be innovative? The effect of art on children cannot be denied or ignored.

Food & Nutrition Department: Children love few things better than playing with food. Having permission to do it is even more exciting. Crafts with food are entertaining and yummy; edible crafts allow young kids to be creative with food in ways they never thought of. Craft time for kids can be fun and tasty with these edible arts and crafts projects. Kids will have a great time playing with their food and then eating their art. These projects can be fun at home or at school, and can even make good party activities.

Fitness & Outdoor Activities: Kids outdoor activities can be a great way to keep your children physically fit  and away from the video games. From scavenger hunts to chasing games and  building projects, there are plenty of ways to keep your children engaged when  they are outside. Playing outdoors can encourage children to become more active, a key point in battling childhood obesity.

<h3>About Salvation Botanicals</h3>
<p>We here at Salvation Botanicals believe in the amazing power of hemp. Many studies are showing the vast medical benefits of hemp and we are super excited to bring a range of healthy hemp teas to market. We have blends of tea that you will never have heard of, that taste fantastic and that also have medicinal properties, using various superfoods and herbal extracts.</p>
<p>Salvation Botanicals is located in sunny downtown <strong>Nanaimo BC</strong>, Canada. We also make luxury herbal organic dark chocolates, with crazy ingredients, like blue lotus and goji berry, that taste fabulous!</p>
<p>We are at that point in the business where we have to sell our tea in tea bags and for that we need a machine. The machine costs around $15,000 plus delivery costs. We also need printing materials and supplies.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal, we will be able to really penetrate the tea market in Canada and bring the natural health benefits of hemp ( combined with superfoods) to tea drinkers nationwide!</p>
<p>We have encouraging feedback from local grocery stores that will stock our teas and we can create a job or two here in Nanaimo when we get the machine running.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our hope is to bring the world of hemp to tea drinkers the world over. This means we have to buy a tea bagging machine that costs approximately $15,000, plus delivery, ($2,000), labelling supplies, and so on, for a total of $20,000.  We also need approximatley $5,000 for marketing, designs and planning for things like tea bag labels, box designs and outer bag design. We already have our warehouse, supply chain, sales and marketing plan and staff. </p>
<p>We are able to offer to every diamond contributor a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Every person who contributes $1,000 to our hemp stem tea bagging machine, will receive a one day ski pass at Whister-Blackcomb and a FULL DAY SNOWBOARDING OR SKIING with Jeremy, our resident creative genius, creator of the teas and chocolates we make here, or a whale watching tour off the coast of Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>A DOUBLE DIAMOND contributor who contributes $5,000 will get a day heli-skiing  high above the treeline at Whistler-Blackcomb, in beautiful BC, Canada, or at a heli-ski operator nearer you, or a Whale watching weekend off the coast of Vancouver Island and join us for our launch party, set for MAY, 2013. </p>
<p>If we don't raise all the necessary funds for this hemp tea initiative, we will still use all the money raised to buy that amazing machine.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What This Means</h3>
<p>Hemp is now being recognised as a healthy superfood. Raw Hemp provides a broad spectrum of health benefits, including weight loss, increased and sustained energy, lowered cholesterol and blood pressure, reduced inflammation improvement in circulation, boosted immune system and natural blood sugar level control, among others. We believe that we can spread the word and increase the appeal of hemp to people around the word and that knowledge will help make the world a better, gentler place.</p>
<p>All contiributors will be able to enjoy all the flavours and different styles of teas that we make. Then you can tell your friends and family and spread the word on the many benefits of imbibing in these tasty teas.</p>
<p>By contributing, you give us the opportunity to serve you and recognise you for making the world of difference that hemp makes. We will send you your tea and include some bonus chocolates that we have just developed. These contain rare and unusual ingredients sourced from around the world too.</p>
<p>Once we are able to be self sufficient making and selling tea, we plan on developing a whole range of innovative hemp based concentrates and extracts that will be notable for raising the profile of hemp as a health choice in Canada.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We completely understand that some of you don't have much money to contribute. We are always looking for friends to be a part of our vision, who are excited to spread the word of how we can use hemp for our health. If you want to help, drop us a line, like us on facebook, or help us spread the word the word by TWEETing, reposting, email and share with people you know.

<h3>$51,761. THAT is the total amount, between our two indiegogo fundraisers, that you all were able to raise in a mere FIVE days... FIVE days!!!! Because you and others like you chose to give back, we have been able to serve 7,394 free, hot meals to people in New York and New Jersey who have no power and, in some of the worst cases, no homes.</h3>
<h3>You all are incredible and from the very bottoms of our hearts, we thank you for your incredible generosity.</h3>
<h3>
<br/>Today, ten days after Super Storm Sandy struck, many are still living without lights and heat so we are continuing to serve via our partnership with The NYC Mayor's Fund to Advance NYC and several corporate sponsors. If you would still like to help bring hot meals to NY-ers, you can donate to the Mayors Fund and ask them to <span class=""il"">earmark</span> the money for food truck emergency outreach.</h3>
<h3>Thank you and take care. </h3>
<h3> ____</h3>
<strong>Overview</strong>
<p>In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the <a href=""http://www.nycfoodtrucks.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New York City Food Truck Association</a> (NYCFTA) worked with <a href=""http://www.jetblue.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jetblue</a> to deliver over 20,000 meals to our neighbors in NY and NJ without power.  Inspired, we decided to reach out to the community to keep the outreach going in the most severely affected areas on the coast of Staten Island, Queens, &amp; Brooklyn. In just two days, the global community responded in great force and we were able to raise over $27,000, more than TRIPLING the amount we  anticipated. We are incredibly thankful and want to keep the momentum going as there are still thousands without power.</p>
<p>Here is how we've helped on the ground so far:</p>
<p>On Friday 11/2, Jetblue gave out hot meals to 11k people without power in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn via 12 sponsored trucks.  </p>
<p>On Saturday 11/3, Jetblue distributed hot meals to 10k people in Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Hoboken, NJ, via 11 sponsored 11 trucks.</p>
<p>On Sunday 11/4 Jetblue distributed hot meals to 4k people in the Rockaways via 4 food trucks. NYC Food Truck Association raised money so fast from people like you via our <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/NYCFoodTrucksSandy?a=1705731"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">last promotion</a>, we were able to get 2 trucks out to deliver 1k more meals the same day.  </p>
<p>On Monday 11/5, we have <a href=""http://www.nycfoodtrucks.org/2012/11/mon-nov-5th-foodtruck-outreach-efforts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">eight trucks out</a> to distribute hot meals to 3k people in Staten Island, the Rockaways, and Redhook.</p>
<p>Many individuals and businesses have written and asked if it is still possible to donate... and the answer is: Yes you can! And we will put your money to use immediately getting hot meals to those who need them.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Food trucks are small businesses that are run by resourceful and caring entrepreneurs.  They have the desire and infrastructure to help, but not the resources to do as much as they might like.  Working with sponsors and the larger community helps us make a larger impact in helping those who are still suffering from the storm.  We are looking for sponsorships to pay for food and fuel for food trucks to go out and serve communities in NYC that were most affected by Super Storm Sandy. </p>
<ul>
<li>A hot meal from a food truck costs about $7 </li>
<li>We are hoping to raise $7,000 to distribute 1,000 meals tomorrow</li>
<li>All the money will go towards food and fuel for food trucks to sponsor outreach (minus the administrative costs of indiegogo)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we cannot raise the full amount we will simply put the money raised towards food and fuel for trucks to donate what they can</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Depending on the amount you contribute you can get all sorts of fun goodies like free high-fives from your favorite truck, a social media shout out as a contributor, or even the ability to choose your favorite NYCFTA truck to serve in an affected communuity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many communities around NYC have been entirely destroyed by Super Storm Sandy.  A hot meal is a small way to help those who have lost power, water, telephone access, and possibly even their home have a moment of comfort.</p>
<ul>
<li>We can move fast and get help out to those who need it quickly.</li>
<li>We have been running outreach to affected communities for the past two days and have delivered more than 20,000 hot meals to those in need.  </li>
<li>Just check @nycfoodtruck for all the positive reports from the field about how this outreach has been received so far in areas affected by Sandy</li>

<p>In the last week of Feb. 2013 I went in the hospital with an obstructed bowel.  It turned out the obstruction was a couple of cancerous leisions.  They removed the affected portion of the bowel but they didn't know where the cancer arose from.  So my oncologist has recommended I get chemo and I start on April 3rd.  I'm looking at six months of chemo which means six months of nausea, drugs, and anxiety.  I have no idea how I am going to react to the drugs and the treatment in general, but I do know that I need something to look forward to so that I can get through this ordeal better.  My plan is to take my long time girlfriend on a vacation, hopefully to the beach, after I finish with the chemo.  She's been indispensible in this ordeal and frankly I could not have made it this far without her, so I want to do something nice for her and for me for having to go through all this.</p>
<p>I figure a nice condo at Atlantic Beach, NC is going to cost around $800 to $900 a week and we'll need to money for groceries.  I'm already on a very fixed income and what little disposable income I have I am using to pay off the various medical bills that Medicare doesn't cover.  So I need to find another source of funds to pay for this vacation, that's where you come in.  If you can donate anything at all to help me go on this much needed trip to the beach then I'm eternally grateful.  Any donation is appreciated and if you donate $10 I'll send you a sticker from my line of vintage stickers.  If you donate $20 you get a vintage line sticker and a sticker from my linocut collection.  If you donate $50, you get the stickers and an original illustration.  If you donate $75 you get the stickers, an illustration, and an 8"" x 10"" print of one of my artsy photos.  </p>
<p>Iknow many others have it worse than me but I really need something to look forward to during all these months of chemo and recovery from getting part of my bowel removed.  And I want to do something nice for my hardworking girlfriend.  So, please, if you can spare it, toss me a few bucks and help me go on vacation in the fall after I get done with chemo.</p>

They also carry oils, incense, perfumes, scented sprays,baths,soaps,floor washes, and other such items.Botánicas can be found in any United States city, though most commonly those with ties to the Caribbean. The number of botánicas found outside of New York and Miami has grown tremendously in the last ten years.The name botánica is Spanish and translates as ""botany"" or ""plant"" store, referring to these establishments' function as dispensaries of medicinal herbs.

<h3>About Amy and Derek</h3>
<p>When we first got married back in 2004, we took a little time to enjoy our new life together, and then, like many newly-married couples, decided a year or so later that we were ready to start our family!  We both had baby-fever.  We were so excited about the start of this journey to parenthood.  But as time dragged on, we started to get concerned.  We never dreamed it would be such a challenge. </p>
<p>So we went to doctors who kept assuring they could see nothing that was wrong, and that it would happen.  We were patient, listened to everyone's advice, and waited.  But it didn't happen.  Our doctor agreed to try clomid to up our chances.  And after this first fertility treatment, it finally happened!  We were overjoyed!  But the joy was short-lived.  Amy suffered an ectopic pregnancy which resulted in some long-term damage.</p>
<p>Thus began a five-year journey filled with doctor appointments, shots, surgeries, miscarriages, fertility treatments, medical bills, and many highs and lows.  It's been a tough road emotionally and financially.  But through it all we've been surrounded by many supportive friends and family members, and have stayed strong and have stayed hopeful that this will happen one way or another.  </p>
<p>And by being open about our struggles, we have even been able to share what we've learned and provide guidance and support to many friends and friends-of-friends who have dealt with their own infertility struggles.  And happily, many of their journeys have ended in success!</p>
<p>Recently, we started exploring new options and new doctors.  After much research and many interviews we are finally working with a new doctor and have a new plan, and we really do believe that this next step on our journey will be a successful one!</p>

<h3>About the Fundraising Effort</h3>
<p>We are doing all we can to raise the resources needed for this next phase of our journey, and we are reaching out to friends, family and well-wishers to raise a portion of the money through fundraising so we can more quickly reach our goal of becoming parents and having a family of our own. </p>
<p>We've set a goal for the site of $7,500.  The total cost of our next step will be approximately $20,000, including in-vitro fertilization costs, medications, and doctor fees.  All contributions will help us move closer to our goal!  </p>

<p>I'm Larry Mattson, president of the board of the new Terra Sol Sports Alliance. In the summer of 2012, a group of soccer-crazed, civic-minded friends and I got together to build a soccer complex in the Yakima Valley. We recently elected a board and selected Terra Sol Sports Alliance as our name.</p>
<p>Why the name? We lead the nation in cherries, apples, hops; we average 300 days of sun per year; and we welcome all soccer clubs and programs, as well as soccer-compatible sports like lacrosse, rugby, and football.</p>
<p>Soccer is incredibly popular here in the Valley. So much so that many of our facilities are over-used, and the field conditions show it. Our vision is to ""<em>provide a world class soccer facility that welcomes all sports, all teams and all players to participate in physical activity in a safe and friendly atmosphere.""</em></p>
<p>Why soccer, why here, and why now?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because soccer brings together people of different cultures like few sports can.</li>
<li>Because youth obesity is on the rise and we need kids to get up and get active.</li>
<li>Because gangs are an attractive option to kids who have no outlet for their energy and we need after-school sports programs.</li>
</ul><p>Your contribution lays the foundation for an enduring community asset, allowing us to finalize our non-profit status. We are drafting business and strategic plans to guide our work. We'll select a location as those plans are finalized, by working with local municipalities and private landowners.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In Phase 1, we are raising $5,000 in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Submit and finalize our state and federal 501(c)3 non-profit charitable organization paperwork</li>
<li>Finalize our logo to develop stationery and initial marketing materials (think t-shirts, soccer balls, and caps)</li>
<li>Develop our website in order to get the word out and keep our friends informed of our progress</li>
</ul><p>If we don't reach our goal, the funds will be used to pay as much of the state and federal fees as possible.</p>
<p>In Phase 2, we'll be seeking funding for designing the complex. We anticipate this phase to cost $75,000-$100,000.</p>
<p>Phase 3 is our capital campaign, likely between $10 and $20 million. This will fund development costs. Any remaining funds will be set aside in a foundation. Foundation funds will be used primarily to enhance youth access to soccer and complementary sports such as lacrosse, field hockey, and rugby.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Yakima makes sense for a soccer complex:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equal travel time from the metro Seattle, Spokane, and Vancouver areas</li>
<li>A warm, welcoming, sports-friendly community</li>
<li>A growing community that already hosts two sold-out soccer tournaments every summer (Yak Attack; Mid-Summer Classic).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p><strong>Dear Friends, Family &amp; Colleagues,</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>It only feels right to re-introduce myself, although most you know me well. But for those who don’t, my name is Lauren Brown Jarvis. I’m a writer, content creator and lover of all things related to technology and communications. I blog regularly on the intersection of women and technology, as well as, my own adventures at <a href=""http://www.digitaldoyennes.com."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.digitaldoyennes.com.</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You’re probably not familiar with the word “doyenne”. It’s a french word that quite simply references a woman who is either senior in rank, or the best at what she does. It’s a title I’ve donned proudly since I launched the concept in April of 2011, when I hosted, “Digital Doyennes: Wisdom from the Women Who Lead in Social Media &amp; Digital Innovation.” Hosting this event was the pinnacle of my career in the digital space. </p>
<p> I feel confident the next peak I will scale will be that of making my way to Kampala, Uganda to be a presenter at TEDxKiraTownWomen. I’ll be speaking on the theme “The Space in Between”. The space I’ll be exploring is between social and media and how women fit in between.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Uganda is one of the world's poorest nations, with a majority of its citizens living on less than $1.25/day. Most of the impoverished are rural women. Rural women in Uganda often work much harder than their male counterparts, overseeing agricultural tasks and caring for their families, obtaining food, water, firewood. There is a desire on their parts to be entrepreneurial, and this is not just for rural women, but all Ugandan women. It is therefore of utmost importance that I speak to all the ways new, digital and social media are making commerce and business ownership possible for women all over the globe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>This is where I need your help. </em></strong>In order to be able to share some insight with the women of Uganda, I must first raise the funds to get there.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Two nights of my accommodations are being covered by the TEDxKiraTownWomen organizers. However, my airfare and accompanying travel expenses are not. While I will only be speaking on one day, Saturday, December 1, 2012, this is a tremendous opportunity for me to also make my first visit to the “Motherland” and my hope is that while there, I will get to explore the “Pearl of Africa” as Uganda is often called.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where The Money Is Going:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Roundtrip Airfare to Entebbe, Uganda from Atlanta, Georgia </li>
<li>Three night accommodations at the Prestige Apartments in Kampala </li>
<li>Visa Entry Fees to Uganda </li>
<li>Taxi fares to, from airport, TEDxKiraTownWomen et al.</li>
<li>Meals!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Happens If I Exceed My Goal:</strong></p>
<p>Any dollars raised outside of my expenses will be donated to the non-profit, Ugandan American Partnership Organization’s (UAPO) Akola Project. The Akola Project is an economic development initiative that helps rural Ugandan women generate sustainable income for themselves and their families. I was introduced to UAPO through founder Brittany Merrill. Brittany has dedicated her career to serving rural women of Uganda and and I am moved to support this effort through her work.</p>

</div></div>","Dear Friends, Family & Colleagues,
 
It only feels right to re-introduce myself, although most you know me well. But for those who don’t, my name is Lauren Brown Jarvis. I’m a writer, content creator and lover of all things related to technology and communications. I blog regularly on the intersection of women and technology, as well as, my own adventures at www.digitaldoyennes.com.
 
You’re probably not familiar with the word “doyenne”. It’s a french word that quite simply references a woman who is either senior in rank, or the best at what she does. It’s a title I’ve donned proudly since I launched the concept in April of 2011, when I hosted, “Digital Doyennes: Wisdom from the Women Who Lead in Social Media & Digital Innovation.” Hosting this event was the pinnacle of my career in the digital space. 
 I feel confident the next peak I will scale will be that of making my way to Kampala, Uganda to be a presenter at TEDxKiraTownWomen. I’ll be speaking on the theme “The Space in Between”. The space I’ll be exploring is between social and media and how women fit in between.
 
Uganda is one of the world's poorest nations, with a majority of its citizens living on less than $1.25/day. Most of the impoverished are rural women. Rural women in Uganda often work much harder than their male counterparts, overseeing agricultural tasks and caring for their families, obtaining food, water, firewood. There is a desire on their parts to be entrepreneurial, and this is not just for rural women, but all Ugandan women. It is therefore of utmost importance that I speak to all the ways new, digital and social media are making commerce and business ownership possible for women all over the globe.
 
This is where I need your help. In order to be able to share some insight with the women of Uganda, I must first raise the funds to get there.
 
Two nights of my accommodations are being covered by the TEDxKiraTownWomen organizers. However, my airfare and accompanying travel expenses are not. While I will only be speaking on one day, Saturday, December 1, 2012, this is a tremendous opportunity for me to also make my first visit to the “Motherland” and my hope is that while there, I will get to explore the “Pearl of Africa” as Uganda is often called.
 
Where The Money Is Going:

Roundtrip Airfare to Entebbe, Uganda from Atlanta, Georgia 
Three night accommodations at the Prestige Apartments in Kampala 
Visa Entry Fees to Uganda 
Taxi fares to, from airport, TEDxKiraTownWomen et al.
Meals!

 
What Happens If I Exceed My Goal:
Any dollars raised outside of my expenses will be donated to the non-profit, Ugandan American Partnership Organization’s (UAPO) Akola Project. The Akola Project is an economic development initiative that helps rural Ugandan women generate sustainable income for themselves and their families. I was introduced to UAPO through founder Brittany Merrill. Brittany has dedicated her career to serving rural women of Uganda and and I am moved to support this effort through her work.
 
Other Ways To Help!
Donations in all sizes are welcome, however, sharing this campaign with your friends and colleagues is also needed and appreciated.  Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or an old-fashioned email, any way to spread the word will all serve to help me reach my goal.
  
All the Best,

<h2>What is Pitch &amp; Match?</h2>
<p>Pitch&amp;Match is the first student-organized networking platform where investment professionals are connected to inspiring social entrepreneurs in the Netherlands with innovative sustainable business ideas. The goal of the project is to provide both social entrepreneurs and investors with a unique opportunity to expand their network and a possibility to embark on further relations. The event will be arranged in the format of the Famous BBC “Dragons‘ Den” whereby six best social entrepreneurs who passed the selection process present their innovative ideas in 3 minutes, in front of a panel of strong and experienced investors. The investors will give feedback and select, together with the audience, the best pitch of the evening. After that there will be space for informal networking, “borrel” and entertainment program, e.g. live music and many other surprises!</p>
<h3>Where and when</h3>
<p>The up-coming event will take place in de Zuiderkerk in Amsterdam on December 10th, 2012. Doors open at 7pm.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Pitch&amp;Match is a part of the Socionext Foundation. The mission of Socionext is to engage university students in the Netherlands directly with their South African counterparts and find creative ways to provide funding for the South African funds Studietrust and TSiBA. <br/>Socionext breaks away from the traditional charity-based approach to “helping” Africa: by now the world has realized that the principle of equality, mutual engagement and creating shared value contributes much more to sustainable development.

Who are you?</strong><br/>Apologies; <br/>BEMEL Foundation is a non-profit &amp; non-government organisation that focuses on providing medical services for the local community and combating ignorance in health based issues, through education.<br/><br/>Based in Ibadan, Nigeria; BEMEL started in 1990 by the Ajayis (Mr Emanuel (R.I.P) &amp; Mrs Elizabeth), both experts in the medical field, with over 20 years of experience.<br/>Mr Ajayi was a medical laboratory scientist, who set up one of the most recognised and respected medical laboratory/training schools in Nigeria; Oluyoro Medical Services <span>he also played a significant role as the head of the laboratory department and Chief Medical Scientist at Jaja Health Services within the University of Ibadan.</span><br/><br/>Mrs Ajayi is an established mid-wife, social worker and qualified nurse is a well known &amp; respected lady in Ibadan, Oyo State.<br/><br/>At the BEMEL Foundation, the medical services provided are;</p>

<li>Gynaecology</li>
<li>Paediatrics</li>
<li>Diagnostics</li>
<li>Immunisation &amp; infant welfare clinic &amp;</li>
<li>Free medical events in rural areas</li>
<li>Maternal care and malaria awareness is the main area of focus</li>
</ul><p><br/>... BEMEL UK are the overseas representatives for the BEMEL Foundation …<br/><br/><strong>What have you done?</strong><br/><br/>During our 22 years of the foundation, we have strived to provide affordable, quality medical services for the less privileged. To date, we have performed;</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 2000 childbirths</li>
<li>1500+ surgeries &amp;</li>
<li>Over 8800 patient admissions and general treatments</li>
</ul><p>We have also educated members of the public through;</p>
<ul>
<li>General health education</li>
<li>Antenatal clinics</li>
<li>Counselling for women &amp;</li>
<li>Malaria eradication campaigns.</li>
</ul><p>ALL this has been done through personal funds &amp; the kindness of donors.<br/><br/>But it does not end there, we hope to get BEMEL to a stage where it will be self-sufficient, for example; in the near future we hope to start small businesses, run by the locals and the profit used to sustain the community and BEMEL. <br/><br/>With time, we hope to build relationships with reputable hospitals across various countries, where we can join hands and provide quality, affordable medical services, for those who otherwise won’t have any. <br/><br/><strong>You seem to be doing well, why should I donate?</strong><br/><br/>…Because our work is not done.<br/>Since the passing of Mr Ajayi (R.I.P), sustaining the BEMEL Foundation has become increasingly difficult. (He took up multiple jobs to fund the foundation whilst he was alive). As of today, the only source of income comes from Mrs Ajayi and a handful of donations received alongside loans which have placed the hospital in debt.<br/><br/>Quality medical services are not readily available in the area BEMEL is located in, resulting in a countless amount of patients seeking alternative options, unfortunately those alternatives end up being bogus hospitals that have been illegally set up, with incompetent doctors and nurses that do not know the difference between a liver and a kidney.<br/>Sadly, most of the patients do not leave the “hospital” alive. 9 out of every 10 hospitals/medical surgeries in the area are illegitimate. l<br/><br/>At the foundation, there are 16+ staff working round the clock to hold up BEMEL; but are hardly paid for their contribution. This is due to the lack of funds available, which has forcefully led to some of the staff to leave BEMEL in search of paying jobs. <br/>In the month of Octoer 2012 the security guard left because of this and we don't want this to continue...losing staff will eventually lead to closing down the hospital. (The combined staff wages alone costs about ₦400000/ £1600 per month)<br/><br/>On a monthly basis, we face the troubling possibility of having to shut BEMEL down; we just don’t have the money to keep BEMEL open, pay the hard working staff and offer a quality service.</p>
<p>In order for the BEMEL foundation to run for 12 months alone, a total of about 12, 000,000N (Naira) equating to £47,400/$76451.48 is needed.</p>
<p>This allows BEMEL to cover the costs over  its 6 main areas of functioning;</p>

<li>
<strong>Marketing/fundraising costs</strong> – (Staff time, marketing materials, design &amp; printing, media outreach, sponsor visits)</li>
</ol><p><br/><strong>What will happen to my donation?</strong><br/><br/>Your donation will go towards helping those who cannot afford quality medical services.<br/><br/>For instance, a donation of just £10 (price of a DVD movie), would cover the cost of a health check-up, for 1 person at BEMEL once a month for at least 5 months. <br/><br/>Your donation will also go towards helping pay the BEMEL Foundation staff a salary; improve medical facilities, equipment, re-ignite the medical laboratory and the BEMEL location.<br/><br/><br/>We do not have any major advertising campaign to pay for.<br/>We do not have any debts to pay off.<br/><strong>All</strong> of our UK colleagues are <strong>volunteers</strong> who donate their time, effort and money to BEMEL.<br/><br/>We are not a major charity with budgets and we have nothing to hide. We will always be transparent with every single penny donated.<br/><br/><br/><strong>What happens if we raise more than our target???</strong><br/><br/>If we raise more than our target... Wow! <br/>If we raise more than our target, one of our BEMEL UK volunteers will personally go a....<br/>Ok, maybe we won’t physically do anything (apart from jumping for joy), but it would be a MASSIVE deal &amp; it would mean more money going to a great cause; saving lives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, if you take a quick peek again at the what Bemel really needs to function in a year (<strong>see above</strong>) you would find that our fundraising target amount ($20,000) is no where near what they really need to support them throughout the year so more money would literally mean more contribution towards keeping Bemel running more efficiently.</p>
<p><br/><strong>What is in it for me?</strong><br/><br/>Good question;<br/>Knowing that your donation is going to help out those who cannot afford, but need the medical services that BEMEL provides,<br/>Knowing that your donation will not be used for the wrong reasons,<br/>Knowing that you are making a huge difference to the lives of people…<br/><br/>… Not forgetting, a choice of goodies, to your left. <br/>Go on… Take a look.</p>

Revisited my beloved Sierra Leone and saw the need to help but I thought to myself, I have three children, a job and my own issue how can I, one person make a difference.
Years later meet a good friend Darlis Johnson, encouraged me to go and two weeks later Khadarlis for Sierra Leone was born. 
Khadarlis is that rare Rhode Island non-profit whose international work in war-torn countries like Sierra Leone and Guatemala is matched by its intense focus on local community and neighborhood needs.  In six short years, this all-volunteer organization has undertaken a number of international projects, most of which are based in Sierra Leone, including:


building and maintaining clean water wells and indigenous mud-hut dwellings;
refurbishing and restocking school libraries;
initiating solar energy projects;
collecting and widely distributing essential items like food, clothing and computers to families throughout the country;
initiating and sustaining a women’s empowerment project centered around palm oil (from initial seeding and cultivation to exporting). 

At the same time, Khadarlis has always sustained a local focus, concentrating much of it’s energy on building relationships in Olneyville, North Providence and the neighborhoods around Academy and Valley Streets as well as Rhode Island .  These local efforts have taken the form of,
serving as a repository for donated household items (through long-established partnerships with such companies as Good360, Home Depot and Bed, Bath & Beyond) to families and individuals moving out of shelters into permanent housing, to victims of fire, to victims of domestic violence, and to elders at risk. Addressing urgent needs related to child welfare and learning, homelessness (through partnerships with Crossroads, and all CAP (community action partners), among other agencies) and low-income housing;

serving as a employment resource center for adults looking for jobs and professional development opportunities through establishing a public computer lab and referral service;
providing computers and tutoring for local students through a variety of partnerships in higher education and through the efforts of volunteer educators.

Bio gas typically refers to a gas produced by the breakdown of organic matter in the absence of oxygen. It is a renewable energy source, like solar and wind energy. Furthermore, bio-gas can be produced from regionally available raw materials and recycled waste and is environmentally friendly.


Goal: to improve people’s lives in rural areas through production of Bio Gas for cooking, heating and lighting while reducing Green House Gasses, avoiding production of charcoal or wood for cooking, reduction of CH 4 and CO2, avoiding slash and burn, avoiding smoke in houses, by using human and agriculture waste in a combined cheap gas producing unit that will costs less than 190 US$ per 2 households. Bio gas production units are natural systems that use organic agricultural waste, primarily manure, to produce bio-gas (fuel) and biol (natural fertilizer) by means of anaerobic digestion. Larger bio-gas production equipment can be used to power electricity generators.
Not only can a family bio gas unit generate renewable and inexpensive energy but it also provides health benefits for the family, because bio-gas does not emit smoke when cooking. In cases where families need to collect firewood, a bio-gas unit can greatly reduce the physical work involved, replaced by the loading of manure and water into the production unit. In agriculture, it provides a farmer with a natural and organic fertilizer which helps increase crop yields, whether vegetables, fruit, corn, potatoes, coffee, onions, cassava, etc. Besides increasing productivity, biol gives ecological added value to products because they can be grown free of chemicals. What is more, farmers or communities save money by not having to buy chemical fertilizers for their crops.
Benefits---health improvement, safer cooking and lighting houses, reduction of CH4 and CO2, better living, healthier living, enjoying life, restful sleep, safer lives and helps the environment.
This DIY equipment provide benefits to families and communities by:
• Reducing the amount of wood fuel used by the household
• Preserving forests that naturally clean the water and air and provide habitats for thousands of species of unique plants and animals, avoiding deforestation
• Producing highquality organic fertilizer as a byproduct
• Improving household air quality by reducing reliance on smoky wood burning stoves
• Providing a method for treating raw waste and finally:
This Do It Yourself Bio-equipment work best when fueled with pig manure, but cow manure,coffee millings, human waste, organic waste as rice husk, sugarcane or cassava waste and any other clean, chemical and pesticide free, biodegradable material can also be used. Biofuel equipment requires about 12 shovels of clean, chemical and contaminant free manure every day.
The Bioequipment
is built with local available materials including a plastic bucket, some plastic bottles, PVC pipes and so on, a release valve is the most expensive part not exceeding US$ 90. A complete list of materials and building manual is available on request.
Sustainable Technology:
As the technology used is simple, it is accessible to anyone, even those with no
prior knowledge. It is enough to follow a few simple instructions to set up this
equipment and understand the technology, the daily operation, maintenance and
repair work. All materials are available locally, without the need to import anything
from abroad.

Over a dozen years ago, Joshua and his mother sold the deli and market they owned together in Brattleboro, VT. At the time, he had worked with his mother in their deli for 12 years, since age 12. Joshua traveled a few years, finally taking a train across country to settle in Southeast Portland, OR. After arriving in Portland he took a Trimet bus across town. Arriving close to his new home, he stopped in front of the very first business he went inside in his new neighborhood, Limbo<strong>. </strong>He had heard about Limbo for months and was excited to finally be in front of the well known, organic produce and specialty food store. He went inside and was in awe. With a suitcase in hand, he asked if they were hiring. They were and he started his position 2 hours later on the same day. After a few years, he became their evening manager, until<strong> </strong><a href=""http://www.kgw.com/video/featured-videos/Limbo-foods-in-SE-Portland-closes-124896929.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"" title=""Limbo Goes Out of Business""><strong>Limbo closed their doors</strong></a> July 2011. After several years, he was jobless, when the owners of Limbo made the decision to retire. Many people were upset by the closing of Limbo because they did not know how to locate hard to find items they relied on to stay healthy. At that time Joshua made the decision with the help of his partner, family and friends, to help these people and opened the doors to Stone Cottage 2.5 months later.</p>

At the time, he had worked with his mother in their deli for 12 years, since age 12. Joshua traveled a few years, finally taking a train across country to settle in Southeast Portland, OR. After arriving in Portland he took a Trimet bus across town. Arriving close to his new home, he stopped in front of the very first business he went inside in his new neighborhood, Limbo. He had heard about Limbo for months and was excited to finally be in front of the well known, organic produce and specialty food store. He went inside and was in awe. With a suitcase in hand, he asked if they were hiring. They were and he started his position 2 hours later on the same day. After a few years, he became their evening manager, until Limbo closed their doors July 2011. After several years, he was jobless, when the owners of Limbo made the decision to retire. Many people were upset by the closing of Limbo because they did not know how to locate hard to find items they relied on to stay healthy. At that time Joshua made the decision with the help of his partner, family and friends, to help these people and opened the doors to Stone Cottage 2.5 months later.

Space once occupied by Limbo is now a new addition to Trader Joes",10.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>We're Going to Nationals!</h3>
<p>Starting in 2013, the US Curling Association has institutued a new National Championship specifically for clubs which play on arena ice.  </p>
<p>Having previously won three state-level new club championships (in 2009, 2010, and a shared title in 2011), the Dakota Curling Club is excited and honored to be able to represent our region at this new National Championship.</p>
<p>The Arena Nationals will be played in Fort Wayne Indiana from July 18 - July 21, 2013.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Sending 10 humble curlers all the way to Fort Wayne for 5 days sure adds up quickly!  Many of the players are long-time club members and volunteers who contribute both to our own club's development and to curling around the region.</p>
<p>The total budget for both teams comes to $7500.  We have already secured a sponsorship from TGI Fridays in Burnsville (our local broomstacking location) for $700.  This campaign seeks to raise an additional $3000 to help defray expenses.  The remainder will be picked up by the players themselves.</p>
<p>Here's how the budget breaks out per person:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel: $150</li>
<li>5 nights hotel (shared room): $290</li>
<li>Uniforms: $135</li>
<li>Food: $175</li>
<li>Total: $750</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if we achieve our fund-raising goal, each player will still be contributing almost $400 out of pocket.  Funds raised in excess of our goal will be distributed equally against player's expenses.  Any funds raised over $7500 will be donated back to the Dakota Curling Club.</p>

God bless!<br/><br/>""The boat was a 1977 Islander 26 (26') It did finally make it all the way to the shore after we jumped off. I haven't been able to get back to the site to see if it is still there. There is a brother by the name of Kevin McMahon that is coming from Nevada tomorrow to get us. He is on his way to the gathering so hopefully we will be in the arms of family soon. I am trying to give a truck to Helen Healing that is a 1990 Ford F-250 heavt duty with a fifth wheel hitch but she might need some help paying for the parking fees because I left it at the San Diego airport. I gave Voice beam a Honda a couple of weeks ago and Jeremie ""Caution"" Hennings a mini van a while back so I don't have much left to give. If Wolf Wandering can salvage the boat, it would be awesome for whoever gets it. It is a fiberglass hull, and was a fantastic boat. Nice deep keel. We got caught in a storm we didn't expect and then stuck in a huge kelp bed right after dark in 9 foot waves. I got on the radio to call for help and the batteries all went dead so we had to get close to shore and use flares. We saw cars lights flash at us. The anchor kept pulling up and we drifted closer to shore. The keel started to hit rocks and tip the boat all the way on its side and back to the other as it spun around in the waves like crazy. Stuff flying everywhere, water pouring in the hatch and little kids screaming bloody murder, terrified. At that point, my memory starts to get a little spotty, all flashes of crazy scenes. The boat is about 10 miles south of Rosarito beach. We were headed for Puerto Salina but were about 3 miles north when shit got real. Excuse the language. <br/>We were helped onto the rocks by some locals. Then had to jump back in to get to the shoreline. We spent the first night at the Rosarito bomberos Station, where they were kind and fed us and let us take showers. They even hung our wet clothes to dry, gave me back the cash they found in the pockets and helped Ryan get a couple of our packs off of the boat, which is all we have left. The boat was being ransacked by the locals the as we sat on the rocks wet and freezing with the children, waiting for the Navy to come. It was full of supplies enough for a family of six for a new life start, and all of our savings, birth certificates, etc. and this is a very poor country, so it was inevitable and we are not resentful in any way. The universe provides for all of us in the way it is supposed to. We have not been able to get back there.<br/>Our plan was to go to the World Rainbow gathering outside of Palenque, Mexico, so all of our savings and possessions were in the boat. We had four of my children on the boat, but the two teens left the next day back to America. We do not have that option as my father, Rick Carrillo, has threatened me with getting CPS or the police involved if we go back, said the the guy at the fire department in Tijuana. <br/>We are still in Rosarito, but a kind brother, Kevin McMahon, has messaged to to say he will head out from Nevada tomorrow and give us a ride South. My beautiful sister in law has set us up an IndyGoGo and we are hoping to raise enough to get somewhere safe and work to pay back all of the help we receive. We could really use a tent, blankets and food. The children are ages 5 and 3. Letting the media know was a suggestion of a kind lady on the internet (which is our only means of communication) and she sent me the links to many news stations, but I was unable to contact them through there and I have no phone.<br/>Once we get to a place to settle for a while, we have 2 acres in California we can try to sell and pay everyone back for their generosity. I didn't want to post this publicly because so many of the people we have given things to keep coming back for more and the property is all we have left. EVERYONE told us to get cheap insurance in the US and the good insurance when we got to Ensenada. So there is no real insurance, just liability. There was tons of food and supplies. We just wanted to move the kids to a free country and continue to do charity work. Never though a shit storm would come up so fast during cruising season. <br/>The crazy judgementality we have gotten from so many was the reason we left the US and has since convinced us that we were right to leave. People are so much more compassionate and hard working here, it is amazing. The people we found to stay with are American, and I believe this is why the weird chaotic energies in this place. I just hope Kevin gets here and helps us out of Rosarito. We have the boat papers and hope that Wolf Wandering is interested in salvage and claiming it for the Rainbow Family. <br/>I skimmed some of the messages from various folks, not in depth yet, but it all sounds like more people mad at us for trying to take the kids to a better life than armed guards in schools, in the police state of America. I really would like to avoid these energies for a while as I am still kinda reeling from the whole experience, as it was MY first sailing trip and most likely, the last.<br/>Ryan is so DEEPLY sorry for the whole thing, I don't think he needs to be punished any more, I raged at him for days. He never intended to put us in danger, as EVERYONE who taught us and gave us advice said no worries, best sail ever. The burden of guilt we both feel is hard enough without all of the people ranting on and on about it. Both of our families turned on us and basically said we deserve worse than what happened. We were trying and we failed. Can't express mt sorrow over that. But not many care to hear that part when they can get gory details and talk crap about stupid people like us and think of all these harsh punishments for us. Yes, we were stupid. Yes we have learned a valuable lesson. No we will not give up. Any more info I can give you just ask and I will provide. Thanks for not being harsh. I appreciate it, truly.

<h3><strong>2. Rabbits for Reading<br/></strong></h3>
<p>Rabbits for Reading is a child and adult sized flax linen napkin set. Once folded, a rabbit appears! This new reading toy builds upon the benefits of learning and play, fusing fun and reading.</p>
<p>This is a collaborative product, designed by Cécile Thalmann &amp; Adel Kassem, two incredible designers living in Amsterdam. <span class=""notranslate"">Cécile's grandmother used to play with her using this linen rabbit trick and Cécile has been sharing it with others ever since. It's such a delightful surpise and the transformation of the napkin sparks a child's imagination. The benefits of play for learning are many, it supercharges learning, relieves stess, and helps to sort new emotions. The rabbit also becomes a child's reading buddy, wandering with them through books and lands of imagination. </span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">This project was inspired by learning the literacy rate in New Orleans, while not in the lowest nationwide, is at 44% (2013). Strength in literacy builds better communities, parents, health, and lowers crime. </span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">A percentage of proceeds will be donated to S.T.A.I.R. and First Book. <a href=""http://stairnola.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">S.T.A.I.R.</a> is a one-on-one tutoring group that helps children in danger of academic failure learn the love of reading and build their confidence, becoming academic leaders. <a href=""http://www.firstbook.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">First Book</a> is nationwide and in Canada, connecting children &amp; schools in need with free or low cost books.

<h3><strong>3. A Warm Hug</strong></h3>
Inspired by the needs brought by Hurricane Sandy, this new blanket forms a heart upon your chest once wrapped around you, essentially giving a warm hug. Soon available in multiple sizes, we are beginning with the smallest size for infants (30"" x 30"") and then will work our way to the larger sizes, hoping to introduce a throw-sized blanket here soon!<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>These blankets bring you warmth while also raising funding for rebuilding communities that are still affected by Hurricane Sandy. We will give a percentage of proceeds to <a href=""http://architectureforhumanity.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Architecture for Humanity</a> who rebuild communities affected by disasters around the world. What makes them different is their focus on the long term &amp; true consideration of each unique community.</p>
<p> </p>
To create the baby blankets we are working with Liamolly's knitting co-op which shares a Stoll knitting machine with makers in New Orleans. These knitting machines are amazing &amp; most commonly known for being used by Nike &amp; Adidas to knit sneakers.  They also use very little electricity, the equivalent of a few light bulbs.<br/><br/>The baby blankets are knit with 100% Egyptian cotton, of beautiful colors made by a high quality mill, Filmar, founded in 1951 in Italy. They are the producers of beautiful colored yarn of the highest quality. At this point, most U.S. Mills have closed and moved across the seas that create the yarn needed for this machine. It requires yarn with long fibers so that it won't break during production. The long fibers requried also make an extremely high quality heirloom blanket, with plenty of gusto for long-life wear.<br/><br/>

Three new products from the makers of BirdProject soap, which has donated 18K to date for restoration post BP spill & has been featured in: GOOD, Whole Living, People, on the Martha Stewart show, Design Milk, Climbur, Treehugger, InvadeNOLA, nola.com, & many other inspiring publications.
About me: I'm Tippy Tippens, founder of Matter Inc., Design for Social Change. Matter is based in the precious city of New Orleans and is a design studio dedicated to creating sustainable products that create meaningful connections for our most important social and environmental problems. I'm also excited to have just recently been honored with the inclusion in the GOOD 100 this year!
I'm thrilled to now share with you three new meaningful Matter products that give back. Please watch our 3 min. video above! All are sustainably made in New Orleans-but we need your help to make them! The funds raised will pay for the first batches of each, eco-happy packaging, & a few updates needed to our website for these new products!
This group of meaningful, sustainably made products are inspired by three different needs but all share one common trait: folding to transform. By backing here on Indiegogo, you receive early-bird-20% off-discounts - WOOT! Please see more about the three below, watch the video above, and let me know if you have any questions, I'm happy to help. 

1. Dreams Matter, Notebooks are where dreams begin.
A sketchbook is a trusted confidant and a place where dreams begin. As you fill these notebooks with your dreams, you also help students stay in school via donations to the ""I Have A Dream"" Foundation.
These 5"" x 7"" notebooks have beautiful letterpress covers made by John Fitzgerald. The paper is amazing. It is incredibly smooth & made of 100% recycled content - French's paper has been creating sustainable papers since 1955. They are a sixth generation, family owned company that started in 1871.

<p>We are a small importing company who needs your help in supplying you and the rest of the country with our wines.</p>
<p><em> ""Adonna Wine Imports brings Italian wines of integrity and legacy. Nevermind they've covered the bases on small production, low yield, unique and pleasurable, but they discover wines that are so well made from conscientious growers. They're wines of place and story. ""  </em></p>

<p><em> </em></p>
<h3><strong>  Who We Are &amp; Why We Are Different  </strong></h3>
<p>We are hands on owner/operators who source, import, and distribute all of the small production Italian wines in our portfolio. Adonna Imports takes great efforts building lasting relationships not only with our producers but with our clientele as well. For us, providing the best service and support possible is an integral part of our philosophy. We have logged countless hours traveling and sourcing wines from all over Italy. Through our travels, we have developed close connections with our producers. The time and experiences shared with them has given us a perspective on wine that is truly invaluable. We focus on providing wines that are traditional, enjoyable, and reveal the character of the land and the talents of the people who produce them.   </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>
<strong>Why we need your help</strong>   </h3>
<p>We are a young company in the world of sourcing, importing and wine distribution. During our time in the business, we have encountered a unique problem: our wines have been met with such strong enthusiasm that we have are having a very difficult time supplying demand. While this is a great problem to have, it is a problem nonetheless. Not having enough wine to sell can create disappointment for current clients but can also stunt growth; this is where you come in.  Your contribution will allow us to strengthen our inventory by not only being able to purchase more wine but to be able to add new producers to our portfolio. All of this allows us to offer our wines in new markets. We are working toward providing our wines throughout New England…and, hopefully, one day nationally. Without enough inventory to supply the high demand for our wines, we cannot support an expansion into new markets...this allows just a small audience in the Boston-Metro area the opportunity to work with our portfolio of producers.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong> Why you should back us  </strong></h3>
<p> ~ To help broaden the audience for small production Italian wine   </p>
<p>~ To promote tradition and quality in wine production  </p>
<p> ~ To help support owner-operated small businesses     </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>The Challenge for us is straight forward: we need to add producers and inventory to our portfolio so that we can bring our wines to you and everyone else. Because we are small and have limited resources and are considered a ""niche"" business, traditional funding options just aren't in the cards for us. The demand for our wines seriously outweighs our supply and without additional funding, offering our wines in any new market isn't possible. We have proven in a very short time that we can succeed, and with your help opening up our portfolio to new markets should be no different.</p>

<div>Sincerly, Leo Harris</div></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary
I am raising money to build a new baseball field for the children of El Gigante, Nicaragua.
I am Leo Harris.  I am 13 years old, live in suburban Chicago, and I play baseball for the Waterdogs.  






Just like me, the children of El Gigante love baseball but and have an old, rough field to play on.  

As part of my Bar Mitzvah social service project, I am raising money to build a new field that they can enjoy.  By improving the field, the children will get to play baseball safely and throughout the entire year.



What We Need & What You Get


I am raising $10,000 to build the new baseball field.  The funds will go for the following improvements:



                  $2,500 for new infield dirt and outfield grass                  $1,500 for a new outfield fence                  $1,000 for construction of new, safe dugouts with roofs                  $5,000 for construction of a secure fence around the entire ballpark,                                       new spectator stands, a concession stand, and a scoreboard.


The Impact
Every dollar will go to improving the baseball field for the children of El Gigante.

I have partnered with The Sweetwater Fund, directed by Kassidy Medford,  located in El Gigante to design and manage the baseball field renovations.
Sweetwater is a 501-C-3 non-profit organization, with locations in Nicaragua and the United States.  Their website can be found here.  www.sweetwater.org 
In 2011, my sister Ella raised more than $1,800 for her Bat Mitzvah to help build a suspension bridge to help the children of El Gigante get safely to school across a gourge.  The story is located here.  Ella's Story.  




How you can contribute:
Like in the major leagues, we have 'sponsorship' opportunities to raise the monies.  


If you contribute $25, your name will appear on a plaque at the baseball field
If you contribute $100, your name will appear on the outfield fence
If you contribute $1,000, your name will appear on the dugout (limit 2)
If you contribute $10,000, we will name the baseball field after you! (limit 1)


Thank you for your consideration and support!

They all teach that what you put out is what you get back, they just do it in different ways.<br/><br/>Do you subscribe to Karma? What about the Golden Rule? Newton's Third Law of Motion? How about ""You reap what you sow""? If you said ""yes"" to one of these, you said yes to all of them because they are the same rule. This is a major discovery, because it is a singularity bewteen opposing ways of thinking. They may be the only law that science, religion, spirituality and common sense all agree on. Here at the SBYC we have taken it one step further by not only simplifying the concepts, we put this universally recognized law into an equation. <strong>We have taken it even further by developing a program that identifies what energy is positive, what is negative and proven method of shifting from one to the other.</strong> With this concept we can unify the people of the world and teach our the youth of the world this universal law. </p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>E x A = C [Energy x Action = Creation]</strong>
</h3>
<h3><strong>The question is what energy are you putting in to your life: positive or negative energy?</strong></h3>
<p><br/>What you see above is called ""The Shift Equation"". I am Zo ""The Peacemaker"" Klimowicz, I created ""The Process"" to find peace in my life and I have created the SBYC Movement in order to share my message with others. I have successfully used this tool to heal my life and now I teach it to others so that they can live the life they've desired for years. I have taught ""The Process"" to over 700 people in the last 2 years. If we can agree that this is a law of the Universe then we have accomplished Step One. Step Two is doing something about it, and that is learning to actively ""shift"". We have found a way to use physics to explain the human condition. This tool, along with the other Soulwurx tools, abide by Universal Laws that teach us how to shift out of negative and into positive energy, thus changing our lives for the better.</p>
<p>My Campaign is important to me because it is my life's purpose to heal, create shift, and serve the world; regardless of peoples' spiritual or non-spiritual preferences. All types of people deserve love and happiness. This campaign is important to the World because there aren't many things that are this simple to understand while being this powerful.</p>
<p>I truly believe this is the formula to World Peace. I've seen it work for people from all walks of life, myself included. Like any formula, once it is perfected, tested and results are proven, the next natural step is marketing and mass distribution, this is the stage Soulwurx is in. The masses we are referring to are today's youth, the future of our world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>For a full crew to put on a single event costs approximately $300 for gas, food, travel, electronic equipment, video, camera man etc. This is a very small budget for 4 people to put on a presentation, but it is enough to make a difference and get the job done!</p>
<p>When you donate, you are ""paying it forward"" and allowing us to go to a new location and spread our message, and you are getting the same education and training those individuals are getting. Its a win-win-win for the people we will be reaching, for our movement, and for yourself.</p>
<p>We are confident our goal will be met or exceeded since you are so awesome and our message is so simple and powerful! We will use any funds raised to go to as many locations as possible. So if we raise $3000, we can afford to present at 10 locations. $6000, 20 locations. $15,000, 50 schools/ Youth Centers/ Day Cares/ etc.</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>When we can get 1 kid to stop and ask themselves ""What is my energy at this moment?"" at or before the moment that they create, it could literally mean the difference between life and death, since decisions form our lives. It could mean the difference between running with the wrong crowd or choosing better friends. It could mean the difference between committing a crime or not. It could mean the difference between a life of being lost in the prison system or a life of freedom. This is how important learning to shift is to you, us, and our world.</p>
<p>Everything amazing that man has ever created whether it was a rocket ship, a medical breakthrough or a new world record came from positive energy, basically from some form of Love. Every terrible thing man has ever created whether it was a small skirmish, a war or an atom bomb, has come from negative energy, basically some form of Fear.</p>
<p>This can be changed through awareness, education, tools, practice, etc. At the SBYC Movement we have created this video, written books, created tools, contacted schools and businesses, built the website, designed stickers, tee shirts and wristbands. All we need from you is a donation to share this with the world. We are willing to do the work if you are willing to support us in it.</p>
<p><br/>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>If you are not in a position to assist financially here are still ways you can help:</p>
<p>Ask your business or company if they can make a donation or hire us to do a presentation for your staff.</p>
<p><br/>Share our site, links and facebook pages with others that may be able to assist, get behind us, or plug us into powerful people that can spread this mesage as well.<br/><br/>The most powerful way to support this movement is...SHIFT BEFORE YOU CREATE! Live this message and remind others of it as well. One more decision to shift today leads to one tomorrow. It inspires others to do the same. We are all part of this world, which means even ONE decision affects EVERYONE, whether you see it or not.</p>
<p>Many of us keep believing that world change is being taken care of by someone else, but in the end there is only you, me and us. Our generation has many messes to clean up, and it is up to us to create a new healthy foundation for future generations - its a big job! SBYC is a movement; so it requires movement, action, involvement, and of course, shift.</p>
<p>We have seen what magic and miracles happen when there is shift in our lives, we challenge you to experience it for yourself, and see just how a powerful creator you really are.</p></div>","What do science, religion, higher consciousness and common sense all have in common?

The aim of HOPE FOR HEIDI is to do exactly that - Give hope to a woman that has been put through hell through the negligence of certain medical professionals and various Hospitals/Clinics.
Heidi has one kidney.
What makes this story different from all the others?
Heidi lost a kidney in her early childhood,but it was never detected.After a medical professional detected kidney stones later in 2006,Heidi being a strong woman,took it as something to overcome as a part of her daily life,but then they saw the severity of the kidney issue,yet nothing was done.Nobody informed her of what needed to be done.
At this stage she had 98% functionality left on the remaining kidney.
It was clear the dead kidney needed to be removed or it will cause issues and damage the remaining kidney.Still nothing was done due to negligence and lack of communication.As the years progressed this caused inexplicaple pain and health issues.
The dead kidney was only removed in 2010 with certain Dr.'s still questioning the validity of the case and the existence of the issues. 
After all of this the Dr.'s made no attempts to save the remaining kidney.
(Dr.'s refused to remove it even after numerous professionals advised to get it removed.Before it was removed experimental treatment was doen to see if it could be revived)
Later on in 2012 a scan was done....10% functioanlity in the remaining kidney with a bleak outlook.
A creatine count over 700.
Very coldly and bluntly she was told that she is ""too old to save"" and they refused to do further tests or take blood for tests - the reason the Dr. gave? - ""I know the outcome and know the case,no need to do anymore tests""
At this point she was told to ""make friends"" with someone in the Government or if she had a friend in Government employement to get her on their Medical Aid as it is the only hope she has (that would be FRAUD!)
She was broken..
Medical Professionals are telling her to give up or commit fraud at 49.
This is who Heidi is :
A loving single mother of 3..
A loving grandmother..
A person with unbreakable faith..
Through her constant pain Heidi refuses to sit at home - She is a full time nursery school teacher and works hard for her money.Unfortunaly it is not enough for private dyalysis or a qualifying and proper medical aid.
And even then she gives to others and shares what she has without hesitation.

FINALLY,Heidi has since received help from the main hospital in question.They are going to be doing tests and WILL put her on the Dyalysis list if she needs treatment,AND if she can improve the functioanlity of her kidney,she might be elligable for a transplant!
So far new tests have shown a drop in her creatine levels and other hopefull signs - and these tests and remarks have been done/made by the same Dr.'s that told her to ""get your affairs in order"" and ""you're too old too save"".
She is busy trying to get fit again,as they long periods of rest and healing and hospital stays have left her unfit and in need of exersize

<h3>La mission de la Fondation</h3>
<div>
<p>La Fondation du Horse Palace de Griffintown est une organisation à but non lucratif qui a pour mandat:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>de sauvegarder et de mettre en valeur le Horse Palace de Griffintown </li>
<li>d'ouvrir celui-ci au public en vue de réintégrer le cheval dans la culture et l’histoire montréalaises</li>
<li>d’offrir aux Montréalais et aux touristes un endroit où il est possible d’admirer les chevaux et de prendre connaissance de leurs liens avec les traces du Montréal industriel et de l’histoire de la classe ouvrière montréalaise.</li>
</ul>
<p>La Fondation du Horse Palace de Griffintown compte dans son conseil d'administration des spécialistes en histoire, en droit, en architecture et architecture de paysage et des passionnés du patrimoine bâti et des chevaux.</p>
<p>Une de ses dernières réalisations importantes consiste en la mise en valeur d'un terrain en friche sous forme d'un enclos permettant aux chevaux de profiter d'un espace plus vaste afin de se promener et de se reposer.</p>

<p>Initialement, la Fondation désirait préserver les écuries actuelles et effectuer des travaux afin de sécuriser le bâtiment. Il s’avère cependant que le bâtiment n’a pas de fondations, et que sa charpente menace de s’écrouler.  Afin de pouvoir couler une fondation en béton adéquate, il a été décidé de procéder à une reconstruction de l'écurie plutôt qu'à sa restauration. Cette décision permettra notamment d'adapter le bâtiment aux normes en vigueur, ce qui le rendra plus sécuritaire et mieux adapté aux besoins des chevaux.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>Bien que le bâtiment soit un témoin de l'histoire, dans le cas présent, c'est surtout l'usage continu depuis plus de 150 ans qui caractérise le site. La préservation du lieu, mais avant tout de sa vocation équestre, permettra de souligner le passé historique du quartier tout en le gardant vivant et ouvert aux visiteurs.</div>
<div>La Fondation a l'intention de réutiliser tous les éléments récupérables et de garder certaines sections intègres comme témoins uniques de l’assemblage en bois tenon et mortaise d'origine pré-industrielle. Afin de conserver intact l'aménagement en fond de cour typique du Horse Palace, exemple unique dans le cadre urbain de Montréal de la disposition des fermes à l'époque coloniale, les bâtiments reconstruits auront les mêmes volumes et emplacement que ceux qu'ils sont destinés à remplacer.</div>

<p>Le temps presse: l'écurie est en très mauvais état et des interventions temporaires empêchent son effondrement. L'objectif de cette grande campagne de financement est d'amasser les fonds suffisants pour reconstruire l'écurie à compter du printemps prochain. Si jamais, pour des raisons de sécurité, les chevaux devaient quitter le site pour cause de risque à la sécurité et ce pour plus de six mois, le droit acquis d'y avoir des chevaux serait perdu en vertu de la réglementation municipale; il ne serait plus jamais possible de garder le lieux vivant en y accueillant ces magnifiques bêtes. L'ensemble des coûts de reconstruction pour la nouvelle écurie a été évalué à environ 180 000$. D'autres sources de financement s’ajouteront à la levée de fond pour permettre d’atteindre l’objectif financier.</p>
<p>DÉTAIL BUDGÉTAIRE  </p>
<p>    180 000 $ (coût approximatif du projet de reconstruction de l'écurie)</p>
<p>-   100 000 $ (apport de certains promoteurs de Griffintown et donateurs privés)</p>
<p>-     35 000 $ (montant mis de côté pour la Fondation à la Fondation du Grand     Montréal)</p>

<div><h3>Save the Griffintown Horse Palace!</h3></div>
<div>
<p>
Help us preserve one of the oldest working urban stables in North America!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our mission</h3>The Griffintown Horse Palace Foundation is a non-profit organization. Our mandate aims to:
<p>
</p>
<p>-  Preserve and restore the stables of the Griffintown Horse Palace</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>-  Open the site to the public and reintegrate the horse into the culture and history of Montreal</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>-  To offer Montrealers and tourists a space to connect with horses and discover Montreal’s industrial and working class history.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The board of the Griffintown Horse Palace brings together members of diverse backgrounds such as history, law, architecture, landscape architecture, who all share a common passion for Montreal’s rich cultural heritage and for horses.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One of the last achievements of the Foundation was the construction of a paddock for the horses of the Horse Palace on the neighboring abandoned plot of land. </p>

<p>Originally, the Foundation was seeking to maintain the stables as they are now, and only secure the building. However, the building is not built on proper foundations and the roof is threatening to collapse any day. In order to build a concrete foundation for the stables, it has been decided that, instead of being restored, the building will be reconstructed and refurbished to better uphold the security standards and norms, and improve the well-being of the horses. </p>
<p>
</p>

La mission de la Fondation

La Fondation du Horse Palace de Griffintown est une organisation à but non lucratif qui a pour mandat:


de sauvegarder et de mettre en valeur le Horse Palace de Griffintown 
d'ouvrir celui-ci au public en vue de réintégrer le cheval dans la culture et l’histoire montréalaises
d’offrir aux Montréalais et aux touristes un endroit où il est possible d’admirer les chevaux et de prendre connaissance de leurs liens avec les traces du Montréal industriel et de l’histoire de la classe ouvrière montréalaise.

La Fondation du Horse Palace de Griffintown compte dans son conseil d'administration des spécialistes en histoire, en droit, en architecture et architecture de paysage et des passionnés du patrimoine bâti et des chevaux.
Une de ses dernières réalisations importantes consiste en la mise en valeur d'un terrain en friche sous forme d'un enclos permettant aux chevaux de profiter d'un espace plus vaste afin de se promener et de se reposer.
Avant: Vue du terrain avant du Horse Palace avant la construction de l'enclos en 2012
Après: Vue aujourd'hui avec l'enclos et son aménagement.







Le projet de reconstruction





Initialement, la Fondation désirait préserver les écuries actuelles et effectuer des travaux afin de sécuriser le bâtiment. Il s’avère cependant que le bâtiment n’a pas de fondations, et que sa charpente menace de s’écrouler.  Afin de pouvoir couler une fondation en béton adéquate, il a été décidé de procéder à une reconstruction de l'écurie plutôt qu'à sa restauration. Cette décision permettra notamment d'adapter le bâtiment aux normes en vigueur, ce qui le rendra plus sécuritaire et mieux adapté aux besoins des chevaux.


Bien que le bâtiment soit un témoin de l'histoire, dans le cas présent, c'est surtout l'usage continu depuis plus de 150 ans qui caractérise le site. La préservation du lieu, mais avant tout de sa vocation équestre, permettra de souligner le passé historique du quartier tout en le gardant vivant et ouvert aux visiteurs.
La Fondation a l'intention de réutiliser tous les éléments récupérables et de garder certaines sections intègres comme témoins uniques de l’assemblage en bois tenon et mortaise d'origine pré-industrielle. Afin de conserver intact l'aménagement en fond de cour typique du Horse Palace, exemple unique dans le cadre urbain de Montréal de la disposition des fermes à l'époque coloniale, les bâtiments reconstruits auront les mêmes volumes et emplacement que ceux qu'ils sont destinés à remplacer.

Objectif 2015



Le temps presse: l'écurie est en très mauvais état et des interventions temporaires empêchent son effondrement. L'objectif de cette grande campagne de financement est d'amasser les fonds suffisants pour reconstruire l'écurie à compter du printemps prochain. Si jamais, pour des raisons de sécurité, les chevaux devaient quitter le site pour cause de risque à la sécurité et ce pour plus de six mois, le droit acquis d'y avoir des chevaux serait perdu en vertu de la réglementation municipale; il ne serait plus jamais possible de garder le lieux vivant en y accueillant ces magnifiques bêtes. L'ensemble des coûts de reconstruction pour la nouvelle écurie a été évalué à environ 180 000$. D'autres sources de financement s’ajouteront à la levée de fond pour permettre d’atteindre l’objectif financier.
DÉTAIL BUDGÉTAIRE  
    180 000 $ (coût approximatif du projet de reconstruction de l'écurie)
-   100 000 $ (apport de certains promoteurs de Griffintown et donateurs privés)
-     35 000 $ (montant mis de côté pour la Fondation à la Fondation du Grand     Montréal)
-     45 000 $ (montant devant être amassé par la campagne Indiegogo)

La sauvegarde du Horse Palace grâce à ce projet de reconstruction aura plusieurs retombées positives dont: 

La mise en valeur d'un lieu unique au pays et chargé d'histoire.
L'offre unique aux résidents de Griffintown, aux Montréalais et aux touristes d'un contact privilégié avec les chevaux dans un cadre urbain.
La réalisation des objectifs du Programme Particulier d'Urbanisme (PPU) de Griffintown concernant la mise en valeur du site du Horse Palace et la constitution d'un Corridor culturel sur la rue Ottawa.

Save the Griffintown Horse Palace!


Help us preserve one of the oldest working urban stables in North America!



Our missionThe Griffintown Horse Palace Foundation is a non-profit organization. Our mandate aims to:


-  Preserve and restore the stables of the Griffintown Horse Palace


-  Open the site to the public and reintegrate the horse into the culture and history of Montreal


-  To offer Montrealers and tourists a space to connect with horses and discover Montreal’s industrial and working class history.


The board of the Griffintown Horse Palace brings together members of diverse backgrounds such as history, law, architecture, landscape architecture, who all share a common passion for Montreal’s rich cultural heritage and for horses.


One of the last achievements of the Foundation was the construction of a paddock for the horses of the Horse Palace on the neighboring abandoned plot of land. 









Our project



Originally, the Foundation was seeking to maintain the stables as they are now, and only secure the building. However, the building is not built on proper foundations and the roof is threatening to collapse any day. In order to build a concrete foundation for the stables, it has been decided that, instead of being restored, the building will be reconstructed and refurbished to better uphold the security standards and norms, and improve the well-being of the horses. 


The building itself may be a witness to history, but it is actually the continuous use of the site for over 150 years, and especially the presence of the horses, that is best suited to maintain the neighbourhood’s heritage. 


The Foundation is hoping to recycle materials, and even incorporate sections of the existing buildings, as samples of the unique pre-industrial construction technique in mortise and tenon joints. In order to preserve the layout of the Horse Palace, as the last remaining example in Montreal of that found ina typical colonial farm, the reconstructed buildings will be assembled in the same space and with the same dimensions as the existing constructions.





Our objective


The preservation of the Horse Palace is urgent! The stables are in a dire condition, and temporary fix-ups are currently preventing its collapse. Our objective, with this large-scale fundraising campaign, is to raise enough money to start rebuilding the stables by next spring. If the horses and their owner were to leave the site because of safety reasons for over six months, the vested right to host horses would be lost: the Horse Palace’s life would be extinguished with them.


The total costs of rebuilding a new stable have been estimated at $180.000. Other funding programs should allow us to reach our goal.


BUDGET DETAILS
$180.000 (estimated cost of the reconstruction of the stables)
- $100.000 (financial support of Griffintown real estate promoters and private donors)
- $35.000 (amount on hold by the Fondation du Grand Montréal)
- $45.000 (amount that we hope to raise with your help through the Indiegogo campaign)


We are offering the perks listed to thank you for your generosity towards our cause!

The preservation of the Horse Palace through its reconstruction will bring so much!


-  The restoration of a historical site that is unique in Canada


-  The integration of the urban horse within Griffintown, to the delight of Griffintown residents, Montrealers, and tourists 


-  Reaching the objectives of the Griffintown SPP (Special Planning Programs)

I believe it is a project that most of us support, but as is the case with most anything in drum corps, we have seen too many people with big dreams come and go; so our trust is now something that has to be earned with an intelligently conceived plan and the credentials to move that plan to fruition. Dennis has demonstrated his long-term commitment, and he has poured a great deal of time and effort into development of plans, both short term and long term, that I believe will lead to the goal we would all like to see accomplished.

The mission of the DCHS is to collect, preserve and provide access to these resources for scholars, educators, students, journalists, and the general public in an effort to broaden the awareness and understanding of the drum and bugle corps, its historical roots and evolution, and its impact in the larger history and cultural fabric of North American music.</p>
<p>In time, The DCHS Collection will constitute the largest individual holding of historical records related to the history of the North American drum and bugle corps activity.

<p>The DCHS is committed to providing public access to its collection through an online, digital repository. To do so, the DCHS has initiated this initial fundraising platform to generate enough funding to create the proper website and multimedia studio needed for collection management of and public access to the DCHS Collection. All revenue collected will be allocated for internal operations as related to the accredited standards for collection development, storage and preservation, and public access.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, your contributions and support will allow the DCHS to project towards its long-term goal of building a permanent ‘brick-and-mortar” museum and archives, alongside its traveling multimedia exhibits. Beyond the public display of its collections, the DCHS strives to broaden its educational mission by participating in professional conferences, and by conducting interdisciplinary oral history research centered on “Alan Lomax-style” personal interviews, conversations and the documentation of collective memory of past and present drum and bugle corps participants.</p>
<p>To achieve its goals, the Drum Corps Heritage Society is seeking financial contributions in the total amount of $15,000. Your contributions will be immediately put into action, as the DCHS seeks to launch its website with secure access to its collections by August 2013.

What I Need & What You GetHere's the break down:
The remainder of my tuition is $10,000. If I reach more than expected (dare to dream!) any extra would go to school related costs such as chefs uniforms, supplies, food for presentations and commute.
Most if not all ""Perks"" are home or hand made by me and can be specialized to fit your particular dietary needs, desires or restrictions. 
If I don't raise the full 10k I will still move forward in enrollment and continue to find ways to fund the rest of the tuition. I am driven to make this happen!

The Impact 
I will gain confidence in not only my abilities as a chef, but as someone with the tools to help heal and support a wide range of clients.
Natural Chefs are in great demand as our society realizes and needs guidance toward healthy food, nourishment and lifestyle. 
I will become skilled in technical culinary practice. 

This program is the launching pad for a future using food as a therapeutic source as well as the precursor to an education in nutritional consulting. 

This program will provide me with the tools to build a health-centered career.

<p>Our goal is to increase access to locally grown fresh food,
farm culture, and provide intergenerational agricultural education in a
neighborhood challenged with providing fresh, local food for its residents. We
are grateful for all the support shown 
to our small scale food justice project, and are embarking on growing
our impact and service to the community by building our infrastructure and
strengthening our resources!  </p>
<p><b>Year Long Market
Stall </b>– We want to make a difference in our community <i>every single day! </i>Help us winterize our market selling area<i> </i>by building new wooden floors, adding thermal plastic enclosures, and including a solar generator that
drives our floor heaters. With these additions, our market stall will stay
open, and serve customers later into the winter season. </p>
<p><i>Dimensions: 40ft x
16ft </i></p>
<p><i>Total Cost: $10,000</i></p>
<p><b>Communication Station
</b>– We want to make it as easy as possible for members of our community to learn
about market and farm programs that benefit our community <i>and </i>get involved! This new communication center will feature a
signup station for customers to learn about the market and farm programs,
signup for weekly baskets, create their own smoothies, and purchase promotional
items. This will also be the place where healthbuccs  and ebt transactions can be processed. Power
will be provided by a solar mini generator. </p>

<p><i>Total Cost: $5,000</i></p>
<p><b>Food Service Area </b>–
One of our favorite parts about gardening is having a chance to enjoy all we’ve
grown! This food service area will be the go-to spot for customers to enjoy
fresh snacks, socialize with neighbors over a hot cup of herb tea, watch
cooking demos, and enjoy other market offerings. This area will be
café style, featuring wooden stools and picnic tables for visitors, plus two
compartment self-contained sinks (with hot and cold water), that will help us
host communal dinner fundraisers in the market. </p>

<p><i>Total Cost: $5,000</i></p>
<p><b>Outdoor Kitchen
Island  </b>– While providing access to
fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs is one of our main goals, we also work with
community residents to teach practical ways of preparing healthy produce, and
host breadbaking workshops with our clay oven. This kitchen island and counter
space will  allow us to expand our bread
baking and culinary skill demos. The outdoor kitchen island consists of food prep
and grilling areas, storage cupboards, countertops, and a ramp for food to move
to and from the storage area. </p>

</p><p><b>Background: About Us</b></p>
<p>The Hattie Carthan Garden, Farm, and Community Farmers
Market is one of the largest, and longest-running projects led by people of
color in NYC. Our garden, urban farm, and two markets are located in Bedford
Stuyvesant, Brooklyn – a neighborhood that typically doesn’t have easy access
to fresh fruits and vegetables. In the 1970’s, we established our first garden
at Lafayette and Marcy Avenue, as a place where low-income residents could have
access to green space, expand their knowledge of plants, and grow fresh food in
Brooklyn. The garden has remained a multigenerational, multicultural public
space ever since. </p>
<p>Since 2003, under the visioning of urban farmer and garden V.P
Yonnette Fleming, the Hattie Carthan Community Garden has reinvented itself by
combining the old-fashioned community gardening approach with urban agriculture
and two community-based markets. The garden now operates a working educational
herb farm, a children’s learning garden, two hoop houses, two chicken coops, and three composting systems. Our advocacy and food justice programs help educate a new
group of food leaders, while empowering youths and others working within the
food system.  </p>
<p>Since 2009, the markets have distributed over 40,000 pounds
of fresh, local food to community residents at low, affordable prices. All of
this food has been sourced by local farmers operating within 150 miles of the
garden. </p>
<p><b>Background: About Bedford Stuyvesant, Brooklyn</b></p>
<p>Bedford Stuyvesant is a densely populated and diverse
neighborhood in Brooklyn. Like most urban neighborhoods, access to fresh
produce is limited, and many live below the poverty line. Although they face
challenges, city communities play a huge part in tackling the problems that
have long plagued them. </p>

Por este motivo, hemos elegido ayudar a unos niños de Kenya. Vamos a recaudar dinero para un orfanato que aloja a unos 150 niños y que necesitan de todo: comida, camas, ropa, material escolar, etc. Sabemos que no vamos a poder construirles unas instalaciones modernas e higiénicas pero por lo menos intentaremos llenarles un poco la tripica.¿Qué haremos con el dinero?Nuestra idea principal era comprarles comida y leche en polvo, pero, hablando con la directora del orfanato, hemos decidido que dentro de nuestras limitaciones, lo mejor sería poder comprarles una vaca que les dé leche día a día. Y ¡sí!, nos ha comentado que tienen recursos para mantener una vaca. De hecho, nos ha enviado información con diferentes razas adaptadas al clima de Kenya. Ésta, por ejemplo, (http://www.livestockkenya.com/index.php/cattle/300-the-best-tropical-dairy-cows ) da más de 62 litros de leche al día. Esto significa más de 400 ml de leche para cada niño al día.En el caso de no poder recaudar lo necesario para comprar una vaca, vamos a volver a la primera idea que tuvimos, comprarles leche en polvo y otro tipo de comida (arroz, maíz, judías, etc.). ¡Tenemos que conseguirlo!Somos humanos Sabemos que no es fácil conseguir esta cantidad de dinero, pero también sabemos que gastamos muchísimo en cosas que no necesitamos. Compramos comida y la tiramos, gastamos en ropa que casi ni utilizamos, pagamos 8€ para un gintonic y 15 para una pizza. ¡Somos así!¿Sabes que si conseguimos recaudar estos 3000€, 150 niños tendrán un vaso de leche cada mañana durante años? Tómate 5 segundos y piénsalo... ¡no es poca cosa!No, en serio, piénsalo...  Ayuda con lo que puedas No queremos que alguno de vosotros pase hambre por haber hecho un esfuerzo más grande de lo que le permita el bolsillo. Por eso, hemos creado varios tipos de ayudas, para que elijas la que mejor te viene tanto para el bolsillo como para tu estado espiritual.En la parte derecha tienes varias opciones para colaborar con nosotros y llevar a cabo este proyecto. Lo bueno es que te puedes llevar cosas muy chulas. jeje¡Muuuuuchas gracias por todo!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Éste es un proyecto hecho con el corazón</h3>
<p>La asociación de familias numerosas Zona Norte (FAN'S) fue creada en el 2005 para ayudar a familias en riesgo de exclusión social, por falta de recursos económicos.</p>
<p>Hace dos años, quedó registrada en la Comunidad de Madrid como asociación que favorecía a colectivos con problemas económicos. A partir de ese momento empezó a tener más presencia dentro de la sociedad, a ampliar su campo de actuación a familias no numerosas, pero con problemas parecidos. También empezó a proveer de alimentos en buen estado a dichas familias, y aquí es donde entra la petición que hacemos mediante indiegogo. Hasta hace unos días repartíamos entre 2000kg - 3000kg de comida mensualmente, mediante furgonetas que nos prestaban algunos benefactores de la asociación, pero dichos benefactores, se han ido reduciendo conforme aumentaba el número de familias a las que atendemos.</p>
<p>Los que trabajamos en ésta asociación, lo hacemos de forma voluntaria, es decir, sin sueldo, pero aún así, no es suficiente para poder ahorrar algo de dinero de lo que algunos benefactores regalan a  la asociación.</p>
<p>Si conseguimos comprar la camioneta mediante ésta campaña, podremos duplicar nuestra labor y llegar a más familias con problemas.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Qué necesitamos y qué obtienes si nos ayudas</h3>
<p>Lo que se necesita en un principio son 10000€, para comprar una camioneta de entre 12 y 17 m3, pero si se quedase corta la cifra, compraríamos una furgoneta un poco más pequeña.</p>
<p>En caso de superar la cifra de los 10000€, ese dinero se convertiría inmediatamente en fruta, verdura o alimentos no perecederos para las familias a las que atendemos.</p>
<p>La ""recompensa"" que podemos ofrecerte por ayudarnos es así de sencilla:Tendrás la seguridad de que la ayuda que nos prestes, por pequeña que sea irá directamente a ayudar a todas éstas familias y su agradecimiento por ello.</p>

La asociación de familias numerosas Zona Norte (FAN'S) fue creada en el 2005 para ayudar a familias en riesgo de exclusión social, por falta de recursos económicos.
Hace dos años, quedó registrada en la Comunidad de Madrid como asociación que favorecía a colectivos con problemas económicos. A partir de ese momento empezó a tener más presencia dentro de la sociedad, a ampliar su campo de actuación a familias no numerosas, pero con problemas parecidos. También empezó a proveer de alimentos en buen estado a dichas familias, y aquí es donde entra la petición que hacemos mediante indiegogo. Hasta hace unos días repartíamos entre 2000kg - 3000kg de comida mensualmente, mediante furgonetas que nos prestaban algunos benefactores de la asociación, pero dichos benefactores, se han ido reduciendo conforme aumentaba el número de familias a las que atendemos.
Los que trabajamos en ésta asociación, lo hacemos de forma voluntaria, es decir, sin sueldo, pero aún así, no es suficiente para poder ahorrar algo de dinero de lo que algunos benefactores regalan a  la asociación.
Si conseguimos comprar la camioneta mediante ésta campaña, podremos duplicar nuestra labor y llegar a más familias con problemas.

<h3>What is Shindiggit?</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Sean Vierth, and I am a 22 year old socialpreneur located in San Diego. I was raised by my grandparents, and they always instilled one strong trait into my thought process. If I was able, help others less fortunate than myself. I was recently humbled when a dear friend's father passed away, and he had a goal in life. Help 1,000,000 people before he died. This resonated so strongly with me that I immediately moved to action and started brainstorming what I know best, and how I could reach that goal for him.</p>
<p>And that's when the ""Party to Save Lives"" campaign was born. Imagine a marketplace of unique party &amp; entertainment products, with globally participating businesses, where funds raised go to charity. This marketplace would have a percentage of funds go to charity, while also helping small businesses all over the world gain exposure, and become more successful. I have the idea, and I know once this is an established business it will be very successful, and generate a huge impact on many of the less fortunate all around the world. </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to consider helping me with this campaign. I have a goal of helping 1,000,000 people, and I will not stop until I reach that goal! And I cannot express enough how thankful I am for the support.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For a business like this to not only be successful, but also make a significant impact, I will need an estimated $25,000. There is a special formula of marketing and structure needed, that can make a cause go viral. Capturing 1% of the market will lead to 2 Million in revenue, which will help thousands of people worldwide. $25,000 is on the lower spectrum of budgets, but our team is very passionate about what we are doing and will make sure we make it count.</p>
<p>For every contribution, you'll receive a fun mystery gift from the Shindiggit team, as well as an account with Shindiggit where you will see fun insights on the company, built in discounts for being a founding contributor, and most importantly, recognition for making this dream possible and truly making an impact on thousands of lives. (And some really fun products!) We also would love to hear what charities you recommend we donate to!</p>
<p>If we do not meet our financial goal, all of the funds we receive will go towards that goal. First will be business structure, and then all of the supplies we need to get Shindiggit up and running. From there, marketing will be very important so people can learn about our movement. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If (and when) we can truly get Shindiggit up and running, the repercussions will lead to hundreds of thousands raised for various charities all over the world. The current marketplace for this niche of products is entirely capitalized for profits, and nothing is given back to the community. </p>
<p>I will not fail at my goal, but I just do not have any funding available to fuel my idea. If you help me reach this goal, I will make sure we make a serious impact. 1 Dollar can help feed a child. Imagine generating hundreds of thousands of dollars towards that cause. </p>
