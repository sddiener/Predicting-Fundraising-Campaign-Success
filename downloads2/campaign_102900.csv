<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Do you like Spaceships? Maybe you prefer huge Battlecruisers?</p>
<p>Or perhaps you even dream of epic battles between space fleets?</p>
<p>In 1999, Games Workshop Ltd released <i>Battlefleet Gothic TM</i>, a specialist miniatures game about ""Spaceship battles in the 41st millenium"". The game was and is still acclaimed for its ruleset and balance.</p>
<p>Sadly, it has been discontinued and it's getting harder and harder to find the materials.</p>
<p>We are eager to make a game which feels like <i>Battlefleet Gothic TM</i>, a turn-based tactical game on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The rules may be different, but the experience will be as much enjoyable!</p>
<p>Move your units with your fingers like you would with miniatures! Play with your friends remotely or next to each other and enjoy huge battles in deep space!</p>

Summary
Do you like Spaceships? Maybe you prefer huge Battlecruisers?
Or perhaps you even dream of epic battles between space fleets?
In 1999, Games Workshop Ltd released Battlefleet Gothic TM, a specialist miniatures game about ""Spaceship battles in the 41st millenium"". The game was and is still acclaimed for its ruleset and balance.
Sadly, it has been discontinued and it's getting harder and harder to find the materials.
We are eager to make a game which feels like Battlefleet Gothic TM, a turn-based tactical game on mobile devices.
The rules may be different, but the experience will be as much enjoyable!
Move your units with your fingers like you would with miniatures! Play with your friends remotely or next to each other and enjoy huge battles in deep space!

How will it play

 
Moving your ships will be easy: you will just have to touch the movement line and your ship will go there.
Touching the Helm or the Throttle will allow for precise movement: your ship will move the exact distance to reach the turning spot or its maximum speed.


Shooting with your ships is also straightforward: choose the weapon you want to use. All targets in range and in the arc of fire will become available to select.
Then you will just have to touch the desired target to let guns do the talking.

Here you can see a rough exemple of how the user will manipulate the game. We are still prototyping, so your insights are most welcome!




Who are we ?
We are a team of videogame veterans, that love good games, no matter the platform. We are all nostalgic about tabletop and videogames from past era, and many other things that make us feel old.
We all come from videogame and computer science industry.
Some of us worked on AAA titles like Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, others on more humble mobile platform, and other others on multiplayer games.
We are absolutely confident the game is doable and that it will be great.
What we are doing now is making a prototype, to transform our thoughts into concrete and touchable matter.


Why do we need money and what is that prototype stuff?
Yes, why? The requested amount is not enough to develop a full game, so what does that mean ?
That's all legitimate questions. This campaign is all focused on the playable prototype on Android, and access to game conventions to bear our project like the world on Atlas' shoulders.
The money will be spent there:


Allow our super 3-men team of veterans to work day & night on the protoype (and maybe feed them, we'll see).
Get hardware devices to confront the prototype with harsh reality, and not only with the dream-world of emulators.
Buy Passes to game conventions (Game Connection, Independant Game Festival...) with all the logistics. Our donkeys are tough but crossing the ocean will be hard for them.

The prototype will be used for:


Show people we are not kidding. We are not. Really.
Challenge the User Interface with our big and messy fingers.



What you will get



The project is clearly in its early stage. We won't lie, it's still a small hydrogen cloud that will eventually become a burning star.
The pledges are low because there is no need for high prices and rewards.
Starting at 5$, you will get a beta access and an account on the dev forum. You'll be able to play the game and tell us your thoughts about User Interface, balance, etc.
If you want to get more invested, you can become a Prime Fleet Captain or Admiral. We will send you a special poster (Captain) or flag (Admiral), with a unique number to show everyone that you were the firsts to support the project. All posters and flags will also be hand-signed by the team!
We will propose several artworks and you'll be able to vote for the one you'd like to see printed (separate votes for Captains and Admirals).
Later, we will invite all Captains and Admirals to post a picture of themselves with their poster / flag. It will be a battle for the best number!
Why no copy of the game as reward?
That's quite strange, isn't it? It's even more questionnable since we are making a mobile game, and the price probably won't go higher than 5$ (and may even not reach it).
So why don't we give free copy for supporting people?
As we said, this campaign is for the prototype. It will allow us to present the game to various investors. Even if the campaign is a success, there is a possibility the the game itself won't make it.
If everything goes well, you will get the final game for sure. However, as we are not 100% sure it will be the case, we'd rather make no false promise.



Risks
There are risks. All space travels are risky, you can always hit a ***ing asteroid coming from nowhere and get your cockpit depressurized.
The major risk is not being able to raise funds for the complete game. In that case, you will get we have (the prototype and/or early builds).



Want to help more?
If you really want to see the project finished, there are some things you can help with :

Talk to your friends about it. Maybe you are a tabletop player? Spread the word accross your opponents circle.

<p>In a steampunk London, during Jack the Ripper's killing spree, all the inhabitants of the city have recurrent nightmares every night.<br/>A wizened old man, draped in colorful clothing and strange amulets, knocked at your door. He told you he knows the way to stop these nightmares, and free everyone. The cure is buried in the sewers, protected by members of a strange cult, eager to sacrifice you to their alien Other Gods, or feed you to one of the horrible creatures that haunt the sewers.<br/>This is a first person dungeon crawler, in which you are investigating the London sewers about this epidemic of nightmares, while other creatures try to kill you. The underground is randomly generated, so every playthrough is different. The player can be one of many character classes: you can be a member of a street gang, a scholar of the hermetic arts or a scoundrel that lives in the thin line between light and dark, or many other classes.

<p><strong>A note regarding objects:</strong><br/>Every object will have a durability, determining its quality.

<h1 align=""CENTER"" class=""western"">The Sewer</h1>
<div class=""postcontent"">
<p>In una Londra steampunk, al tempo degli efferati omicidi di Jack lo Squartatore, gli abitanti della città hanno incubi ricorrenti tutte le notti.</p>
<p>Un vecchio uomo raggrinzito, vestito con colori sgargianti e strani amuleti, bussa alla tua porta. Ti dice che conosce il modo per fermare questi incubi, e liberare tutti. La cura è seppellita nelle fogne, protetta da membri di strani culti, desiderosi di sacrificarti per le loro strane Altre Divinità, o diventare cibo per una delle creature orrende che infestano le fogne.</p>
<p>E' un dungeon crawler in prima persona, in cui stai investigando nelle fogne di Londra riguardo l'epidemia di incubi, mentre altre creature provano a ucciderti. Il sottosuolo è generato casualmente, così che ogni partita sia diversa. Il personaggio può appartenere a una delle diverse classi: puoi essere il membro di una gang di strada, uno studente di arti ermetiche o una canaglia che vive nella sottile linea tra la luce e l'oscurità, o varie altre classi. Ci sarà anche un mercato online dove poter vendere gli oggetti che trovi nel dungeon agli altri giocatori che giocano a The Sewer.</p>
<p>Lo sviluppo del gioco è già in corso, e continuerà successivamente anche dopo il rilascio della prima versione del gioco, per aggiungere nuovi funzionalità e migliorie. Mentre sarà sviluppato verranno usati modelli 3d temporanei. Finché non sarà possibile pagare uno studio di modellazione (metà della cifra indicata per tutto il progetto) dovremo usare questi modelli provvisori e la grafica che vedrete negli screenshoots non rifletterà l'aspetto grafico finale. Potrete trovare gli aggiornamenti su Facebook ( <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheSewerGame"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/TheSewerGame</a> ) o sul sito web ( <a href=""http://sewer.sfrajone.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sewer.sfrajone.org</a>)</p>
<p>Il gioco è sviluppato usando Unity 3d e sarà multipiattaforma (Windows,Mac, Linux) e girerà anche su device mobili (iOS e Android).</p>
<p>Potete trovare la raccolta fondi per lo sviluppo su <em><strong><a href=""http://igg.me/at/thesewer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/at/thesewer</a></strong></em></p>
<p>I fondi sono richiesti per: <br/> - Acquistare la licenza di Unity PRO;<br/> - Pagare professionisti di modellazione 3d per la realizzazione della grafica del gioco; <br/> - L'hardware necessario per lo sviluppo; <br/> - Pagare i server internet per l'hosting.</p>
<p><strong>Alcune note sullo sviluppo</strong> <br/>Verrà adottato il metodo ""no number"" spiegato nella pagina <a href=""http://mu.ranter.net/design-theory/general-topics/the-no-numbers-concept"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://mu.ranter.net/design-theory/general-topi...</a><br/>Le statistiche e i vari valori all'interno del gioco non saranno visualizzabili dal giocatore come numeri, ma verranno utilizzati degli aggettivi che corrisponderanno a uno spettro di valori numeri. Ad esempio la qualità di un oggetto potrà essere: eccellente,buona, normale, scarsa.<br/>I punti ferita che indicano quanti danni è possibile subire ancora verranno rappresentati solo graficamente o attraverso percentuali (questione ancora da valutare), mentre per capire quanto un avversario sia più o meno forte del personaggio, verrà modificata la dimensione rispetto ad esso: I nemici più forti saranno rappresentati fisicamente più grandi mentre quelli più deboli relativamente più' piccoli.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Note riguardanti gli oggetti.</strong><br/>Ogni oggetto al suo interno avrà dei punti ferita che determinano la qualità. Nel caso dell'equipaggiamento sono un numero a scalare di punti d'impatto, mentre nel caso di armi sono un numero di punti di danni che riesce a infliggere.<br/><br/>Oltre gli oggetti che occuperanno uno spazio nel proprio personaggio, sarà possibile associargli equipaggiato un talismano fatto dagli studenti ermetici o un artefatto fatto dagli ingegneri per potenziare i bonus.<br/><br/>Gli oggetti possono essere venduti dai commercianti presenti all'esterno del sistema fognario, in cambio di soldi. Oppure attraverso il banco dei pegni, se gli oggetti sono di un certo valore, possono essere impegnati in cambio di una cifra gravata di interessi per un mese, se non verranno riscattati in tempo, finiranno all'asta e possono venire acquistati dagli altri giocatori.<br/>Altrimenti direttamente il giocatore può vendere direttamente gli oggetti all'asta agli altri giocatori.</p>

<h2> FAQ</h2>
<p><strong>Come mai IndieGoGo mi chiede direttamente il pagamento, e non al raggiungimento del goal come Kickstarter ?</strong><br/><br/>La piattaforma di finanziamento è stata scelta in questo modo per poter accedere in ogni caso ai fondi che permettono di avere dei miglioramenti o velocizzare lo sviluppo e nella resa del prodotto finale. In ogni caso, e' garantito al 100% a chi preoacquista il gioco di averne una copia una volta finito lo sviluppo, i soldi spesi non andranno buttati, anche perché secondo l'accordo con IndieGoGo, presuppone che i perks reclamati vengano consegnati obbligatoriamente in ogni caso.<br/><br/><strong>Cosa succede se nn si raggiungono i fondi ? Il gioco uscirà lo stesso ?</strong><br/><br/>Si, il gioco uscirà lo stesso. La raccolta fondi serve per riuscire a stringere i tempi, e per pagare risorse che altrimenti non saranno utilizzate o saranno utilizzate in tempi più laschi<br/><br/><strong>Quando uscirà il gioco ?</strong><br/><br/>Tenteremo di far uscire il gioco per l'inverno del 2013, ma la data diverrà certa con l'andamento della raccolta fondi. Speriamo che la data di rilascio in ogni caso non slitti più' di tanto. Verrà data priorità alla versione per computer rispetto alla versione per dispositivi mobile.</p>

If they're not reedemed in time, they'll be auctioned to all the other players.In addition, every player will be able to auction their items to other players directly.

The Sewer

In una Londra steampunk, al tempo degli efferati omicidi di Jack lo Squartatore, gli abitanti della città hanno incubi ricorrenti tutte le notti.
Un vecchio uomo raggrinzito, vestito con colori sgargianti e strani amuleti, bussa alla tua porta. Ti dice che conosce il modo per fermare questi incubi, e liberare tutti. La cura è seppellita nelle fogne, protetta da membri di strani culti, desiderosi di sacrificarti per le loro strane Altre Divinità, o diventare cibo per una delle creature orrende che infestano le fogne.
E' un dungeon crawler in prima persona, in cui stai investigando nelle fogne di Londra riguardo l'epidemia di incubi, mentre altre creature provano a ucciderti. Il sottosuolo è generato casualmente, così che ogni partita sia diversa. Il personaggio può appartenere a una delle diverse classi: puoi essere il membro di una gang di strada, uno studente di arti ermetiche o una canaglia che vive nella sottile linea tra la luce e l'oscurità, o varie altre classi. Ci sarà anche un mercato online dove poter vendere gli oggetti che trovi nel dungeon agli altri giocatori che giocano a The Sewer.
Lo sviluppo del gioco è già in corso, e continuerà successivamente anche dopo il rilascio della prima versione del gioco, per aggiungere nuovi funzionalità e migliorie. Mentre sarà sviluppato verranno usati modelli 3d temporanei. Finché non sarà possibile pagare uno studio di modellazione (metà della cifra indicata per tutto il progetto) dovremo usare questi modelli provvisori e la grafica che vedrete negli screenshoots non rifletterà l'aspetto grafico finale. Potrete trovare gli aggiornamenti su Facebook ( https://www.facebook.com/TheSewerGame ) o sul sito web ( http://sewer.sfrajone.org)
Il gioco è sviluppato usando Unity 3d e sarà multipiattaforma (Windows,Mac, Linux) e girerà anche su device mobili (iOS e Android).
Potete trovare la raccolta fondi per lo sviluppo su http://igg.me/at/thesewer
I fondi sono richiesti per:  - Acquistare la licenza di Unity PRO; - Pagare professionisti di modellazione 3d per la realizzazione della grafica del gioco;  - L'hardware necessario per lo sviluppo;  - Pagare i server internet per l'hosting.
Alcune note sullo sviluppo Verrà adottato il metodo ""no number"" spiegato nella pagina http://mu.ranter.net/design-theory/general-topi...Le statistiche e i vari valori all'interno del gioco non saranno visualizzabili dal giocatore come numeri, ma verranno utilizzati degli aggettivi che corrisponderanno a uno spettro di valori numeri. Ad esempio la qualità di un oggetto potrà essere: eccellente,buona, normale, scarsa.I punti ferita che indicano quanti danni è possibile subire ancora verranno rappresentati solo graficamente o attraverso percentuali (questione ancora da valutare), mentre per capire quanto un avversario sia più o meno forte del personaggio, verrà modificata la dimensione rispetto ad esso: I nemici più forti saranno rappresentati fisicamente più grandi mentre quelli più deboli relativamente più' piccoli.
Note riguardanti gli oggetti.Ogni oggetto al suo interno avrà dei punti ferita che determinano la qualità. Nel caso dell'equipaggiamento sono un numero a scalare di punti d'impatto, mentre nel caso di armi sono un numero di punti di danni che riesce a infliggere.Oltre gli oggetti che occuperanno uno spazio nel proprio personaggio, sarà possibile associargli equipaggiato un talismano fatto dagli studenti ermetici o un artefatto fatto dagli ingegneri per potenziare i bonus.Gli oggetti possono essere venduti dai commercianti presenti all'esterno del sistema fognario, in cambio di soldi. Oppure attraverso il banco dei pegni, se gli oggetti sono di un certo valore, possono essere impegnati in cambio di una cifra gravata di interessi per un mese, se non verranno riscattati in tempo, finiranno all'asta e possono venire acquistati dagli altri giocatori.Altrimenti direttamente il giocatore può vendere direttamente gli oggetti all'asta agli altri giocatori.

 FAQ
Come mai IndieGoGo mi chiede direttamente il pagamento, e non al raggiungimento del goal come Kickstarter ?La piattaforma di finanziamento è stata scelta in questo modo per poter accedere in ogni caso ai fondi che permettono di avere dei miglioramenti o velocizzare lo sviluppo e nella resa del prodotto finale. In ogni caso, e' garantito al 100% a chi preoacquista il gioco di averne una copia una volta finito lo sviluppo, i soldi spesi non andranno buttati, anche perché secondo l'accordo con IndieGoGo, presuppone che i perks reclamati vengano consegnati obbligatoriamente in ogni caso.Cosa succede se nn si raggiungono i fondi ? Il gioco uscirà lo stesso ?Si, il gioco uscirà lo stesso. La raccolta fondi serve per riuscire a stringere i tempi, e per pagare risorse che altrimenti non saranno utilizzate o saranno utilizzate in tempi più laschiQuando uscirà il gioco ?Tenteremo di far uscire il gioco per l'inverno del 2013, ma la data diverrà certa con l'andamento della raccolta fondi. Speriamo che la data di rilascio in ogni caso non slitti più' di tanto. Verrà data priorità alla versione per computer rispetto alla versione per dispositivi mobile.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<div>This is a campaign to raise the final bit of funding needed to bring my dream to life - a full, comprehensive Gaming-themed bar for my hometown of Falmouth, Cornwall. With the only remotely similar bar closed and moved to London, the time is ripe to make this happen!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The plans include</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Three dedicated HDTV sets, one each for Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft</li>
<li>Another HDTV easily switchable between a Megadrive, SNES and N64</li>
<li>A full-size standing Arcade Cabinet, boasting over sixty popular, classic titles (Including a number of Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat titles, Metal Slug, Bubble Bobble, Donkey Kong, Pacman etc.)</li>
<li>A dedicated, seperate area for either card gaming or the playing of RPGs (Need a specific night for your group? Hire the space!)</li>
<li>Full, free, high-speed customer Wi-Fi</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's just the gaming side of it!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We already have a premises picked out at <strong>29 High Street, Falmouth (Currerntly ""The Underground"")</strong>, and we already have £35,000 in funding - it's enough to cover the premises and all expenses with buying the remainder of the lease. This is in part personally, and in part bank funded, but the amount we have isn't quite enough, though the hard part is done!</p>
<p>What we need now is the capital to furnish and stock the Bar, and bring it to life.</p>
<p>The £5,000 funding we're asking for is going to the following places.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>£1,200</strong> for out standing arcade cabinet. This is already picked out, and earmarked for us!</li>
<li>
<strong>£1,000</strong> for the purchase of all four major consoles, and enough peripherals to enable simultaneous four-player on each, at once.</li>
<li>
<strong>£1,800</strong> for four Samsung 42"" 5-series 1080i Full-HD TVs, including wall-mounting</li>
<li>
<strong>£1,000</strong> budget for the purchase of a wide range of titles for the consoles. The aim is to have a comprehensive, if not exhaustive range of titles for each system to keep everyone entertained. Any remainder from this sum will be kept seperate to fund new releases as they happen!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Overfunding</h3>
<p>If we manage to get over our target (!) we'll be spending the money on the bar, in the same vein as above. Every single contribution will go straight into enhancing the bar for every single customer, in the following order.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>£1,100 </strong>A tabletop-style arcade maching to compliment the seating area, of the same quality and depth of choice as our standing arcade cabinet (From the same people).</li>
<li>
<strong>£950</strong> A ceiling-mounted projector to turn the back wall of the bar into the ultimate competitive gaming ground. Life-Size Mario Kart, anyone?</li>
<li>
<strong>£450</strong> An accompanying surround-sound system for the projector, making it the focal piece of an evenings competitive gaming. You've never played Guitar Hero like this, I promise!</li>
</ol>
<p>And on, and on, and on!</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Alright, so besides giving yourselves a new place to drink and enjoy the latest games, with friends, in spacious, comfortable surroundings, what's in this for you?</p>
<p>Well, at the very least, (<strong>£5</strong>) you'll have your name (Or your gamertag, if you prefer!) drawn into a mural in the hallway leading from the front door, forever showing every person to walk through the door exactly who made this possible. You!</p>
<p>At <strong>£10</strong>, you'll get yourself a free drink, and ten free credits for our standing arcade cabinet, to spend as you wish.</p>
<p>At <strong>£25</strong>, we'll make that three drinks, double your number of free arcade credits to 20, and make sure your name is listed higher in the list of thanks!</p>
<p>At <strong>£50</strong>, we'll sweeten the deal even further. You'll get the choice to inspire either a cocktail or a shot/bomb from your favourite game, name it, and see it immortalised on the menu, alongside your name! You'll of course get three free samples of your creation to help ""playtest"" it. Not only that, you'll still get thirty (30!) free games on our Arcade Cabinet, three more drinks of your choice, and your name will be even higher on the Mural of Thanks!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every single penny of your contribution is going straight into making the 8-BIT Bar everything it needs to be. Every person who donates, as well as adding to the dream, re-enforces the idea that this is the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I sincerely and honestly believe in this idea, and that's why I'm willing to put my money where my mouth is. Unfortunately, there's just not quite enough money to fill my mouth just yet, and without this comparitively small amount, there will be no Bar.</p>
The whole reason behind choosing Indiegogo for this was the fact that, if some of you believe enough to donate, to fund this wonderful space where we can hang out in an area designed for people who share our interests, then I still get what you put in without meeting that goal. Because this bar will happen. It will. And every penny goes to that eventual goal - Not funding this is not the end. It just delays it a while.</div>
<div>The reason for wanting it funded now is the fact that the premises we've found is perfect. I'm in love with it. Genuinely, I feel this is the best place the bar could ever happen. Missing the goal will mean time to build more funds to reach our target, but also losing out on this beautiful building</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's why I'm reaching out to <strong>you.</strong>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you just don't have the funds to help out - that's fine! I understand! You're in no way obliged to donate to help us out. Just get the word out! Let everyone know what we intend, and we'll see you when it happens!</p>
<p>You could always...</p>

<h2>NATIONS the powered board game</h2>
<h3>One little spark</h3>
<p>The cloud over Europe after World War II has just settled into a deceiving peace when in the background two new powers set up their army for one final strike. The world is a powder keg ready to burst...and it would only take one little spark to blow it up- NATIONS is telling the story</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>New era of games – powered board games</h3>
<p>So called powered board games combine the best of two game-worlds: the fun of classic board games and the power of smart devices (f.e. tablets, smartphones,computers and so on). This combination makes a brand new, breathtaking game experience possible. You can develope complex economic or production mechanics which are easily handled by your smart device. This also gives you the possibility to secretly engage in diplomacy or espionage between you and other players. There are unlimited possibilities - all you need is the elements of a board game and one smart device!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Gameplay</h3>
<p>In NATIONS every player chooses a leading nation of one of the three fractions (capitalism, communism and neutrals). The goal is to find the right mix between military power, diplomacy, science and espionage to conquer the whole world. Some of the game elements like the map, soldiers, dices are printed. Others like military supplies, science, diplomacy and espionage are controlled from your tablet. We created a special combination with real dices, virtual battlefields and special weapons on the tablet for a completely new battling system. To build up power you have to occupy countries. Depending on the external borders the player gets production points (=the money in the game) for each country he's taking over. After a turn the active player passes the tablet on to the next player so it is possible to play the game with only one device! <br/><br/><img alt=""NATIONS - gameplay"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://powered-board-game.com/indiegogo/gameplay.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Better together – Our team of developers</h3>
<p>We are a team of five who for the most part know each other since childhood. The shared passion of playing any kind of games lead us to the decision of creating our life’s dream: telling you a breathtaking historical story while playing a special thrilling kind of game. <br/><br/>You want to know more about us:</p>

<h2>It’s all about the money</h2>
<h3>Help us to take the next step and reach our goal</h3>
<p>The main goal is to raise $8,000 ,which is going towards the complete playable game including two fractions fully illustrated, the whole app for Android and iOS, the dices and all printed game pieces. <br/><br/> Any additional money will give us the ability to expand and add even more features to the game. <br/><br/> If we don’t reach our goal,your contributions aren’t lost! NATIONS the powered board game will be launched either way, even if in that case our hard working team will have to eat humble pie. <br/><br/><img alt=""NATIONS - goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://powered-board-game.com/indiegogo/goals.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

English Translation
As you can see English is a (little) challenge for us but nevertheless we decided us to spend our money into the game developing and not into translating our pitch text. To take care of our community feedback we want to straighten out that for the finalized game we will pay for a professional translation because we want to produce a high-quality product as our published game elements show you.

NATIONS the powered board game
One little spark
The cloud over Europe after World War II has just settled into a deceiving peace when in the background two new powers set up their army for one final strike. The world is a powder keg ready to burst...and it would only take one little spark to blow it up- NATIONS is telling the story
 
New era of games – powered board games
So called powered board games combine the best of two game-worlds: the fun of classic board games and the power of smart devices (f.e. tablets, smartphones,computers and so on). This combination makes a brand new, breathtaking game experience possible. You can develope complex economic or production mechanics which are easily handled by your smart device. This also gives you the possibility to secretly engage in diplomacy or espionage between you and other players. There are unlimited possibilities - all you need is the elements of a board game and one smart device!
 
The Gameplay
In NATIONS every player chooses a leading nation of one of the three fractions (capitalism, communism and neutrals). The goal is to find the right mix between military power, diplomacy, science and espionage to conquer the whole world. Some of the game elements like the map, soldiers, dices are printed. Others like military supplies, science, diplomacy and espionage are controlled from your tablet. We created a special combination with real dices, virtual battlefields and special weapons on the tablet for a completely new battling system. To build up power you have to occupy countries. Depending on the external borders the player gets production points (=the money in the game) for each country he's taking over. After a turn the active player passes the tablet on to the next player so it is possible to play the game with only one device! 
 
Better together – Our team of developers
We are a team of five who for the most part know each other since childhood. The shared passion of playing any kind of games lead us to the decision of creating our life’s dream: telling you a breathtaking historical story while playing a special thrilling kind of game. You want to know more about us:

<br/><h3>The Producer</h3>
<i><b>Brief Background</b></i> :<br/>               Hi, My name is John and i have always been a gamer since i was little. I grew up in a small town called ""Albay"" of Legazpi City, Bicol Region, Philippines and graduated with a course of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. I've worked as a Technical Support Representative for the last five years but my passion for game and arts never left me. Early of 2012 i decided to work and study at the same time and took up the course of 3D arts and Animation in First Academy of Computer Arts in Makati City. There, i fell in love with Maya and started to explore other 3d softwares that helped me enhance my skills. When Unity was introduced i literally flipped and became addicted on how the software works. Latter of that year, i quit my job as a level 2 Technical Support Representative and started a new career as 3D freelance artist. From there on i have worked with gaming companies as a home based freelance artist.<br/>                Early of the year 2013 i became an in-house 3D artist of a gaming company here in the Philippines and with the help of my previous colleagues we conceptualized a game that will show our Philippine Culture but at the same time will also have western feel on it and so came to be the team ""Lakbay Studios"" and gave birth to the game ""Ang Babaylan"" (The Sorcerer).<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/710031/files/20140711032714-goal.jpg?1405074434"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i><b>Goal :          <br/></b></i>               The main goal of the campaign is to gather enough funds to support the production of the game. Currently we have finished the first level and the story, however, with the current team, finishing the entire game will take much longer as we are only composed of a few. This Campaign will enable the team to expand and hire individuals needed to shorten the time of production thus giving an acceptable Milestone upon finishing the game. In addition, the funds will also help the team  purchase software licenses and additional hardware needed to speed up the production process.<br/><br/><br/><h3>The Team<br/>

We feel that Filipinos are ready to compete and go with whatever is out in the gaming industry.<br/><br/>The game, if proven successful, will serve as a major step of the team (Lakbay Studios) in creating fun-filled exciting games. We hope that this will serve as a beginning of many more gaming projects to come.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/710148/files/20140711051149-loadingg.jpg?1405080709"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p style=""text-align: justify;""> In the early production of the game, the team found it very difficult as it requires a huge amount of time consumption in producing the game itself. Some colleagues needed to choose between their regular day job and the team, unfortunately our numbers began to lessen as we move further on the production. Though we barely made it, we were able to overcome these hurdles by focusing our time and effort on the game, sticking on a tight pipeline. Time management, maximizing resources and with best effort of the remaining team members, we were able to at least partly finish a level of the game.</p>
<p>Great Passion and Dedication these are the main elements of what makes the team profound, and i believe with your help we can make this game happen.</p>

Eliseyah will train Baltog to be a warrior that would defeat Kareem and after 5 years he will then embark on a journey in pursuit of the said perpetrator only to find himself traveling to a different dimension and encountering creatures that he had never seen before.

The Producer
Brief Background :               Hi, My name is John and i have always been a gamer since i was little. I grew up in a small town called ""Albay"" of Legazpi City, Bicol Region, Philippines and graduated with a course of Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering. I've worked as a Technical Support Representative for the last five years but my passion for game and arts never left me. Early of 2012 i decided to work and study at the same time and took up the course of 3D arts and Animation in First Academy of Computer Arts in Makati City. There, i fell in love with Maya and started to explore other 3d softwares that helped me enhance my skills. When Unity was introduced i literally flipped and became addicted on how the software works. Latter of that year, i quit my job as a level 2 Technical Support Representative and started a new career as 3D freelance artist. From there on i have worked with gaming companies as a home based freelance artist.                Early of the year 2013 i became an in-house 3D artist of a gaming company here in the Philippines and with the help of my previous colleagues we conceptualized a game that will show our Philippine Culture but at the same time will also have western feel on it and so came to be the team ""Lakbay Studios"" and gave birth to the game ""Ang Babaylan"" (The Sorcerer).
Goal :                         The main goal of the campaign is to gather enough funds to support the production of the game. Currently we have finished the first level and the story, however, with the current team, finishing the entire game will take much longer as we are only composed of a few. This Campaign will enable the team to expand and hire individuals needed to shorten the time of production thus giving an acceptable Milestone upon finishing the game. In addition, the funds will also help the team  purchase software licenses and additional hardware needed to speed up the production process.The Team


Who are we?


            Lakbay Studios was founded on the first quarter of 2014. The
 Company's main goal is to bring about a game that will entice the 
imagination of the players and at the same time introduce cultures of 
the founders origin. ""Lakbay"" is a Filipino word that means ""Journey"" , 
as the company embarks a journey to create a fun filled exciting game 
for the general audiences.

- Should the team not meet the goal needed for this campaign, we will still push through with the project, for we believe in what we do, and our hearts passion is to have the game completed.

  The Impact The main aim of the project is to showcase bits of information of Philippine culture and folklore through the game. We feel that Filipinos are ready to compete and go with whatever is out in the gaming industry.The game, if proven successful, will serve as a major step of the team (Lakbay Studios) in creating fun-filled exciting games. We hope that this will serve as a beginning of many more gaming projects to come.

  Risks & Challenges  In the early production of the game, the team found it very difficult as it requires a huge amount of time consumption in producing the game itself. Some colleagues needed to choose between their regular day job and the team, unfortunately our numbers began to lessen as we move further on the production. Though we barely made it, we were able to overcome these hurdles by focusing our time and effort on the game, sticking on a tight pipeline. Time management, maximizing resources and with best effort of the remaining team members, we were able to at least partly finish a level of the game.
Great Passion and Dedication these are the main elements of what makes the team profound, and i believe with your help we can make this game happen.


  Other Ways You Can Help -Though some may not be able to help financially , there are ways to help the team. We ask you guys to spread the word about the game and share or post it on social networking site, such as Facebook, twitter etc. so that people would know of the games existence. 
- We understand that there's a lot of people that's very busy so spreading the word through your friends, through text, posting on Facebook or twitter will very much likely make the game happen!

<p>I have been a tabletop gamer all of my life and the game
that originally got me hooked was the Games Workshop tabletop American football
styled game ‘Blood Bowl’. I played this for many years as a child and have recently
got back into the hobby as an adult, regularly attending tournaments in the UK
and Europe playing this particular system.</p>
<p>I have seen other manufacturers creating frog teams in the
past but have never seen one that gripped me. With the many different systems
available nowadays to play games of this style I thought it would be great to
introduce this to the world myself.</p>
<p>The main objectives that I wanted to achieve with the
project were for the miniatures to:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Have lots of character and a classic look</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Actually look like they are wearing a fantasy
version of American football gear</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Be beautifully sculpted</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Stick to the 28mm scale</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Be cast in high quality white metal</p>
<p>My favourite fantasy football miniatures of the last few
years have all been sculpted by one man, <b>Pedro
Ramos</b>. In my opinion his style was absolutely perfect for this project and
he was the first sculptor that I approached. Luckily, he was keen to do this
project and we quickly began to bounce ideas off one another on how the frogs
should look.</p>
<p>The next consideration was who should cast the miniatures
themselves. After doing some research I discovered that <b>Griffin Moulds JJP Ltd. </b>(casters of the incredibly well
manufactured Guild Ball miniatures) were only an hour’s drive from my home.
After visiting them and running through the project with them I was convinced
of not only their professional nature but also the incredibly high quality of
their work.</p>
<p><b>What is needed to
push the project forward and what are the risks?</b></p>
<p>This project is fairly unique in that the miniatures sculpts
for the main campaign are already complete. I have invested thousands of pounds
of my own money in order to create the team up front, greatly reducing the risk
to the backers of the campaign. The masters are completed, the casters are on
board and everything is geared up to start producing the teams once the
campaign achieves its funding goal.</p>
<p>However, I am not running this as my main business (I have a
career that I enjoy) and will need to redeem my initial investment before
production can begin. This is where you come in. I have set the campaign goal
at a figure that will ensure that I cover the costs of my initial investment
and the production of the miniatures that I plan to be sending out to you all
in the near future. Also, as this is not to be my main source of income I may not produce the team indefinitely after the campaign has ended so the teams you purchase may be quite a limited edition.</p>
<p><b>What will you get for
backing my campaign?</b></p>
<p>There are various different perk levels that allow backers
to contribute whatever they can afford and these will give whatever collection of items that is detailed
in the description. However, backers of any of the ‘TEAM’ deals will receive
not only what is detailed in the description but also all of the unlocked stretch
goals (excluding the newly added 'ADD-ON' stretch goals). These unlockable stretch goals will include a mix of star players, variant
positional poses, side-line miniatures, exclusive miniatures and more depending
on how much is raised! If the total raised is far above and beyond what is
expected then ‘add-on’ perks may be added to give backers more options as well.
Regardless of your contribution, all backers will receive <b>FREE WORLDWIDE SHIPPING</b> on their perks.</p><p><br/></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">The Team Itself</b><br/></p><p>The team itself is designed specifically to provide a great representation of all of the positionals commonly used in fantasy football games. Linefrog 7 is designed to look more like a quarterback / leader in order to allow it to be utilised as a thrower, allowing the team to be used in game as a broader mix of teams. At present there are just two unique blitzer poses which will be doubled up in the 'team' deals (although they will be provided with a head sprue in order to allow customisation of these figures).

<p>Jashan (17) and Davinder (28) are born and raised in
Patiala, northern part of India. They are suffering from very rare disease
called <b>limb girdle muscular dystrophy</b>. With this disease both siblings had a normal childhood till the age of 11 and
then suddenly they started losing muscular strength in their legs. By the age
of 13, both have been bed ridden with zero muscular strength in their lower
body. Both are high school graduates and love life. Jashan is a sweet girl with
a high acumen and Davinder is a brave boy with multiple face offs with death.
His latest trip to ER has changed his perspective towards life and now he just
wants to make others happy and travel.</p>
<p>Their father is the sole bread winner and retired last year.

Jashan (17) and Davinder (28) are born and raised in
Patiala, northern part of India. They are suffering from very rare disease
called limb girdle muscular dystrophy. With this disease both siblings had a normal childhood till the age of 11 and
then suddenly they started losing muscular strength in their legs. By the age
of 13, both have been bed ridden with zero muscular strength in their lower
body. Both are high school graduates and love life. Jashan is a sweet girl with
a high acumen and Davinder is a brave boy with multiple face offs with death.
His latest trip to ER has changed his perspective towards life and now he just
wants to make others happy and travel.
Their father is the sole bread winner and retired last year. Post retirement life has been tough for the family. This one time campaign is to help Jashan and Davinder. Funds raised during this campaign will directly benefit
them for paying off their bills and day to day needs. All funds will be transferred to their account and we will provide all proofs of fund transfer.

What We Need & What You Get
 Our goal is to raise minimum of 1000$ for the family. More money we raise, longer we will keep this family afloat. All contributors will be notified of all the updates and will receive the blessings of the Jashan, Davinder and family. 
Our secondary goal is to create awareness about this rare disease and more we share it among our friends and family, better it is to create the awareness. We do want to continue this secondary goal beyond this find raising campaign and we will continue posting updates on campaign facebook page.

The Impact
 Impact of financial help is huge for this family. Awareness about this disease has potential to recognize these people in our communities and help them.
    
Risks & Challenges
No risk and challenge is big enough as compared to risks and challenges faced by this family every day. Davinder latest trip to ER where he was pronounced dead has changed our perspective to deal with risks. We all believe he is a gift for all of us and our campaign will help him in so many ways including financially and emotionally.




My commitment:
As part of our commitment to this cause, Gagandeep Singh Bachhal will take on a ride up on one of the highest mountain roads in Colorado, USA, Pikes Peaks on his Royal Enfield (Bullet) in the month of August 2015. Both Jashan and Davinder approved my goal and they are equally excited.

Playing games was the first I've discovered having touched my first computer Apple II. I really love playing computer games and personally I find the multiplayer online games as most exciting so two years ago decided to put all my experience toward game development.

We decided to begin a great project together: to bring the PopolVuh myth into a videogame for children. Me, the father, with more than 20 years of software development experience offered my services  to my little son, who has more than 7 years of videogame experience and a great imagination :) 
The story.  We chose the most electrifying story that we all study, in Mexico and Latinamerica when going to elementary school: The popolvuh, the creation story of the Maya...
  Here is the story of the
beginning, 
  when there was not one bird, not one fish,
  not one mountain.
  Here is the sky, all alone.
  Here is the sea, all alone.
  There is nothing more
  –no sound, no movement.
  Only the sky and the sea.
  Only Heart-of-Sky, alone.The videogame.   Certainly, we needed to adapt the story to make it videogame attractive, so we decided to divide it in 7 different chapters, which offer 7 different videogame levels, where children will have the opportunity to join the two princes brothers who crossed 7 Mayan kingdoms, braving dangers and getting new friends.Children will have great fun using special powers to defeat the evil reptilian and monsters who persecuted the princes during the 7 worlds.Our videogame production will be coming to the market by parts, in the form of a Popopulvuh videogames saga:Chapter 1: ""The Kingdom of Birds""!!Chapter 2: ""The Animal Kingdom""!!Chapter 3: ""The Kingdom of Mud""!!Chapter 4: ""The Kingdom of Wood""!!Chapter 5: ""The Kingdom of the Apes""!!Chapter6: ""The Kingdom of the Mayan Warriors""!!Chapter 7: ""The Return of the Birds""!!The production.  This is certainly our first videogame production, we are still learning on the go, however we are highly excited and motivated to achieve our goal together.Although we started with a group of only 2 people (father and son), time after, we managed to organize and compile the effort of many highly talented freelancers from many parts of the world: writers, cartoonists, modelers, programmers, musicians, translators and voice actors. With a good project management methodology and spending all our savings :)  ...  we managed to build up step by step a videogame production, which we believe, will bring a unique message and a lot of fun to worldwide children.Our production is based in the concept of family ties, it counts the story of Popolvuh, underlining the family feelings and love among brothers, parents, grandparents and friends.We used the narrative style, which offers narrative segments like a movie and gameplay elements which work together to create a fantastic world of entertainment.The fisrt chapter to be completed.   Our videogame production is right now in phase of testing for Chapter1, looking forward to come out to the market with: Chapter 1: ""The Kingdom of the Birds"" - The origin of the Maya begins …The internationalization.  Our production  includes more than 1,000 words in the form of videos, dialogues and voice instructions, which were made completely in Mayan language and another 16 worldwide languages:  English, Spanish from Mexico, Spanish from Spain, Portuguese, Chinese -Mandarin, Hindi, Bengali, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Russian,  Japanese, Korean, Turkish and Indonesian. How did we do that? ... ""fiuhh, it was a great experience interacting on the web  with so many people from all over the world, who helped us as voice actors :)   ... We will give special thanks to all of them, actually we made a very nice 3DMax video credits for that""The music.  You know that all nice video games include a special song, so we made our own song. We didnt have money to pay an important and famous musician, so we we made it on our own. You won't believe how good this song sounds. Sorry that I am not attaching here videos and songs right now, since we are still protecting all this material for the moment that we come out to the market with the complete production.We made the song in a rock style, I wrote it on my own, I learned some Mayan expressions, so I composed the song beginning with some  lyrics in Mayan language, then English words and then the chorus in Spanish alternating with English Spanish. Everyone who has listened to the song, they really adore it. They say the song is  very lively and rhythmic, so that will help us to send a great message to the world :) The videogame platform. We used Unity3D as platform of development to integrate our videogame production. That means that potentially we could publish the resulting videogame to be played upon multiple console platforms such as PC, Mac, Xbox, Play Station , Nintendo and Wii.  However it is almost impossible to get a  license to publish upon those dominant worldwide console platforms when you are nobody :) ...  So we will have to start deploying the videogame to be played upon Web PC. Eventually, when we make good noise in the market then we could think of talking to the other big companies. Our web videogame on testing...The financial challenges we need to overcome. At this moment, we have invested so much money during 16 months continuously that we cannot keep the rythm any longer, but we need to finish testing and  cleaning many small tech details of the mentioned first chapter to be able to launch it to the market and have a great quality product to compete with another productions. We have already talked to some International publishers who are very interested on our product, mainly because it is something very different, no violence and rich of culture.  So we need a package of money in order to (1) finish the production with our local freelancers and (2) to bring the production to Japan to be played and corrected by another group of more experimented professionals (a specialized studio to publish INDIE productions) who can help us to clean it, so we can finally finish it and launch it to the international market.The estimated date to launch the production to the market: Looking forward to be in the market on November 1st, 2014   We will appreciate your financial support infinitely 
As we mentioned above, we need at least $100,000 USD in order to achieve our goal by launching a historical videogame production to the market.

We will use $30k USD in salaries for mexican freelancers (4 people, 4 months) to complete the production (testing and cleaning) 
We will use another $30k USD for traveling expenditures to go to Japan to correct the production final details (flights, accomodation, food and local transport for 4 people during 8 weeks)
We will use another $40k USD to pay initial consulting fees (additionaly of 30% for success fees that we have negotiated with them)
Your help, whatever it is, will make a great change in our lives. Thank you for believing on us.The impact of your money on us.  If we get more financial support than we are initially requesting here, then we will use that money to go right ahead and start the  next chapters of our production at the same time that we complete the first chapter:
Upto $100k USD then we'll complete Chapter 1: ""The Kingdom of Birds""!!

Upto $300k USD then we'll also make Chapter 2: ""The Animal Kingdom""!!
Upto $400k USD then we'll also make Chapter 3: ""The Kingdom of Mud""!! 
Upto $500k USD then we'll also make Chapter 4: ""The Kingdom of Wood""!!
Upto $600k USD then we'll also make Chapter 5: ""The Kingdom of the Apes""!!
Upto $700k USD then we'll also make Chapter6: ""The Kingdom of the Mayan Warriors""!!
Upto $800k USD then we'll also  make Chapter 7: ""The Return of the Birds""!!
More than $800k USD then I will open a formal studio for videogame productions with a quality assurance department and  to focus entirely on completing the complete Popolvuh videogame saga.  If we have gone so far using only  late nights and weekends, I am sure that we could make great productions in a top quality level when focusing full time

About us
I always loved platforming games, action games and a good brain teaser, so i decided, why not make a game that would combine all the best features of the different genres. The game we are creating will make your brain work overtime solving the puzzles and break your fingers trying to reach that clue.
""The curse of Moorden"" is a third-person game for PC/Mac. It combines action, platforming and puzzle games.


Story background

The story takes place in the kingdom of Moorden, ruled by the evil necromancer king. He rules with an iron fist and is known for his cruelty. But it wasn’t always so. Ages ago he had a different reputation. Everyone loved him. But that changed when he became ill. His illness almost cost him his life and so he started his path to learning the secret of immortality. By the time he found immortality he was a different man. There was no good left in him, only darkness. His men found the four ancient artifacts, each representing an element of life. The artifact of water, fire, wind and earth. He summoned all the wizards in his kingdom to perform the ritual of immortality.The ritual did not only make him immortal, it also gave immortality to his armys. Later he ordered his most trusted men to hide and protect the artifacts. But some of the wizards rebelled and  decided to steal one of the artifact to ensure that one day, a hero will rise to save the kingdom from the tyrant king. This is where your journey starts. Support us to experience the end of this tale.


Hall of fame explained (credits)

The hall of fame is a playable series of rooms that are dedicated to all people that have contributed to the game. During your travels you will find various treasures, which will be displayed in these rooms once you find them.
There will be three rooms, bronze, silver and gold. The names of all our contributors will be engraved and displayed in these rooms. The location of your name depends on your chosen contribution.
Example: Bronze, Silver and Gold contributors have a separate room and design of their name plates/engravings. 
 

How will the money be used

We will use the funds that we raise with your help to fund the development and finalization of the game. We have young talented people working on the project that need to be paid for their work. We still need to create some characters, animations and record the story line.

<p>Herzlich willkommen bei der Crowdfunding Kampagne von Kako no Koi! Die erste deutsche Visual Novel auf Indiegogo! Ich bin ein großer Fan des japanischen Visual Novel Genres und träume schon seit langem davon eine eigene Visual Novel zu erstellen. Das Problem dabei ist, dass ich natürlich nicht alles alleine machen kann und potentielle Mitarbeiter natürlich nicht von der Luft und der Liebe leben können, bezahle ich andere Leute dafür um z.B. Zeichnungen anzufertigen. Da ich selbst nur Schülerin bin, kann ich dieses Projekt unmöglich selbst finanzieren, deswegen benötige ich eure Hilfe!</p><p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.abload.de/img/crowdfunding7zd83.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Crowdfunding""/></p>
<p>Mit dieser Kampagne auf Indiegogo möchte ich versuchen genügend Geld zusammen zu bekommen, um mein Visual Novel Projekt Kako no Koi (das ist japanisch und heißt so viel wie verflossene Liebe) finanzieren zu können. Das Ziel ist 5000 €, sollte diese Summe erreicht werden, wird die Vollversion komplett kostenlos sein! Wenn die Summe nicht erreicht wird, kostet die Vollversion dann wahrscheinlich um die 15 € und schließlich bevorzugt jeder kostenloses Spiele, oder? Sollten über 6500 € zusammen kommen, wird noch eine zusätzliche Route eingebaut. Die Belohnungen für einzelne Summen stehen rechts. Geplant sind Releases für Windows, Mac, Linux und später vielleicht auch für Android. Das Genre ist Romantik, Drama und Mystery. Die verwendete Engine ist Ren'py.</p>

<p>Hier folgt nun eine kurze Beschreibung der Handlung. Naoya Kiriyama, der Protagonist von Kako no Koi ist ziemlich am Ende, seit seine jüngere Schwester Nagi aus Liebeskummer sich selbst umbrachte. Die Zeit verging und Dank seiner Freunde fühlt sich Naoya besser. Eine große Stütze für ihn ist seine Kindheitsfreundin Chizuru Futami. Beide sind unzertrennlich und verstehen sich bestens. Außerdem muntert ihn Chizurus beste Freundin Tsukasa Hanamiya auf und mit der Zeit verliebt sich Naoya in sie. Doch als er ihr mutig ein Liebesgeständnis macht, weist diese ihn zunächst ab. Die Zeit vergeht und Naoya gibt nicht auf, was sich am Ende bezahlt macht. Tsukasa willigt ein, seine Freundin zu werden. Beide sind glücklich und verbringen eine schöne Zeit zusammen, doch dieses Glück bleibt nur vor kurzer Dauer... Bei einem Unfall kommt Tsukasa ums Leben, was Naoya wieder in Depressionen stürzt. Wird Naoya es schaffen seine Trauer zu überwinden? Wird er Tsukasa vielleicht wieder sehen? Das erfahrt ihr, wenn das Crowdfunding erfolgreich abgeschlossen wird!</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.abload.de/img/naoya2nl22.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Naoya""/></p>
<p>Naoya Kiriyama ist der Protagonist und dessen Rolle der Spieler versetzt wird. Er ist ein Schüler im zweiten Jahr an der Oberschule und Mitglied im Okkultclub. Er ist ein netter, friedfertiger Mensch, aber kann auch ziemlich stur sein. Als Kind war er eine ziemliche Heulsuse und ist am liebsten vor Problemen weggelaufen. Dank seiner Kidnheitsfreundin Chizuru ist er selbstbewusster geworden.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.abload.de/img/chizuru7ebho.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Chizuru""/></p>
<p>Chizuru Futami ist Naoyas Kindheitsfreundin und geht in die selbe Klasse wie er. Sie ist das Sportass der Schule und möchte später einmal eine professionelle Läuferin werden. Außerdem ist sie durch ihre offene, hilfsbereite Art sehr beliebt bei den Mädchen und hat sogar schon das ein oder andere Liebesgeständnis von anderen Mädchen bekommen. Obwohl sie Naoya immer gute Ratschläge erteilt, liebt sie es ihn zu ärgern.</p>

<p>Tsukasa Hanamiya ist Chizurus beste Freundin und wird später Naoyas feste Freundin. Sie ist schüchtern und ruhig. Am liebsten verbringt sie Zeit in der Schulbibliothek, wo sie auch ehrenamtlich aushilft. Sie wird immer wieder von Jungs angemacht und obwohl sie kein Interesse hat, sind viele der Schülerinnen neidisch auf sie und mobben sie auch ab und zu. Durch einen Vorfall in der Mittelschule hat sie eine leichte Angst vor Männern entwickelt.</p>

<p>Nagi Kiriyama ist Naoyas jüngere Schwester und ging bis zu ihrem Tod noch in die Mittelschule. Sie liebt Geistergeschichten und versucht auch zu beweisen, dass Geister tatsächlich existieren.

Doch bald zeigt dieser seine wahre Gestalt und durch verschiedene Vorfälle sieht Nagi keinen anderen Ausweg mehr, als sich selbst umzubringen.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Wahrscheinlich werden sich viele fragen, wozu den 5000 € für das Crowdfunding gebraucht werden. Da die Preise für die Zeichnungen je nach Aufwand variieren und ich jetzt natürlich noch nicht weiß, wie viele Grafiken am Ende brauche ist das schwer einzuschätzen.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;"">Die Kosten für CGs sind am schwersten einzuschätzen, da die Zeichnerin nach Zeit berechnet.

Der Prolog und die Commonroute sollen 5 CGs umfassen mit 2 Personen (Wahrscheinlich werden es aber mehr werden) wäre das 475 €. Die 5 Charakterrouten sollen 10 CGs bekommen, wieder mit zwei Personen per CGs gerechnet wäre das dann 950 €</p>

Last weekend, I participated in the regional Weiss/Schwarz card game tournament in North Carolina. I placed in the top four, which won me an invitation to the national tournament in Rochester, NY on October 27, 2013. In the event that I win at the national level, I get to be sent (for free) to Japan for the World Grand Prix tournament.</p>
<p>I've never really been into card games in the past, but this game has basically taken over my life. I spend at least an hour a day studying the different sets of cards and trying to recognize basic Japanese to give me a competitive edge. I'm practicing really hard and I'm aiming to win at Rochester (or, at least represent well- I'm the only one that's actually from the southeast that's going so far).</p>
<p>I'd really like to go, but the cost is quickly escalating to a point where it would be seriously detrimental to my finances. I need to obtain my deck in Japanese (because of a dumb licensing rule) in order to play in Rochester, which is going to cost me around $150 to $175. A ticket to Rochester (both ways) is sitting around $200 to $250. I think I can use my dad's Marriott points for a room (riiiiight, Dad?), so that's taken care of. I will also need money for renting a car or paying a cab to take me to the shop, depending on the age policy for renting a car there. And of course, for incidentals like food while I'm there.</p>
<p>Expense, right? So, I'm asking you, my friends. I will gladly exchange labor/chores/crafting/whatever you can think of for funding my trip! Of course, living reasonably nearby or asking something of me that doesn't require my physical presence is something to be considered.

If you're reading this, you probably know me, Jessi. Last weekend, I participated in the regional Weiss/Schwarz card game tournament in North Carolina. I placed in the top four, which won me an invitation to the national tournament in Rochester, NY on October 27, 2013. In the event that I win at the national level, I get to be sent (for free) to Japan for the World Grand Prix tournament.
I've never really been into card games in the past, but this game has basically taken over my life. I spend at least an hour a day studying the different sets of cards and trying to recognize basic Japanese to give me a competitive edge. I'm practicing really hard and I'm aiming to win at Rochester (or, at least represent well- I'm the only one that's actually from the southeast that's going so far).
I'd really like to go, but the cost is quickly escalating to a point where it would be seriously detrimental to my finances. I need to obtain my deck in Japanese (because of a dumb licensing rule) in order to play in Rochester, which is going to cost me around $150 to $175. A ticket to Rochester (both ways) is sitting around $200 to $250. I think I can use my dad's Marriott points for a room (riiiiight, Dad?), so that's taken care of. I will also need money for renting a car or paying a cab to take me to the shop, depending on the age policy for renting a car there. And of course, for incidentals like food while I'm there.
Expense, right? So, I'm asking you, my friends. I will gladly exchange labor/chores/crafting/whatever you can think of for funding my trip! Of course, living reasonably nearby or asking something of me that doesn't require my physical presence is something to be considered. At the moment, I am living in Boone, but traveling back to the Raleigh area frequently. 
Thanks so much for helping me out! I love all of you and I know that money is tight at the moment, so even if you can support me in spirit, I appreciate it a lot!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">The main idea of this project is to test the ability of the human mind using the oldest and most challenging board game in the world - <strong>GO (baduk, weiqi)</strong>. If you are already familiar with this game, you know that it is played on 19x19 board (361 intersections). The goal of this project is to make this 4000 year old game really <em>extreme</em>. To reach this goal, we have to create the largest GO board in the world - 57x57 (3249 intersections) and play a mind game record match on it.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Two teams having 8 players each will play on the biggest board in the world. Players will be quite strong so that they can focus on the whole game. We are planning to invite players from different countries.</p>

Go is the second most played game in the world, behind Xiangqi (Chinese Chess).

Go is simple enough for a 4 year old to learn, but too complex for computers to beat expert players.

The world's largest Go game is played in Oita, Japan on a 40 x 40 meter large field. One round stone is 1,8 meters wide and its weight is about 1 kilogram.


Go is considered one of the premiere challenges for programmers of artificial intelligence. There is no super computer which can win against professional Go player.


There is a historical story that in the 17th century, the rule of Tibet was once decided over three games of Go.

Go has an immense impact on the mental development of children, particularly in the area of reasoning.

Chess is primarily a left brain game. Go actively stimulates both the right and left sides of the brain.

<div>Quint is an entirely new game - or a well-known type of game with a twist. It is extremely simple to learn and play, but it can be quite tricky to master. Quint can be played against your computer's or smartphone's AI or against real life opponents via a game server. Games in progress can be saved, and players can post their triumphs to various social media. The game is suited for players from approx. 12 years of age.</div>
<div>
<p>Each player has 7, 8, 9 or 10 pieces depending on the desired difficulty. 10 pieces = quite easy. 7 pieces = pretty tough. The pieces are placed in turn on a board, and the winner is the one who first achieves a certain geometric shape.</p>
<p>Sounds simple? It is - and isn't. A game may last from a few minutes to several hours, and difficulty is adjusted by using many or fewer pieces.</p>
<p>Playing Quint requires only a minimum of strategic skill, and no luck at all. Whether you win or lose, it's all your own doing :-)</p>
<p>Since games can't be copyrighted (only game designs can), we're unable to be entirely specific about the finer details of the gameplay, but trust us - you'll enjoy it!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.rubens.dk/Windows-banner.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Why do we need your support?</span></strong></p>

<p>If the project does not meet the entire goal, the launch will be postponed and another campaign will be launched.

</div></div>","My Story


Hello, my name is Laura-Lee Walker and I believe social games can help real-world charities achieve their goals.I want to set-up a social enterprise that does exactly that.

My mission is to create an online social game that connects people with non-profits to raise awareness about issues that matter.Social
 games are web-based games like Mafia Wars and CafeWorld that you 
can play on social networks such as Facebook and FourSquare.One 
need only to look at usage statistics of social gaming to demonstrate 
their popularity: 20 million people are registered players of Mafia Wars
 and over 100 million people are active on FarmVille.Now imagine...
 every time a person plays their beloved game, they contribute something
 of value to a charity. The more they play, the more the charity benefits. Simple.With over 200,000 charities in Canada and 1 million in the US alone, the potential impact of popular social games is staggering.Here's where is get interesting:My vision is for a game that allows people to give in the most 
social way possible, feel more of a personal connection than by simply 
cutting a check and support any number of specific
 charities while having mad-fun.
So
 how does this charity-based gaming model work? Players use their sphere of influence to support charities that align with their values.Starting to get excited? Me too!
With changes in the online world of social media, there are so many opportunities for innovation.This game is the first of its kind. The social good that can be achieved through its success is monumental. I've cried from the happiness of knowing the good this game can do for so many charities on an international level.
Gamers will know that they are helping charities in a significant way. This is something each one of them can beproud of.Thank you for supporting me in this unique, online opportunity to help others in need.

<p>Capital ships are the backbone of a fleet and will be controlled in the 3rd person, providing a unique perspective of the unfolding battle. Individual weapons can independently target or be focused on a single enemy depending on field of view. There are three types of capital ship within Battlescape, each filling a specialized role:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Destroyers -</b> The smallest and most maneuverable of the capital ships - destroyers are densely fitted with light weaponry to protect their larger brethren from swarms of fighters and bombers.</li>
<li>
<b>Cruisers -</b> Heavy weapons platforms capable of reducing enemy infrastructure and capital ships to rubble within minutes. Despite their awesome power they are particularly vulnerable against bombers fitted with long range weaponry.</li>
<li>
<b>Carriers -</b> Mobile spawn points capable of launching, refueling, and refitting small to medium spacecraft. A carrier has a finite number of spawnable ships however its squadrons can be replenished at a space station or base. With a limited number of light defensive weapons a carrier is particularly vulnerable once its squadrons have been destroyed.</li>

A match begins with each team being allocated some combination of space stations, planetary bases, factories, and AI controlled defense turrets. Each player will start with a moderate amount of credits with which they can upgrade or customize their ship and equipment, or acquire new ships.

 Every couple of minutes a factory spawns a cargo ship which will transfer raw materials to the nearest space station or planetary base for processing into credits. These credits are split evenly among the members of the team however if the cargo ship is destroyed its owners lose the credits. Players are able to donate credits to other members of their team so that they can pool resources.


 

Small ships with first-person, twitch based newtonian controls will provide players with high speed dogfights inspired by those seen in sci-fi film and television. We've implemented a flight model that makes each planet a unique experience based on drag, thrust to weight ratio, atmospheric density, and turbulence.


Interceptors - Your standard fast, sleek, highly maneuverable killing machine. They are primarily designed for destroying enemy light spacecraft.

For starters we have the default skin for a Hellion corvette as pictured below. We'll use this as a baseline for demonstrating some of the fun things we can do to allow you to customize the look and feel of your ships.
Think of decals for ships in Battlescape the same way you would for your car. If you buy a black Chevrolet Camaro and decide to paint gold wings on the hood the wings would be considered a decal. Similarly the Hellion pictured above has a baseline paint job with an SF-1 Racing decal.

You can think of a skin as a whole new paint job. It's the same as buying a white Camaro with blue lights in the undercarriage instead of a stock black Camaro. As you can see in the image above we've completely changed the look and feel of the Hellion. Here are some more examples:

<p style=""text-align:justify;""> Meiko Miniatures is a small company producing miniatures for Fantasy
Football. We offer alternative designs to the ones existing and we provide the
players with a wide variety of miniatures to help them complete their teams. To
achieve this we always work with the most talented sculptors.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""> We have made 6 previous Indiegogo
campaigns: Lizardmen, Kaos Dwarves, Ratmen, Undead / Necromantic, Kaos Pact and
Kaos. <b>All the packages of these six
campaigns were shipped just 3 months after the end of each campaign</b>, accomplishing
the estimated shipping dates stated on the campaign descriptions.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""> The Meiko <span>Miniatures new project is the <b>Ultimate Norse Team</b>. This team will
include the following 16 Players: 1 Snow Troll, 2 Ulfwerners, 2 Blitzers/Berserkers, 2 Throwers, 2 Catchers / Runners, and 7 Norse Linemen. The campaign
will also include 5 Star Players that can play with the Norse Team (including a
Snow Troll Star Player) and several more items: two pitches  (Rollable Gaming Mat and Puzzle-like Hard Pitch), a </span><span>Norse
Football,</span> a Norse
Range Ruler, one Norse Injury Dice, a Set of 3 Norse Block Dice, a Set of 2d6 Norse
Dice, Two Turn and RR Counters and Two Prone / Stunned Snow Troll Tokens.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""> We are pretty excited with this project, since <b>this is the first Meiko Team totally
designed with 3D sculpting</b>. We want to make clear that in the future, Meiko
Miniatures will keep launching teams traditionally handmade sculpted. But from
now on, we will also launch 3D sculpted teams, alternating them with handmade
sculpted teams. This Meiko Norse Team is the one than starts this new stage for
Meiko Miniatures regarding sculpting.  </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""> <b>The sculptor of this team is </b><b>Sergi Torras,</b>
the acclaimed 3D sculptor of several popular Fantasy Football Teams, like the
Iron Golems Dark Elf and Human Teams or the Star Player Miniatures Wood Elf
Team, among others. Before being hired by Games Workshop for the Warhammer
line Sergi Torras sculpted the Meiko Norse Team. Sergi is considered by many Fantasy Football fans as one of the
best and most talented Fantasy Football 3D sculptors worldwide. We all
hope that in the future he will work again for the Fantasy Football community. Franarcilla will sculpt using 3D the upcoming Star
Players if their Stretch Levels are near to be unlocked .  </p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;""> <b>All the miniatures will be
casted in metal</b>. The sculpting of most of
these miniatures has already been made. We need your help to speed up the casting process. That way, we
will be able to release the Meiko Norse Team much sooner than what was
initially planned. Using Indiegogo as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot
since we can finance new miniatures and other interesting items, obtain
feedback from our customers and it gives us confidence to keep working on. In
exchange you will get some cool rewards.</p>

<br/></div>","About us
 Meiko Miniatures is a small company producing miniatures for Fantasy
Football. We offer alternative designs to the ones existing and we provide the
players with a wide variety of miniatures to help them complete their teams. To
achieve this we always work with the most talented sculptors.
 We have made 6 previous Indiegogo
campaigns: Lizardmen, Kaos Dwarves, Ratmen, Undead / Necromantic, Kaos Pact and
Kaos. All the packages of these six
campaigns were shipped just 3 months after the end of each campaign, accomplishing
the estimated shipping dates stated on the campaign descriptions.

Why crowdfunding?
 The Meiko Miniatures new project is the Ultimate Norse Team. This team will
include the following 16 Players: 1 Snow Troll, 2 Ulfwerners, 2 Blitzers/Berserkers, 2 Throwers, 2 Catchers / Runners, and 7 Norse Linemen. The campaign
will also include 5 Star Players that can play with the Norse Team (including a
Snow Troll Star Player) and several more items: two pitches  (Rollable Gaming Mat and Puzzle-like Hard Pitch), a Norse
Football, a Norse
Range Ruler, one Norse Injury Dice, a Set of 3 Norse Block Dice, a Set of 2d6 Norse
Dice, Two Turn and RR Counters and Two Prone / Stunned Snow Troll Tokens.
 We are pretty excited with this project, since this is the first Meiko Team totally
designed with 3D sculpting. We want to make clear that in the future, Meiko
Miniatures will keep launching teams traditionally handmade sculpted. But from
now on, we will also launch 3D sculpted teams, alternating them with handmade
sculpted teams. This Meiko Norse Team is the one than starts this new stage for
Meiko Miniatures regarding sculpting.  
 The sculptor of this team is Sergi Torras,
the acclaimed 3D sculptor of several popular Fantasy Football Teams, like the
Iron Golems Dark Elf and Human Teams or the Star Player Miniatures Wood Elf
Team, among others. Before being hired by Games Workshop for the Warhammer
line Sergi Torras sculpted the Meiko Norse Team. Sergi is considered by many Fantasy Football fans as one of the
best and most talented Fantasy Football 3D sculptors worldwide. We all
hope that in the future he will work again for the Fantasy Football community. Franarcilla will sculpt using 3D the upcoming Star
Players if their Stretch Levels are near to be unlocked .  
 All the miniatures will be
casted in metal. The sculpting of most of
these miniatures has already been made. We need your help to speed up the casting process. That way, we
will be able to release the Meiko Norse Team much sooner than what was
initially planned. Using Indiegogo as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot
since we can finance new miniatures and other interesting items, obtain
feedback from our customers and it gives us confidence to keep working on. In
exchange you will get some cool rewards.

</div></div>","About us
Workbench Studios is a team of young game designers from Skopje , Macedonia.


Our dream is to become game developers one day and make awesome games that people will enjoy playing. We're currently giving our best and putting a lot of effort in our first game. We're working everyday , designing and discussing about new ideas and what can be implemented into the game , removing bad things and trying to be as creative as possible. We're four members at the moment and looking to expand with people willing to help us achieve our dream.
                 
                     About Wounded
Wounded is a first person horror game that offers an immersive and realistic environment along with many strange things and mysteries that you will soon uncover. 

The game puts you in a role of a father who finds himself in a strange , abandoned place after having a car accident while returning from a family trip with his daughter Lisa. After waking up you realize that things are not like they look like and Lisa is gone missing from the passenger seat. As you start to look for her you find out new things about the place and as far as you know they are not very pleasant.         Why do we need your support?
         

We need your support because we're currently only four people working on the game and our programmer recently quit because he couldn't find the time to work enough and he didn't want to slow us down. 

We have a bit of trouble with money that we need to continue developing since we're too young to have a job. Also the game is being made with the free version of Unity , we are planning to buy Unity Pro if our project gets funded. 

 

                               Risks & Challenges We're aware that we're not the only one out there trying to make their dreams come true and achieve their goals. That is why we are giving our best to make it happen. 
We're also aware of the risks on our way to achieving our goal for example : - Our project doesn't get funded and we may not continue our progress.- We do not find another programmer.- Someone also has to quit for some other reasons.

                      Other Ways You Can Help       Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help!
Anyone who supports us but cannot donate for some reason , can help us in many other ways!  - Any programmer , 3D modeler , Animator who wants to help us with the developing of Wounded can contact us on our Facebook page and join the team.- If you liked the announcement trailer feel free to leave a like or share it with other people.  - Share our campaign with others.Please note that we accept any ideas for the game and if you have any thoughts on how we can improve feel free to contact us on our Facebook page. We respect all opinions even if they are bad so please feel free to tell us. It will help us improve!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Let's Go Outside and Play Together!

GrowGames has Three Goals for Food Action:
1. GAME:  #SeedstheGame are mobile games that teach you how to grow and then get you gardening outside in real life
2. JAM: Game jams connect you to local players to form or join teams and clubs to design, garden, and play together
3. THRIVE:  Receive useful tools and vibrant seeds through our rewards and for tackling challenges in the game and then use them to grow with your friends
Seeds is a Series of Mobile Games Created with YOU

We want to shift the way people use technology: instead of shutting you off from the world, our games showcase the most beautiful and amazing things growing around us and then challenge you and your friends to go out and find them in real life.

We LITERALLY put the tools, and the seeds, in your hands to grow the kind of garden you've always dreamed of.


Join us as a seed planter, designer or developer at a game jam, a beta testing player growing food with friends or action hero garden expert to level up your guild and share knowledge worldwide. Clues to gameplay are hidden in our series of videos starting with the first video above and releasing weekly every Wednesday in 2014. Come back to watch the updates and learn how to level up with Grow Games.

Connect Gardens Worldwide & Play an Ecosystem of Experiences 

We connect gardens in gratitude with our shared heritage and we tell this story in our games.  Whether you're an individual gardener or part of an established organization, this is your invitation to join us and get in first for our soundtrack of music, games, game jam events and actions in your area to grow together in guilds and food leagues.

Together with dozens of our favorite artists we are offering this limited edition game jam alpha release for you, straight from the best festivals and events around the world as a preview for music in gameplay. With your support we are launching a series of mobile games in 2015 and you will get the first download codes & access. The more we raise together, the faster we can produce this series for you. 

Grow Food, Play with Friends, Save Money: GAME JAMS
We mix permaculture education, game design and community playtesting into local events to engage people who may be new to game development and gardening. 

Some of our games like Symponix and Pested include great music - all of our games are tools designed to help you grow food together. We create together at game jams with community experts and game designers from many backgrounds.

As a thank you for helping us build these games we are producing a mix of our game music together with our favorite musical artists. You, the perfect beta testers, get the perfect seed album to start your garden adventures.
We are creating healthy homemade perks including custom food items with our gardeners and city farmers if we meet our goals. Stay tuned for our video releases every Wednesday including our PERKS video coming soon and help us sell out and share more SEEDS!
A Gratitude Garden Jam for you to enjoy anywhere 

Mixed by Jesse Wright (Lightning in a Bottle, Artist Director) joined by a huge harvest of artists with gratitude for all of their amazing hard work. We will be announcing artists every week and you can head over to our Soundcloud for more music to garden by.

Seed Packs & Special Gift Packs with Sensors
We are making gift baskets with special perks for our first beta testers and supporters including jewelry from artist Cristina McAllister, one of our character designers. Some of the perks listed include shipments of sensors for the home, school or community garden including arduino-based soil sensors and weather stations. Gameplay will help you link your sensors to play in coming iterations and we encourage you to make your own data centers in your garden to keep track of your soil health and climate needs for healthy gardens. 


Early Bird Worm Specials & Farm to Table Play
Get in first for early access to the downloads and beta codes! Seed packs and special gift packs include extras to share. In-game our early worm will give you insight on your soil health and help you get in first for our games and apps even before they are released to the public. You can sign up to be an early playtester and come to our game jams to get involved in game and app development....plus get in on the secret prizes available only for the first week of this campaign.


Seeds Launch Party in Vista
In 2015 we will be hosting an event for our top crowdfunding supporters where they will receive all sorts of wild infusions of new seeds and special prizes.

<h3><b>FAQ</b></h3>
<p><b>Q: What do I need to do when I get to the location?</b><br/><i>A: Players will have to find the hidden image and scan it with their Bink app, unlocking special offers from vendors or cash prizes ($100 up to $1000) having an option to donate a certain part of their prize to a participating NGO and in turn making the world a better place.</i></p>
<p><b>Q: What does it mean to Pay-It-Forward?</b><br/><i>A: We keep track what portion of any prizes that you win in a live leaderboard. It shows how much money is paid forward to non-profits and how much is kept by the players. Our hope is that the community will autonomously balance itself and that greed will not overshadow giving; eventually we see Bink creating a sustainable way for non-profits to fund raise on a global scale through our game platform and this IndieGogo campaign. </i></p>

<h3>Community testimonials:</h3>
<div>From the HULT International Business School pilot:</div>
<div>
<p>""It was great to experience the culture more. It involves
you, its not like you are just walking around. It gets you engaged with your
environment.""</p>
<p>""It was an awesome day having the treasure hunt, we got to know a
lot about each other, just figuring out the activities, where to go, our sense
of orientation and direction. I feel like I know the city better. I know how to
get around better. It was a pretty awesome day. It really was!"" </p>
<p>""The app was great. It was slick. It was fresh. No bugs. You could track live scores of other teams and see how they are doing. It was a lot of fun and we had an amazing time. Great app!!""<br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>""The best part was that as we
were roaming all over the streets without knowing anything about the city at
all. Bink! rocks! Its awesome to move through the San Francisco
streets. I enjoyed the game. Keep rocking!""</p>
<p>""The best part was that it tracked our live progress and showed us in the map; instead of
using a piece of paper to mark something. Here we can see that a visual effect
is much better than a written response. It was a bonus to see that once we
uploaded a picture we could see that other teams we competing.""</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">""The apps clarity, inclusion of
the logo scan, the presence, the positioning of the logos, and featuring a
leaderboard, that was amazing.  That was
something that I found to be new to an app. The integration of the scan and the
GPS was the best thing that I saw. It was the best activity to start our MBA
program. I have lived and roamed around the city these past few days, I feel
that I know it better now.  Good job guys!""</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">""It’s an exclusive stand-alone
app for adventure. It makes complete sense to use
something like this because you have exact locations to goto. You have
activities to do once you have reached the goal. It would be great for any brand to
consider using this platform.""</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">""It was the excitement to
cover all the spots that drove us to do this. We were having great fun out
there. I really want to thank you for the application that you prepared. It's
very useful. Each and every college, I would advise them that they should
create this kind of activity that will enhance our knowledge and skill along
with motivating us. Something new is good and this is good. It created some
serious positivity for me!""</span></p>

KICK OFF 2015 on the right foot and be a part of the Bink! movement.


Receive special CODES to exclusive private games on our Twitter feed @thebinkworld. 



It all starts soon.





WHAT IS BINK!?

Bink is a
mobile game where players are asked to navigate to a target area in the real world and recognize (scan) an image with their smartphone camera to unlock and win a
reward with the option to Pay-it-Forward to participating NGOs!
The Game is all set to go! We just need YOUR help with the reward fund to start populating the real world with Bink quest spots! Players will search for secret logos on the streets of San Francisco and with your help all across the globe, unlocking $100s in cash rewards!
Once you complete a quest we'll provide you a money transfer code you will be able to use at any Money Gram / Western Union location.
Will players keep rewards or pay them forward to NGO...? The leaderboard will show.




 





FACTS:
For the 1st time ever, we are spending more time on our smart devices that in front of the television, over 5 hrs. a day. Our kids are on their devices in the car, at the dinner table, practically everywhere, from the moment they wake until the moment they sleep. We are building relationships with our smartphones rather than our families. It is through our smartphones that, Bink! reconnects us with what really matters, the real world. Get back to reality and experience real world adventures with your friends playing Bink!









BINK! WILL LAUNCH A GAME SOON!
All you have to do is get to the location where a secret hidden object is located, find the special image and scan it with the Bink! mobile application. You will unlock a $100!!! reward and can either collect the cash or Pay-It-Forward to a partnering non-profit organization and help those in need.



We love real world adventures and video games! Now you can enjoy these loves at the same time while earning rewards, even cash money ($$)!



THE COOLEST THING
As the Indiegogo campaign takes place we are adding more locations into the Bink! World for players to win. The more you contribute the more challenge areas we will release! After the 3rd week of January we will begin to notify players that have downloaded the app about new Bink! challenges. 
Get out and play Bink!
This is an adventurous mobile game that presents each player with a unique opportunity to reconnect with the real world and enjoy a healthy active activity. (Hint: Be on the lookout, as Bink! grows so will the competition.) If you seek the feeling of achievement then this is right up your alley. 



ABOUT BINK! WORLD:










Every day new challenge areas will be activated.
Players will see challenges on the map inside the Bink! app.
Using the clue provided players will have to find a secret image that is hidden inside the area and scan it with the Bink! app.
Whoever manages to scan the image first gets the reward! Cash rewards can be redeemed in as little as 15 minutes from completion of the challenge. We  use a money transfer service provider, like Money Gram or WesternUnion, they have locations all over the USA. It's cash right here and right now. Special offers will be redeemed at participating vendor's storefronts.
Each winner can donate a portion of their reward to a participating non-profit. We are looking for new partners. Email us at join@thebrandedapp.com and check out the $1 Non profit perk.

Community testimonials:
From the HULT International Business School pilot:

""It was great to experience the culture more. It involves
you, its not like you are just walking around. It gets you engaged with your
environment.""
""It was an awesome day having the treasure hunt, we got to know a
lot about each other, just figuring out the activities, where to go, our sense
of orientation and direction. I feel like I know the city better. I know how to
get around better. It was a pretty awesome day. It really was!"" 
""The app was great. It was slick. It was fresh. No bugs. You could track live scores of other teams and see how they are doing. It was a lot of fun and we had an amazing time. Great app!!""


""The best part was that as we
were roaming all over the streets without knowing anything about the city at
all. Bink! rocks! Its awesome to move through the San Francisco
streets. I enjoyed the game. Keep rocking!""
""The best part was that it tracked our live progress and showed us in the map; instead of
using a piece of paper to mark something. Here we can see that a visual effect
is much better than a written response. It was a bonus to see that once we
uploaded a picture we could see that other teams we competing.""
""The apps clarity, inclusion of
the logo scan, the presence, the positioning of the logos, and featuring a
leaderboard, that was amazing.  That was
something that I found to be new to an app. The integration of the scan and the
GPS was the best thing that I saw. It was the best activity to start our MBA
program. I have lived and roamed around the city these past few days, I feel
that I know it better now.  Good job guys!""
""It’s an exclusive stand-alone
app for adventure. It makes complete sense to use
something like this because you have exact locations to goto. You have
activities to do once you have reached the goal. It would be great for any brand to
consider using this platform.""
""It was the excitement to
cover all the spots that drove us to do this. We were having great fun out
there. I really want to thank you for the application that you prepared. It's
very useful. Each and every college, I would advise them that they should
create this kind of activity that will enhance our knowledge and skill along
with motivating us. Something new is good and this is good. It created some
serious positivity for me!""

</div></div>","Keep using your mouse and keyboard as before and add an entirely new input channel! Do more at the same time and speed up your gaming. Handle even complex key bindings with a simple twitch of your foot.

 
Making use ot the broadly established HID (Human Interface Device) Protocol, the Bcon automatically works with all games and software that support keyboard controls - no need for any driver installation. 

Focus on WASD and your mouse and let the Bcon handle the rest! 

Always to the point - easily unleash complex combos in the heat of battle! 

Immediate access to up to 24 additional keys! 

Immerse yourself the way you want! 
From OBS, to 3D modeling, to all sorts of creative software. Bring efficiency and comfort into your professional life with a device that works with every established software out of the box. 

The Bcon’s broad compatibility brings motion control even to your SmartTV or cell phone!
 


The Bcon's Dynamic Sensor System combines the results of the constant measurements within fractions of milliseconds to achieve optimal results in different situations. 
 
The wearable recognizes four effortless moves: lift heel or lift toes (pitch), tilt right or tilt left (roll) and translates real-time measurements into precise input.
The device measures your movements at a velocity of 1,000 measurements per second and is capable to recognize changes at up to 2,000 degrees per second for responsiveness and accuracy when it matters most.The Bcon compensates for non-mono-directional movement patterns by ignoring small values on the alternative axes.
Seamlessly stall all actions triggered by the Bcon whenever you need it! 

Allocate Pause to any keyboard key to temporarily prevent the Bcon from sending any command to your PC. This allows you to easily switch games and even leave your computer without removing the device. After your break just remain in a relaxed position and continue to game on!

The Bcon is designed for highly complex key bindings giving you up to 24 additional hotkeys or 4 key sequences of up to 6 keys each through the versatile configuration software. 
 
Freely adjust the device’s sensitivity and decide when you want a command to be sent. Whether it´s just a quick press of a single hotkey or keeping multiple keys pressed - experience the full spectrum of your keyboard at a flick of your foot.

Chain up multiple keys to create powerful combos without any automation! 
 
Each combo is created within the device’s firmware, achieved without automation scripts for authenticity and can be interrupted at any point to react to changing game contexts.

We’ve taken into account the unconscious movement, position shifting, and the natural flow of gaming. 
 
To prevent the Bcon from triggering unwanted or unconscious commands (its hard to keep your feet still in the heat of the moment!) we have integrated a -5° to 5° protection zone on both the longitudinal and lateral axis. To keep up with your individual habit of fidgeting we additionally made this protection zone fully adjustable beyond the -5° to 5° range.
Freely change your sitting position! 
 
The player can reset the zero point at any time and the Bcon will interpret movements according to its new spatial orientation. As gaming sessions tend to become long, feel free to stretch out, jump up, and change positions as necessary without losing functionality.

The Bcon clings magnetically and is both securely fastened and easily removed by hand. The socket’s elevated boundaries mechanically absorb centrifugal forces and protect the Bcon against falling off while in use. The socket possesses an attached webbing customizable in length to accommodate different types of usage. Barefoot naturally requires less length than using the Bcon with your shoes on.

The Bcon has been actively tested by gamers – even live on stream! The valuable feedback gathered went straight into the development process, making the Bcon a true gaming device.

<p>Project Gaia is a mobile game, focused around the concept that every action, regardless of how small, has the potential to completely alter the future of yourself and those around you.

We quickly started laying the ground work to open the store, and after a few months of looking, we finally found the perfect store location nestled in the up-and-coming Lakeshore area of Jacksonville, Florida. On February 8th, 2014 we officially opened our doors, and it has been a wonderful, crazy roller coaster ride ever since. </span></p>

We would like expand our store to include a true retro arcade and create a Cafe Nostalgia, a local quick-dining establishment catering to the needs of busy gamers and card players alike. </span></p>

It is an ambitious project, implementing a lot of new features.</p><p>The Requiem is about surviving the resistances in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by virus infected humans. Humanity was not unprepared however, several pockets of resistances have been set up in various towns and cities to fend off the threat and start anew. The infected are the least of your problems, your resolve will be tested by the harsh political climate of the resistances in a decimated world.</p><p>The Requiem is built in the powerful Unreal 4 Engine. It allows for both great flexibility and high quality graphics culminating into a formidable game experience.</p><p>We plan to release The Requiem for PC initially within the Pre-Alpha and Beta stages, then moving on to console release further down the pipeline development. The reason for console release being delayed until final launch is purely because we want the final launch to be fantastic, with minimal bugs; making sure we deliver the best experience possible to the players. Also at the current stage of the game, we could not afford to support console at this stage.</p><br/><p><b>Faction System</b></p><p>Several different factions have set up after the fall of structured governments plunging the world into anarchy. Resistances may not see eye-to-eye on how the world should be restructured, or even if it should be. Beware of bandits.</p><p><b>Inventory and Crafting</b></p><p>An inventory and crafting system will assure that you can make use of various objects found around the world. It will allow you to repair any broken items, or build new ones altogether.</p><p><b>Bartering</b></p><p>With currency devalued, the only way for you to trade is with possessions. The age old system of bartering assures that some kind of economy still remains.</p><p><b>Dynamic Weather System</b></p><p>A realistic weather system will assure an environment with a constantly changing weather climate.</p><p><b>Notoriety</b></p><p>We want your decisions to have proper impact. Your decisions will affect how you are viewed by the different factions in the game. Traders will also be affected by your decisions, whether it is their stock or their price.</p><p><b>Favour System</b></p><p>Since The Requiem is set in a post-apocalyptic setting, the lack of tradable goods can impede on your progress and negatively impact your chances of survival. Luckily, some of the citizens of the new world might be willing to negotiate with favours instead of items.</p><p><b>Vehicles</b></p><p>Although the number of working vehicles has drastically decreased, the general rule is the vehicle is mechanically intact and has fuel, you can drive it.</p><p><b>Weapons</b></p><p>We want to provide you with an experience unlike any other, we plan to implement over 100 different usable weapons.</p><h3><b>Your impact:</b></h3><p></p><p><b>Development</b></p><p>The development of the game will be the main expenditure, it will allow us to work on the game full time. At the moment, the team on board fund themselves and want to take the project to a new level, where we can take on more developers to speed everything up. The pledges will be invested into the game within several different categories. </p><p><b>Design</b></p><p>The game does not only need to be functional, but also visually stunning.

It is an ambitious project, implementing a lot of new features.The Requiem is about surviving the resistances in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by virus infected humans. Humanity was not unprepared however, several pockets of resistances have been set up in various towns and cities to fend off the threat and start anew. The infected are the least of your problems, your resolve will be tested by the harsh political climate of the resistances in a decimated world.The Requiem is built in the powerful Unreal 4 Engine. It allows for both great flexibility and high quality graphics culminating into a formidable game experience.We plan to release The Requiem for PC initially within the Pre-Alpha and Beta stages, then moving on to console release further down the pipeline development. The reason for console release being delayed until final launch is purely because we want the final launch to be fantastic, with minimal bugs; making sure we deliver the best experience possible to the players. Also at the current stage of the game, we could not afford to support console at this stage.Faction SystemSeveral different factions have set up after the fall of structured governments plunging the world into anarchy. Resistances may not see eye-to-eye on how the world should be restructured, or even if it should be. Beware of bandits.Inventory and CraftingAn inventory and crafting system will assure that you can make use of various objects found around the world. It will allow you to repair any broken items, or build new ones altogether.BarteringWith currency devalued, the only way for you to trade is with possessions. The age old system of bartering assures that some kind of economy still remains.Dynamic Weather SystemA realistic weather system will assure an environment with a constantly changing weather climate.NotorietyWe want your decisions to have proper impact. Your decisions will affect how you are viewed by the different factions in the game. Traders will also be affected by your decisions, whether it is their stock or their price.Favour SystemSince The Requiem is set in a post-apocalyptic setting, the lack of tradable goods can impede on your progress and negatively impact your chances of survival. Luckily, some of the citizens of the new world might be willing to negotiate with favours instead of items.VehiclesAlthough the number of working vehicles has drastically decreased, the general rule is the vehicle is mechanically intact and has fuel, you can drive it.WeaponsWe want to provide you with an experience unlike any other, we plan to implement over 100 different usable weapons.Your impact:DevelopmentThe development of the game will be the main expenditure, it will allow us to work on the game full time. At the moment, the team on board fund themselves and want to take the project to a new level, where we can take on more developers to speed everything up. The pledges will be invested into the game within several different categories. DesignThe game does not only need to be functional, but also visually stunning. It is very important to us to provide you with high quality textures for both the environment and objects.AudioTo assure that we can provide the highest quality game, an important factor is the audio. Whether it is ambient sounds or NPC communication. Your pledge will help us invest in proper tools and software to produce quality sound.SoftwareA big expenditure will be software. A plethora of tools are required to make a high quality game, ranging from the game engine to design tools that help us populate the world with wonders.DetailPolishing is also a very important aspect. This means that attention to fine detail will be necessary. This also includes testing.HostingHosting can get quite expensive after a while, but with your help we can keep the boat afloat.Rent and foodYour pledges will also bring us food to the table so that we may keep working full-time in providing you a quality game.New StaffWe have most of the bases of the game covered, but we'd really like to bring some more staff on board to speed things up and add some quality features.Milestones:We really want to add all these features, but with your funding, we can make them happen a lot sooner.£25k- Single Player campaignDonations will go a long way into providing a feature length game (150 hours) with a gripping and original plot in The Requiem's harsh world environment.

<p>A throw-back to the good
ole days?  Maybe. <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>But in the fast paced

Hello, Friends.  My name
is Jeff Sorenson, and I’ve produced a game
for country music fans that requires actual
human interaction.
So You Think You’re
Right: Classic Country Music Trivia is the perfect game for a
gathering of family or friends to enjoy some time around
a table in good natured fun…
A throw-back to the good
ole days?  Maybe. But in the fast paced
world, is that such a bad thing? I think it’s just what
the doctor ordered!

It’s taken me three
years of working with a small team of
amazingly talented, creative peeps, to make
this game a tangible, playable, challenging, entertainment reality….but I've taken this project as far as I
can by myself.
I need your help. I know I’m asking for a
lot of money. $150,000 is a lot of
pocket change, but I've done my
homework, and that’s the amount of
money it will take to make this
entity a success. If you watched my video,
then you know that 25% of American
music lovers call themselves country
music fans.
That’s a potential
market of 54,000,000 people…Wow…that’s a lot of
zeroes!

I know what you’re
thinking. How many of those
54-million people will invest in a
board game? Isn't this a digital
age? Well…you might be
surprised to learn that board games are becoming cool again! Statistics show we’re in
a board game Renaissance. While sales of board games
of the past are seeing a slight
decline, every year for the past
ten years NEW board game sales have
increased 10-20%. Americans are becoming
social again!

First let me explain my
game to you in a little more detail; Then I’ll show you where
your money will go as we make So
You Think You’re Right a country music lover’s ""must-have game"".





THE
GAME

Anyone can play this game. There is only ONE requirement to
participate: You must like country
music!It doesn't matter how
long you've been a country
fan. That’s part of the fun. We've included questions
in this game that even country newbies can answer, and when you come across a
more challenging question,
you’ll learn some really cool country
music facts that made this genre of
music America’s Music!
So You Think You’re
Right: Classic Country Music Trivia is a trivia game that
tests your knowledge about country music
artists and songs. The graphics were designed
by Jerry Palmer, a one-time art director
for the TV show Hee Haw, and to make it even more
fun, each square on the
colorful, top quality board has a significance to
country music. 
Try to figure out what
each square symbolizes. For example what song does
this square bring to mind? How about All My Exes Live
in Texas? Or this square?





Could those be John
Conlee’s rose colored glasses?






The game is designed for
2-4 individual players, or for 2-4 groups. Players answer trivia
questions--- mostly from multiple
choice and true or false
options…HOWEVER this game gives ample
opportunity for ALL of the players to
be invested.
As the pieces move around
the board. family and friends
actively engage even when it’s another
player’s turn. This group participation
makes So You Think You’re
Right? a wonderful social medium… created to encourage
laughter, social interaction and
bonding. Winner of the game is the
first player to make it back to start.

GAME
COMPONENTS

game board

4 game pieces

3 sets of playing cards:

	Classic Country Trivia Card



	Feeling Lucky Card




	The Judge Says Card



Examples of The Judge
Says Card:

Defense Attorney is
calling her next set of
witnesses. If you can list the
first names of all four Oak Ridge
Boys, move ahead 4 spaces.



You’re the reason Our kids are ugly.  Move back two spaces.

If you can tell the
judge how many beats a waltz
has,  move forward that many
spaces.

Plead your case to the
jury. Tell the other players How much you love
country music. If they believe you, move ahead one space. In case of hung jury,
stay where you are.

Judge convicts you of
arson. Sing the first two
lines of the chorus to The
Fireman or head directly to The
Crowbar Hotel.













PLEASE
HELP / NEED FUNDING

I’ve invested years of
my time and money to create this game. I could have asked for
help earlier, but I wanted to wait for
the RIGHT time to present my dream to the
world. That time is NOW. 
The game itself is not
simply an idea in my head. It’s an actual thing you
can hold… well thought
out…creative…smart…fun.
So You Think You’re
Right? is ready for mass production. The money we collect will
be used In the following ways:1. Product production
	of the game in The United States2. Update our website3. Production of a :30
	TV spot and an ad for print4. Tiered media campaign
	involving radio, print and television targeted specifically to media
	frequented by country music fans.  This ain’t cheap, folks, but
	it’s a necessity for this product to be successful.




The games themselves can
be manufactured in less than two weeks…and we've spoken to all
media and know their advertising rates and schedules.  We hope to be
up and rolling by the end of October, so we can capitalize on
Christmas sales.

Here is a graph
proportioning the amounts designated to bring this game home.






FUTURE
PLANS

The production of this
game is Phase One of a multi-phase marketing
plan.

Phase Two
involves the creation of the So You Think You’re
Right? Game App… So you can play our game
anytime, anywhere. We are working on this
phase now.

Phase Three
is the production of the So You Think You’re
Right? 30-minute
Game show for television
and the internet.And Phase
Four is the creation of additional So You Think You’re
Right? board games: Classic Rock and sports
additions.
BBEC

Seven years ago, I became
one of the founders of the BBEC (Baby Boomer’s Entertainment
Corporation).  I started this organization because I realized that baby boomers make up 25% of America's population, yet control 75% of its wealth.  While most corporations produce entertainment for younger generations, the fact is that the baby boomers (born post WWII 1946-1964) outspend other generations by an estimated 400 billion dollars per year in consumer goods, services and entertainment.  I created BBEC to deliver family friendly entertainment to that under-served baby boomer market.



























THANK
YOU!

Thank you for watching my
video and for reading this
proposal. I appreciate your time and
consideration more than you could
possibly know.
As a token of my
gratitude, I’d like to give you a
gift for each donation as listed under
the PERKS section to your right.
Every dollar you give is
important to this project’s
success. But with each dollar
given, I also see a belief in me and my vision to
bring back social interaction.
For that belief, I am
eternally grateful.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3></div></div>","WHO we are, WHERE we're going and WHAT we're all about: 
My name is Autumn and I'm a 17-year-old senior living in the greater Atlanta area.  My church, Mount Paran Church of God (come out and see us!), hosts a number of short term and long term mission trips.  The missions cater to people in need all around the world from every continent excluding Antarctica (We're working on it penguins!).  Our youth group supports an annual short term mission trip to Bolivia, reserved specifically for teenagers in grades 9 through 12.  Our youth pastor along with a number of adult leaders take a group of approximately 25-30 high schoolers to build (wells, houses, sheds, fences, playgrounds, etc.), cook/serve food, make long-lasting friendships and ultimately spread God's love with Bolivian children and teens our own age. 
While in Bolivia, we'll team up with local pastors in charge of Operation Restoration (http://www.ywambolivia.org.uk/).  This organization was created in 1991 with one mission: ""to show God's love in a practical way, encouraging children and teenagers between 8 and 18 years of age to leave the streets"".  Operation Restoration is dedicated to empowering, educating and influencing youth to live a life they never imagined for themselves. 



Making a DIFFERENCE: 
We're seeking $5000 to assist in the cost of airfare, building materials (wood, nails, etc.), food, clothes and gifts for the boys and girls.



PAYING IT FORWARD. What you give and what you get:
What comes around goes around!

1. Keeping us in your prayers and spreading the word- It's not all about the money even if we DO need it.  A big thank you goes out to you and we'll be sending you love from Bolivia!
2. $10 dollars-  Knowing that you're effort is appreciated and that great, fuzzy feeling you get after someone tells you, ""you just made my day"". Well, you just made my day.
3. $25 dollars-  A beautiful friendship bracelet in an assortment of yarns, strings and colors made by the Bolivian children you'll be supporting.
4. $50 dollars- A postcard/ personalized thank you note sent straight from Bolivia upon our arrival this summer.
5. $100 dollars-  A photo album of a collection of pictures taken in Bolivia this summer (late July).
6. $250 dollars-  All the perks from numbers 1-5!

<h3>Origins of GENEDYNE</h3>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p>I've always enjoyed playing old school
2D side scrolling games be it on Nintendo, Sega, PC, or even on a
little known unit called a TurboGraphics 16. Even in my spare time I
still work out my frustrations on my Sega Genesis.  I've always had a
vivid imagination and see the squarelike pixels on the screen as
fully realized ideas just waiting for someone to render with a pencil
or a pc.  I also liked how easy it was to learn how to control the 2D rendered characters on screen.</p>

<p>As someone who likes video games and
has spent the better part of my time rendering among other things,
GIANT ROBOTS!  I've always waited and wanted to see publishers
release a game that was as easy to control as the old style 2D games,
and as fun to watch as a 3D simulation of a mech battle might be. 
Thats why Ive started this project and hope you'll be exited enough
to contribute ideas and capitol towards its completion.  So spread
the word!  
</p>

<p>Thus far, I've contributed code,
models, animations, and many years of research concerning the design
of different styles of mech robots, transformable and non towards
this project. </p>

<p> Working with the demo of the Unity Game Engine Technology has been a wonderful
tool for learning how to create games, yet this is an area where I
must bow to the skills of those who are able to setup networks,
manage physics, and some types of artificial  intelligence. </p>

Origins of GENEDYNE

I've always enjoyed playing old school
2D side scrolling games be it on Nintendo, Sega, PC, or even on a
little known unit called a TurboGraphics 16. Even in my spare time I
still work out my frustrations on my Sega Genesis.  I've always had a
vivid imagination and see the squarelike pixels on the screen as
fully realized ideas just waiting for someone to render with a pencil
or a pc.  I also liked how easy it was to learn how to control the 2D rendered characters on screen.



As someone who likes video games and
has spent the better part of my time rendering among other things,
GIANT ROBOTS!  I've always waited and wanted to see publishers
release a game that was as easy to control as the old style 2D games,
and as fun to watch as a 3D simulation of a mech battle might be. 
Thats why Ive started this project and hope you'll be exited enough
to contribute ideas and capitol towards its completion.  So spread
the word!  



Thus far, I've contributed code,
models, animations, and many years of research concerning the design
of different styles of mech robots, transformable and non towards
this project. 


 Working with the demo of the Unity Game Engine Technology has been a wonderful
tool for learning how to create games, yet this is an area where I
must bow to the skills of those who are able to setup networks,
manage physics, and some types of artificial  intelligence. 


 The
ultimate goal will be to setup Genedyne as an online community where
users can easily log in, create, compare, and contest the efficiency
of their mech designs over the network in various contests of skill.








   What We Need & What You Get

As a provision for the further
completion of this project into a beta testing phase I am attempting
to secure almost 120K.  These funds will go towards the the payment
of the talented folks whom I know should have the skills to fill in
the gaps aforementioned.



 I will also use these funds to secure publishing and software licenses.  I will also be working with virtual and networking  technologies that will assist in making sure this game has a
chance at being the best mech based game EVER created.


 Other publishing
and promotional materials  will help facilitate that goal and the distribution
of your products will need to be allowed for. 
Additionally, my aim is to bring in some new artists, musician(s),
and animators to help design this game.  



Some Points of Gameplay or Strategy

</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">One person reads all the definitions aloud, including the actual definition of the word, which is randomly mixed in. </span><br/>
</li>
<li>

What the Deck is This? 

Heard this one before? You're having drinks with friends and everyone is on their iPhone. One person is talking about their new diet (nobody cares). 
Deck Around is here because parties need more -- more laughs, more surprise, more ridiculousness. 

You'll learn the game in 27 seconds
You'll start laughing 1 minute after that
Enjoy it with big groups of friends and strangers alike
No downtime, no waiting for turns -- no boring shit


The game is designed, thoroughly tested and I've locked down a solid supplier who can make it real! I can't offer the game at this great of a price for all of us unless we purchase a large volume of them -- so that's why I'm trying to get a big order in before Christmas with the funding here on Indiegogo.

How to Play
Watch the video above to find out how to play. Here's a quick description for if you can't hear or something: 



You'll get a deck full of slang terms -- words like twerking or Dutch oven -- but more obscure. You pick a random one and everyone writes a made up but convincing definition for the word and anonymously hands it in. 


One person reads all the definitions aloud, including the actual definition of the word, which is randomly mixed in. 


Everyone guesses which definition is the real one. They usually fall for someone else's bullshit definition. 






What's in the Box
The full game has everything you need to Deck Around:

106 rounds of gameplay in a deck of cards -- that’s a big deck!
400 sheets of answer paper, and after that, you’re on your own
6 mini pencils I stole from a public golf course
1 sexy shrink wrapped box with instructions
0 dice, game boards or little plastic houses




If you back the game right here, you're poised to get some great stuff: 


Incredible pricing that includes shipping

A bonus set of a half-dozen words, exclusive to Indiegogo
A PDF you can instantly download, print then and play at home
Get your name (or Twitter handle) printed on a card in every box
Finish your holiday shopping all in one great deal with 4 copies of Deck Around
Create your own word that officially becomes part of the game
Print any 5 words you want on every single box

Nevertheless, I will keep working on it with my own means. In that extent, this project would remain low budget and may struggle to become reality. Keep in mind every little coin will make Applegleam closer to its release.What happens if we get more ?I assume 1500€ would be a fair amount to make this project come true. But there is no doubt gathering more than the initial goal would be a significant boost for Applegleam, and would allow more features to appear in the game. Be sure this would make me the happiest man on earth !All that stuff being said, show me that everything is possible and make me proud to make you play the game. Don’t forget that every single coin can make the difference and makes me step toward my goal.Thanks for reading guys, the choice is now yours.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Hi, I'm Toby Turner! 
Ever since my mom's dream of me becoming a dentist fell through, I spend most of my time making youtube videos and playing video games. 
As some of you may know Tobuscus Adventures is a web-cartoon about my character, Tobuscus, and his friend Gabe (Gabuscus). We go on adventures and sometimes zombies kill us. We actually made a new episode of the show to promote this campaign ... check it out!



 


 


We Are Making a Game (with your help)!
The game will be called Tobuscus Adventures: Wizards! and in it, Tobuscus accidentally incapacitates a powerful wizard and has to take his place to defeat the Wizard of Darkness!
In the game, you cast various spells of murder doom upon the incoming zombie armada.  To cast a spell, Tobuscus must draw the spell symbol on his spellbook (which is, naturally, a touch-screen tablet. He is a modern wizard).  
This game features fun and challenging game mechanics, as well as cut-scenes animated in the style of Tobuscus Adventures.  It even has a theme song.  Crossfire the boardgame had a theme song, why shouldn't a mobile app?   Here's some concept art:



I have a few games I'd like to make in the Tobuscus Adventures universe, and we're starting with a game that I feel is both fun and can be produced and launched relatively quickly.  If we can raise the money, this game should only take about 4 months of dedicated development to get into everyone's hands!
If Tobuscus Adventures: Wizards! does well, we will immediately begin to work on a few other really exciting game ideas.  The goal is to always have a game in development forever, so there's always something new and awesome to look forward to!






Some of you may be asking yourselves ...
""Why is Toby Producing Games Now?""
It's something I've always wanted to do! I love the animated show, and if I could partner with a real game studio to make a game around the Tobuscus Adventures characters, I think we could make something that's both fun and funny.  
I get bored really easily, so trust me, this game is gonna have to be awesome!

It takes more than just an idea to create something as epic as a Tobuscus Adventures video game. There are the game developers, graphic artists, animators, voice over talent, editors ... and that's just to name a few.
We Need Your Help! 
Every penny donated (after covering the awesome donation perks, etc) will go toward the production of this, and FUTURE games. Game production will begin as soon as funds start coming in. If we're able to surpass our goal, we can start production on the next game and more Tobuscus Adventures episodes!
The more we make, the more we CAN make.The goal is to always have something in the works to give back to the Audience.

MY, MY YOU ARE KIND!
Every pledge will help make this vision become a reality. Contribute today and receive the exclusive rewards available only to those pledging through this IndieGogo campaign.

The best part about making a contribution (other than being part of a movement that completely changes everything we've ever known about gaming forever because it has a theme song.  Some of that might be an embellishment) are the rewards of course! All of our give backs are exclusive to this IndieGogo campaign. These are all things ""Tobuscus"" that you've never seen before and our swag was created specifically with our contributors in mind. Check out the tiers on the right for some of the cool stuff you can get if you donate.


GET MORE COOL STUFF ... SPREAD THE WORD!!!

All you have to do is share using the ""Share This Campaign"" link above!
During the course of the campaign, we'll be running some ongoing challenges to get your community involved.
Use the ""Share This Campaign"" link above and post it every where so your friends can check out the project and get in on the action.  The more people that use your link to donate to the campaign, the better your odds are for getting the special prizes!


The top three referral sources (by dollars raised) will be offered a chance to have an animated character designed around them and will appear in an episode of Tobuscus: Animated Adventures! You will also get an invite to the game's launch party!

The top three referral sources by total donors referred (i.e. individuals that donate through your unique referral link) will earn themselves an invite to our launch party!

So, that's the deal! We're excited and we hope you are too. Thank you in advance for your support and for helping us make this vision a reality.
Bless your face. If you sneezed during this campaign, bless you. Peace Off.

<h3>What is LifeRPG?</h3>
<p>LifeRPG is an application aimed at helping you organize your life and become more productive by using an intuitive, video game-like system, while helping in building confidence and motivation.</p>
<p>It grew out of my frustration at trying to find a productivity system and software that suited me best. No matter what I tried, my mind always kept going back to the almost magical way that video games seem to be structured to capture your interest and reward you for your progress. So I did some research and started developing a productivity system for myself based on game principles. As I started telling others about it, I found out that many other people were interested in a tool like this as well!</p>
<p>At this point, there is <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeRPG/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a fast-growing community</a> building up around it on reddit, and the best thing is that you can already <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeRPG/comments/12fmm6/download_liferpg_r2_is_here_get_it_while_its_hot/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">download LifeRPG</a> and try it out for yourself!</p>
<p>This is a campaign to help speed up the development of the next iteration of the LifeRPG system.</p>
<h3>What Can LifeRPG do for you?</h3>
<p>Here is what LifeRPG can already do for you, <em>right now</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Keep track of your projects</strong> and assign a difficulty, importance and skill to each one.</li>
<li>
<strong>View your projects by order of difficulty</strong>, from the easiest to the hardest, so that you can build up confidence and motivation by tackling challenges in a game-like fashion.</li>
<li>
<strong>Projects are colored by difficulty</strong> to make it easier to navigate the list.</li>
<li>
<strong>Gain points for completing projects</strong>, and watch your level progress bar increase until you LEVEL UP!</li>
<li>
<strong>Dynamic skill system</strong> lets you assign an optional skill to each project, which can be anything you want, so when you complete them your assigned skill will go up.</li>
<li>
<strong>Manage your skills</strong> with the Skills Stats view and see which are beefed up and which ones are lagging. Instantly access your projects for each skill by double-clicking or hitting enter on the highlighted skill.</li>
<li>
<strong>Heads-Up Display</strong> is redesigned, can be toggled on and off, and hides automatically if you move the mouse over it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Customize your HUD</strong> by entering a name and title for yourself in your profile -- Ninja, Wizard, Businessman, Artist -- whatever you want!</li>
<li>
<strong>Project Log</strong> window lets you see a record of projects you've completed, what skill was affected, and what your overall level was, so you can track your progress through time.</li>
<li>
<strong>Momentum Bar</strong> (MMT) -- a totally unique concept, not available anywhere else as far as I know, that motivates you to keep making progress on your goals. Every day, your momentum stat will decrease by a certain amount, and will eventually drop to zero unless you complete a project from your list to make it recharge. See if you can get your MMT bar back to 100% every day!</li>
<li>
<strong>Custom Level Up Sound</strong> -- Select a sound file to play when you reach a new level, perhaps one from your favorite game, or anything else you want.</li>
<li>
<strong>Keep more than one database</strong> so you can track projects for different contexts; like perhaps one database for personal projects and one for your business.</li>
<li>
<strong>QuickAdd Projects</strong> window lets you add projects to your database when you're in the middle of anything, so you don't have to switch back to the LifeRPG main window.</li>
<li>
<strong>QuickDone Projects</strong> window, similar to the QuickAdd function, but marks the project you enter as done, immediately increasing your points and your skill.</li>
<li>
<strong>Manually increase points</strong> with hotkeys so you can adjust your level properly, or to just increase your progress without having to enter any projects or anything tedious if you don't want to.</li>
<li>
<strong>No level cap</strong>, infinite content already available, no DLC ever required :)</li>
</ul>

<h3>What Redditors Are Saying About LifeRPG:</h3>
<p>The response for LifeRPG on reddit has been phenomenally positive. Just take a look:<br/><br/>""...I think this may honestly be the first to do/life management software that I actually stick with. Awesome work! All we need now is a mobile app (which I would totally pay for, given the already extensive list of features) and we're golden.""</p>
<p><br/>""There's just something about clicking project done and seeing your EXP bar go up as opposed to simply seeing a task disappear from a to do list.""</p>
<p><br/>""Have to say, I ABSOLUTELY love this. Fantastic, fantastic idea, really... a fantastic program that i see myself using for a long time. Keep up the good work!""</p>
<p>""Beautiful stuff dude! You're helping people fix their lives, thats a big deal...hope this gets more popular soon.""</p>
<p><br/>""Oh man, I'm really loving this. This is a great idea, and so far well executed.""</p>

<h3>The Future: LifeRPG 3 and Beyond</h3>
<p>I'm committed to developing the LifeRPG concept and taking it to its limits!</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I want to include in the upcoming LifeRPG 3:</p>
<p><strong>Repeating project support and streak-tracking</strong>. By far one of the most requested features on r/LifeRPG. You'll be able to set projects to repeat (whether daily, weekly, etc.) and keep track of your completion streaks, in a ""don't break the chain"" type of way.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise tracking</strong>. A special module to keep track of your workouts, where you can input workout details like times, weights, distances run, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Money management system</strong>. A simple, fun system for tracking your finances.</p>
<p><strong>Reward management system</strong>. You'll be able to set rewards you can earn for completing your projects. Whether that's a specific reward for a certain project, or random ""drops"" that only appear some of the times you complete projects, it'll be up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple-language support.</strong> Users have already eagerly started translating LifeRPG to their native languages, and I want to enable the app to have the interface available in multiple languages.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple skills per project</strong>. You'll be able to assign more than one skill to a project, so completing a project can affect your level in however many skills you want.</p>
<p><strong>More customizations and refinements.</strong> I want to consider all the feedback people have been giving about LifeRPG 2, and add some surprises of my own.</p>
<p>This is all just the beginning, and as more support comes in, this is what I can envision for the future of LifeRPG:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Linux and OS X compatible versions.</strong> Highly requested by many interested people.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile versions.</strong> Also highly requested. Take the power of LifeRPG with you in the palm of your hand.</li>
<li>
<strong>Collaborative web versions.</strong> Imagine competing with your co-workers or group members to complete projects, gain levels and unlock rewards!</li>
<li>
<strong>A real-life heads up display</strong>. Can you imagine LifeRPG one day running on something like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_glass"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Google Glass</a>? I sure can, and it's really exciting to think about!</li>
</ul>

<h3>What LifeRPG Needs</h3>
<p>I have a big interest in developing this project, as it's helped me a lot to organize my own life and become more motivated and productive. However, other users seem even more excited about it and are wondering when the next release is going to happen. The thing is, up until now I've just been able to work on it whenever I can spare. So I figured Indiegogo could help us all out and make LifeRPG 3 happen as soon as possible!</p>
<p>Your contribution will go to help make development of LifeRPG 3 easier and faster. I'll be able to devote more attention and time to the project, so you can get it on your desktop as soon as possible for you to have fun leveling up and managing your life.</p>
At the very least, you can help pay for a few drinks and snacks for while I code :)</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>LifeRPG is free and open source, so if you are inclined you can step right up and contribute to the code, or customize it for yourself or others however you want (it's written in AutoHotkey, which is a fun and simple scripting language for Windows).</p>
<p>Another way you can contribute is by sharing LifeRPG with others if you think it can help them!</p>
<p><br/>If you've read this far, you must be really interested in LifeRPG! So go ahead, make your contribution and tell your friends about it!

<p><strong>STORY</strong></p>
<p>""A man is a god in ruins"" <br/>-Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>
<p>It is still believed by some that eons before man settled this land, in an era preceding the first sunrise, rainfall, or gust of wind, this world was in chaos...   </p>
<div>In an effort to bring order to our world, the leaders of humanity united to build a temple atop the highest mountain. At the highest point of the temple, humans lit a fire that could be seen from the heavens, in the hope of summoning gods to establish order. They called this the Everlasting Fire.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Mankind's wishes were fulfilled when two cosmic beings descended upon our world. One was Altarch, who held dominion over the elements. The other was Dak'Ur, the master of corruption and decay.   </div>
<div> </div>
<p>Altarch wished to oversee a world where a peaceful race could flourish. However, Dak'Ur had other plans. Upon arrival, Dak'Ur transformed half of the population into monstrous abominations. Altarch commanded the remaining humans in a bloody war which spanned thousands of years. In the end, Altarch and his followers emerged triumphant.   </p>
<p>Furious, Altarch cracked open the planet itself and cast Dak'Ur in its ever-burning center. To seal the dark god's fate, Altarch moved the mountain temple over the chasm and reinforced the Everlasting Fire to prevent the spread of corruption... </p>
<p>As life grew on the planet, the nations of man united in reverence for their savior. For many generations, the world enjoyed peace and prosperity, never daring to question the way of Altarch.   </p>
<p>To spite Altarch's victory, the rage of Dak'Ur swelled from beneath the surface, slowly tainting the souls of men. As time passed, Altarch's influence over the world dwindled, and so did his godly powers.     </p>
<p>Today, the followers of Altarch are all but few. According to legend, the fading god still guards the sacred flame in his mountain temple, beholding the imminent collapse of the world below, silently awaiting the Fall of Eternity.</p>

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>
<p>Q: Why the modest funding goal?</p>
<p>A: Our game is being developed in open-source software. Your contributions are compensation for the labor involved in developing the game.</p>
<p>Q: What's the gameplay like?</p>
<p>A: As of 6/15, we decided to transfer our assets from an isometric system to a first-person one. There will be an optional third person view in the final version. Anyone who has ever played an Elder Scrolls game will feel right at home, though the gameplay will feel more traditional, similar to classic first-person RPGs like Ultima Underworld and King's Field. </p>
<p>Q: How much will this game and/or the soundtrack cost after it is finished? </p>
<p>A: THIS GAME WILL BE FREE!!! Everyone can download it, play it, mod it, and share it when it's done. Same with the music. The only thing we're asking for is the startup to make this project happen. The physical DVD copies and CD soundtracks are rewards for supporting this pledge drive. You will not be able to get them anywhere else but this kstarter campaign. </p>
<p>We promise we're not greedy -- we think intrusive features like DRM are only encouraging disgruntled and financially-strapped gamers to circumvent the law. Since we don't support illegal activity, and we don't want people ""stealing"" our game, we're making it impossible to steal. We honestly love making video games, and Fall of Eternity is our gift to RPG fans :)</p>
<p>Q: Is this game open-source?</p>
<p>A: Short answer: ""Pretty much"".</p>
<p>Long answer: Our early build runs via a batch file that interprets the game through a GNU-GPL binary. Our artist and writer don't want their work becoming public domain, though I could personally care less if you pick apart the code and have a field day with it. The license will allow you to do whatever you want with the code, such as building your own custom ports... but the art, music, and story are intrinsically the intellectual property of the individuals who created it. When I start releasing beta versions, do what you want with my code, but please be careful or you'll have to answer to some angry artists and musicians.</p>
<p>Q: Do any of the lower level pledges come with digital copies of the game?</p>
<p>A: The game will be free for anyone to download upon release, similarly to La Mulana and Cave Story. We will post the download links on our developer's blog at <a href=""http://wizardboxgames.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://wizardboxgames.blogspot.com</a>. At Wizard Box, we believe the best anti-piracy measure is to remove the retail aspect from gaming altogether. It's impossible to steal free things ;) Donations and fundraising events such as this are our sole means of income.</p>
<p>Q: If I made the $50 pledge, do I also get the lower level tier pledges?</p>
<p>A: Yes, the rewards stack. *HOWEVER*, the soundtrack CD will not be included in the $50 pledge package, though the music files will be on the DVD in a folder. The $100+ pledges include both the soundtrack CD and the game DVD.</p>
<p>Q: If I was to pledge to get a physical copy of the game, is there an added cost for international shipping?</p>
<p>A: Any pledge involving shipping encompasses all shipping costs. It shouldn't cost more than $5-10 USD for us to ship a DVD internationally.</p></div>","**early gameplay videos in the gallery**

STORY
""A man is a god in ruins"" -Ralph Waldo Emerson
It is still believed by some that eons before man settled this land, in an era preceding the first sunrise, rainfall, or gust of wind, this world was in chaos...   
In an effort to bring order to our world, the leaders of humanity united to build a temple atop the highest mountain. At the highest point of the temple, humans lit a fire that could be seen from the heavens, in the hope of summoning gods to establish order. They called this the Everlasting Fire.
 
Mankind's wishes were fulfilled when two cosmic beings descended upon our world. One was Altarch, who held dominion over the elements. The other was Dak'Ur, the master of corruption and decay.   
 
Altarch wished to oversee a world where a peaceful race could flourish. However, Dak'Ur had other plans. Upon arrival, Dak'Ur transformed half of the population into monstrous abominations. Altarch commanded the remaining humans in a bloody war which spanned thousands of years. In the end, Altarch and his followers emerged triumphant.   
Furious, Altarch cracked open the planet itself and cast Dak'Ur in its ever-burning center. To seal the dark god's fate, Altarch moved the mountain temple over the chasm and reinforced the Everlasting Fire to prevent the spread of corruption... 
As life grew on the planet, the nations of man united in reverence for their savior. For many generations, the world enjoyed peace and prosperity, never daring to question the way of Altarch.   
To spite Altarch's victory, the rage of Dak'Ur swelled from beneath the surface, slowly tainting the souls of men. As time passed, Altarch's influence over the world dwindled, and so did his godly powers.     
Today, the followers of Altarch are all but few. According to legend, the fading god still guards the sacred flame in his mountain temple, beholding the imminent collapse of the world below, silently awaiting the Fall of Eternity.

A: Yes, the rewards stack. *HOWEVER*, the soundtrack CD will not be included in the $50 pledge package, though the music files will be on the DVD in a folder. The $100+ pledges include both the soundtrack CD and the game DVD.
Q: If I was to pledge to get a physical copy of the game, is there an added cost for international shipping?
A: Any pledge involving shipping encompasses all shipping costs. It shouldn't cost more than $5-10 USD for us to ship a DVD internationally.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We have developed a platform that is non-gambling, but allows players to play for significant prizes.  As we are non-gambling, our platform is legal in most markets around the world, including the US.  We have devised a model that through participating advertisers and sponsors, we are able to offer our community of players, life changing prizes including automobiles, boats, trips of a lifetime, cool consumer products, and of course, money.  With grand prizes up to $20 million, our players will be incentivized to come back and play multiple times.  Our model is so unique that we devised it in a way that the winner of a $20 million tournament, would simply have to win a total of 9 times and beat a total of 77 people, regardless of how many players play in the tournament.</p>
<p>This platform has been in development for 3 years and we are now in our beta testing phase.  We anticipate our public launch to commence in Q2 - 2017.  We have distribution partners in many markets including: Brazil, India, Europe, Israel, The Philippines, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, China, and of course, the US.</p>
<p>There is no other platform like ours on the planet.  We have incorporated many unique elements which makes our platform more than just a casual social gaming site.  Players will be able to rent movies, watch concerts, watch sporting events, and much more.  With our strategic partnerships, we have access to technology that is truly next level.   </p>
<p>In addition to the above, we have partnered with hundreds of celebrities (musicians, athletes, comedians, actors, etc) who you will be able to play against and ""chat smack"" with.  Further, our platform is designed to raise significant funds and awareness for multiple charities around the world.  Further, we have partnered with global brands as we are able to offer the following:</p>
<p>       1) X millions of players will interact with select brands for 30-60 minutes at a time</p>
<p>       2) 100% commercial ad views</p>
<p>       3) 100% banner ad/logo views (in a strategically placed location)</p>
<p>       4) Significantly higher than average banner ad views from other locations</p>
<p>       5) Immediate Response Offer with an expected minimum of 50% participation rate.</p>
<p>All of the above allow us to generate revenues at a rate that is quite attractive.  Using extremely conservative numbers, our first year revenues are expected to be well over $10 million.  By year 3, our projected revenues actually make us blush.  But it comes down to basic math.  We know we have the strategies and management team in place that will steer this train to achieve our goals.  So not only should your investment return you a nice annual return,  if we hit our numbers, we may very well be the target of an acquisition.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To date, we have been self-funded but as we are preparing for our global launch, we need second round funding.  We are looking to raise $750,000 (selling 750,000 shares at $1.00  You may purchase as many as you wish, but the minimum purchase is 50 shares.  For larger investments, please consider the perks.).  The money will be used for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase our own ad server (which will allow us to significantly increase our revenues)</li>
<li>As we are launching with slot games, we need to build out other games, including: poker, videopoker, bingo, blackjack, baccarat, mahjong, teen patti, and more.</li>
<li>Operational expenses</li>
<li>Purchase the code from our platform partner</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
</ul>
<p>Our platform will attract many brands and advertisers from all over the world.  We can support global as well as regional and local brands.  As our platform offers significant value per advertising dollar, we will be in the enviable position of picking and choosing who we want to promote.</p>
<p>Most social gaming platforms earn their revenues by charging players to purchase more coins to continue to play, all the while the players keep playing but cannot win anything.  Further, these same platforms earn additional revenues from in-app/in-game purchases of digital goods.  Although we too will be offering in-game purchases, our players will never need to purchase more coins.  Imagine, by participating in one of our tournaments, our players play for free but can win up to $20 million.  To put things in perspective...the current world record for an online poker tournament was set 2 years ago by powerhouse Poker Stars.  There was a $1 buyin, making the tournament illegal in the US as well as most of the other markets in the world.   The first place prize was $10k.  They ended up having over 277k players in that tournament.  Imagine what we will be able to achieve if we were to hold a $1 million free tournament, which is open to most everyone on the planet.  </p>
<p>Here's the bottom line, we have designed this platform to benefit players, advertisers, celebrities, and charities.  In today's crazy global economy climate, people want to feel good about what they are doing and helping other people is the perfect way to achieve that.  Every tournament we hold will benefit up to 10 charities.  There are 2 elements to our tournaments...the online component and the live component.  When we whittle our players down to the targeted number of finalists, we provide an all expense paid trip for the finalists and a guest to a regional casino, where we will hold a live and televised event.  We will also be inviting many celebrities and brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>As noted earlier, there truly is no other platform like this.  Our build out plans include streaming concerts, renting movies,   It is our goal to get our player base to the point where we have 20 million monthly average users.  To give you an idea of what that might look like in terms of an acquisition, take a look at this firm:</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As in all investments, there is a real chance you might lose your money.  However, we believe we have identified the 4 riskiest aspects of this business, and we have built-in contingencies to minimize if not completely mitigate those risks.</p>
<p>Risk #1 - The games do not draw well</p>
<p>We have chosen to launch with our version of the most popular slot games on the market.  We are being very diligent in who we work with as we will continue to bring more brands to our platform.  In addition to offering popular games, we are creating our own, extremely unique games that people will not be able to play anywhere else.   The contingency here is that we have multiple games available to us so if a few aren't performing, we simply bring new games to the fold.</p>
<p>Risk #2 - Not enough players</p>
<p>Again, we feel we have almost completely eliminated this risk as there are multiple steps we can take.  First, when we launch, although we are launching in North America and we are geo-fencing the region, if we are not getting the players at the pace we expect, we will simply life the geo-fence and open the tournament up to all players around the world.  Second, we are leveraging celebrities and non profit organizations.   These sources will bring us plenty of players.  Third, we have arrangements with affiliate groups who have millions of people in their databases who are looking for a place to play and win online.  Fourth, our distribution partners include cellular service providers in the Philippines, India, Japan, Dubai, Sri Lanka, etc.  The total reach of these channels is well over 1 billion consumers.  Further, here are the global numbers of social players:</p>
<p>          •Total worldwide social casino players = 179,000,000 players</p>
<p>          •Total worldwide Poker player base = 100,000,000+ players</p>
<p>          •Total worldwide Mahjong player base = 700,000,000+ players</p>
<p>          •Total worldwide Bingo player base = 100,000,000+ players</p>
<p>Risk #3 - Advertisers feel they are not getting enough value from us</p>
<p>Again, this is something we spent a great deal of time on.  As noted earlier, we can offer sponsors and advertisers, guaranteed results.  To our knowledge, there are no other platforms that can deliver what we can.  Our advertising partners have multiple options on how they want to deliver their message/s, and if we don't deliver, we will make it right.</p>
<p>Risk #4 - The Management Team doesn't know what they are doing</p>
<p>We eliminated this before posting this campaign.  We have some of the top people from gaming as well as peripheral industries.  We are committed to creating a truly innovative, creative, exciting, and profitable business.  We are laser focused on driving revenues as we will be able to change peoples lives across the globe.   We have multiple revenue streams, with the following  generating the most significant portion:</p>
<ol>
<li>Banner Ads</li>
<li>Commercial Ads</li>
<li>Nightly Raffle</li>
<li>Prizes</li>
<li>Out-bound affiliate revenues</li>
</ol>

<p>Runners Grinders will come in the form of an mobile game mainly targeted towards Android phones. It uses GPS extensively to map your real world position into an in-game position.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The game takes place in a fantasy world on a recently discovered continent. You play as Hjalte, a young and strong spirited cartographer. You set out to explore and map the new world. To explore and travel in the game-world, you need to move in the real world! As you start moving in the real world, you will explore the game-world accordingly. The game will automagically generate a landscape with roads that resembles the routes you've moved in.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt=""Default game view seen when actually moving"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.arcsweden.se/e107_files/public/mapview_mockup.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>The generated landscape contains a variety of nature and places to visit - villages, cities and dungeons are all just a few examples. As you run along a path and pass by one of these locations the visit gets stacked as messages. When you have finished running you can open up the message tab and play through all your visits.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img align=""none"" alt=""Location view. This is where you gather and turn in quests"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.arcsweden.se/e107_files/public/scaledmockup.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p>When you play through a visit of any location the game will play like any oldschool RPG. Here you can speak to characters, gather and turn in quests. By helping characters you help the villages to grow and in time they will turn into cities. Of course, turning in quests will give you lots of rewards in the form of trophies and achievements!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">So, do I really have to run to play this game?</span><br/></p>
<p>Not necessarily. Of course, the game is all about motivating exercise, but if you just go out walking that's really enough! The requirement is that you physically move between the locations in the game.</p>
<p>We are still undecided about this, but we might add running specific missions. This could be anything from being chased by a monster to running fast enough to catch a thief. Of course, you should not miss any of the story by walking, but it's good to make it even more fun to run! What do you think?</p>
<p>We will also make sure to add a ""travel-mode"", which means that you can untie yourself from your actual GPS coordinate. You'll need to generate a map in the standard mode first, but once you have that you can play on the same map from anywhere in the world. You could even play from a treadmill!</p>
<p>Nope, you will not be able to travel by car. The game will only let you play if you move under maximum running speed. We might make it possible to go by bike as you find a special item in the game. The possibilities are endless! This brings us to the next point.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What are your thought?</h3>
<p>We are very open for your thoughts and ideas about the game. It's part of the reason why we're doing this campaign!</p>
<p>Is there a gameplay feature you would really love to see? Is there any problem you think we need to solve? Let us know and leave a message at the comment section!</p>
<p></p>
</div><div><h3>We need you! :)</h3></div><div>
<p>If we're gonna be able to work on this full time, we need your help to support our time. We have some savings but it's just not enough. Reaching our funding goal of $6000 will make sure one of us can work full time as well as covering all our other expenses, such as maintaining a website and licensing theme music.</p>
<p>If we reach our goal we can promise to release a beta version this coming spring. That way you can start running during the whole season. The beta will be very playable but will lack all the planned content and final polish.</p>
<p>Even though it's not critical, we aim to exceed the funding goal. If we gather the double amount, things will really start to happen. We can then hire someone to make continuous ports to iPhone. We can free up more of our time and even hire in an additional artist which will raise the quality of the release and its amount of content substantially. We could license a lot more music, a full album of scores fitting the theme of the game.</p>
<p>If we don't receive enough funding we will have a hard period ahead. We won't be able to keep up the pace and the release will probably be delayed a year. We intend to complete the game anyway and will try to manage, so don't be afraid that you would fund a project that just dies away!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Your rewards</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Of course, a fine deed will not be left unrewarded! There are different reward levels ranging from the very tiny amount of $1 up to $1000. All the perks will reward you with unique achievement badges, such as an golden idol. These will be visible in all online affiliations of the game such as the support forums.</p>
<p>We hope the different perks are explained well enough in the field to the right, but if something is unclear, don't hesitate to ask!</p>
<p>Choose them wisely and remember that this campaign is the only chance to fetch these perks.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Of course, if you like this game but cannot fund us you can help by spreading the word. This is highly valuable and will help make the game known not only for the campaign itself but for when it actually will release!</p>
<p>However, if you plan on buying the game we still recommend you fund at least the 6 dollars to get the game, because it may cost more at release.</p>
<p>Surely you have friends that might really need this game. You should let them know about this game, for their own good! We're happy to say the benefits are mutual - Not only will you help us that way, but you'll also help your friends getting healthier.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The story behind Runners Grinders</h3>
<p>The story of this game begins in this summer, at a computers club. A revolt was on the way, some of the nerds inhabiting the place was actually beginning to exercise and it was spreading like a virus! In the mind of one of them a devilish plan was taking form - A game that would cause any nerd to start exercise!</p>
<p>Actually, this idea maybe wasn't so bad after all. Exercise is a good thing, right? I mean, even though it might be boring and hard to find motivation for, it's not a bad thing. Why not make it fun then? Games with quests, items, levels and achievements can offer an severe amount of motivations, so why not use that potential? This was the thoughts that brought this game to life.</p>
<p>The project started out with just one of us working on it - Fredrik Andersson, which is the one writing this. When I first got the idea I hadn't heard of any game like this before. I found the idea so good that I felt I had to start a company. It was my responsibility to make this game! I was currently occupied by studying for an engineering degree, so I started working on this game in my spare time. The game required more and more of my time and focus. I realized it wouldn't work out to do both and decided to work on this full time!</p>
<p>Since I decided on working full time, the plan looked much more solid which let me recruit two good friends that's actually studying game development.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Keep updated!</h3>
<div>Also, if you wonder about anything, don't hesitate to ask. We'll put up a FAQ once we get some questions rolling in.<br/>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We hope you've enjoyed our campaign so far! Have a great day, and take care of your health and spirit!</p>

The airship sure didn't make it, but other that that, we, our gear and supplies made it pretty well. Crawling outside we could see a lush and completely wild land...

Nope, you will not be able to travel by car. The game will only let you play if you move under maximum running speed. We might make it possible to go by bike as you find a special item in the game. The possibilities are endless! This brings us to the next point.

What are your thought?
We are very open for your thoughts and ideas about the game. It's part of the reason why we're doing this campaign!
Is there a gameplay feature you would really love to see? Is there any problem you think we need to solve? Let us know and leave a message at the comment section!

We need you! :)
If we're gonna be able to work on this full time, we need your help to support our time. We have some savings but it's just not enough. Reaching our funding goal of $6000 will make sure one of us can work full time as well as covering all our other expenses, such as maintaining a website and licensing theme music.
If we reach our goal we can promise to release a beta version this coming spring. That way you can start running during the whole season. The beta will be very playable but will lack all the planned content and final polish.
Even though it's not critical, we aim to exceed the funding goal. If we gather the double amount, things will really start to happen. We can then hire someone to make continuous ports to iPhone. We can free up more of our time and even hire in an additional artist which will raise the quality of the release and its amount of content substantially. We could license a lot more music, a full album of scores fitting the theme of the game.
If we don't receive enough funding we will have a hard period ahead. We won't be able to keep up the pace and the release will probably be delayed a year. We intend to complete the game anyway and will try to manage, so don't be afraid that you would fund a project that just dies away!

Your rewards

Of course, a fine deed will not be left unrewarded! There are different reward levels ranging from the very tiny amount of $1 up to $1000. All the perks will reward you with unique achievement badges, such as an golden idol. These will be visible in all online affiliations of the game such as the support forums.
We hope the different perks are explained well enough in the field to the right, but if something is unclear, don't hesitate to ask!
Choose them wisely and remember that this campaign is the only chance to fetch these perks.

Other Ways You Can Help
Of course, if you like this game but cannot fund us you can help by spreading the word. This is highly valuable and will help make the game known not only for the campaign itself but for when it actually will release!
However, if you plan on buying the game we still recommend you fund at least the 6 dollars to get the game, because it may cost more at release.
Surely you have friends that might really need this game. You should let them know about this game, for their own good! We're happy to say the benefits are mutual - Not only will you help us that way, but you'll also help your friends getting healthier.

The story behind Runners Grinders
The story of this game begins in this summer, at a computers club. A revolt was on the way, some of the nerds inhabiting the place was actually beginning to exercise and it was spreading like a virus! In the mind of one of them a devilish plan was taking form - A game that would cause any nerd to start exercise!
Actually, this idea maybe wasn't so bad after all. Exercise is a good thing, right? I mean, even though it might be boring and hard to find motivation for, it's not a bad thing. Why not make it fun then? Games with quests, items, levels and achievements can offer an severe amount of motivations, so why not use that potential? This was the thoughts that brought this game to life.
The project started out with just one of us working on it - Fredrik Andersson, which is the one writing this. When I first got the idea I hadn't heard of any game like this before. I found the idea so good that I felt I had to start a company. It was my responsibility to make this game! I was currently occupied by studying for an engineering degree, so I started working on this game in my spare time. The game required more and more of my time and focus. I realized it wouldn't work out to do both and decided to work on this full time!
Since I decided on working full time, the plan looked much more solid which let me recruit two good friends that's actually studying game development.


Keep updated!
Also, if you wonder about anything, don't hesitate to ask. We'll put up a FAQ once we get some questions rolling in.


We hope you've enjoyed our campaign so far! Have a great day, and take care of your health and spirit!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

It is a multiplayer-only game that is set in a dynamically changing, stealth-like environment focused on alliances and co-operation. The design puts you in near pitch black with only a flashlight and a gun. Shadows and light will give anyone away, whether it's the light flashing on them, or their own flashlight. The design is supposed to have people make sacrifices using their own flashlight, but also, if they can get away with it, use it to take down enemies. However, the plan is to be able to use it in such a way where someone needs to sacrifice himself/herself for the team to succeed.</p>
<p>As planned, the game's design is going smoothly in terms of team work and lights. The work is focused around stealth and tactical gameplay. Based on you and your team's tactics, the game experience will change.</p>
<p>Another focus in the game is sound. Footsteps and gunshots being heard will be a way to detect enemies. For example, if a unity is looking for you, chances are, you will hide behind an object and turn off your flashlight. When they look for you, they will probably be searching for a light source that doesn't exist; and, since you aren't moving, they have no way of hearing you. You hear the enemy or see them come into your sight, you pop out of your hiding spot, and shoot them. They wouldn't expect this because they had no way of finding you without a flashlight or sound.</p>
<p>The Networking multiplayer tests are already done and completely functional. The next step is the actual game. When we have money, the polish will come into play. The game will be a basic design and things will be added in updates after the game's release.</p>
<p>The minimum amount of money we need for the game is $3,000, but that is only for licenses: the bare minimum. For actual professional design and work, we will need the full amount of fundraising money.</p>

<h2>Visit <a href=""http://www.dominiquepamplemousse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dominiquepamplemousse.com</a> to check it out!</h2>
<hr/><p>Hi! My name is <a href=""http://www.deirdrakiai.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Deirdra</a>, and I’m a writer, programmer, musician, and visual artist who primarily works in videogames and interactive media. My latest work in progress is a stop motion musical detective adventure called <em>Dominique Pamplemousse in “It’s All Over Once the Fat Lady Sings!”</em></p>
<p><img alt=""Dominique Pamplemousse logo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://deirdrakiai.com/images/pamplemousse/logo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Pimple-what?</h3>
<p>Dominique Pamplemousse, the titular protagonist, is a down-on-their-luck private investigator of ambiguous gender only one rent payment away from homelessness. When the CEO of a major record company shows up asking Dominique to locate a missing pop star, taking the job appears to be the straightforward thing to do. However, as things are never quite as they seem in these kinds of stories, Dominique winds up framed for a crime they didn’t commit, bringing to surface their mysterious past and the events that led them to take up shady detective work in the first place.</p>
<h3>Musical? Did I just read that correctly?</h3>
<p>With singing, and everything! It’ll be like watching a stage musical, only you get to control which verses the characters sing next. Pretty neat, huh?</p>
<p>I’ve written and recorded quite a bit of music for my previous interactive works, in addition to playing with a super awesome <a href=""http://www.orkestarslivovica.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Balkan brass band</a> for the past three years, so I’m definitely no stranger to this whole “being musical” thing. My aim is to go one step further and actually integrate music and singing into an interactive narrative format. Inspired by my experiences with jazz improvisation, the soundtrack to this project is composed in separate sections that can be played in a different order depending on the player’s actions.</p>
<p><img alt=""Me being musical"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://deirdrakiai.com/images/pamplemousse/euph.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>And it’s also in stop motion?</h3>
<p>I’ve always loved stop motion animation, and have wanted to use it in a videogame for quite some time. Pretty much all the art assets in this game are made from real, physical things: clay, aluminium wire, cardboard, paper, fabric, felt, duct tape, and whatever else I’ve been able to get my hands on. It makes for a much more organic art style than what I’ve previously been able to create using just a computer, and it just plain looks and feels like a lot of fun. (Check out the video at the top of the page to see it in action! You <em>did</em> notice there’s a video, right?

<p>I have a number of <a href=""http://www.deirdrakiai.com/my-games/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">finished solo projects</a> to my name, dating back to 2002.

<p>More importantly, however, I’m known for touching on personal issues in my work, such as feminism, race, gender, coming of age, and social awkwardness -- subjects you’d be hard-pressed to find in most big budget videogame productions.

<p>I’m using Adobe AIR; having been a Flash developer for years, Actionscript 3 is a language in which I’ve become quite comfortable. Plus, it has the advantage of being cross-platform. My current plan is to make the game available for Windows and Mac desktops, as well as on the iPad, but I am open to other devices (e.g. Android tablets) if I somehow wind up having the means to test them. If there’s any particular platform on which you really, really want to play this game, please let me know and I’ll do my best to make it happen!</p>

<p>So far, I’ve been working on <em>Pamplemousse</em> on my own dime, in whatever spare moments I’ve been able to fit in my schedule.

If this project gets fully funded, I’ll be able to treat the remainder of its development like a Real Job™ and get it finished within the year.</p>
<p>Taking into account that Indiegogo and PayPal will take their respective cuts, and that I’ll also need to create and ship your contribution perks, the amount I’ve asked for is the minimum I would need to fund the game to completion.

With that in mind, if I just so happen to get overfunded, Tim Schafer-style, I’ll be able to put in more spit and polish, and perhaps even bring on other people to help me.

<p>Why, the chance to contribute to the development of a really, really unique and offbeat videogame, of course!

<h3>I’m sold! Now what do I do?</h3>
<p>First, select your pledge and claim what perk you want. Then, tell all your like-minded friends about this project and share it on all your favourite social networks.

Visit dominiquepamplemousse.com to check it out!
Hi! My name is Deirdra, and I’m a writer, programmer, musician, and visual artist who primarily works in videogames and interactive media. My latest work in progress is a stop motion musical detective adventure called Dominique Pamplemousse in “It’s All Over Once the Fat Lady Sings!”

Pimple-what?
Dominique Pamplemousse, the titular protagonist, is a down-on-their-luck private investigator of ambiguous gender only one rent payment away from homelessness. When the CEO of a major record company shows up asking Dominique to locate a missing pop star, taking the job appears to be the straightforward thing to do. However, as things are never quite as they seem in these kinds of stories, Dominique winds up framed for a crime they didn’t commit, bringing to surface their mysterious past and the events that led them to take up shady detective work in the first place.
Musical? Did I just read that correctly?
With singing, and everything! It’ll be like watching a stage musical, only you get to control which verses the characters sing next. Pretty neat, huh?
I’ve written and recorded quite a bit of music for my previous interactive works, in addition to playing with a super awesome Balkan brass band for the past three years, so I’m definitely no stranger to this whole “being musical” thing. My aim is to go one step further and actually integrate music and singing into an interactive narrative format. Inspired by my experiences with jazz improvisation, the soundtrack to this project is composed in separate sections that can be played in a different order depending on the player’s actions.

And it’s also in stop motion?
I’ve always loved stop motion animation, and have wanted to use it in a videogame for quite some time. Pretty much all the art assets in this game are made from real, physical things: clay, aluminium wire, cardboard, paper, fabric, felt, duct tape, and whatever else I’ve been able to get my hands on. It makes for a much more organic art style than what I’ve previously been able to create using just a computer, and it just plain looks and feels like a lot of fun. (Check out the video at the top of the page to see it in action! You did notice there’s a video, right? Or alternatively, play the demo!)

So, what kind of experience do you have with game development, anyway?
I have a number of finished solo projects to my name, dating back to 2002. Most recently, I released the previously-crowdfunded Life Flashes By and the award-winning, text-based The Play. I’ve also worked professionally in game design and programming on several larger titles.

<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>THE PROJECT IN A NUTSHELL:</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Those evil corporations have polluted our air and water so much that our friends, family and neighbors have been turned into </span><span>kleptomaniac zombies!</span><span> It’s YOUR job to manage them, and to defend your home and restore the environment to save humanity both in the game and in REAL LIFE.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>In the meantime, you must train your recently zombified friends and family to defend your house and gather resources in this post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland. Careful - your new neighbors are watching YOUR house for things to steal!</span></p>
<p>Here’s the kicker: All the game items you will be using to improve and defend your house have real-world coupon counterparts, so you can use them to save massive bucks on that new lamp, water filter, fridge or washing machine purchase!</p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>CROWDSOURCING ROCKS!!</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Not only are we using the power of the crowd to raise seed money through IndieGoGo, but we’re also making crowdsourcing a key part of our game. We will accept art, items, and sounds directly from players, so you can add weapons, zombies, or whatever your heart desires to the game! Plus, there will be awesome cash prizes for the top rated user-submitted items!</span></p>

Captain Killjoy, forced our heroic company to be established in the United States. You see, in Venezuela, video games, fun, and smiles are banned and punishable by stern looks, jail time, or death.  That’s why we now operate in the Land of the free and Home of the brave - where the pursuit of happiness is much more than a distant dream - it’s a right.</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>Chavez is a </span><a href=""http://www.hacer.org/latam/?p=4335"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>corrupt and violent dictator</span></a><span>.  Besides handing out guns on the street to </span><a href=""http://world.time.com/2012/02/03/a-repulsive-childrens-crusade-in-venezuela-but-hope-for-a-civil-presidential-campaign/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>kids</span></a><span> - he has ironically made violent video games illegal.  Sound too ridiculous to be true?  Check out this article:</span></p>

<p> </p>
<h2>WHO HELPED US WITH THE VIDEO:</h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>MORF is a creative/video studio based in Venezuela and we have a very close partnership with their studio - in fact, we worked closely with them on the IndieGoGo video.  We plan to continue creating videos with them that capture the story behind the game.  We may even merge the studios in the next couple of years if the game really takes off!  Gerardo, Pericles, Alvaro, and Armando all appeared in the IndieGoGo video.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span> </span></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><span>WHY INDIEGOGO?</span></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For the past nine months, we have been pouring our blood, sweat, and tears...along with our personal savings into the project because we believe in the vision.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>For the past few months we’ve been hunting for funding and have approached numerous funds, VCs, and publishers and we keep getting the same story - “we love the game, but aren’t crazy about the environmental part of the business plan”.  Well - the problem is that we </span><span>are</span><span> crazy about the environmental part of the business plan - we’re crazy in love with it!  We have two core reasons for doing this: first, we want to make a super entertaining 3D game for everyone to enjoy; and second, we want to create a new way for people to help others live greener lives.  VCs and publishers haven’t seen the light yet - they can’t see how popular and awesome a game like this will be - so help us show them that people want a fun game that also helps save the planet.  And just to be clear - in case you are a VC - we have nothing against accepting capital from a VC - we just don’t want to compromise our vision.  So if you’re a VC that gets it - give us a call!</span></p>
<h2>WHAT WE NEED?</h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We need $50,000 to finish our game.  We’ve been bootstrapping the game for the past nine months and we’re running out of our personal savings.  We will not spend a single dime we raise frivolously - we’re going to put the bulk of it towards sustaining our artists, developers, and game designers.  The rest will go towards caffeine and servers.</span></p>

<p><strong> </strong></p></div>","THE PROJECT IN A NUTSHELL:
Those evil corporations have polluted our air and water so much that our friends, family and neighbors have been turned into kleptomaniac zombies! It’s YOUR job to manage them, and to defend your home and restore the environment to save humanity both in the game and in REAL LIFE.
In the meantime, you must train your recently zombified friends and family to defend your house and gather resources in this post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland. Careful - your new neighbors are watching YOUR house for things to steal!
Here’s the kicker: All the game items you will be using to improve and defend your house have real-world coupon counterparts, so you can use them to save massive bucks on that new lamp, water filter, fridge or washing machine purchase!
CROWDSOURCING ROCKS!!
Not only are we using the power of the crowd to raise seed money through IndieGoGo, but we’re also making crowdsourcing a key part of our game. We will accept art, items, and sounds directly from players, so you can add weapons, zombies, or whatever your heart desires to the game! Plus, there will be awesome cash prizes for the top rated user-submitted items!

WHY ARE WE IN AMERICA??
Chavez of Venezuela, A.K.A. Captain Killjoy, forced our heroic company to be established in the United States. You see, in Venezuela, video games, fun, and smiles are banned and punishable by stern looks, jail time, or death.  That’s why we now operate in the Land of the free and Home of the brave - where the pursuit of happiness is much more than a distant dream - it’s a right.

Chavez is a corrupt and violent dictator.  Besides handing out guns on the street to kids - he has ironically made violent video games illegal.  Sound too ridiculous to be true?  Check out this article:
http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/venezuela/091120/violent-video-game-ban
 
WHO HELPED US WITH THE VIDEO:
MORF is a creative/video studio based in Venezuela and we have a very close partnership with their studio - in fact, we worked closely with them on the IndieGoGo video.  We plan to continue creating videos with them that capture the story behind the game.  We may even merge the studios in the next couple of years if the game really takes off!  Gerardo, Pericles, Alvaro, and Armando all appeared in the IndieGoGo video.  
 
WHY INDIEGOGO?
For the past nine months, we have been pouring our blood, sweat, and tears...along with our personal savings into the project because we believe in the vision.
For the past few months we’ve been hunting for funding and have approached numerous funds, VCs, and publishers and we keep getting the same story - “we love the game, but aren’t crazy about the environmental part of the business plan”.  Well - the problem is that we are crazy about the environmental part of the business plan - we’re crazy in love with it!  We have two core reasons for doing this: first, we want to make a super entertaining 3D game for everyone to enjoy; and second, we want to create a new way for people to help others live greener lives.  VCs and publishers haven’t seen the light yet - they can’t see how popular and awesome a game like this will be - so help us show them that people want a fun game that also helps save the planet.  And just to be clear - in case you are a VC - we have nothing against accepting capital from a VC - we just don’t want to compromise our vision.  So if you’re a VC that gets it - give us a call!
WHAT WE NEED?
We need $50,000 to finish our game.  We’ve been bootstrapping the game for the past nine months and we’re running out of our personal savings.  We will not spend a single dime we raise frivolously - we’re going to put the bulk of it towards sustaining our artists, developers, and game designers.  The rest will go towards caffeine and servers.
WHY YOU SHOULD BECOME A PART OF THIS:


First of all - we are offering some really awesome rewards - check out the full details below.

 


Second, with pollution, destruction of nature, and climate change wreaking havoc on the world - we need people to be more aware of the problems facing the environment and what they can do about them, but we need a FUN way to confront them. We can have fun and safe the world at the same time!

 


Third, in a world in crisis with a recession the likes no ones has ever seen before, entrepreneurs creating companies leads to more growth, more jobs, and a better life for everyone.

 


Fourth, it’s really obvious, but we’re including it anyway - you’ll have an awesome game to play!

 


Fifth, show the publishers and the rest of the world how the gaming community is not just a bunch of passive escapist kids, but a fully committed community of people who can save the world while having massive fun.

 


Sixth, show Chavez that he can’t stop a dream.

<p>******************************MAY 2015 UPDATE*****************************</p>
<p>Hello everyone, </p>
<p>I apologize for not updating the actual Indiegogo site.  I have been updating the Facebook page and completely forgot to update the Indiegogo page. </p>
<p>As you know, we have had some trouble getting our decks out in a timely fashion. The reason behind that is because we had a huge printing problem with the company we were having our decks printed from.  To make a long story as short as possible...  After doing several test runs and being satisfied with the printing quality, we began the printing for the batches of all of the ordered decks.  Unfortunately, the printing quality on our final run was not acceptable at all.  </p>
<p>Because we did not meet our ultimate goal, the amount of fees that were taken out of the Campaign, no wiggle room for a mistake of this nature, as well as, not having any savings cushion for such a happening, we are now left to pick up the pieces and get the final batches ordered... slowly, but surely. </p>
<p>Where we are now:  We are now staying committed to fulfilling all of the deck orders that were placed during the Indiegogo campaign.  However, because we are now having to put our own money into the fulfillment, it will be a slow process.  We are a small family business and have not had the opportunity to grow a cushion for instances such as these.  </p>
<p>We are now slowly getting decks out a few at a time.  We ask for your patience.  We are committed to fulfilling the orders for decks; however, there is only so much we can do at a time.  Creating our own game along with our first Indiegogo Campaign has turned out to be a huge learning process and a process that is going much slower than we ever anticipated.  </p>
<p>Thank you for your continued support!!  We again apologize for the delay and hope that you will understand the difficulties in growing a small family business without the capital for any hiccups.  We do hope to one day see our game in store counters.  Perhaps once the decks are out to you all, that can happen.  For now, we will focus on getting those decks out to you all.  Thank You!!  </p>

</div></div>","******************************MAY 2015 UPDATE*****************************
Hello everyone, 
I apologize for not updating the actual Indiegogo site.  I have been updating the Facebook page and completely forgot to update the Indiegogo page. 
As you know, we have had some trouble getting our decks out in a timely fashion. The reason behind that is because we had a huge printing problem with the company we were having our decks printed from.  To make a long story as short as possible...  After doing several test runs and being satisfied with the printing quality, we began the printing for the batches of all of the ordered decks.  Unfortunately, the printing quality on our final run was not acceptable at all.  
Because we did not meet our ultimate goal, the amount of fees that were taken out of the Campaign, no wiggle room for a mistake of this nature, as well as, not having any savings cushion for such a happening, we are now left to pick up the pieces and get the final batches ordered... slowly, but surely. 
Where we are now:  We are now staying committed to fulfilling all of the deck orders that were placed during the Indiegogo campaign.  However, because we are now having to put our own money into the fulfillment, it will be a slow process.  We are a small family business and have not had the opportunity to grow a cushion for instances such as these.  
We are now slowly getting decks out a few at a time.  We ask for your patience.  We are committed to fulfilling the orders for decks; however, there is only so much we can do at a time.  Creating our own game along with our first Indiegogo Campaign has turned out to be a huge learning process and a process that is going much slower than we ever anticipated.  
Thank you for your continued support!!  We again apologize for the delay and hope that you will understand the difficulties in growing a small family business without the capital for any hiccups.  We do hope to one day see our game in store counters.  Perhaps once the decks are out to you all, that can happen.  For now, we will focus on getting those decks out to you all.  Thank You!!  
*****************************************************************************

We are Matt and Kesha Hawk.  We began our company, The Hawks' Aerie, several years ago to combine and collaborate their multiple and diverse talents.  We strive to utilize our talents in ways that support and sustain our beautiful, zany, unique family while making an impact on people's lives.  It has always been important to The Hawk Family to bring our creativity and passion to the forefront with thoughtful care in how our pieces affect the clients that commission our work.   
Matt has been an illustrator for the past  14 plus years.  He has spent his art career working on video games, creating original artwork, and teaching children how to create their own pieces of original art.  Wanting to branch out, with the desire to create something unique and fun with original illustrations of his own, he has recently created an awesome new card game from his original illustrations.  
We have dabbled in lots of commissioned work across the country.  In most recent years, we have gained the support of our Eugene, Oregon community.  We are finally ready to present our first big campaign going out to the public from The Hawks' Aerie - Widdershins Card Game!!
This campaign of Widdershins Card Game is very important to The Hawk Family. We have put a lot of love, care, and passion into the creation of this game.  Our family loves working together and bringing what we love to those around us.  Now, it is time to do this on a bigger scale than we have ever done before.  To do this successfully, we need your help and support!

If you could be a part of the beginning of a card game aimed for any age that has the potential to expand into a World of Its Own, would you?  Do you want to be an integral part of the process of making Widdershins a household name?  
By contributing or simply sharing our campaign with others who can contribute, you will not only be helping an awesome card game garner success and availability to the masses, but will help us begin to delve even deeper into the backstory of all the characters - truly creating a World of Widdershins.
You will also be helping us get out to as many gaming conventions as possible. After all, it takes exposure to get a game truly out to the masses.  Exposure is done through conventions to get the game seen by business owners and customers alike. We want to see Widdershins in as many homes and game stores as possible across the country.  Will you help us achieve our goal?   

What is Widdershins?  What is this game all about, you ask? 
It is a 78-card deck.  The game is part strategy, part luck.  Good for ages 8 to 108. Below is a visual as to how the game plays.  
  
Here is a bit of the backstory, which will be a part of a future ""History and Character Guide for the World of Widdershins""...   


Long ago before the time of man, the Fae ruled on Earth.  Their civilization was orderly and refined.  Using the powers of the four elements together, they created amazing works of art and expanded their evergrowing civilization.  Then, the Fae splintered into small warring factions across the World, and they have fought against each other for eons.  The curse can only be broken when the Fae learn to work together again and erase the curse of Murioche.  
Now, it is time for you to step sideways, from our World into the World of Widdershins to help bring this curse to an end.  Gather your armies and bring the Fae together again.  But beware - Murioche has tricks yet to play.  This is but the beginning of your adventure.  For now, you have to just get the Fae to work together again.  Wait until you see what happens when they find their powers again!! 
Remember, you are now in their  world where nothing is what it seems,
And sometimes, the best way to go is backwards!!



Our campaign is looking for at least $6,000 to get this game up and going to the masses.  These funds will pay for production and distribution costs to get the game to as many game business owners and customers as possible.  We want our name and our game out there!!  
With an additional $2,000, we will reach our First Stretch Goal of $8,000, which will allow us to get to as many conventions across the country as possible.  These could include the following conventions:  Emerald City ComicCon, San Diego ComicCon, Orycon, Steamposium, BayouCon, DragonCon, and more...  True exposure will happen at these conventions and help make Widdershins a household name!
Another $2,000 will bring us to our Second Stretch Goal of $10,000, allowing us to begin creation of the First Expansion Pack.  This will introduce a fifth element of Spirit, new characters, enhanced powers for character cards, more complex game play rules, and more!  It will also allow us to begin creation of ""The History and Character Guide for the World of Widdershins,"" coloring book, travel game board, and the beginning of dabbling with the 3D character pieces for the game.  






1st Reward Tier:  $10 - With a contribution of $10, you will receive (1) signed print of Murioche.

2nd Reward Tier:  With a contribution of $30, you will receive the previous reward PLUS The Game!!



3rd Reward Tier:  With a contribution of $50, you will receive the previous rewards PLUS the following (4) signed prints of the #1 suit character cards from the game.


4th Reward Tier:  With a contribution of $75, you will receive all previous rewards PLUS a poster with all original 20 characters from the first run of the game.


5th Reward Tier:  With a contribution of $100, you will receive all previous rewards PLUS the vinyl 2 ft x 2 ft Travel Game Board that rolls up.



6th Reward Tier:  With a contribution of $500, you will receive all previous rewards PLUS a one-of-a-kind Character Card for your own personal deck designed by Matt Hawk.






Obviously, financial contribution will help us attain our goal.  However, we understand that some of you who have the desire to support us will not have the ability to support in a financial contribution.  No worries!!  You can STILL help in a huge, major way!!  
We need people to SHARE our Indiegogo link and SHARE our Facebook link.  We need people to get the word out to others that we do not know.  This is an important aspect of this campaign.

Supporting this campaign will allow us to release this game on Facebook.</span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;"">When you make purchases in the game, you arenâ€™t just changing the village you see on your computer screen, youâ€™re making a donation to the towns weâ€™re helping.

Youâ€™ll progress through a heart-warming and compelling narrative where youâ€™ll make meaningful decisions about the progression of your village.</span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;"">While you attempt to reach virtual sustainability within the game, you can also step through a portal and enter the world of Kapir Atiira. If you decide to explore the portal, you can absorb the culture and lifestyle of the village youâ€™re helping by reading blog posts, watching videos, and viewing pictures. </span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;"">Obviously, you can give money to help Kapir Atiira, but you mean more to us than a few quick bucks: We want you to become part of the team! Through the portal, you can directly contribute your thoughts and ideas to specific projects happening in the village like building a water well, and youâ€™ll be updated in real time about their status.

In fact, there is already a version of â€œRaise the Villageâ€ available for download on iTunes for play on iPhone, iPad and iPod. However, the version weâ€™re creating for Facebook is no simple port from one platform to the next.</span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;"">â€œRaise the Villageâ€ is, essentially, being remade for Facebook. It will have a brand new art style, game mechanics and connectivity to Kapir Atiira. If you've played and enjoyed the old â€œRaise the Villageâ€ on iPhone, youâ€™ll be blown away with how much better the Facebook version is.</span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;"">The initial release of the game was made by an outside development team very early in the existence of New Charity Era. Because of this, the final version wasnâ€™t entirely what we envisioned it to be, but it still contains the most basic concepts we want to incorporate into this fully fleshed out version of the game. Since the original release, the team at New Charity Era has grown to include our own developers and artists who can make the game we originally intended â€œRaise the Villageâ€ to be. </span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;"">â€œRaise the Villageâ€ on iOS has given us the chance to learn more about the process of deliveries to the village and communication with both Kapir Atiira and our users. With this pertinent information, weâ€™re poised to make an incredibly immersive game for Facebook that also provides a never-before-seen level of interactivity with the village youâ€™re helping.</span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;"">What has â€œRaise the Villageâ€ done so far?</span><br/><span style=""background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; text-decoration: none; white-space: pre-wrap; font-weight: normal; font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);white-space:normal !important;"">In the short year that the old version of â€œRaise the Villageâ€ has been out on iOS it has allowed players to give enough to make four deliveries to the village a possibility. It was also featured twice by Apple in iTunes under ""new and noteworthy"" and ""what we're playing,"" it was ranked sixth on the App Store over both ""Angry Birds"" and ""Facebook,"" it was nominated for 2011's Best App Ever by 148Apps, and it's been downloaded over 300,000 times. </span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;white-space:normal !important;""></span><br/><span style=""font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;white-space:normal !important;"">Weâ€™ve already created a new method of giving, and weâ€™ve seen that itâ€™s unequivocally more effective than the archaic operations of charities in years past. Weâ€™ve already brought charity into the 21st century, now itâ€™s time to bring it to the largest audience possible via Facebook.</span></span>

</h3></div>","$50,000 is ambitious, but we can achieve something at several levels of funding: Raise $20,000 and . . .Weâ€™ll create â€œRaise the Villageâ€ for Facebook, and youâ€™ll get to play this revolutionary social game. Raise $30,000 and . . .Weâ€™ll accomplish the above and travel to Africa to revamp our infrastructure. This will allow quicker correspondence with the village and incredible interactivity for the player. Raise $50,000 or more and . . .We can take the gaming and giving experience to a new plane of existence. This means production value beyond anything youâ€™ve seen in the realm of social gaming or giving, including instantaneous communication with the village that lets players see the impact theyâ€™re making in real-time.
  

What is â€œRaise the Village?â€â€œRaise the Villageâ€ is a game that lets you create a highly personalized virtual village while you simultaneously transform an actual village in Africa. Supporting this campaign will allow us to release this game on Facebook.When you make purchases in the game, you arenâ€™t just changing the village you see on your computer screen, youâ€™re making a donation to the towns weâ€™re helping. Currently, weâ€™re focused on the Ugandan village of Kapir Atiira, and once itâ€™s a sustainable village, we will expand and begin helping other impoverished villages reach sustainability.The game will be social in nature, allowing you to connect with all your friends whoâ€™re playing, but it will also challenge you to make the right choices for your village. Youâ€™ll progress through a heart-warming and compelling narrative where youâ€™ll make meaningful decisions about the progression of your village.While you attempt to reach virtual sustainability within the game, you can also step through a portal and enter the world of Kapir Atiira. If you decide to explore the portal, you can absorb the culture and lifestyle of the village youâ€™re helping by reading blog posts, watching videos, and viewing pictures. Obviously, you can give money to help Kapir Atiira, but you mean more to us than a few quick bucks: We want you to become part of the team! Through the portal, you can directly contribute your thoughts and ideas to specific projects happening in the village like building a water well, and youâ€™ll be updated in real time about their status. Send us feedback in the form of videos, comments or pictures, and you can easily become a part of the decision-making process. Where can I play â€œRaise the Village?â€â€œRaise the Villageâ€ is going to be a Facebook game; however, this isnâ€™t the first time itâ€™s left the starting gates. In fact, there is already a version of â€œRaise the Villageâ€ available for download on iTunes for play on iPhone, iPad and iPod. However, the version weâ€™re creating for Facebook is no simple port from one platform to the next.â€œRaise the Villageâ€ is, essentially, being remade for Facebook. It will have a brand new art style, game mechanics and connectivity to Kapir Atiira. If you've played and enjoyed the old â€œRaise the Villageâ€ on iPhone, youâ€™ll be blown away with how much better the Facebook version is.The initial release of the game was made by an outside development team very early in the existence of New Charity Era. Because of this, the final version wasnâ€™t entirely what we envisioned it to be, but it still contains the most basic concepts we want to incorporate into this fully fleshed out version of the game. Since the original release, the team at New Charity Era has grown to include our own developers and artists who can make the game we originally intended â€œRaise the Villageâ€ to be. â€œRaise the Villageâ€ on iOS has given us the chance to learn more about the process of deliveries to the village and communication with both Kapir Atiira and our users. With this pertinent information, weâ€™re poised to make an incredibly immersive game for Facebook that also provides a never-before-seen level of interactivity with the village youâ€™re helping.What has â€œRaise the Villageâ€ done so far?In the short year that the old version of â€œRaise the Villageâ€ has been out on iOS it has allowed players to give enough to make four deliveries to the village a possibility. It was also featured twice by Apple in iTunes under ""new and noteworthy"" and ""what we're playing,"" it was ranked sixth on the App Store over both ""Angry Birds"" and ""Facebook,"" it was nominated for 2011's Best App Ever by 148Apps, and it's been downloaded over 300,000 times. Weâ€™ve already created a new method of giving, and weâ€™ve seen that itâ€™s unequivocally more effective than the archaic operations of charities in years past. Weâ€™ve already brought charity into the 21st century, now itâ€™s time to bring it to the largest audience possible via Facebook.



The previous version of â€œRaise the Villageâ€ received accolades from: 
Who is behind â€œRaise the Villageâ€?New Charity Era is the team behind â€œRaise the Village.â€  While the team is currently six guys with a vision, weâ€™re growing. Some of the team is in America, working on our game, while the remainder of the team is located in Kapir Atiira, on-site and ready to help.Weâ€™ve also brought on the help of a top-notch developer, Puppy Punch Productions, to fine tune this release to perfection. With these resources, we think we can change the world -- no, scratch that -- we know we can change the world.While the task of changing the world may sound grandiose, it can be accomplished one village at a time. With enough people behind the cause, sustainable villages all over the entire continent of Africa are a highly viable possibility. After that, we move on to the next continent, and we donâ€™t stop until the job is done.This mentality is at the very core of our teamâ€™s mode of operation. We work tirelessly to make our vision a reality. There are no insurmountable obstacles. As of right now, no one on the team has seen a single dime from â€œRaise the Village.â€ We have all worked for free for the benefit of Kapir Atiira, every penny has gone into helping the village and operation costs. But weâ€™ve all been rewarded with something better than money: the opportunity to make a meaningful impact in the lives of those who need it most. Weâ€™ve received so much from this venture, and we want to extend that opportunity to you as well.Our definition of â€œteamâ€ isnâ€™t as stringent as other companies, because to us, if you support our cause, youâ€™re on the team! So jump on board and head down the road of change with us. First destination: Kapir Atiira.


What have have people been saying about â€œRaise the Village?â€â€œâ€˜Raise the Villageâ€™ is an innovative platform that takes advantage of mobile apps to provide a service that can actually have a positive impact on the world. You can't say that about many other apps out there. This one's actually worth something.â€

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi. My name is Bernie and I've been a gamer since the day I was born. :) But I only got into the hobby seriously when I opened my first Magic the Gathering booster in 1996. Ever since then, I've been into various collectible and non-collectible games - Mage Knight, LOTR CCG, VS CCG, and most recently, back into Magic again. I also collect and play board games, DnD and TONS of iOS games.Recently, I have also developed an iOS game -<a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/grammar-police/id397583585?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""""> Grammar Police</a>, a game which teaches the basics of grammar to children and 2nd Language learners.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The idea for this new game - PvP, came about as a way to meld all the good things I love about gaming - cards, dice, strategy and more importantly, having a game with friends.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In PvP, you choose a team of 3-4 combatants from a roster of up to 12 unique characters. Each character has special abilities that trigger when a specific dice combination is rolled. Each combat turn, 6 dice are rolled three times and the player can keep any number of dice between these rolls. (aka Yahtzee mechanics) After the final roll, the player allocates the dice to the cards. Watch the video for a sample of game turn!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Throw in faction abilities and additional factions/characters updates, the options for customization are near limitless!!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The game is already available as a free Print-n-Play format (download it at <a href=""http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/87562/pvp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Boardgamegeek</a>) and I really want to see it materialize in a digital form.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will go towards hiring an artist and designer for the card art (The current art is drawn by an internet artist - Peter Sekler (pseckler13@msn.com). Funding will also go towards hiring a developer to code and develop the game for an iOS format. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Additional funding above the limit will go towards developing it for the Android platform.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If funding goal is not met, I will still go ahead with development. I really want to see this game come to life! However, I really need your help to do this! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The game will come with 4 factions (3 characters per faction), with additional factions and characters available either as IAP or free updates. The game will be fully asynchronous multi-player-enabled (single player vs AI game dependent on funding)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<div>While I don't have much to offer, my levels of ""perks"" are as follows</div>

<p> 3years ago, we founded our start-up with the goal to create the ""Game of Life"".</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We were playing a board game that nite, when we realised that there is no actual game for the real world. We were searching the internet, the app- and google play store, but there was no game to be found.</span><br/></p>
<p>But what is (the game of) life about? </p>
<p></p>
<p>Your life is a sea of endless possibilities. As you grow and change, you have infinite paths to choose from and multiple roles to play. Only you can decide how to live your life.</p>
<p>Get to know the world around you by exploring every opportunity. The earth has 7 continents, 196 countries and more than 7 billion people. Where will you go? Who will you meet? How far will you venture out of your comfort zone?</p>
<p>With youdare, your life becomes limitless. Take on dares from the role of an engineer, artist, globetrotter, athlete or mingler and complete them in your real life.</p>
<p>Create you own dares and challenge yourself, your friends or even the world. Then upload your proof as a picture or video and inspire others to follow in your footsteps.</p>

</div><div> <p>We just need you to go to <a href=""http://www.youdare.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.youdare.com</a> or directly in the app and /or google play store and download our app for free. We have an offer saying once we get 400000 downloads we will be funded to finish what is yet only at the very beginning of where we are heading to. If you want to fund us we do really appreciate,  </p>
<p>BUT:</p>
<p>WE DON'T ASK FOR YOUR FUNDING DIRECTLY.PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE APP. ITS FREE.AND SPREAD THE WORD. WHEN WE GET 400000 DOWNLOADS WE WILL BE FUNDED!!!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The game of Life is about you and you only. What you consider a challenge for yourself and for which challenges you want to go,  is for you and you only to decide. We just want you, to ask yourself what you think your life should be about, and than inspire you to go for it. What greater impact on society can there be than that the single individual goes for his/hers/- own personal goals and dreams.</p>
<p> Right. NONE.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We already took a great financial risk and we are willing to go even further. If you download the app you will see where we are at right now, but you will also see what is still missing. To implement the necessary features (like a virtual Map, Messenger and so on) to compete with the ""Big guys"" we need serious funding.

</div></div>","Short Summary Hi my name is Patrick Fricke, I am 29 and I am the Co-Founder of the Minglemind Ag, Berlin, Germany.
 3years ago, we founded our start-up with the goal to create the ""Game of Life"".
We were playing a board game that nite, when we realised that there is no actual game for the real world. We were searching the internet, the app- and google play store, but there was no game to be found.
But what is (the game of) life about? 

Your life is a sea of endless possibilities. As you grow and change, you have infinite paths to choose from and multiple roles to play. Only you can decide how to live your life.
Get to know the world around you by exploring every opportunity. The earth has 7 continents, 196 countries and more than 7 billion people. Where will you go? Who will you meet? How far will you venture out of your comfort zone?
With youdare, your life becomes limitless. Take on dares from the role of an engineer, artist, globetrotter, athlete or mingler and complete them in your real life.
Create you own dares and challenge yourself, your friends or even the world. Then upload your proof as a picture or video and inspire others to follow in your footsteps.

What We Need & What You Get
 We just need you to go to www.youdare.com or directly in the app and /or google play store and download our app for free. We have an offer saying once we get 400000 downloads we will be funded to finish what is yet only at the very beginning of where we are heading to. If you want to fund us we do really appreciate,  
BUT:
WE DON'T ASK FOR YOUR FUNDING DIRECTLY.PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE APP. ITS FREE.AND SPREAD THE WORD. WHEN WE GET 400000 DOWNLOADS WE WILL BE FUNDED!!!
    The Impact The game of Life is about you and you only. What you consider a challenge for yourself and for which challenges you want to go,  is for you and you only to decide. We just want you, to ask yourself what you think your life should be about, and than inspire you to go for it. What greater impact on society can there be than that the single individual goes for his/hers/- own personal goals and dreams.
 Right. NONE.
    Risks & Challenges We already took a great financial risk and we are willing to go even further. If you download the app you will see where we are at right now, but you will also see what is still missing. To implement the necessary features (like a virtual Map, Messenger and so on) to compete with the ""Big guys"" we need serious funding. But we think its worth the try and the risk besides the fact that we already risked a lot.
    Other Ways You Can Help You can either donate (which we would appreciate) or even better go to www.youdare.com download the app like us on Facebook, tweet about youdare using #youdare and spread the word that the next big thing is just about to happen very soon. Life is what you make. Let's  go for it together.

<p></p></div>","Live Twitter Mention During The Competition:















Who Should I Start?
Fantasy football players are DESPERATE to get
this question answered accurately each week.  Go on Twitter during a
football game week and see the mass of tweets requesting ""Pick 1 of these
2 QBs"" or WRs, FLEX, etc.  Many of the paid experts just don't have
the time or interest to answer tweets so who can you truly trust?  Some
random guy who answers your tweets?  Not quite.  In fact, who is
really accurate in their fantasy advice?  Where's the PROOF?                 
Rotochatter.com
takes care of this by tracking the accuracy of our users in their lineup
decisions and promoting interaction with these users and those seeking lineup
help. How you ask? Simple.Contest Setup

We run a weekly fantasy picks
contest grouping 4 similarly valued players (ie. Manning|Stafford|Newton|Brady)
and ask the question: ""Who will score the most fantasy points""
in that group using a preset PPR scoring system.   We do this for all positions (QB, RB, WR, TE, FLEX, D) and track each user's accuracy not only overall but also within each position group.  One user might not be great overall but have very high accuracy picking the FLEX group so why not pick his/her brain if you have a tough FLEX decision?  No-brainer!        When you Follow any Rotochatter user on Twitter, our system recognizes this via Twitter's API and you gain Bonus Access to their Current Week's Locked Picks (contest locks 1-2 hours prior to 1 PM Sunday Games).  This is HUGE for daily/weekly players for difficult last minute decisions. 

Win/Win For All Users
Not only does Rotochatter help the
average fantasy player seeking lineup advice but also gives the fantasy player
seeking to be a 'guru' the platform to prove themselves accurate.  Want to
start a fantasy blog or grow your Twitter following for fantasy purposes and
just need proof of your expertise?  Start here.

Does the Fantasy Community Agree?
2013 was our first year and was
driven to prove the concept and get our feet wet.  Our initial users loved
the site and what we offered.  We were so confident others would love it
too that we took our concept to the Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA) Conference
in Las Vegas in January and competed in their Elevator Pitch Competition. 
The competition featured 15 up and coming fantasy businesses and Rotochatter
Finished in 2nd place!  The concept has been validated.


How Can You Win $1,000,000?
One thing we learned from 2013 was
that our setup was difficult.  So much so that we have brought in the Industry Leader in Large Scale Contests, SCA Promotions (Yes, those Big Check Holding Guys for Basketball Half-court Shots), to offer any Rotochatter user who
gets 28/28 picks correct in any single week $1,000,000 cash.                           That's
it.  Nail the picks and you're a millionaire from using your
fantasy knowledge.  SCA Promotions has you covered!Who wouldn't want a shot at a million dollars for simply making fantasy football picks?  Sure the
chances are against you but no worries about beating out millions of other players in
some daily fantasy setup or putting up $1,000 for a chance.  Just you,
your brain and crossed fingers and 17 weeks to give it a go.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What Will We Do With the Funding?


Mobile App - For 2013 we built a desktop only
platform that was also mobile compatible which worked well however requires
some updates to meet all of our 2014 goals.  A fully functioning mobile
app will be necessary to reach all of the fantasy players we are targeting on all devices.  


Outreach - We need to get Rotochatter in front of every
pair of fantasy players' eyeballs and have them join in on the fun.  The
more users we have the greater the pool of great fantasy minds to interact
with.

Features - Our advanced stat features we have planned for 2014 will be a game changer for fantasy players.  Adding the 'social data' element of our contest to compare to the Experts picks will help you make better decisions.
Any Potential (Clint) Hurdles?
Because we do not currently have all
of the features w/i the Pledge levels active right now, we will require some
time to bring these together and get ready for the 2014 Football season once
our project is funded.  This is why we are starting this project now so early we are giving ourselves plenty of time to complete our 2014 version for you.
Seeing this is the first contest of
its kind and the fact that we are offering $1,000,000 for a perfect week of
picks, we are expecting a barrage of fantasy players to give it a try. While
this is our goal, the sheer amount of new users will certainly be a major
challenge for our team and we're ready for it.
We will be taking input from our
current users to create the ultimate user experience on all of our platforms
for 2014.

<p>There are two ways to describe what were are doing here, one is to use genres to describe it, other is to point at what analogies there are.</p>

<p>So it's soul is a lighthearted adventure, where you travel around the world, in a semi open fashion, entering different locations and trying to complete the kind and humorous story. You have many moves you can do, like jumping or dashing, you fight enemies and collect crazy things, and here starts the deep complex core. <a href=""https://discord.gg/CdV4Vnm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477969996/vpy4qbl5rrjivz1r7h6r.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>

<p>You will actually have a role playing experience. You will do quests, train new moves, find new equipment that can give you very unexpected abilities, spend money in shops and overall it will feel like a turn based JRPG became realtime with skill based combat. </p>

<p>Now comparing to beloved classics you can expect a game that is close in it's adventure mechanics to Zelda, Super Mario 64, you will travel the world map, in different regions like in Final Fantasy and other rpgs, you will fight crazy bosses, meet memorable characters , participate in crazy quests and dare i say it - Change the world! </p>
<p>As a game director i am deeply inspired not only by classics but by modern masterpieces too. You will find how strongly games like Fez, Journey, Little Big Planet affect the course of Redwood Tale, bringing more light and soul in this world.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">More info about our vision</h2>
<p>We will add many unique gameplay mechanics, unique to locations, to items, to characters.<br/>Remember Link's magnet boots? That sort of thing.<br/>We will make combat feel very good, expect Dark Souls level precision, but less punishing.<br/>Same goes for movement, it will feel extremely responsive and accurate, on par with Super Meat Boy. </p>
<p>We have a script ready for the whole story, it's our most valuable thing right now, that ties all ends together and we will keep it secret til the release :) You will meet a lot of unique characters and will visit many different places.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Where will the money go?!</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This is a complex question. I could write a meaningless chart with standard ""marketing/animation..."" you know all that. However this is how i see it :<br/>I am working on average 12 hours a day on this project, sometimes i have freelance jobs that can consume a good chunk of my time. This is insane. I'm doing everything - art, programming (all the tools/gameplay/core systems) managing the whole production, social media and writing this. Im leading to the point that first of all i need money to support myself and my family, which is fully involved in the process, and when savings run out and i don't get the fundings that will be it - back to day job, which will slow down the process insanely. However we won't stop there.<br/>If we get funded i will invest chunk of money into speeding up the process, hiring artists, animators, programmers if needed. It's not my first day in gamedev and i know how things roll, how to make a product with limited funds. Nonetheless there are friends i know that will join anyway, and it seems they will during this campaign. </p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> What you gonna do if you don't get funded?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>It's not like i have a choice, this is such an amazing project and such a big deal for me that backing off is not an option and won't be considered. The only direction is forward, period, through struggles, through ups and downs this game will live and it will be great.</p>

</div></div>","There are two ways to describe what were are doing here, one is to use genres to describe it, other is to point at what analogies there are.

So it's soul is a lighthearted adventure, where you travel around the world, in a semi open fashion, entering different locations and trying to complete the kind and humorous story. You have many moves you can do, like jumping or dashing, you fight enemies and collect crazy things, and here starts the deep complex core. 

You will actually have a role playing experience. You will do quests, train new moves, find new equipment that can give you very unexpected abilities, spend money in shops and overall it will feel like a turn based JRPG became realtime with skill based combat. 

Now comparing to beloved classics you can expect a game that is close in it's adventure mechanics to Zelda, Super Mario 64, you will travel the world map, in different regions like in Final Fantasy and other rpgs, you will fight crazy bosses, meet memorable characters , participate in crazy quests and dare i say it - Change the world! 
As a game director i am deeply inspired not only by classics but by modern masterpieces too. You will find how strongly games like Fez, Journey, Little Big Planet affect the course of Redwood Tale, bringing more light and soul in this world.


Main story in three acts with a lot of playtime
Side quests
You are free to revisit places around the world 
Meet characters and help them out
Character customization!

World map, open for you to go where you want




We are developing with gamepads and mouse in mind. 
Sophisticated combat with auto target locking
Mobility moves like dashing, roll, blink
Magic casting system that is super awesome - you charge your spells by making gestures with your mouse or thumbstick and then release it when needed (and your hair glows when spell is charged with the color of the magic school the spell belongs to)



Change your build as you go - spend experience points to unlock abilities that will change the way you play the game.
Warrior, Mage, Rogue, and other potential builds you can pursue.
Equipment can give you new abilities, or modify existing ones.

The features described above are all planned and are the core of the game, however how particularly we will implement is still a question mark and will be thought through extensively and tuned and changed as we go. This is how we work, we test features to see how they fit the game, because what's on paper rarely reflects reality. 


All in all this is a HUGE endeavor, especially for a small team. Nevertheless this is not my first project, and every detail was chosen with realistic expectations in mind.  
 
More info about our vision
We will add many unique gameplay mechanics, unique to locations, to items, to characters.Remember Link's magnet boots? That sort of thing.We will make combat feel very good, expect Dark Souls level precision, but less punishing.Same goes for movement, it will feel extremely responsive and accurate, on par with Super Meat Boy. 
We have a script ready for the whole story, it's our most valuable thing right now, that ties all ends together and we will keep it secret til the release :) You will meet a lot of unique characters and will visit many different places.
FAQ
 
Q: Where will the money go?!
A: This is a complex question. I could write a meaningless chart with standard ""marketing/animation..."" you know all that. However this is how i see it :I am working on average 12 hours a day on this project, sometimes i have freelance jobs that can consume a good chunk of my time. This is insane. I'm doing everything - art, programming (all the tools/gameplay/core systems) managing the whole production, social media and writing this. Im leading to the point that first of all i need money to support myself and my family, which is fully involved in the process, and when savings run out and i don't get the fundings that will be it - back to day job, which will slow down the process insanely. However we won't stop there.If we get funded i will invest chunk of money into speeding up the process, hiring artists, animators, programmers if needed. It's not my first day in gamedev and i know how things roll, how to make a product with limited funds. Nonetheless there are friends i know that will join anyway, and it seems they will during this campaign. 
Q: What you gonna do if you don't get funded?
A: It's not like i have a choice, this is such an amazing project and such a big deal for me that backing off is not an option and won't be considered. The only direction is forward, period, through struggles, through ups and downs this game will live and it will be great.
Perks!

<p>The Plot Thickens is a collaborative game where players create a tale that intertwines in ways no other storytelling game has done before!</p>
<p><strong>Whether you're looking for an energetic, easy-to-learn game to play with your family and friends, or you're a more serious gamer with a love for storytelling and RPGs, you've come to the right place. </strong>Even if you're not great at improv or storytelling, the collaborative nature of the game makes it easy to weave a fun and interesting story.</p>
<p><strong>Every game is unexpected!</strong> You'll create unusual, imaginative and wonderful tales with any group of storytellers you bring together - whether they be strangers or old friends.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476236482/g49njpiofj8inz3panvv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><br/><strong>You are a character in a Detective, Sci-Fi or Romance story (or any combination of the three!), and the plot is in your hands.</strong> You will craft an improvised narrative from a hand of 5 cards, each representing a person, place or thing in your story. The object of the game is to tell a creative tale and interconnect narratives as much as possible, using “plot points” that you will earn. At the end of the game, the player with the most plot points out gets to decide how the story ends, while the player with the most connections to their cards gets to name the story! You decide how long you'd like the game to be, by playing a quick game of 3 chapters or a longer more convoluted game of 6 or 7 chapters.</p>
<p><strong>In The Plot Thickens, players are rewarded for using other players' story cards and bringing their character together into an epic, or hilarious, tale. </strong>Everything you do is canon to the one story you're all building. Didn't name your character? Well, someone else can! Every game is a new and unexpected adventure.<br/> </p>

<p><br/><strong>One of the most fun features is the ability to mix editions! </strong>Want to tell the tale of an alien love triangle in a space station on the edges of the galaxy? Mix Romance and Sci-Fi! How about space mobsters from another dimension? Sci-Fi and Detective! What about lovestruck pickpockets on the run from a private eye? You guessed it - Detective and Romance!</p>
<p><strong>Whether you want a space opera, noir thriller, or cheesy romance novel, you can mix things up and let your imagination run wild!</strong></p>

<p><br/><strong><u>Choosing your Character</u></strong></p>
<p>Each player gets 3 Person cards at the beginning of the game. Choose 1 Person card to be your character for the game, and to tell the story from their perspective. Shuffle the unchosen cards back into the red deck.</p>
<p><u><strong>Story Cards</strong></u></p>
<p>Now that you have the character that you’ll be “playing”, you need words to build your story. Deal out 1 new Person card, 2 Place cards and 2 Thing cards to each player. This is separate from the Person card you chose to be your character. You should have a hand of 5 cards, and your character Person card down in front of you.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475718185/adm65amqnj7rsgsuaf3q.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><u><strong>Playing Story Cards</strong></u></p>
<p>You will use your hand of Person, Place and Thing cards to tell a story. You can use the words literally or figuratively, and you can use any number of the cards in your hand. Add as much flair and description as you’d like. Here is an example of how it works, and how you lay your cards out as you go:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476033807/xdpl51o6c9mjccefx3q0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In this example, we introduced the beginning of the story using cards in our hand, as well as revealed and named our character. Once you are out of cards or ideas, you say “meanwhile...” to pass the turn on to the next player, clockwise. As you tell your tale, place cards down as you say them, in the order they come up in the story. You can use as many or as few of your cards as you want, but you want to use as many as you can.</p>
<p>The second chapter works the exact same way, but you lay the next chapter just below your last chapter so everyone can still see your earlier chapter's words clearly to connect to later.</p>
<p><strong><u>Plot Points</u></strong><br/>For every story card played (not including your character), you get a plot point. In the example above, we played 4 cards, so we got 4 plot points. The plot points have other uses as well, but the main purpose of them is to Thicken The Plot.</p>
<p><strong><u>Thicken the Plot</u></strong><br/>Use other players' cards by incorporating that person, place or thing into your story. When you use a word, put one of your earned plot points on the white area of their card. You can only put one plot point per card, and you cannot put plot points on your own cards. In order to use another player’s word, you must reference the card in the specific context the player used it. For example, if a player put down “file” and explained it had evidence to a murder, in order to use that “file” card, you must be referencing the same file. You can connect to another player’s character card as well as the story cards they’ve used in their chapters.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476235014/zvtgwkxcntdscym8gwgr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/><strong><u>End of the Game</u></strong><br/>At the end of your final chapter, don't worry about wrapping up the story - that is the Main Character's job! After the last player's final chapter, each player counts their color plot points on other players' cards. Whoever has the most plot points on other people's cards is deemed the Main Character and gets to end the story however they want. Unused plot points don't count!</p>
<p>Whoever has the most plot points on their own cards from other players is deemed the Author, since they contributed elements that everyone wanted to connect to. They get to name the story whatever they like!</p>
<p>There are a few other rules, like ""Writer's Block"" and ""Edits"", you can <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/berzgpht28tw9ea/ThePlotThickens_Rules.pdf?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">download the full rules here.</a><br/> </p>

With Mike's direction we crafted what words were included in each edition.Mike's favorite thing about the Plot Thickens is seeing people react to the unusual tales that come from so many unexpected places.

<p>For starters my name is Steffan Harris I am an indie game developer born &amp; raised in  Virginia. I went to college at Westwood College of Technology in Denver Colorado studying Video Game Art &amp; Design. After leaving college I came back to Virginia until I met my now wife &amp; moved to Minnesota after working at Gamestop &amp; years of going to conventions &amp; being an avid gamer decided to use what I had learned in college to develop a game.</p>
<p>Upon talking with friends from X-Strike Studios I found the project I wanted to do &amp; thus we have SideQuest. It started off as a movie a parody of RPG's from the late 80's early 90's but never was finished. I read the script &amp; knew that this would make a great retro rpg.</p>
<p>This game is the best of all the rpg's from the 80's &amp; 90's. It has a huge array of party members to choose from; an epic storyline; monsters &amp; massive boss battles. Oh yeah and did I mention Summons. I am currently using the RPG Maker Xp &amp; Vx to build the game and plan to release it on PC through Steam &amp; on disk and am planning to release it on the Xbox 360 Arcade.</p>
<p>This is my first outing as a developer &amp; it can't fully be done without your help. I thought I could do it on my own but soon realized that is not going to happen. I need help from you the public. This is a labour of love &amp; a personal dream of mine.</p>
<h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p>For those just catching up to this Side Quest is a JRPG that parodies JRPGs from the 80's &amp; 90's it was written by our own X-Striker Juese &amp; just a touch rewritten by me. It follows Gale Winthrop (Stormwind..Hey things happen &amp; people sometimes have to visit a naming way) On Gales 16th birthday he is forced to take a stand against not only his father &amp; the Envirocorp his father works for to save the planet but save his friend Dreamer and help his friend Bob pick the pieces of his life back up. &amp; believe me not everything is as straight forward as it may seem in the world of Side Quest. <br/><br/>Now on to the technical aspects. The game will be released for the PC either through disk or through Steam also it is being released for the Xbox through the arcade so there will be options for you all the gamers. As far as perks go any donation amount will be getting thanks in the credits &amp; on the web page but larger donations can earn you a spopt in the game as either a vendor, a quest giver, summon or, special playable character. <br/><br/>The website for the project is Sidequestrpg.weebly.com<br/>And you can find us on the book of faces as well.

<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
<p>The funds for this game are going to various sources for one I need a machine powerful enough to do the build &amp; the art on. I have a machine lined up it  is 700. I am sourcing out music &amp; some art &amp; want to set aside an additional 500 for labour.  800 is for materials such as paints, pencils, sketchpads, lightbox &amp;, software such as RPG Maker VX Ace &amp;, Adobe Photoshop CS3. $99 is for the mebership fee to Microsoft to be able to release it on the Xbox Live Arcade Inidie section. The rest is for distribution, printing off maps, prints &amp; , authoring soundtracks.</p>
<p>Even if I don't get the full funding I still need to get a machine so I can get back to work on the game itself. The laptop I was working with died but the data is recoverable. &amp; those who do donate will have the game around two weeks after it's completion.</p>
<h3>In Finality</h3>
<p>First off I need to tell you this isn't a fund my life project I am still working a fulltime job and paying my own life bills  expenses. I am making this game as a labour of love &amp; using it as my stepping stone to get into the industry.</p>
<p>This project is something I have  put my heart &amp; dreams into. It's my first outing into the development world &amp; I want to comeplete this with all my being. Any help is appreciated so plese if you can't donate then tell your friends mention it at your local gaming shop whether it be video or table top get the word out &amp; help me with my dream. I have a great story that was written by great friends &amp; I want them to experience it with me.</p>
<p> </p></div>","Who am I & what is this about?
For starters my name is Steffan Harris I am an indie game developer born & raised in  Virginia. I went to college at Westwood College of Technology in Denver Colorado studying Video Game Art & Design. After leaving college I came back to Virginia until I met my now wife & moved to Minnesota after working at Gamestop & years of going to conventions & being an avid gamer decided to use what I had learned in college to develop a game.
Upon talking with friends from X-Strike Studios I found the project I wanted to do & thus we have SideQuest. It started off as a movie a parody of RPG's from the late 80's early 90's but never was finished. I read the script & knew that this would make a great retro rpg.
This game is the best of all the rpg's from the 80's & 90's. It has a huge array of party members to choose from; an epic storyline; monsters & massive boss battles. Oh yeah and did I mention Summons. I am currently using the RPG Maker Xp & Vx to build the game and plan to release it on PC through Steam & on disk and am planning to release it on the Xbox 360 Arcade.
This is my first outing as a developer & it can't fully be done without your help. I thought I could do it on my own but soon realized that is not going to happen. I need help from you the public. This is a labour of love & a personal dream of mine.

<h1><b>Back Then</b></h1>
<p>Remembering back to my adolescence, I used 
to love experimenting and creating. One of my early inventions was 
taking a clickable pencil, breaking off the head which would release the
 inner rod, cutting a slit in the eraser that's attached to the inner 
rod and then tying a rubber band between the eraser and the clip which 
would allow for an item to be loaded in to the barrel shell from which 
one could pull/release the inner rod to shoot the projectile out. To my 
surprise, it was quite accurate.</p>
<p>My friends would always want to 
borrow it and test their aim. We would set up targets and challenges. It
 was all quite fun and entertaining.</p>
<h1><b>Just Recently</b></h1>
<p>Well,
 contrary to what my friends may have you believe, I'm no longer a 
child. I'm 32, but who says I can't still enjoy the simple things in 
life and have a little fun? I recently read up on a few crowdfunding 
success stories and thought back to the device I used to make as a 
child. Remembering back to how much fun my friends and I enjoyed playing
 with it, maybe it's time to bring my idea to life for the world to 
enjoy<b>.</b></p>
<p><i>The grown-up</i> in me says I should make a pen that is practical, purposeful, comfortable and writes well.</p>
<p><i>My inner child</i> tells me to make it a gadget that can transform in to another device to shoot out spitwads and the like.</p>
<p><i>My business sense</i> tells me to combine the two functions to make for one awesome, and yet totally cool, device.</p>
<h1><b>Today</b></h1>
<p>I'm
 ready to move forward and am committed to making the best pen + spitwad
 launcher ever! The first and only one of its kind, I believe.</p>

<h1>So, I've Built An Initial Prototype</h1>
<p>The photos below depict my process for creating a spitwad launcher. Please keep in mind that this is merely to demonstrate the assembly and use of the device.<br/></p>

<h1>Manufacturing Process</h1>
<p>All designing, prototyping and packaging will be done out of our office in Virginia Beach, VA. The manufacturing and assembly will be handled at the location of the manufacturer (China).<br/><br/><b>Designing</b> - I will be leading the industrial design effort as I have a background in graphic design. I've created most all of the design works for my ad agency over the past 18 years. My 3D background experience is a little lacking, having only worked with 3D Studio Max and Cinema4D on hobbyist-type projects, but I plan on brushing up on my 3D design skills to develop the look and feel for the Wads device. I'm a fast learner and work diligently on my own. In researching online, I've found that Autodesk123D seems to be a popular 3D design platform for use with 3D printers. So, I plan to start there. We estimate this process to take 1 month.<br/><br/><b>Prototyping</b> - Once our 3D designs are complete, I'll begin creating prototypes using a 3D printer. I'm still researching which printer would best suit my needs as this product will require a very high layer resolution in order to output a smooth surface. I'm leaning towards MakerBot's Replicator 2x. Handling this process, in-house, will allow me to tweak the various design components of the device until everything is perfect (Lord knows I'm a perfectionist!). We estimate this process to take 1-2 months.<br/><br/><b>Manufacturing &amp; Assembly</b> - Once we have successfully created our fully functioning prototype, we will meet with our local outsourcing partner to demonstrate our product and deliver our final 3D files. They work with local companies that require outsourcing their product development needs. They have relationships with manufacturers in China and act as main point of contact throughout entire development process. This will help us out tremendously as we don't know a lick of Chinese. We've worked with them in the past and feel very comfortable with their capabilities. Based on initial conversations with this company, there's often a little back and forth with the manufacturer when developing the molds. Tweaking of specs and so forth. Given that, we estimate this entire process to take between 3-4 months.<br/><br/><b>Packaging</b> - All Wads products will be packaged by us, in Virginia Beach, VA. This will allow us to keep a close eye on quality to provide you with the best product possible.<br/><br/><b>We hope to be ready for orders by May 2014.</b><br/></p>
<h1><b>Future Plans (Interactive Game)</b></h1>
<p>Please
 note that all items listed below are ""Future Plans."" They will not be 
included in initial product launch. The good news is that you will not 
have to replace your device when we do release these new products.</p>
<p><b>Wadboard</b>
 - We plan on offering both a laser pointer accessory and a Wadboard 
(think dartboard). The laser pointer can be attached to the pen for 
aiding in accuracy. The Wadboard will be able to sync with a user's 
mobile device (phone/tablet). On the mobile device, the user can 
download our native app. This app, which communicates with the Wadboard,
 will allow the user to take part in challenges with other Wad users, 
track the distance of wads shot out of it, measure accuracy, community 
rankings, scores and more.</p>

<p><b>Wads</b> - We will offer a variety of additional wads including glow-in-the-dark wads, rocket wads, etc.</p>
<p><b>Pen wraps</b>
 - Cool design wraps, on an adhesive material, used to customize the 
look of the pen. We'll offer a gallery of different wraps, for purchase,
 on our website. In the future, we'll allow for users to create their 
own wraps, through our website, from which we will print and mail to 
customer.</p>

<h1>Who we are and the inspiration for Skipping Turtles? </h1>
<p>Kevin and Steve have been working on Skipping Turtles for close to a year now in one form or another. When Leap To Mobile was created late last year it was time to get serious about developing Skipping Turtles. <br/><br/>The inspiration for Skipping Turtles came while Kevin was fishing in OK. He thought why not create a mobile game starring a turtle as the hero who saves the day from a much larger foe. Kevin has lived in Australia and want to begin begin Skippy's adventure in the beautiful country of Australia. </p>

We hope to raise more than our goal so we can create additional levels, work on the back story of Skippy and introduce new characters. We will be creating hidden levels within the game, additional shells that can be utilized on certain levels and enemies. <strong>We also have some exciting stretch goals if we reach our initial goal before campaign ends.</strong></p>

When Leap To Mobile was created late last year it was time to get serious about developing Skipping Turtles. The inspiration for Skipping Turtles came while Kevin was fishing in OK. He thought why not create a mobile game starring a turtle as the hero who saves the day from a much larger foe. Kevin has lived in Australia and want to begin begin Skippy's adventure in the beautiful country of Australia.

What Will indiegogo Funds Be Used For? 
We have started the design and development process for Skipping Turtles. We have chosen to utilize indiegogo to assist us in raising the additional funds needed to fully design and develop Skipping Turtles for OUYA, iOS, and Android. We hope to raise more than our goal so we can create additional levels, work on the back story of Skippy and introduce new characters. We will be creating hidden levels within the game, additional shells that can be utilized on certain levels and enemies. We also have some exciting stretch goals if we reach our initial goal before campaign ends.
We sincerely appreciate everyone's support and could not do this without your help.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to the fundraiser for our God of War focused fan film, Ashes! This page is dedicated to raising funds and interest for a very exciting project a very talented group of people will be putting together.</p>
<p>Please note; we are actually aiming for about £250-£300 worth of funding but IndieGoGo's minimum is £500!</p>
<p>This cosplay showcase will focus on the relationship between Kratos and his son Atreus, and we want to convey their growing relationship through the video that does the game's beautiful theme and moods justice. Not only are we aiming for a roughly 4 minute video, but also a gorgeous set of prints available both physically and digitally for our backers. Each different tier offers different, exciting rewards that we can keep adding to if this fund raiser goes well!</p>
<p>Meet the cast and crew; </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are all dedicated fans and artists in the forms of cosplayer, videography and photography. All of us are incredibly fond of the game and would love to convey how much it impacted us as creatives through this project to thank Santa Monica for such an incredible experience.

<p>Super Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Dojo Storm: Championship Edition
celebrates the grand inside joke of being a jiu-jiteiro with a tongue-in-cheek
exploration of the weird and wonderful side of jiu-jitsu culture. Instead of
trying to replicate the experience of training, Dojo Storm uses RPG-style
mechanics to thrust players into a world where everyone takes training as
seriously as we do—from our unhealthy acai obsessions to our hate for all
things board-breaking.</p>
<p>Play as Tim, an aspiring world champion, as you travel from
a rural town to the big city of Bitsburgh to compete in the Polaris Team Invitiational, recruiting a zany team of
martial artists to compete at your side along the way. You soon discover,
however, that an outbreak of the McDojo virus threatens to infect jiu-jitsu,
raising the stakes from winning a gold medal to saving the sanctity of
jiu-jitsu as we know it. The future of the art rests on the shoulders of you
and your hodge-podge team of fighters. Can you master the art of fighting and
coaching in-time to save jiu-jitsu?</p>

<p>Dojo Storm takes artistic and gameplay queues from retro
roleplaying games. The world is built with an 8-bit inspired aesthetic, and
combat is turn-based. As you travel from town to town, making your way toward the
center of Bitsburgh for the Universe Championships, you take on challenge
matches and recruit roaming fighters to join your team. With over 50 characters
and upwards of 300 unique abilities, the make-up of your team and their
fighting styles are uniquely your own. If you loved handheld RPGs in the 90s
and early 2000s, the gameplay of Dojo Storm will feel heartwarmingly familiar.</p>

<p>Styles make fights. The key to success in Dojo Storm is
building a well-rounded team of fighters. While each fighter has his or her own
unique characteristics and abilities, every fighter in the world of Dojo Storm
comes from one of five fighting backgrounds:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Grapplers want to

<p>Dojo Storm features RPG-style turn-based combat. Though you
compete as a team, your fights are character to character, making your strategy
a mix between matching styles and knowing when to pull a fighter out of combat
in favor of a new one. A match is won by forcing every fighter on the opposing
to team tap out, but winning a fight is about much more than depleting hit points
and picking the right style for the fight.</p>
<p>As characters level-up, they learn new moves, and different
moves can change the tide of the fight in different ways. Picking the right
moves for your fighter’s gameplan is critical, and using those moves to maximize
your strengths while exploiting weaknesses will give you the edge in a close
fight. In addition to dealing damage, fighters in Dojo Storm can use moves
that:</p>
<p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Stun: Paralyzes the fighter temporarily, making
him unable to attack.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Wound: Causes the fighter to bleed each round,
losing hit points much in the same way the poison status effect is used in
other games.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Disorient: Confuses the fighter, causing him to
sometimes attack himself or miss with his attack completely.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Blind: Kickboxer-movie-style blink mode, making
the fighter woefully inaccurate.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Cripple: Slows the fighter down by inflicting a
brutal and painful injury.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To survive Dojo Storm, you have to fight smart. Training
dynamic fighters and using their abilities strategically will be essential to
your dream of becoming a jiu-jitsu champion and saving jiu-jitsu from the McDojo virus.</p>

<p>With over 50 potential fighters to recruit to your team,
there is no shortage of variety, but many fighters are not freely roaming the
world waiting for the opportunity to join your quest. Instead, they need to be
trained and unlocked. In Dojo Storm, most fighters will transform into new
versions of themselves if they can get enough experience in combat. We call
this ranking up, and you never can be sure how a fighter will change in the
course of their career.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432686518/rwub1w3b4xgpufpxfnhc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Because Dojo Storm was inspired by classic handheld RPGs, we
are optimizing the game experience for mobile devices—iOS and Android. In our
mind, this will be the perfect way to pass the time as you wait for your match
to be called or while you’re stuck at work dreaming of jiu-jitsu. At the same
time, we want as many people as possible to experience the game, so we also
have plans to make Dojo Storm available for PC, provided that we have the capital
to do so.</p>

<p>In recent months, a slew of failed crowdfunding campaigns
with grand promises and waves of hype behind them have fallen apart, leaving
backers without their rewards or the games that they so desperately wanted to
play. We are sensitive to these realities, and want to address the risks of
this campaign head-on with clear and detailed explanations of how we are
mitigating them.</p>
<p><b>Reliability</b>:
Artechoke ran a crowdfunding campaign in February of 2014 to fund our first
cloud instructional, Mastering the Crucifix. Our goal was $4000 and we raised
$5711. We delivered the product and the rewards as promised. Marshal and Matt
are active members of the jiu-jitsu community and have always kept their
promises. This project will not be any different.</p>
<p><b>Financial:</b>
The biggest fear in crowdfunding is that the project will fade into the ether
and take your money with it. We are committed to completing this game
regardless of the performance of the crowdfunding campaign. We have already
invested significant personal time and money into it, and we are prepared to
get the game released no matter what (but platform support may be limited).</p>
<p>Another point of comfort: many video games that pursue crowdfunding incorporate employee salaries into their estimates, increasing the scope of their initial goals into the six figures and beyond. Where even small games request that backers contribute $100,000, we are only asking for $3400. Any money we raise beyond that will be invested into improving the game, not our standard of living.</p>
<p><b>Scope: </b>Many
crowdfunded games fall into the trap of being overly ambitious. We have
deliberately limited our gameplay mechanics, world-size, and art style to
insulate ourselves from scope creep. Unlike some campaigns that feature
mock-ups of GUIs only, Dojo Storm is currently playable with major mechanics
implemented and the majority of the game art completed, so we know with certainty that we can deliver on our promises. We are not asking for your help to start development; we are asking for your help to <i>complete</i> development, which in our minds are two very different goals, and we hope you agree.</p>
<p><b>Delivery
Date: </b>Though we are planning for an Oct. 2015 release, unforeseen obstacles
could lead to delivery delays. Of all of the risks, this is one that we are
willing to compromise on. We would rather take the time to release a polished
product, and we hope that the Artechoke track record quells any worry.</p>
<p><b>Enjoyment:
</b>We think that Dojo Storm is hilarious, but there is of course a risk that
you will not agree. If you liked Don’t Wear Your Gi to the Bar or The
Cauliflower Chronicles, you will almost certainly love your romp through this
retro-inspired world, but we can’t promise that you have the quality of tastes that we
do.</p>

Super Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Dojo Storm: Championship Edition
celebrates the grand inside joke of being a jiu-jiteiro with a tongue-in-cheek
exploration of the weird and wonderful side of jiu-jitsu culture. Instead of
trying to replicate the experience of training, Dojo Storm uses RPG-style
mechanics to thrust players into a world where everyone takes training as
seriously as we do—from our unhealthy acai obsessions to our hate for all
things board-breaking.
Play as Tim, an aspiring world champion, as you travel from
a rural town to the big city of Bitsburgh to compete in the Polaris Team Invitiational, recruiting a zany team of
martial artists to compete at your side along the way. You soon discover,
however, that an outbreak of the McDojo virus threatens to infect jiu-jitsu,
raising the stakes from winning a gold medal to saving the sanctity of
jiu-jitsu as we know it. The future of the art rests on the shoulders of you
and your hodge-podge team of fighters. Can you master the art of fighting and
coaching in-time to save jiu-jitsu?





Projected
Release Date: September 2015


Platforms:
iOS, Android, PC 


Game
Style: Retro handheld RPG


Estimated Gameplay: 15 to 20 hours

Crowdfunding
Needs: Hardware and software necessary for a full, multi-platform release.


Stretch Goals: Additional game content and multiplayer support.



Dojo Storm takes artistic and gameplay queues from retro
roleplaying games. The world is built with an 8-bit inspired aesthetic, and
combat is turn-based. As you travel from town to town, making your way toward the
center of Bitsburgh for the Universe Championships, you take on challenge
matches and recruit roaming fighters to join your team. With over 50 characters
and upwards of 300 unique abilities, the make-up of your team and their
fighting styles are uniquely your own. If you loved handheld RPGs in the 90s
and early 2000s, the gameplay of Dojo Storm will feel heartwarmingly familiar.

   


In Dojo Storm, you venture from a small rural town to a rich
and vibrant city, with each neighborhood and route featuring a unique
environmental personality, making world exploration just as rewarding as
conquering your enemies. This world loosely parodies the real-life landmarks of
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, breathing an additional layer of life and vibrancy
into the gameplay for anyone that has visited the city. Even if you have never
been to Pittsburgh, the detailed artwork and colorful NPCs will suck you into
this digital martial arts playground.
   




Styles make fights. The key to success in Dojo Storm is
building a well-rounded team of fighters. While each fighter has his or her own
unique characteristics and abilities, every fighter in the world of Dojo Storm
comes from one of five fighting backgrounds:


Grapplers want to
close the distance and take the fight to the ground but are weak against fighters
that use weapons or unconventional attacks.


Strikers are fast and mobile but are
not equipped to defend takedowns or weapon attacks.


Brawlers fight with their hearts but
struggle to cope with more technical fighters.


Spirit types are unpredictable wild
cards in the fighting world but crumble when facing off against styles that
like to strike.


Weapon users are ready to put down
fighters with more technical styles but are weak to fighters that are just as
willing to go off the deep-end as they are.



   
Dojo Storm features RPG-style turn-based combat. Though you
compete as a team, your fights are character to character, making your strategy
a mix between matching styles and knowing when to pull a fighter out of combat
in favor of a new one. A match is won by forcing every fighter on the opposing
to team tap out, but winning a fight is about much more than depleting hit points
and picking the right style for the fight.
As characters level-up, they learn new moves, and different
moves can change the tide of the fight in different ways. Picking the right
moves for your fighter’s gameplan is critical, and using those moves to maximize
your strengths while exploiting weaknesses will give you the edge in a close
fight. In addition to dealing damage, fighters in Dojo Storm can use moves
that:


Stun: Paralyzes the fighter temporarily, making
him unable to attack.


Wound: Causes the fighter to bleed each round,
losing hit points much in the same way the poison status effect is used in
other games.


Disorient: Confuses the fighter, causing him to
sometimes attack himself or miss with his attack completely.


Blind: Kickboxer-movie-style blink mode, making
the fighter woefully inaccurate.


Cripple: Slows the fighter down by inflicting a
brutal and painful injury.


To survive Dojo Storm, you have to fight smart. Training
dynamic fighters and using their abilities strategically will be essential to
your dream of becoming a jiu-jitsu champion and saving jiu-jitsu from the McDojo virus.

With over 50 potential fighters to recruit to your team,
there is no shortage of variety, but many fighters are not freely roaming the
world waiting for the opportunity to join your quest. Instead, they need to be
trained and unlocked. In Dojo Storm, most fighters will transform into new
versions of themselves if they can get enough experience in combat. We call
this ranking up, and you never can be sure how a fighter will change in the
course of their career.

Because Dojo Storm was inspired by classic handheld RPGs, we
are optimizing the game experience for mobile devices—iOS and Android. In our
mind, this will be the perfect way to pass the time as you wait for your match
to be called or while you’re stuck at work dreaming of jiu-jitsu. At the same
time, we want as many people as possible to experience the game, so we also
have plans to make Dojo Storm available for PC, provided that we have the capital
to do so.

Dojo Storm is the result of a collaboration between Artechoke
Media and Synersteel Studios and a partnership with Polaris and Scramble. We partnered with Polaris and Scramble because they are just as passionate about supporting the grassroots of jiu-jitsu as we are. Supporting Polaris and Scramble goes a long way toward supporting the future of our sport. We are incredibly grateful to be working with them.
Polaris is Europe’s
premier submission grappling and jiu-jitsu invitational, hosting unique,
high-quality events to drive interest and support for competitive jiu-jitsu and
the many talented men and women growing the art.
Scramble is here to
rescue jiu-jitsu from the downward spiral of poorly designed and shoddily
manufactured training and casual gear. Scramble’s spirit of innovation has made
it one of the top jiu-jitsu brands in the world.Mechanical Advantage Digital Records is run by a jiu-jitsu purple belt and produces bleeding edge music in the electronic genre. They produced all of the music in Dojo Storm.

in a meaningful way and to think creatively about how we can grow and
strengthen jiu-jitsu. That thinking spawned our unique media-rich cloud
instructionals, and it took us down the rabbit hole of creating Dojo Storm, the
first-ever jiu-jitsu video game.

For this project, Artechoke has formed a 50/50 partnership
with Synersteel Studios, an independent video game development start-up based
in Philadelphia. Lead by two brothers, Nick and Anthony Vaccaro, Synersteel is

people together, and like Artechoke, Synersteel is devoted to meaningful experiences
rather than chasing the latest fad for the sake profit.
Upon completion of Dojo Storm, Synersteel Studios plans to

engagement, and publicity while also pursuing internal development projects. In
the interest of full disclosure, Marshal—an Artechoke co-owner—is now an
advisor and contributor to Synersteel. He joined the team after being impressed
with their work ethic and performance.

We are turning to crowdfunding for three reasons:


To accelerate the development process for Dojo Storm by
securing the software and hardware that we need for a full release.


To ensure that all users—iOS, Android, and PC—get access

To invite other members of the community, like fighters

In addition to the maps and detailed explanations of how to perfect your team, you can look behind the scenes at the making of Dojo Storm to learn more about the work that went into designing the Dojo Storm experience.
In-Game Character Placement
As a kid, you may have dreamed about entering the worlds of your favorite video games, becoming one of the characters that shapes the plot and the history of fictional playgrounds. Now you can live that dream. With your direction and source material, we will transform you into a Dojo Storm character, complete with a custom appearance and custom attacks. As a character in the world, every person that plays Dojo Storm will have the chance to add you to their team of fighters.
*We reserve the right to decline your participation if we believe there is not a good fit. If this happens, you will receive a full refund.
Business Sponsorship
We believe in supporting the jiu-jitsu community and are always looking to collaborate with businesses as passionate about the community as we are. This is what lead to our working with Polaris and Scramble, and we would love to use Dojo Storm as a platform for supporting your business. We will feature your business on the Dojo Storm website. Your logo will appear on the splash screen. Your business will appear on in-game billboards. And if it is relevant, an in-game item will be tied to your business. For example, if you sell supplements, players could buy them in the game.
*We reserve the right to decline your participation if we believe there is not a good fit or if your business conflicts with an existing sponsor. If this happens, you will receive a full refund. If you have any questions, please contact us directly.
Gym Side Quest Package
This is the ultimate tribute to your gym. Capture the unique personality of your gym and your instructor with a gym-themed Dojo Storm side quest. Players will be able to meet and recruit your instructor and three other custom characters to join their teams all while exploring a dedicated, customized game area. This perk is a one-of-a-kind opportunity to connect your gym to jiu-jitsu history. Use this perk to say thank you to your instructor or as a marketing tool to separate your gym from every other jiu-jitsu gym in the area.
*We reserve the right to decline your participation if we believe there is not a good fit or if your business conflicts with an existing interest. If this happens, you will receive a full refund. If you have any questions, please contact us directly.


Our minimum goal is so low, relative to the $500,000 and up goals that are usual for video game projects, because we have already invested significant personal time and resources to make this game a reality. Rather than use crowdfunding to fund our salaries, we are using funds to cover basic development expenses. Our stretch goals are simple, and they are designed with the same philosophy.


$4000 - Classic Green Mode
$6000 - 80s Action Movie Side Quest 
$8000 - Multiplayer Support
$10000 - Special Edition DLC


Classic Gameboy Green Mode: Get the true retro mobile gaming experience with this classic mode. You won't need a portable light kit and a backpack full of AA batteries to play the game, but it will feel like the old days.

80s Action Movie Side Quest: Take some time away from training for Polaris to take on an adventure inspired by your favorite classic action films. Explore all-new areas and recruit all-new fighters to your team along the way.

Multiplayer Support: Take your team beyond the Polaris Team Invitational and challenge your training partners to team vs. team matches. This is a great way to pass the time before class or to game-away a long tournament day.

Special Edition DLC: We will expand the Dojo Storm universe with more playable areas and recruitable characters. For this perk, we are setting aside $1000 to use as sponsorship money for a talented jiu-jiteiro. The DLC would be themed after this fighter, using their fighting style and personality as inspiration.



In recent months, a slew of failed crowdfunding campaigns
with grand promises and waves of hype behind them have fallen apart, leaving
backers without their rewards or the games that they so desperately wanted to
play. We are sensitive to these realities, and want to address the risks of
this campaign head-on with clear and detailed explanations of how we are
mitigating them.
Reliability:
Artechoke ran a crowdfunding campaign in February of 2014 to fund our first
cloud instructional, Mastering the Crucifix. Our goal was $4000 and we raised
$5711. We delivered the product and the rewards as promised. Marshal and Matt
are active members of the jiu-jitsu community and have always kept their
promises. This project will not be any different.
Financial:
The biggest fear in crowdfunding is that the project will fade into the ether
and take your money with it. We are committed to completing this game
regardless of the performance of the crowdfunding campaign. We have already
invested significant personal time and money into it, and we are prepared to
get the game released no matter what (but platform support may be limited).
Another point of comfort: many video games that pursue crowdfunding incorporate employee salaries into their estimates, increasing the scope of their initial goals into the six figures and beyond. Where even small games request that backers contribute $100,000, we are only asking for $3400. Any money we raise beyond that will be invested into improving the game, not our standard of living.
Scope: Many
crowdfunded games fall into the trap of being overly ambitious. We have
deliberately limited our gameplay mechanics, world-size, and art style to
insulate ourselves from scope creep. Unlike some campaigns that feature
mock-ups of GUIs only, Dojo Storm is currently playable with major mechanics
implemented and the majority of the game art completed, so we know with certainty that we can deliver on our promises. We are not asking for your help to start development; we are asking for your help to complete development, which in our minds are two very different goals, and we hope you agree.
Delivery
Date: Though we are planning for an Oct. 2015 release, unforeseen obstacles
could lead to delivery delays. Of all of the risks, this is one that we are
willing to compromise on. We would rather take the time to release a polished
product, and we hope that the Artechoke track record quells any worry.
Enjoyment:
We think that Dojo Storm is hilarious, but there is of course a risk that
you will not agree. If you liked Don’t Wear Your Gi to the Bar or The
Cauliflower Chronicles, you will almost certainly love your romp through this
retro-inspired world, but we can’t promise that you have the quality of tastes that we
do.",33.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><em><strong>""So why pledge? It sounds like Final Rush is pretty much done.""</strong> - Some guy</em></p>
<p>Final Rush is almost done; but we're looking to improve the bad parts and expand the good parts of the game. Most big studios spend more in one day than the entire budget of Final Rush. We want to continue imrpoving the game while we wait to get it up on Steam's Greenlight, and get the game out to gamers.</p>
<p>The initial goal of the Indiegogo is to get enough funds to overhaul and improve the gameplay experience in a few areas.</p>
<p>These areas are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Gameplay tweaks.</strong> We want to do a collection of smaller tweaks to improve the feel of the game, and make it much more enjoyable and immersive; tweaking things like weapon reloads and melee attacks, to how the robot AI behaves.</p>
<p><strong>A massively improved main menu.</strong> The current main menu is one of the oldest elements of Final Rush, and is outdated and ineffective. We want to give you a friendly, common-sense, easy to use, mouse friendly main menu, which allows you to easily interact and setup games with your friends.</p>
<p><strong>Improved ingame instruction.</strong> Startup Final Rush, launch a game, and it might be a little bit confusing for first time players. We want to implement a system that guides first time players, and gets out of the way completely once you don't need it any more. There are all kinds of great tips, like sprinting while you reload your shotgun, or moving explosive barrels to better positions, which simply aren't obvious, especially to first time players, but really help make the game more fun.</p>
<p>In short, the goals are to take Final Rush from a game that's fun to play, to a game that's really fun to play, and easy to get into.</p>
<p>And that's not even touching the possibility of stretch goals, should we (hopefully) get that far.</p>
<p><em>[Note: Final Rush is currently only supported on the PC. While Mac support is on the agenda, it's not something that we can commit to until we get a little further along.

<p><em><strong>""So what is Final Rush supposed to be? What is it really?"" </strong>- Some Guy</em></p>
<p>Final Rush is a first person, action/sci-fi shooter being made by Strike Games, and has been in development for over two and a half years. As you can see from the trailer, it's nearly complete.</p>
<p>The goal of Final Rush is to provide players with a fun and highly replayable game, which can be played alone, or cooperatively with their friends (current game modes support up to 3). Eventually, we would like to support a variety of game modes, level themes, and options.</p>
<p>For now, the game has one game mode: Rush. The rush game mode dynamically adjusts the difficulty and rewards depending on the performance of the players. The more you play, the more rewards you get, but the harder enemies become. Rewards vary from special weapon and grenade enhancements, to the powerful, room clearing high powered ammunition.</p>
<p>Final Rush is also what we call a <strong>'continual development project'</strong>, which means that we're going to <strong>keep working on it</strong>, long after the game is released, and for as long as there is community interest in the game. What this means for you is a game that keeps getting bigger and better! We're going to keep giving you<strong> free content additions</strong> for the game which expand and improve every aspect of the game.</p>
<p>We want to make a game that has the content and quality of a AAA game; it might take us a while to get there, but we'll keep working on it.</p>
<p>Final Rush is built with advanced technology; starting on the Unreal Developer Kit, Final Rush eventually transitioned to a full licensed version of the Unreal® 3 Engine; the same game engine that brought you Borderlands, Mass Effect and BioShock. Moving forward, we'll be able to leverage the full power of the Unreal Engine to bring you a spectacular experience.</p>

<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.strikegames.net/indiegogo/IngameRewards.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Ingame Rewards""/></h3>
<p><em><strong>""What is all this about ingame rewards, why not real life loot?"" </strong>- Some Guy</em></p>
<p>To be honest, there are two reasons all of our rewards (except for the super big ones) are ingame content.</p>
<p>The first reason is, Final Rush doesn't have much of a community yet. Posters, T-Shirts, and Mouse Pads are coo; but we think that giving players special, very limited edition -ingame- content would be better. If you like a game enough to give us support, then you should have actual game related content to play with; rather than a poster you might not like, a T-Shirt that isn't your style, or a mousepad that isn't as good as the one you have now.</p>
<p>The second reason is; we're lazy bastards. We'd rather spend more time working on the game and making it better than spending time, effort, and money sending you loot.</p>
<p>Leave us a comment if you want to have real word loot; like the content in the game, we're open to community input.</p>
<h3><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.strikegames.net/indiegogo/TheFuture.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""The Future""/></h3>
<p>The future of Final Rush is as bright as the community interest in the game. If people like the game, then we'll continue to grow and improve the game for years to come. Whatever the case may be, the response will be equal to the interest. Less interest from the community means less work on Final Rush; but more community response (including a small but intense community) will mean big things for Final Rush.</p>
<p>What kind of things can you expect? More refined gameplay, more efficient graphics and code, allowing better graphics. More weapons, more levels, more enemies, and more game modes. Even a fully-fledged episodic (but integrated into one game) single player story is on the table.</p>
<p>If you don't want to pledge, or don't like what the game offers, that's fine - but check back in a few months and see what you think of the game.</p>

narrative, both seen through the prism of surreal artwork and 
atmospheric music.Tulpa is a puzzle-platformer game, in which the player controls two characters, a girl named Ophelia and a boy named Oliver, that travel through an ever-changing world. 
The characters possess different abilities and perceive the world differently. This makes the survival of both characters non-trivial, as traversing the world and overcoming its challenges demands that the player has both perspectives in mind.Story-wise the game revolves around concepts borrowed from occultism and theosophy, with thought forms (or “Tulpae”) on the focal point. Characters hide twisted secrets and the world transforms to pair with their psychology. Symbolism is also used along those lines with both game objects and -literal- symbols (we call them “Glyphs”), filling the world, giving information to the player about the story as well as about the challenge he is facing. With all these in-place, it comes down to the player to find out the grim past of our (anti-?)heroine and her tulpa.Basic ControlsThe game’s controls regarding character movement follow the well-known and established control patterns of the platformer genre. Player uses the arrow keys for moving Ophelia to the left or to the right and space for jumping and climbing. When you switch over to Oliver, the arrow keys are used to set him in motion in both the horizontal and vertical axes, floating near his beloved Ophelia. Character AbilitiesOphelia doesn’t have any special ability. Her role is interacting with the material world by means of pushing and grabbing stuff around. Oliver’s ability on the other hand is the interaction with otherworldly objects using a telekinetic power, directed by the player using his mouse.SanityOliver is Ophelia’s tulpa. He was created by her own mind in need for support.That cause has an effect. Ophelia needs Oliver to be close, otherwise she begins to lose her sanity, ensuing an inevitable death.The aesthetics are focused on flat colored models and fine tuned full-screen effects for the generation of minimalistic but intense and smooth-looking scenes. The graphical concepts are heavily inspired by the works of Salvador Dali, Jacek Yerka as well as other known (and unknown) artists. On the gaming side, great influences were Yume Nikki, Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet, American McGee's Alice and Limbo. Finally, the Glyphs being a major characteristic of the game aesthetics, follow a sketched/scribbled style adding obscurity on the -already twisted- matters presented.Tulpa is dark, it's eerie. The same goes for Red Aura’s music. We knew it from the very first hearing, Red Aura was the missing puzzle piece of this game. We share very much the same theme and mood. Paradoxical! Red Aura’s experimental and dark ambient elements make Tulpa shine… darker.As for the sound effects, if we manage to reach our goal, Luke Thomas is going to work on it to give the game that final touch it needs to feel smooth and complete.From development perspective, a huge amount of work is already done for Tulpa. So you may ask why we need your help? For our game to be released we need to optimize both some pieces of code and part of the assets (mostly audio). Apparently that needs tools we can’t afford while we are still students (with no full-time jobs).That means that we need two Unity Pro licenses, sound effects and to get our musician a new laptop, since her last one doesn't work. So if you like the game and want to play it you can help us by contributing any amount you want towards our goal.Potential risks
Only one potential risk exists: it is kind of macabre and involves one or more members of the team. So Tulpa will definitely be released sooner or later.However, since polishing may take several months to complete, in the meantime we will keep you up-to-date with the latest development news and (why not) invite you over to beta-test the hell out of our game (assuming you agree to be heavily spoiled story-wise).On the right side of this page you will find the levels of funding you can contribute.

Tinyplanet, a series of educational games to teach kids colors, shapes, numbers, letters and more through fun puzzle games. IN GREEK!

Update1: You can play 3 demo games
  
 


What is Tinyplanet?


There are many educational games that are made for preschoolers. Games that can be played on an internet browser, games that you can buy or download to your PC, apps for iphone, Android, etc. But when we searched for such games in languages other than English, particularly in Greek, we could not find many. In the past, Greek was one of the major languages of the world. That is why we started making a series of games in our own language, Greek. One of the reasons we put the Tinyplanet project in Indiegogo is that it can be extended to other languages if there is interest from supporters.
 


Why Tinyplanet?


As parents of toddlers, we quickly realized that the children already know how to use the mouse and the computer even before we show them how. The major deficiencies of the games we found as a result of our search are related to language and the teaching methods used (if used at all). Few applications are written for children who speak Greek, either as mother language, or as a foreign language. Also most games are designed to keep children busy and distract them like a babysitter. In fact, apart from using the computer, the application may use many teaching tools that will make the child develop interest in learning, for example colors, shapes, letters, numbers etc. So we decided to create this series of games through which children can learn by playing games based on a choice of exciting topics.
  


The Games


Tinyplanet is a series of games designed to help toddlers come in contact with basic knowledge of preschoolers. We use a nearly consistent set of games for each subject so the child is focused on understanding the topic and not the way the game is played. The groups of games that we are preparing or have built are:

card Game - The topic is presented in a series of cards. The child has to choose the right topic every time,
the Memory Game - A favorite for many children, The Memory Game helps reinforce the topics, while also developing a child's memory,
matching - This is an extension of The Memory Game except that instead of having all the cards hidden and matching identical cards, the children will match related cards. For example matching the color red with a red car,
puzzle - This game allows children to put together puzzles related to the topics provided,
complete the Pattern - This game challenges children to complete a pattern of cards from a set of available cards.
Many more games could be added after hearing your suggestions.
 


The Topics


Each topic will be presented from a game series like the one we described above. The topics currently planned are:

colors,
shapes,
numbers,
letters,
animals.
Many more games could be added after hearing your suggestions.
 


Current Progress


We currently have built a ""game machine"" for the card games and the memory games. Games ""Complete the Pattern"" and ""Matching"" are under development and will soon be ready for testing. The graphics of the game are originals and designed exclusively for the Tinyplanet series. We have already made some graphics for cards that can be used for several of the topics.
 


Getting to a Live Product


Our plan is that the final product will consist of a series of games designed in Flash. Everyone will be able play them for free at Tinyplanet.gr. In order to release tinyplanet we have to:

finish the two types of games that have not been finished,
build the puzzle game,
design graphics for most of the topics,
enrich the graphics that have been made to test the ""game engine"",
record sound (voice) for the games,
find music that fits with the concept of the game,
build the site Tinyplanet.gr to present games.
With the necessary funding we plan to publish the site with the first games in Μarch 2013.
 


Expansion ideas


Tinyplanet is a series of games. Some of them could be transferred to iphone, ipad or android. With additional funding we could translate Tinyplanet in other languages that lack preschool games. To implement such an expansion we need help from friends who speak these languages and can provide us with the corresponding material (voice and text).

That's the tiny Italian soul in you! Why not listen to it some more and support the Italian quidditch National Team, then?</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Quidditch in Italy</b></p><p>We represent a nation that, despite its still not incredible density in terms of teams and players, is doing its best to be one of the leading forces in European quidditch. With the only team coming from a country that wasn't the hosting one for the first edition of European regionals, we always looked for internationality, and the Global Games are for us a chance to show that us not being there from as early as other countries is not stopping us from having a steady growth, and that we deserve any attention we can get on the international stage.</p><p>The first italian team registered with the IQA was Milano Meneghins Quidditch in 2012, and we are now up to 5 official teams with Lunatica Quidditch Club from Brindisi being the team that reached the 4th place during the most recent European regional championship, despite having only 8 players in their roster. We have come a long way and we still have an even longer way to go, and we want to show you what we've accomplished so far and how Italian quidditch is developing its own distinctive traits.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>The national team</b></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/607563/files/20140527120937-divisa_naz.png?1401217777"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>The Azzurri side (from ""azzurro"", light blue, the color that italian sides of all sports usually wear) was announced in Italy a few months ago, composed of players from the most active groups, and a minority from newly founded, or yet to be founded, teams. There has been a first practice in the north in March and one in the south in April, with two more scheduled before Global Games.<br/>The roster is surprisingly diverse, considering the relatively small pool of national players, and you will soon have a chance to meet them on this campaign, and with an article in English that is being edited as I write this.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Here is why you should help us!</b></p><p>Helping us get to Global Games, not only you make sure that we can bring some more people than the current group that would be able to travel to Canada - right now a rather limited bunch of players - but you would also make sure that we can bring that experience back, increasing the level in our league, and in Europe, and subsequently anywhere else we get a chance to play. At the same time you will be able to experience different ways to look at the sport you love so much, and to make valuable friends in a country different from yours. Do I need to mention (again) we almost undisputedly have the best food, and wines, and art, and history, etc., and that you are welcome to visit us any time?</p><p><br/></p><p><b>What you get</b></p><p>First, you get us! And we are adorable. Don't misunderstand, we're here to kick some ass or give it our best shot at least, but we strongly believe in the community aspect of quidditch, and you'll love having us at Global Games to hang out with, even those of us that are not so skilled in English.<br/>Also, our perks, to be released soon, will be that touch of Italian class you were missing from your quidditch collection!</p><p><br/></p><p><b>Where does your money go?</b></p><p>That's easily said: we estimate that to bring the entire team to Canada would cost easily over 10,000€, so if we are able to meet our goal every cent will go into getting us there.<br/>As a non-profit sports association, we are required to reinvest any budget left by the end of the social year into activities related to the goals of our organization, so in the unfortunate case that it becomes impossible for us to be present in Vancouver, all the money raised will go into helping Italian and possibly European teams with equipment, lowering tournament fees, and helping with expenses (travelling, volunteers, etc.) that slow down the expansion of quidditch.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>In Italiano!

That's the tiny Italian soul in you! Why not listen to it some more and support the Italian quidditch National Team, then?Quidditch in ItalyWe represent a nation that, despite its still not incredible density in terms of teams and players, is doing its best to be one of the leading forces in European quidditch. With the only team coming from a country that wasn't the hosting one for the first edition of European regionals, we always looked for internationality, and the Global Games are for us a chance to show that us not being there from as early as other countries is not stopping us from having a steady growth, and that we deserve any attention we can get on the international stage.The first italian team registered with the IQA was Milano Meneghins Quidditch in 2012, and we are now up to 5 official teams with Lunatica Quidditch Club from Brindisi being the team that reached the 4th place during the most recent European regional championship, despite having only 8 players in their roster. We have come a long way and we still have an even longer way to go, and we want to show you what we've accomplished so far and how Italian quidditch is developing its own distinctive traits.The national teamThe Azzurri side (from ""azzurro"", light blue, the color that italian sides of all sports usually wear) was announced in Italy a few months ago, composed of players from the most active groups, and a minority from newly founded, or yet to be founded, teams. There has been a first practice in the north in March and one in the south in April, with two more scheduled before Global Games.The roster is surprisingly diverse, considering the relatively small pool of national players, and you will soon have a chance to meet them on this campaign, and with an article in English that is being edited as I write this.Here is why you should help us!Helping us get to Global Games, not only you make sure that we can bring some more people than the current group that would be able to travel to Canada - right now a rather limited bunch of players - but you would also make sure that we can bring that experience back, increasing the level in our league, and in Europe, and subsequently anywhere else we get a chance to play. At the same time you will be able to experience different ways to look at the sport you love so much, and to make valuable friends in a country different from yours. Do I need to mention (again) we almost undisputedly have the best food, and wines, and art, and history, etc., and that you are welcome to visit us any time?What you getFirst, you get us! And we are adorable. Don't misunderstand, we're here to kick some ass or give it our best shot at least, but we strongly believe in the community aspect of quidditch, and you'll love having us at Global Games to hang out with, even those of us that are not so skilled in English.Also, our perks, to be released soon, will be that touch of Italian class you were missing from your quidditch collection!Where does your money go?That's easily said: we estimate that to bring the entire team to Canada would cost easily over 10,000€, so if we are able to meet our goal every cent will go into getting us there.As a non-profit sports association, we are required to reinvest any budget left by the end of the social year into activities related to the goals of our organization, so in the unfortunate case that it becomes impossible for us to be present in Vancouver, all the money raised will go into helping Italian and possibly European teams with equipment, lowering tournament fees, and helping with expenses (travelling, volunteers, etc.) that slow down the expansion of quidditch.In Italiano!

<h3>The Story of Paranoid</h3>
<p>Paranoid started in 2010 literally with a dream. In the beginning of 2011 this dream was acted, recorded, composed, drawn and coded by a tiny, tiny team of passionate people. It became an audio-and-GPS-augmented-mobile game, where you run for your life. It was published in the Spring of 2011.</p>

<h3>Our Situation</h3>
<p>We are now struggling with competition and sales. And we are now forced to either we make this big or then to wrap up the loose ends and leave it for now. We need you to be able to fight our competition, because we STILL have better ideas and better path to develop this type of game and we know how to keep things simple and with Your help we can make them into reality.</p>

<h3>Paranoid 2.0</h3>

<p>We are going to use the money to go on-line, to introduce 3D in the gameplay, more themes and a couple of surprises for our competition, so in short your money will be spent well. That's about 2/3 of the funding we ask for. The other 1/3 will go to Android development.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Considering what we are about to do (and what we have done already), these numbers are 'peanuts' in the world of gaming. Our advantage is that we happen to have a very devoted and talented people working in this project.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>What you will be giving us is time to work on this. Shiing has a lot of work lined up for it, so we're trying to figure out would the world like Paranoid 2.0 to be made or should we concentrate on the other stuff.</p>

<p>This draw and discard card game is simple to learn but challenging to master. The objective is to build a complete creature that's worth the most points. You get to enhance your creature with crazy accessories and special powers for bonus points,  play negative points on other players and even steal their creature pieces! The player with the most points wins! This game is suitable for ages 8 and up and helps teach math skills too! It's 
unique, silly, visually fun, and different each time you play so it keeps your interest. Don't be fooled by the simplicity of game-play. It takes strategy and planning to win. <br/>

<p>The objective of the game is to get the most points. You can do this in a variety of ways. Build the most creatures, have the most bonuses, the best abilities or a combination of all.</p>
<p>Every turn starts with drawing a card and ends with a discard. Each turn you can play one card to your score pile. Unless you have a special card! More about that below.</p>
<p>The game deck is divided into categories. The 3 main categories are Head, Body and Feet. These are the basic components of any creature. To score any points you must complete a creature with head, body and feet. This makes a scoring set.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453244995/s4acqoxapja3l1palsoi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Once you have a complete set you can start customizing your creature. The other categories are bonus, ability and special. Bonus cards are used to add bonus points for each body part. Some of these are claws, webbed feet and googly eyes! Ability cards are rare abilities each creature can obtain. Such as fire breathing! But watch out... someone may have a water ability to put out your fire! Special cards can be played on other people or to the deck and have powers like stealing a creature part, drawing extra cards, or shuffling the deck. When a player has used all the cards in their hands the game ends. The player with the highest score wins!<br/>
<p>Let's take a look at a sample score:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453245022/wwjhvlumxackb42rzwqb.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

2-6 players ages 8 and up. Children can play it alone but it's fun for 
us big children too. The game helps teach math skills 
with addition, subtraction and multiplication by 2. The game deck is 
also categorized in ways that help teach pattern recognition and like 
object grouping. Each head, body and feet card has it's own color and 
icon. Any card you can play on a head, body or feet card shares the same
 color and icon making it easier for younger children to play and 
understand.<br/>

<p>The game concept and deck with sample graphics is complete, tested and fun! Basic package design is complete. What I need is refined graphics for the bonus, ability and special cards. These refined graphics will tie into the package design as well. I have some local and regional sales outlets but need complete printed decks to present. The main bulk of funding needed is to cover artwork, printing and marketing costs. I know the game works well and has expansion possibilities for continued growth. My goal is to get this game into the hands of local stores, regional and national chains. Every donation will go to getting as close to that goal as possible. The $3,800.00 goal will cover the costs of revised artwork, printing costs and marketing for enough decks to hit my regional goals. If I get less then I'll stay local and still get this in front of as many people as I can. If I get more I'll get it in front of national chains. If I end up going way over my goal then anything remaining will go towards making the first themed expansion deck.<br/>

The objective is to build a complete creature that's worth the most points. You get to enhance your creature with crazy accessories and special powers for bonus points,  play negative points on other players and even steal their creature pieces! The player with the most points wins! This game is suitable for ages 8 and up and helps teach math skills too! It's 
unique, silly, visually fun, and different each time you play so it keeps your interest. Don't be fooled by the simplicity of game-play. It takes strategy and planning to win. 








The objective of the game is to get the most points. You can do this in a variety of ways. Build the most creatures, have the most bonuses, the best abilities or a combination of all.
Every turn starts with drawing a card and ends with a discard. Each turn you can play one card to your score pile. Unless you have a special card! More about that below.
The game deck is divided into categories. The 3 main categories are Head, Body and Feet. These are the basic components of any creature. To score any points you must complete a creature with head, body and feet. This makes a scoring set.

Once you have a complete set you can start customizing your creature. The other categories are bonus, ability and special. Bonus cards are used to add bonus points for each body part. Some of these are claws, webbed feet and googly eyes! Ability cards are rare abilities each creature can obtain. Such as fire breathing! But watch out... someone may have a water ability to put out your fire! Special cards can be played on other people or to the deck and have powers like stealing a creature part, drawing extra cards, or shuffling the deck. When a player has used all the cards in their hands the game ends. The player with the highest score wins!
Let's take a look at a sample score:


It's for everyone! The game can be played with 
2-6 players ages 8 and up. Children can play it alone but it's fun for 
us big children too. The game helps teach math skills 
with addition, subtraction and multiplication by 2. The game deck is 
also categorized in ways that help teach pattern recognition and like 
object grouping. Each head, body and feet card has it's own color and 
icon. Any card you can play on a head, body or feet card shares the same
 color and icon making it easier for younger children to play and 
understand.

  


The game concept and deck with sample graphics is complete, tested and fun! Basic package design is complete. What I need is refined graphics for the bonus, ability and special cards. These refined graphics will tie into the package design as well. I have some local and regional sales outlets but need complete printed decks to present. The main bulk of funding needed is to cover artwork, printing and marketing costs. I know the game works well and has expansion possibilities for continued growth. My goal is to get this game into the hands of local stores, regional and national chains. Every donation will go to getting as close to that goal as possible. The $3,800.00 goal will cover the costs of revised artwork, printing costs and marketing for enough decks to hit my regional goals. If I get less then I'll stay local and still get this in front of as many people as I can. If I get more I'll get it in front of national chains. If I end up going way over my goal then anything remaining will go towards making the first themed expansion deck.




One of the hats I've worn has been in sales and marketing. I've been part of a clothing company that grew from selling t-shirts in the parking lots of concerts to going wholesale in major resort destinations in Hawaii, California, Colorado and Arizona. I know how to pound the pavement, make calls that lead to appointments and be diligent to get my product in front of the right people. I bring that same tenacity to my first self published game. 




If you can't make a donation but like the idea:Spread the word!Please feel free to share this with those you know and love! This game couldn't have been made without the help of my friends and family and I value their input and support greatly!Perks:Featured Perk: $38.00Game deck (96 cards), sleeve

best cards in the game! This is a chance to be part of the creation of the final deck. Not only will you choose an ability you can help decide what the graphics look like. Get creative with it. Lightning, Earthquake 
stomp, Extreme napper... you decide!

Our world is made by hand and not computer generated. It was very important to us to create world that is constructed out of unique places that you can explore.Even though big part of the world is nature, every place will feel unique and different so after playing few hours of game you will feel comfortable withouth using map of the world. There are 7 theme bioms: green spring, autumn, snowy, desert, savanna, jungle and drought island.
Probably your main goal in The Warhorn will be creating your own village. You can do it almost anywhere in the world by placing totem and setting up name for your village.
  Then you will be able to invite your friends, so development of your village will be easier and more fun.The Warhorn offers two types of building systems:First one is for creating your own house - you can build using ready elements like foundations, pillars, walls, doors and etc.You can build what you want and how you want. In your house you can keep your most valuable items you have.Second way to develop your village is by placing functional buildings like sawmill, blacksmith, armorer, mill or alchemist etc.These predefined buildings are very usefull for creating tools, armors and weapons. Your future achievements and safety will depend on these buildings. The most important functional building is townhall, which you have to build in first place because it will allow you to fully manage your village. In townhall you will be able to check level of your village, list of all members and  theirs role, list of buildings and NPCs that you own. Level of your village will depend on two things: resources that you will bring to village and buildings you will create. When your village level is high enough you will get information that new era has come, which means that you can now build better buildings and upgrade the ones you already own. This is very important part of the game because new elements will be much stronger and you will feel much safer.As owner of the village you will be able to create NPCs that will help you in the game. You can craft 3 types of NPC's:- Villager who can extract resources and bring them to village.- Warrior who will help you fight with every creature and player in the world. He will also take care of helpless villager who is exposed to other players when he is gathering resources by himself.- Gate guard who will guard entrance to you village.Crutial place when you will start the game will be main village which is mutual for every player. When you will need any armor or weapons you can visit any of functional buildings that are available in main city and buy what you want.That place is a safe zone where players can not fight and it is place where you can meet new friends. There is also an arena where you can fight for money and honor.This approach allows you to have fun all the time without spending too much time on looking for resources because you can just buy it.



Multiplayer in our game will operate on dedicated servers, but there will be also possibility to create you own game and invite your friends to join you. So if you want to play alone or with couple of friends it will be possible.When your village will be developed enough you will gain access to build war machines like catapult, ballista or battering ram so you can attack other villages and defend your own one.All over the world there will be a lot of mysteriuos places that will be a challenge for everyone. Often before you will get acces to that place you will have to resolve a puzzle. Many entrances will be hidden or locked.Just remember to have your eyes open. Look for buttons, mechanisms, levers and everything else that you can interractc with.Frequenty you will notice different symbols that will help you find an answer. Almost everything what you will encounter in game will be important.When you finally find the end of dungeon you have to face big beast. You will die or win the fight. There will be no return.Kill, cook, eat, drink and survive.We are three students of computer science in Łódź.

The game is played with each player having four cards in their hand and each turn you draw a card and then play a card. Then you just follow the rules written on the cards themselves. The

The cards

FLIP! Once you play this card you flip a

That's where EVENT cards
come in! They can steal, copy, or remove cards, as well as either
enhance or detract their Point value.

Method is an old WoW guild, but as an organization we are making baby 
steps. As many other organizations in their early years it is a struggle
 for us to be financially self-sufficient. So we are asking for your 
help to get things moving.<br/><br/><i>Don't you get money from sponsorships like other teams?</i><br/><br/>
We have received small amounts of financial support from sponsors. 
However it has been no where near enough to finance a full Hearthstone 
or Heroes of the Storm roster for a longer time though. Besides, most 
bigger esport teams have wealthy investors behind them who provide funds
 in addition to sponsorships. Method does not have that unfortunately.<br/><br/><i>Why do you need money to write WoW/HS/HotS guides?</i><br/><br/>
Most people who ask this would be surprised about how many WoW guides on
 the internet are paid content. It is painful to ask our members and 
players from other top guilds to write in-depth guides for no pay while 
other sites are paying for the same work. In general it is our believe 
that game guides are work that deserves pay, hopefully others see it the
 same way.<br/><br/><i>If other websites already write guides, why do we need yours?</i><br/><br/>
In regards to boss guides we would definitely be able to write mythic 
guides much earlier than anyone else. Our class guides are written only 
by members of Method and other top raid guilds. Not saying that makes 
our class guides better, but it certainly makes them different.<br/><br/><i>How do you come up with the amount of money needed for each goal, like 3000€  for class guides or 4000€ for new Hearthstone members?</i><br/><br/>
First you have to keep in mind that Indiegogo, like all crowdfund 
websites, and PayPal take fees for their services. On top of that there 
are the costs for perks. In the end somewhere between 70-75% of the 
funded amount will be available to achieve our set goals. The 3000€ 
(2100€+ after costs) for class guides for instance were calculated by 
taking the total amount of guides needed and multiplying that number 
with the average amount of money that other websites pay for class 
guides. Same goes for boss guides. 4000€ for new hearthstone members is 
an estimation of the money that will be needed to sign players for 6 to 
12 months. As explained in the campaign, the money will be used to cover
 flight, hotel and other travel costs which occur when our players 
attend live event competitions.<br/></p></div>","UPDATE: FAQ added at the end of the campaign. A statement, addressing questions and concerns about the fundraiser can be found here: http://www.methodwow.com/board/showthread.php?15445-Method-Fundraiser-Statement-FAQ&p=116843#post116843Scott 'Sco' McMillan founded the World of Warcraft guild Method in summer 2005. Since then the guild has developed into a community, forming friendships and even relationships over the past 9 years.  Amongt them is a couple, now married with a kid, who found each other by being members of Method. Besides raiding in WoW and playing other games together, some of us also meet at events like DreamHack, Gamescom and Blizzcon.Method is a gaming community that we want to preserve and expand. We also want  to share our experience with other gamers. This fundraiser campaign, if succesful, will help us immensely to achive these goals.We promise that, if reached, goals will be fulfilled.A complete re-work of the current Method website.

</div></div>","RPGnet is the top independent web site for tabletop roleplaying games. The heart of our site is one of the most talked-about forums in the industry — with 11,000 active members and almost 16 million posts. We also publish several reviews every week and a few columns. Finally, we maintain a constantly expanding catalog of roleplaying products that currently indexes 19,000 games and supplements, 2,000 magazines, and 36,000 articles.All of this costs money, so in 2013 we decided to turn to crowdfunding to encourage readers to become members, to support the site. The drive was very successful, so we've turned into a yearly tradition.In years past, we've thanked our members with proactive work that's helped to make the site a better place.That's included the reinstatement of the search function, the movement of the machines to a cloud platform, the fixing of bugs, and the improvement of security.We'll be offering proactive work again this year, with a focus on improving the mobile experience. However, we also want to offer another sort of thanks. So this year we'll be offering some free PDFs in January and February to everyone who's a member, as long as we hit the core goal of this crowdfunding. So, join us now, and get some cool stuff for some cool RPGs. Following the end of this GoGo, you can sign up for a membership directly from RPGnet. Cool stuff will be available to everyone who signs up before the end of February.We hope you'll become members to support a site that you use and enjoy. However, as long as we meet our core goal of $2,500 $1,500 (see below), we'll also be giving out cool PDFs to all of our members in January and February 2016 thanks to some help from some great RPGs companies!If you're a Cthulhu fan, we have:

Extraordinary Renditions, the new fiction anthology eBook for Delta Green.

The Unspeakable Oath #23, with the ""Cold Dead Hand"" scenario.

The Unspeakable Oath #24, with haunted houses, shotguns, and more.
If you're a fantasy d100 fan instead, we have:
Legend Core Rulebook, Mongoose's take on a classic d100 system.If you're a Pathfinder fan, we have:

Ultimate Relationships #1: The Lonely Lyrakien from Legendary Games.

Dungeonlands: Tomb of the Lich Queen from Savage Mojo.
Finally, if you're an indie fan, we have two books from Rogue Games:
Colonial Gothic 2nd Edition Rulebook.

Lovecraft for Colonial Gothic (yep, that's another Cthulhu book!).
Thanks to these product sponsors!

      
   

Though ads and affiliations pay some of our costs, we are picky about which ads and ad networks we use, so that we can maintain high-quality ads that are likely to be of interest and that won't distract our readers. We've opted out of high-value ads that include audio, that expand, or that are placed as interstitials between pages. We forbid dating ads, gambling ads, gold-farming ads, political ads, and certain other categories of advertising. As a result, we occasionally ask RPGnet readers to become members, in order to help support the community. We've done this on a somewhat ad hoc basis in the past, but now that crowdfunding has matured, we've turned to IndieGoGo for our annual RPGnet Membership Drive.We hope that you'll join us, and help to support the RPGnet community.Our goal for this IndieGoGo crowdfunding is simple: we want you to become an RPGnet member. Every single reward other than the $5 support level will grant you a membership at RPGnet. Most of them provide membership for the next year*, but we also offer Lifetime Memberships for Patrons and others who want to offer a higher level of support.As a member, you'll receive a few benefits as thanks:

No Ads.You may choose to turn off some or all ads at RPGnet.

Forum Recognition.You'll receive a Member flag on your forum account.

Forum PMs.You get a larger 150-item PM Box and you can mail to users with full PM Boxes.

Forum Avatar.You can select a larger 60x60 avatar.

Early Columns Access.You can read columns before they're posted.

Early Review Access. You can read reviews before they're posted.

XP. Just for fun, we'll give you Experience Points every month, to reflect your contribution to the site.

Cool PDFs. Becoming a member is how you get access to the PDFs our sponsors are providing. From about 1/1/16 to 2/28/16, they'll be available as a free download directly from your membership panel. 
* We'll start all memberships shortly after this crowdfunding closes, once we get your forum account names. If you already have a yearly membership, we'll just add a year to your current end date. If you already have a lifetime membership, then we offer our thanks!Your support ensures that we can continue to give RPGnet the same attention that we have in the past. However, we'd like to do more than that. If we raise higher levels of funds, we'll also work to make RPGnet more self-sufficient, so that its improvements don't depend upon Skotos staff not being busy with other tasks.To ensure this, we'll guarantee increased staff time at many of our stretch goals. That will allow us to once more be proactive in 2016 and to put more time toward increasing the coolness of RPGnet. As we reach new funding levels, we'll be adding stretch goals, most of which relate to specific work that we'll undertake for the site in 2016. We gave our past sponsors the opportunity to renew their sponsorship buttons in advance of the GoGo and will be counting that toward the drive. As a result, we've lowered all our intended stretch goals by $1,000, thanks to the sponsorship renewal by DTRPG.$1,500. Bag of PDFs. As soon as we hit our core goal of $2,500 $1,500 we'll start working on programming a simple interface to let you download our sponsor's PDFs. Files will be available in January and in February. Goal Met! PDFs are Coming!$4,000. Boots of Striding. The biggest technical request for RPGnet seems to be better mobile support. If we hit our first stretch goal, we'll put up to a week of effort into making mobile work better. This will definitely involve releasing a standalone mobile app and ensuring that we have the newest and most up-to-date mobile skins for RPGnet. We may decide to upgrade from vBulletin 4 to vBulletin 5 as part of this process, to really make sure that everything is up-to-date. Goal Met!$6,500. +1 Staff. Our chief programmer (Shannon) dedicates a full week of work to RPGnet, absent any emergencies with our various machines. Our top priorities for this (and all other work time that we stretch in) will be: improving the security of the site; aggressively fixing bugs; and adding cool features (possibly including blogs, but fundamentally focusing on what our Patrons, Talkative Members, and Lifetime Members want to see). Goal Met!$9,000. Amulet of Contributions. Though our forums are the heart of our site, our reviews and columns are very important too. If we hit this stretch goal, we're going to create some infrastructure to better identify our top contributors of all sorts, allow them editing capability, and give them a place to talk. We'll also create the foundation for a line reviewers program. If you're a reviewer or columnist, you'll get better support; and if you're a reader, you'll get more cool stuff. Goal Met Through Bonus Stretch Goal! (See Below.)$11,500. +2 Staff. We dedicate a second full week of programming & sysadmin work to RPGnet. This will probably occur late in 2016.$14,000. Bag of Holding. A new membership benefit? This stretch goal slot is undecided, so feel free to offer suggestions.$19,000. +3 Staff. We dedicate a third full week of programming & sysadmin work to RPGnet.
Bonus Stretch Goal: If we hit 104 backers, exceeding the size of our 2013 Membership Drive, we'll automatically bump up to the next stretch goal!
