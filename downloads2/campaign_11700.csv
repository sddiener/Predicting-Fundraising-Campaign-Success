<p>Hello fellow comic fans! Our names are Adam Gagnon and Mike Virgilio. We've been friends since we were 14 years old and are so excited to share our new comedy comic series, Social Studies, with you.

<h3>What You Get For Your Support</h3>
<p>We did our best to keep our funding goal low. Our only goal is to get our stories in your hands. We want to share the fun and friendship on these pages with you so we can get to know each other through a shared, though different, experience.</p>
<p>Indie comics live with people like you. This is a passion project for us, and we're cool with that. Printing and shipping can get expensive and restrictive at times. Small bits of help go a long way to keeping independent projects like this rolling.</p>
<p>Our core focus is on the story itself. But we wanted to have some fun with the perks!</p>
<ul>
<li>Every backer will get a thank you, by name, in the back of the trade and on our website.</li>
<li>Every backer of a physical product will get a 4x6 print of our 'tagged' character image (below).</li>
<li>If we reach our goal every backer of a physical product will get the above perks as well as a bookmark designed specifically for this campaign to track your progress.</li>
<li>If we reach 1500 we'll add in a custom dye cut sticker.</li>

<p><i>“Korey and Clayton Barton are two guys I’m keeping a close eye on right now. Both are young, talented, not easily shaken and above all move with purpose. Driven. Dangerous combinations like this can shake the world. I backed Kozor because I believe in them and want to give their artistic journey the push it deserves and hope all of you will too.”</i> <strong>- Jon Malin</strong><br/><br/><i>“Kozor was an instant buy for me. The passion that the Barton Brothers have for creating awesome stories and art is infectious. Do yourself a favor and GET THIS BOOK”</i> <strong>- FragaBoom!</strong><br/> </p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>KOZOR: Descent Into Madness is a 48 page full color comic book that tells a nightmare fueled story of foul demons, grizzled warriors and abundant bloodshed.</p>
<p>The mighty warrior, Chief Baron and his clan of swordsmen embark on a quest into the sacred swamp lands of Nimlaar in search for the mysterious 'faceless people'. But when they're attacked by a flock of flying beasts, their journey proves more fatal than they could have ever imagined!<br/> </p>

<h3>HEXER DUSK</h3>
<p>The Obsidian galaxy. Five years after the devastating Chaos War. The Sky Cities have fallen from the sky, other-dimensional creatures called the Weird have emerged from the rift caused by the Sky Cities destruction. The Weird can't survive here for long unless they take a being to use as their shell. Living or dead--it doesn't matter to them. Hexers are the only ones who can destroy the Weird--and most of them died in the Chaos War. Hexer Xane Dusk is one of the last Hexers. </p>
<p><strong>Hexer Dusk will be a 72 page FULL-COLOR GRAPHIC NOVEL.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>First, we'd like to introduce ourselves. We Jan Duursema and John Ostrander and are comic book creators who are passionate about our work!</p>
<p>Jan Duursema is a long time comic book artist who has illustrated series such as Star Wars Legacy, Hawkman, X-Factor and more. John Ostrander is a long time comic book writer who has written stories for series such as GrimJack, Hawkman and Star Wars Legacy. He is also the creator of the modern Suicide Squad and Amanda 'The Wall' Waller.</p>
<p><strong>Hexer Dusk</strong> is extremely important to us and our first joint foray into indie comics creation. We've both worked in the comic book industry for a long time, but getting to create something of your own is something we've always dreamed of doing! </p>
<p>Hexer Dusk was successfully funded on Kickstarter, so why are we here on Indiegogo? We're here because after the Kickstarter was over, we started getting messages from folks who'd missed the Kickstarter and who wanted to read this new graphic novel! We're here because we want <i>you </i>to read the story of <i>Hexer Dusk</i>--the first story of what we hope will become a<i> series</i> of stories that we can't wait to tell you. </p>
<p>By backing Hexer Dusk, you will be a big part of making this series happen--and you'll get to read the premiere graphic novel full of compelling new characters, alien creatures and otherworldly settings. We want to ignite your imagination and take you to strange worlds on an exciting new adventure! It's what we love to do. We hope you will join us!</p>
<p> Right now, Hexer Dusk is being illustrated with pencils and inks by Jan and John is scripting those pages. We're aiming for a shipping date in December of 2016. </p>

NEW ARTWORK PREVIEW- AVAILABLE IN THE UPDATES SECTION- 9/14/2021. CHECK IT OUT!!!The media calls it the Pacific Flu. The CDC calls it H7D3, and it spreads like wildfire. The virus combines the worst symptoms of Rabies and the common Flu, and is suspected to be man-made. The first reports of feral, cannibalistic “zombie-like” symptoms were met with disbelief and skeptical amusement, but nobody’s laughing now. Scientists, backed by the world’s governments and its wealthiest institutions, race against the clock to develop a cure as infections rise and cities fall.A glimmer of hope appears as a vaccine is discovered, but its production requires harvesting the spinal tissue of the infected, a grim task that tests the limits of human morality. With no other choices apparent, time is quickly running out before hordes of infected overwhelm the last remaining bastions of civilization.In the first days of the outbreak, a college history professor receives a cryptic warning from a trusted source. Its baffling, yet unmistakable message translates as:  ""PACK UP, GET OUT,AND GO NOW!""Steve Smith and his family don’t waste any time; they leave their normal, comfortable lives behind to get ahead of the inevitable panic and survive the end of the world!Special 5-Page Sneak PreviewMain Characters: The Smith Family  Steve Smith: A paratrooper turned college professor; Steve heeds his brother’s warning to leave the family’s former life behind during the early days of the outbreak. A calm and soft-spoken man with an iron resolve, who will stop at nothing to protect his wife and daughters. Steve “flips the switch” back to the combat-hardened mindset of his Army days, and looks to the lessons of the history he taught to bored college freshmen in his pursuit of safe harbor. Stacey Smith: A savvy mechanical engineer who keeps her family running as smoothly as the engine of their stolen boat, procured in no small part by her quick thinking. Stacey and Steve are low-key “preppers” who raised their daughters to be capable and independent-minded, with lots of self-defense training on top of sports and education.  Sophia Smith: Older daughter of Steve and Stacey. Sophia takes after her mother, especially when it comes to logical thinking and planning. She is often frustrated at having a “little” sister who isn’t so little, and her conscientious wisdom often clashes with Faith’s impulsive nature.         Faith Smith: Younger daughter of Steve and Stacey, a high school student who is especially tall and strong for her age. The fire to Sophia’s ice. Extremely competitive, often hot-headed and impetuous, but tempered with a compassionate heart. Faith adapts very quickly to fighting the infected, to an almost frightening degree, and buries her fear by treating the “zombie apocalypse” as an exciting game.        Tom Smith: Steve’s brother, former Special Forces. Head of Security & Emergency Response for Bank of the Americas, one of the elite institutions funding its own efforts to produce a vaccine. His keen sense of honor creates conflict between his obligations to the bank and his family loyalty. Tom struggles to maintain a fragile truce between ruthless bankers, vicious gangsters, beleaguered cops, and grasping bureaucrats...all entangled in a deadly game of brinksmanship and hidden agendas. Supporting Characters

<p>One day, Savannah Steel's father,  does an experiment to unlock what he believes are actually hundreds if not thousands of parallel dimensions.  In a terrible accident, he is killed and Savannah is injured. </p>
<p>Have you ever lost someone?  You'll know then the emptiness that comes with that loss, an irreplaceable vacuum in your heart. You'll know what Savannah has felt. </p>
<p>Yet strangely she soon finds that she can somehow summon great deals of energy to strike and control objects she touches. </p>

<p>I get it, money is tight and you can't just go around backing every comic book campaign that pops up.</p>
<p>So if you can't back me with your hard-earned money, is there any way in the world you could possibly help spread the word? Could you tell a friend?  Share a post?  Yell loudly at the sky while waiving your hands in the air, in a fashion that implies that you just don't care?</p>
<p>Any little bit helps and I would be incredibly grateful.</p>
<p>Thank you kindly.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612233096/yrb5tlzf3xjzqrmz1dmj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div></div>","Kinetic is the action-adventure story of a reluctant girl taking on the mantle of a hero!
I am incredibly excited to show you: Kinetic.  This tremendous book is mix of Invincible and Spider-Man as it fuses the intensity of incredible, fly by the seat of your pants action with the struggles of growing into adulthood. 
Why should you back this book?  You'll experience a captivating journey of a girl who summons the kinetic energy of multiple dimensions to strike ballistic blows to her foes.  Armed with her trusty ""Battle Ribbon"", Kinetic does her best to save, or at least try to save, the day any way she can.
You'll love this 40 page adventure written, drawn, and lettered by myself.  With your help and support you can help launch this awesome comic book series. 
You'll get a top of the line book that puts you on the edge of your seat from the moment you open it up to the final closing page. 
With your help, I can take this story from being a small-time character to something the whole comics world can enjoy.
A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF KINETIC:
One day, Savannah Steel's father,  does an experiment to unlock what he believes are actually hundreds if not thousands of parallel dimensions.  In a terrible accident, he is killed and Savannah is injured. 
Have you ever lost someone?  You'll know then the emptiness that comes with that loss, an irreplaceable vacuum in your heart. You'll know what Savannah has felt. 
Yet strangely she soon finds that she can somehow summon great deals of energy to strike and control objects she touches. 
Although unable to unlock those other dimensions, somehow she draws the kinetic energy of those parallel worlds and focuses it into this dimension.  The result is a powerful ballistic force generated as a weapon.
Honoring her father with what she now sees as his dying gift to her, she uses this ability to fight crime and the recent rise of terrorist activity as her alter ego, KINETIC. 
However, a strange new enemy has emerged and now Kinetic finds herself face to face with a monstrous and deadly foe.....

THE EXPENDABLES are an international team of mercenaries based out of New Orleans, Louisiana.


This Band Of Bad-Asses is led by founding member BARNEY ROSS, a highly-decorated veteran of the United States Military. While the membership varies wildly (once topping out at 22 members) the core group is comprised of:


LEE CHRISTMAS- Brit. KNIFE-FIGHTER. Second-in-command. UNLUCKY in love.

GUNNER JENSEN- Swede. GIANT. Genius. SELF-MEDICATES with alcohol & street pharmaceuticals.

YIN YANG- Chinese. RAGE-QUITS the team every year or so. Back for now (he's BROKE).

TOLL ROAD- American. NEUROTIC. Small Unit Combat Operations are his version of GROUP THERAPY.



The team takes High-Risk/High-Reward missions and split the take EQUALLY. Contract work for the CIA keeps them out of JAIL for the International Laws they break as mercenaries.
Members come and go, but there's always a need for ROUGH MEN to commit VIOLENCE so that civilized people can sleep in PEACE...and THE EXPENDABLES are just the men for the job!
 


KILLED in Combat...They Awaken in HELL!
Here are several pages from the main story. Line Art by Graham Nolan. Colors by Daniel Brown.

The Historians are a team of explorers who travel the multiverse and protects reality from evil, they are attacked by an extra - dimensional being who seeks to destroy them; which causes time to splinter, forcing the Historians into action across different timelines. These characters have existed in my mind for far too long; and now its time that they've made their appearance.  

I'm Dante Lee, writer and creator of the Historians and their supporting cast.
I have a strong passion for comic book storytelling, I come from an era of great comics and creative minds.
My goal is to share a new universe of comic book lore and excitement, new characters and storylines that'll stand the test of time. I had to challenge myself when it came to every aspect of these characters and their stories. 

(Note: I write from a place of truth and memory... My creations have been with me before I knew myself...)


The Goal!
The Breakdown:

I'm trying to raise enough funds to successfully provide you with a quality 70+ page graphic novel, in color (paperback, hardback, digital); on time or before the due date. My goal is: $8k which will cover artist fees, colorist fees and publication.
This is my first campaign and I'm happy to say that I'll have Posters, Character Cards and Exclusives (covers and book interior bonus).
If this campaign doesn't reach the goal but has some backers, the backers who provided support will get their book and other materials on time. 



Impacting Dreams
The Truth:

I am ultimately here because I need your support and your belief in my creativity.  
I have a strong passion for comic books, they have been a part of my life since...forever.
I need your support. Believe in the Historians, and that there is something greater around the corner. 


The Future
Book One of the Historians is 50% complete and I've already outlined  part two & one spin off.  

I've overcome most issues during these strange times we live in now.
The only thing to do now is to continue moving forward and deliver a solid product upon completion.

<p>Chaotic Flux centers on a group of unique heroes who unite in the future to rid the world of Dreadfiends, flesh-devouring mutant abominations. These heroes form a group called the Crimson Flame and become humanity's last hope of survival.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Chaotic Flux #3 is 30 pages long.</strong></h3>
<p>Chaotic Flux #2 left Zithara, a powerful hybrid alien warrior, surprised by a Dreadfiend's extreme mutating ability. This reborn monster won't stop at anything until it gets its revenge on her by ripping her apart just and devouring her rare hybrid flesh.</p>
<p>As she is fighting to survive this new horror the twisted cyborg Lt. Vladic is waiting for his chance to finally bring her to his master, Thraxus Prime.  Lt. Vladic will unknowingly kick off a series of events that will begin Zithara on a new path of daring heroics, with an exo-suit pilot named Sorin and an highly advanced A.I. war machine named Strife. Together they will start the super team, The Crimson Flame.</p>

<p>Hello. My name is Scott Payne. I have been a huge comic book fanatic for most of my life and I've wanted to be a comic book creator ever since I can remember. I've always felt that if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it BIG.</p>
<p>I have been building on this story and world for about 20 years. Chaotic Flux is a grand culmination of ideas, story elements, and characters influenced by many things that I have loved throughout my life. It is a passion of mine and I want nothing more than to get it into the hands of readers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612075152/wfnpt0gyi9aerdovxitb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Illustrator: Brian Balondo - Returning for Chaotic Flux #3, Brian is a very talented and versatile up and comic book coming artist. It has been said many times that his art would fit wonderfully in the books of the big 2. Some of his other works include Star Burn, Rising Sun, Undercity Tales, and Chaotic Flux #1 and 2.</p>
<p>Colorist: Bryan Magnaye - Returning for Chaotic Flux #3, Bryan is a genius when it comes to his coloring techniques. He makes that art just jump right off of the page every time. Some of Bryan's other works include The Mighty Titans, War of the Independents, Rising Sun, Undercity Tales, and the greatly successful IndieGoGo comic, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ravage-kill-all-men/x/19575607#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">RAVAGE - KILL ALL MEN!</a></p>
<p>Letterer: Janelle Murphy - Returning as letterer for the second time, following Chaotic Flux #2. As you can see from the previews above, she has a natural talent for it. Her drive and devotion to making this book turn out great continues to be just as strong as anyone else's on our team.</p>
<p>I am so lucky to have these amazing and talented artists to help me bring my vision to life.</p>

Chaotic Flux #3 is 30 pages long.
Chaotic Flux #2 left Zithara, a powerful hybrid alien warrior, surprised by a Dreadfiend's extreme mutating ability. This reborn monster won't stop at anything until it gets its revenge on her by ripping her apart just and devouring her rare hybrid flesh.
As she is fighting to survive this new horror the twisted cyborg Lt. Vladic is waiting for his chance to finally bring her to his master, Thraxus Prime.  Lt. Vladic will unknowingly kick off a series of events that will begin Zithara on a new path of daring heroics, with an exo-suit pilot named Sorin and an highly advanced A.I. war machine named Strife. Together they will start the super team, The Crimson Flame.

Hello. My name is Scott Payne. I have been a huge comic book fanatic for most of my life and I've wanted to be a comic book creator ever since I can remember. I've always felt that if I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it BIG.
I have been building on this story and world for about 20 years. Chaotic Flux is a grand culmination of ideas, story elements, and characters influenced by many things that I have loved throughout my life. It is a passion of mine and I want nothing more than to get it into the hands of readers.

Illustrator: Brian Balondo - Returning for Chaotic Flux #3, Brian is a very talented and versatile up and comic book coming artist. It has been said many times that his art would fit wonderfully in the books of the big 2. Some of his other works include Star Burn, Rising Sun, Undercity Tales, and Chaotic Flux #1 and 2.
Colorist: Bryan Magnaye - Returning for Chaotic Flux #3, Bryan is a genius when it comes to his coloring techniques. He makes that art just jump right off of the page every time. Some of Bryan's other works include The Mighty Titans, War of the Independents, Rising Sun, Undercity Tales, and the greatly successful IndieGoGo comic, RAVAGE - KILL ALL MEN!
Letterer: Janelle Murphy - Returning as letterer for the second time, following Chaotic Flux #2. As you can see from the previews above, she has a natural talent for it. Her drive and devotion to making this book turn out great continues to be just as strong as anyone else's on our team.
I am so lucky to have these amazing and talented artists to help me bring my vision to life.

Exilium is a sci-fi action series taking place in the late 21st century that is returning for its second season following a highly successful six-issue first season (which, if you missed it, is available as part of this campaign), as well as a new spin-off series, Exilium: Vanguard.

 
The first series saw the first official contact having been made with an advanced, extraterrestrial race. On the run from a superior force, they sought refuge on Earth, deeply dividing humanity.
Unknowingly leading their oppressors to Earth, the aliens along with the human faction they had allied themselves with struggled to mount an effective defence.
Humanity's only hope rested with a mysterious group known as the Exilium, where a shocking truth awaited, leaving the heroic trio of Nia, Tr'u and Ken, and indeed all of Earth in absolutely dire straits.
 

 
The second series continues right where we left off in season one and is sure to be another wild ride as the trio of Nia, Tr'u and Ken are called upon in aid of the very foe they had spent most of their lives fighting against.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings, all! My name is Ben Fuselier, Ben Fuse, Fuse Box, whichever you prefer. I am an aspiring screenwriter/comic writer from New Orleans, Louisiana. This story has been an idea that I ping ponged back and forth in my mind: a pipe dream for a film. The recent surge in independent comic book creation had inspired me. I love seeing grass roots creators forge ahead without the control of modern, incorporated comics. As such, I decided to contribute to the cause.</p>
<p><u><strong>This book is going to be 25 pages long (50 pages if we can hit 10K!!).</strong></u></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581803493/kjipqc2qshfgq48sqyrw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A win win in the best sense possible.</p>
<p>Outlaw Nights took on a new life as a comic and, in fact, works best in this medium! </p>
<p>Cyrus Lawson works as a security officer in a remote, strategically useless colony. The 31st Century has seen the countries of earth reignite colonialism in the endless ocean of the universe. Cyrus has seen his fair share of conflict and chaos as a result of the never-ending race. He seeks a quiet life, where he can exercise some ""small town justice."" Unfortunately, fate has other plans...</p>
<p>Ivory, and the pirate crew of Hazard, raid the small settlement of Terez; an art gallery in particular. They seek data that will lead them to the ultimate prize: coveted by nations and individuals alike. In the ensuing chaos, Cyrus must confront these pirates, as well as his notions of ""right"" and ""wrong."" </p>

<p>As such, in order to ensure this book is all it can be, this is going to require some substantial funding. I am setting the fixed goal to 6.5k, but we are going Indemand, as we are going to need at least 10k! I know this is a tall order, but this story is more than worth it!</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>What is Doctor Mars?</strong></h2>
<p>Verdant Comics returns with the follow up to our first successful campaign, Doctor Mars #1! Serving as the launch series for our interconnected universe, this first volume focuses on the story of doctor Adam Albert, who, at the conclusion of the first issue, not only inherited the galaxy, but also the responsibilities that come with protecting it. Wielding both the power of a god and the light to guide him, Doctor Mars must learn what it takes to protect our realm from a threat steadfast on taking it. </p>
<p>For those of you just finding us for the first time, the first issue also saw Doctor Mars uncovering a long-buried threat, a race of ancient alien parasites with the unique ability to not only inherit your physical features, but your memories as well. And when the first of these parasites finally reveals his own face, Adam Albert must learn what it truly means to face one's inner demons. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Who are we? </strong></h2>
<p>We are Verdant Comics, an independent publisher looking to launch the second entry in our very own shared universe! With plans to grow our roster of interconnected characters, we are also beginning the early stages of launching our own original, animated series! </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Meet the team! </strong></h2>
<p><strong>Jacob Coppock</strong> (creator and writer) founded Verdant Comics as a platform to further his passion as a writer as well as utilize his talents to produce high quality, interconnected stories that he hopes will someday redefine industry standards. You can find him on Instagram and Twitter at @jakemakescomics.</p>
<p><strong>James Garman </strong>(creator and editor) co-founded Verdant Comics after his experience in helping introduce Handsome Devil Comics’ Fantasy Killer to the masses lent its hand in understanding what independent comics are really all about. You can find him on Instagram and Twitter at @jamesmakescomics.</p>
<p><strong>Emanuel “Eman!” Sotomayor </strong>(artist) is an illustrator, comic book, and storyboard artist who’s worked in the industry for companies such as Creature Entertainment, YouTube horror channel Crypt TV, Frameworks Artists Agency, and recently was brought on by Verdant Comics as a penciler and inker for Doctor Mars #1. He enjoys spending his days drawing and eating pizza. You can find him on Instagram at @e_man_arts.</p>
<p><strong>Danny Faubricio Sànchez Chaves</strong> (colorist) is a Costa Rica based colorist. He has studied graphic design and began his career as assistant flatter. His career took off when he became involved with Boom Studios for the comic, Smackdown 20th Anniversary. You can find him on Instagram at @dannyfsch.</p>
<p><strong>James Dufendach</strong> (letterer) wears many hats. He is the editor, letterer, and PR guy over at independent comic publisher PLB comics and is also the coordinator of the Ocean City Comic Con. His credits include lettering, editing, writing, and coloring credits on over fourteen issues with PLB Comics, lettering on American Mythology's Stargate Atlantis: Hearts &amp; Minds, as well as many credits on a wide variety of independent projects. When not working on comics or managing the con, James can generally be found fussing with his comic collection and vintage toys while blaring 80's new wave records at full volume.</p>

<p>This issue has already been scripted and completed by Jacob Coppock. The art itself is almost complete. Emanuel Sotomayor has proven to be quick and reliable in his attention to art and speed, and has already begun to work hard at completing the last half of the book during the course of our campaign.

We are expected to launch without issues, however it's possible, while unlikely, that printing or shipping issues could still arise and the book could be delayed. In the case that this happens, backers will be notified and given updates on the reasons for the delay.

STANDARD COVER
 
What is Doctor Mars?
Verdant Comics returns with the follow up to our first successful campaign, Doctor Mars #1! Serving as the launch series for our interconnected universe, this first volume focuses on the story of doctor Adam Albert, who, at the conclusion of the first issue, not only inherited the galaxy, but also the responsibilities that come with protecting it. Wielding both the power of a god and the light to guide him, Doctor Mars must learn what it takes to protect our realm from a threat steadfast on taking it. 
For those of you just finding us for the first time, the first issue also saw Doctor Mars uncovering a long-buried threat, a race of ancient alien parasites with the unique ability to not only inherit your physical features, but your memories as well. And when the first of these parasites finally reveals his own face, Adam Albert must learn what it truly means to face one's inner demons. 
 
Who are we? 
We are Verdant Comics, an independent publisher looking to launch the second entry in our very own shared universe! With plans to grow our roster of interconnected characters, we are also beginning the early stages of launching our own original, animated series! 
 
Meet the team! 
Jacob Coppock (creator and writer) founded Verdant Comics as a platform to further his passion as a writer as well as utilize his talents to produce high quality, interconnected stories that he hopes will someday redefine industry standards. You can find him on Instagram and Twitter at @jakemakescomics.
James Garman (creator and editor) co-founded Verdant Comics after his experience in helping introduce Handsome Devil Comics’ Fantasy Killer to the masses lent its hand in understanding what independent comics are really all about. You can find him on Instagram and Twitter at @jamesmakescomics.
Emanuel “Eman!” Sotomayor (artist) is an illustrator, comic book, and storyboard artist who’s worked in the industry for companies such as Creature Entertainment, YouTube horror channel Crypt TV, Frameworks Artists Agency, and recently was brought on by Verdant Comics as a penciler and inker for Doctor Mars #1. He enjoys spending his days drawing and eating pizza. You can find him on Instagram at @e_man_arts.
Danny Faubricio Sànchez Chaves (colorist) is a Costa Rica based colorist. He has studied graphic design and began his career as assistant flatter. His career took off when he became involved with Boom Studios for the comic, Smackdown 20th Anniversary. You can find him on Instagram at @dannyfsch.
James Dufendach (letterer) wears many hats. He is the editor, letterer, and PR guy over at independent comic publisher PLB comics and is also the coordinator of the Ocean City Comic Con. His credits include lettering, editing, writing, and coloring credits on over fourteen issues with PLB Comics, lettering on American Mythology's Stargate Atlantis: Hearts & Minds, as well as many credits on a wide variety of independent projects. When not working on comics or managing the con, James can generally be found fussing with his comic collection and vintage toys while blaring 80's new wave records at full volume.
 
Take a look inside! 





With pleasantries out of the way, let's show you a closer look on what you can expect to find in the second issue with these randomly selected pages!  
We are also excited to reveal that we will again be releasing with two exclusive, limited print variants! These come in their own tiers - or, you can take home a bundle with both variants+ the standard cover in our ALL COVERS tier!
On that note, our first variant comes from interior artist Emanuel Sotomayor!

<br/>Pieces Project</h2><p>The idea for Pieces was conceived in 2006. It was to be an internal project addressed to the members of IllustrateYourself - an on-line gallery promoting young illustrators I had been running. I believed that the form of a graphic novel would create an opportunity for an exciting, creative dialogue between entirely different personalities. The project was to involve representatives of various arts, not only cartoonists. As the story grew, its local character changed. Over the years, more than 200 artists from 39 countries have contributed their artworks, co-creating two unpredictable stories.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598704604/z6ur07obdgua2w4h6mkt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598704634/z3hn1a8jaxjxbpzfqmmu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2>
<br/>Creative Process </h2><p>Pieces Project started with a panel (<strong>""piece""</strong>) depicting a group of characters in specific surroundings. The initial situation in which the characters were introduced served only as an excuse to further the story. Every next ""piece"" of the tale is sent to another artist involved in the project. Taking into account the previous panel, the artist draws the next part providing his/ her style to the overall story. Every artist has the opportunity of leaving their own impact on the whole body of the work; by adding new characters, slowing down or speeding up the action, etc. As the story progresses the protagonists and other characters can evolve, and the story itself may change - from being full of humour to a sombre, melancholic tale, to becoming a horror full of disturbing imagery. The outcome is only limited by the participants’ imagination. The artist that will receive the last part will have a chance to create the conclusion and finish the story.

What started as a fun, creative exercise dedicated to close friends sharing a passion for illustration, has become an international project introducing different artistic perceptions. Today, we need your help to take the final step: to publish “Pieces Project - Pieces Book 2”.
Contributing ArtistsPieces 2, similarly to its first edition, has provided a unique platform for creative collaboration between artists. The story has been imagined and brought to life by not only comic creatorsbut illustrators, graphic designers, animators, painters, street artists, sculptors, printmakers. For some, this was the first-ever opportunity to express themselves through comic art. Each of the artists involved was asked to prepare only ONE ""piece"" (comic book panel). Each of the artists involved was asked to decide where the story should go next.      ---The full creative process has been explained below.
Countries involvedPieces 2: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Botswana, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Denmark, England, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Latvia, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Romania, Russia, Scotland, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United States of America, Wales  The StoryPieces 2 will take you on a quest for the Golden Egg. An exciting journey filled with monsters, mega-birds, werewolves, flying cats, witches, and skeletons.
Unconventional TechniquesSome of the ""pieces"" are highly original in their form and style. Techniques such as 3D rendering, embroidery, sculpting, painting, and building with LEGO bricks were incorporated.
Extras ""Pieces Project - Pieces Book 2"" will include short biographies/ information about the artists, ideas for the continuation of the ""pieces"" they created, photos from behind the scenes, additional sketches & illustrations, and the alternative endings.
""The CROWD""Pieces 2 will bring you a one of a kind, collaborative illustration by 46 leading comic book artists. Inspired by the ""Where's Wally?"" concept, the splash-page artwork will invite you to engage in the search for the Golden Egg hidden among over 1000 characters.
Endings by Established ArtistsThe book will include alternative endings by established artists, exhibited by prominent museums and galleries around the world. (e.g. Sun Xun, Abdul-Rahman Abdullah, Joan Ross).sneak peek - the ending by Sun Xun - full artwork available in the book
Augmented RealityPieces 2 will leap into the future with a unique AR illustration. You will be invited to scan the artwork and explore enhanced visual experience. The ending has been cerated by Sutu - an author, illustrator, media artist and the founder of EyeJack (Augmented Reality company).
Specifications ""Pieces Project - Pieces Book 2"": A4 size / hardcover with spot UV / 100+ pages (approx. 120 pages - the final number will be known after finalising all translations, etc.).All of the graphics included in the presentation are mock-up designs; the final product might slightly vary.

Pieces ProjectThe idea for Pieces was conceived in 2006. It was to be an internal project addressed to the members of IllustrateYourself - an on-line gallery promoting young illustrators I had been running. I believed that the form of a graphic novel would create an opportunity for an exciting, creative dialogue between entirely different personalities. The project was to involve representatives of various arts, not only cartoonists. As the story grew, its local character changed. Over the years, more than 200 artists from 39 countries have contributed their artworks, co-creating two unpredictable stories.
Creative Process Pieces Project started with a panel (""piece"") depicting a group of characters in specific surroundings. The initial situation in which the characters were introduced served only as an excuse to further the story. Every next ""piece"" of the tale is sent to another artist involved in the project. Taking into account the previous panel, the artist draws the next part providing his/ her style to the overall story. Every artist has the opportunity of leaving their own impact on the whole body of the work; by adding new characters, slowing down or speeding up the action, etc. As the story progresses the protagonists and other characters can evolve, and the story itself may change - from being full of humour to a sombre, melancholic tale, to becoming a horror full of disturbing imagery. The outcome is only limited by the participants’ imagination. The artist that will receive the last part will have a chance to create the conclusion and finish the story. The result of the collaboration of many artistic minds and personalities is a diverse and unpredictable graphic story - a story that we could control only at its inception, at its first piece; a story that lives its own life. 
""Pieces Project - Pieces Book 1""The first edition of Pieces project was published in 2013.

What You Get
This is our biggest, boldest project yet! We have a HUGE GRAPHIC NOVEL in the works with seven individual stories by some of comics brightest talents!
“The Unfunny X-Cons: The Beginning”, a 10-page parody of the original Stan Lee and Jack Kirby 1963's X-Men #1 by Don Chin, Mark Lewis, Kurt Hathaway and Delfin Barral.  Professor Ex with his young prodigies Anglo, Beastie-Boy, Dumbkophs, Marvelous Girl, and Sno-Cone must defeat the evil plant-based villain Magnutto! Done in retro-aged color FX!

 
“X-Farce”, a complete 21-page adventure which was the first ever collaboration of Chin and Maus for Eclipse Comics in 1992. It was the best-selling black and white satire for that year, and was a parody of Rob Liefeld's X-Force #1.  X-Farce members Cable TV, Dominoze, Eightball, Shboom Shboom, Garferal, Fallenstar and Tonto must thwart the evil Mpuppet Liberation Force and their secret weapon, the all-pungent wise-cracking mutant known as Cesspool!  Story by Don Chin, art by Bill Maus, Bob Hanon and colored by Delfin Barral.

 ​

“The Newt Mutants” by Chin and Thad (Zen Intergalactic Ninja) Rhodes , lettered by Keith Gleason.  A short story in the artistic painted style of Bill Sienkiewicz about Young Amphibians with strange powers who were rejects from the Van Sciver Institute of New Jersey.
​
“Professor Ex: Auditions” by Mike (Nexus) Baron, Ted Helard and Barral.  The X-Cons must interview potential new hero recruits after mutant Hunger James ate himself. 

 

“The Overcomplicated And Completely Unnecessary Power-House of X” by Keith Gleason, Ian Waryanto and Anton Bandi.  The Professor has a chance encounter with Moira McMorbid and she shares her vision of an All-Mutant Island Nation known as Whackoa.  Gleason, Waryanto and Bandi are also the creative team behind “The Mighty Mascots”, a popular independent title  for Alterna Comics.
“WHAT IF…Other Comic Book Companies Had Mutants?” by Chin, Delfin Barral and Michael Grassia.  Asks the hypothetical question of The Unfunny X-Cons Creators Stan Wee and Vac Kirby if they they worked for publishers other than Marble Comics and came up with mutant heroes for them.  “It’s narrated by The Poacher, who is basically Elmer Fudd in space who likes to wuh-wuh-wuh watch from afar,” said Chin.
​“The X-Cons Meet The Infringers in Mission: Antarctica!” By Chin and Kurt Hathaway.  “We challenge the reader’s imagination in this short art-free story that has nothing but word balloons and sound effects”, said Chin.


We are hoping that this comic book's success will allow us to bring more fun, high-quality material to an ever-growing enthusiastic audience. It is our FIRST CROWDFUNDED endeavor and we hope to make it the first of many offerings for our fans!

Risks & Challenges

We are happy to report that 80% of this book's art and story are already completed! 
It's been a labor of love to bring the creative teams together and we are in a strong and confident position to see this book to the finish line and get it into your hands.
Our funding goal is minimal at $1,700 (we didn't quit our day jobs, lol) and we are feeling GREAT about being able to deliver this book to you on or before April 1, 2021. (No joke!) 

Best of all, most creators to the book have already been paid for their work. We are just awaiting what should be a mind-blowing variant cover #1B by ROB WILLIS & MATT YACKEY, and for a couple short stories to be illustrated, which should be done by the end of January 2021.

<p>Back in the summer of 2008 Ben was writing and drawing a back up for Ninja High School #'s 162-164 and asked me to  takeover writing the series after part 3 and so, a short while later I handed the completed script in. Sadly, the series never saw completion in the pages of Ninja High School as the series ended at # 175.  Fast Forward to  late 2015 and Ben &amp; Myself decided to do a 4 issue Mini-series and finally complete the series unfortunately, the comic market is a harsh Mistress and the series was cancelled after issue two due to low sales. Shortly thereafter I  heard from fans wanting to read the rest of the series so, decided to bring it directly to them  and the best way to do that was with a fundraising campaign.  Comics are not cheap to produce and it takes time to get the work done but, I was resolute in bringing the completed series to the fans that have supported us or those that just want to read a fun, exciting story set in the Ninja High School universe.</p>
<p>So, here we are. Indiegogo.  I hope you consider helping us bring out the complete Ninja High School : Ninjas VS Aliens TPB .Your support means the world to us.</p>

Thank you for spending the time to take a look at our newest Indiegogo campaign. Yes, we just completed fulfillment of the last COLORIZE Gold Digger campaign which got us through issue #25.  We've hit the halfway point!  Whew...it has been a journey, but thank you taking it with us. </p><p>If you're not familiar with us, my name is Joeming Dunn, and I run Antarctic Press, a small, independent comic company started in 1984. I have personally collected comics of almost every type and genre since 1974, and I can say that during the past 30 years, we have published some of the greatest and best independent comics out there. Our publishing history includes titles like <i>Gold Digger </i>and <i>Ninja High School</i>. The comic industry has changed over the years, so we have started this Indiegogo program to help introduce new projects from our talented group of creators. You may have seen some of our other successful and fulfilled campaigns.</p><p>Over the years, we have published a number of series. Prominent among these is Fred Perry's ingenious title, <i>Gold Digger</i>, which Fred describes as a mixture of <i>Indiana Jones</i> and <i>Final Fantasy</i>. The idea for <i>Gold Digger</i> was first conceived during Fred's tour of duty in the first Gulf War, and it debuted in Antarctic Press's anthology comic, <i>Mangazine</i>, in 1991. A four-issue miniseries followed in 1992, and a regular monthly black-and-white series followed starting in 1993. The current color series began in 1999 and has continued since then. It is the second-longest-running solo-created title in the industry, and the only second-longest-running female-lead comic series after <i>Wonder Woman</i>. In 2013, Fred was honored at Comic Con International in San Diego, where he received an Inkpot Award for his work on <i>Gold Digger</i>.</p><p> </p><p>One of our most frequently received fan requests over the years is, ""When can I see the original black-and-white series of <i>Gold Digger</i> in color?""</p><p> </p><p>Getting a book colored is not an easy proposition due to the cost and time involved, and both of those commodities are scarce in the independent publishing world.

So back in June of 2016, we ran the first part of this campaign, and thus far, we've been able to COLORIZE 25 ISSUES of the original 50-issue black-and-white series.  Here is a small sample of what's been done.

Thank you for spending the time to take a look at our newest Indiegogo campaign. Yes, we just completed fulfillment of the last COLORIZE Gold Digger campaign which got us through issue #25.  We've hit the halfway point!  Whew...it has been a journey, but thank you taking it with us. If you're not familiar with us, my name is Joeming Dunn, and I run Antarctic Press, a small, independent comic company started in 1984. I have personally collected comics of almost every type and genre since 1974, and I can say that during the past 30 years, we have published some of the greatest and best independent comics out there. Our publishing history includes titles like Gold Digger and Ninja High School. The comic industry has changed over the years, so we have started this Indiegogo program to help introduce new projects from our talented group of creators. You may have seen some of our other successful and fulfilled campaigns.Over the years, we have published a number of series. Prominent among these is Fred Perry's ingenious title, Gold Digger, which Fred describes as a mixture of Indiana Jones and Final Fantasy. The idea for Gold Digger was first conceived during Fred's tour of duty in the first Gulf War, and it debuted in Antarctic Press's anthology comic, Mangazine, in 1991. A four-issue miniseries followed in 1992, and a regular monthly black-and-white series followed starting in 1993. The current color series began in 1999 and has continued since then. It is the second-longest-running solo-created title in the industry, and the only second-longest-running female-lead comic series after Wonder Woman. In 2013, Fred was honored at Comic Con International in San Diego, where he received an Inkpot Award for his work on Gold Digger. One of our most frequently received fan requests over the years is, ""When can I see the original black-and-white series of Gold Digger in color?"" Getting a book colored is not an easy proposition due to the cost and time involved, and both of those commodities are scarce in the independent publishing world. But with crowdfunding, it is now possible to achieve that goal.

<p>Hi, everyone!</p>
<p>It's our very first time here, and we're excited to bring you Fairy Quest, our all-ages graphic novel series. Thanks to some good friends (including Billy Tucci, Brian Pulido, Dan Fraga and many others) running successful Indiegogo campaigns and waxing lyrical about how awesome you are, we honestly can't believe we hadn't come here before... so, let's remedy that right now! We hear there are lots of loyal backers who come to Indiegogo exclusively and we want to make sure everyone has a chance to read our series and love our books. Why Fairy Quest? Well, for one thing it looks like this:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598475632/st2uvxthabymgaywiitx.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>There are currently about 100 pages of that goodness, and we are writing and drawing 48 more pages of it for book 3.  You can see more about the story further down.</p>
<p>So, what about us - who are ""we?"" Well, I'm Paul Jenkins, the Eisner Award-Winning writer behind Fairy Quest. META Studios, my company, is Atlanta's only cross-media development and production house. Highlights of my career include creating <i>Wolverine: Origin</i> for Marvel as well as <i>The Sentry</i>. I also did a 6-year run on <i>Spider-Man</i>, I've written <i>Hulk, Batman, Avengers, Captain America</i>... pretty much every major character there is... and I just happen to love comics. I started my career with the <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>, and independent, creator-owned comics have always been my true love. I'm thrilled that crowdfunding allows us the chance to bring you the books you actually want, presented as a true collaboration between the fans and the creator. You guys are our publishers, and I truly appreciate that relationship. Creators should be able to give you what you ask for, not just react to some big marketing plan or crossover event.</p>
<p>The true talent is in our many amazing artists that have worked on Fairy Quest so far. <i><strong>Humberto Ramos</strong></i> is one of the world's most recognizable comic creators - he and I started Fairy Quest along with <i><strong>Leonardo Olea</strong></i>, our fantabulous colorist. We're now lucky enough to bring on the incredible <strong><i>Mike Bowden</i></strong> for the new chapter, but dang... we also have the most brilliant group of cover artists as well.  We have three special covers by <strong><i>Ale Garza</i></strong>, Limited Exclusive covers by <i><strong>Kevin Eastman</strong> </i>(co-creator of the <i>Ninja Turtles</i>), my old mate, <strong><i>Billy Tucci</i></strong> (author, <i>Shi</i>) and a beautiful additional cover by the wonderful <strong><i>Jill Thompson</i></strong>! We can't wait to show you all of that stuff as we go along.</p>
<p>We wanted to make sure there are some Indiegogo exclusives as well - check out our T-Shirt, which is only available here. We have a really beautiful print by one of the best people alive: Jennifer L. Meyer (check out her many bunnies on <a href=""https://twitter.com/JenniferLMeyer%C2%A0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> if you want to put yourself in a good mood). And as you would expect, we really want to bring out some stretch goals and give away free stuff, so hang onto that thought as I tell you about our story...<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597955628/genhxbdtt8s72mhedumj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We'll show you a ton more art as we go along, including finished art and cover sketches, as well as behind-the-scenes work. In short, we really want to make this a cool, easy, unforgettable project for everyone. To jazz you up a little more, here are a few of the cover images:</p>

<p>Let's build this thing together!<br/><br/><strong>QUALITY</strong></p>

</div></div>","Hi, everyone!
It's our very first time here, and we're excited to bring you Fairy Quest, our all-ages graphic novel series. Thanks to some good friends (including Billy Tucci, Brian Pulido, Dan Fraga and many others) running successful Indiegogo campaigns and waxing lyrical about how awesome you are, we honestly can't believe we hadn't come here before... so, let's remedy that right now! We hear there are lots of loyal backers who come to Indiegogo exclusively and we want to make sure everyone has a chance to read our series and love our books. Why Fairy Quest? Well, for one thing it looks like this:

There are currently about 100 pages of that goodness, and we are writing and drawing 48 more pages of it for book 3.  You can see more about the story further down.
So, what about us - who are ""we?"" Well, I'm Paul Jenkins, the Eisner Award-Winning writer behind Fairy Quest. META Studios, my company, is Atlanta's only cross-media development and production house. Highlights of my career include creating Wolverine: Origin for Marvel as well as The Sentry. I also did a 6-year run on Spider-Man, I've written Hulk, Batman, Avengers, Captain America... pretty much every major character there is... and I just happen to love comics. I started my career with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and independent, creator-owned comics have always been my true love. I'm thrilled that crowdfunding allows us the chance to bring you the books you actually want, presented as a true collaboration between the fans and the creator. You guys are our publishers, and I truly appreciate that relationship. Creators should be able to give you what you ask for, not just react to some big marketing plan or crossover event.
The true talent is in our many amazing artists that have worked on Fairy Quest so far. Humberto Ramos is one of the world's most recognizable comic creators - he and I started Fairy Quest along with Leonardo Olea, our fantabulous colorist. We're now lucky enough to bring on the incredible Mike Bowden for the new chapter, but dang... we also have the most brilliant group of cover artists as well.  We have three special covers by Ale Garza, Limited Exclusive covers by Kevin Eastman (co-creator of the Ninja Turtles), my old mate, Billy Tucci (author, Shi) and a beautiful additional cover by the wonderful Jill Thompson! We can't wait to show you all of that stuff as we go along.
We wanted to make sure there are some Indiegogo exclusives as well - check out our T-Shirt, which is only available here. We have a really beautiful print by one of the best people alive: Jennifer L. Meyer (check out her many bunnies on Twitter if you want to put yourself in a good mood). And as you would expect, we really want to bring out some stretch goals and give away free stuff, so hang onto that thought as I tell you about our story...
We'll show you a ton more art as we go along, including finished art and cover sketches, as well as behind-the-scenes work. In short, we really want to make this a cool, easy, unforgettable project for everyone. To jazz you up a little more, here are a few of the cover images:
Main cover to Fairy Quest #3 by Humberto Ramos and Leo Olea
New Variant cover to Fairy Quest #3 by Mike Bowden and Leo Olea
Variant Cover to Fairy Quest #2 by Billy Tucci
Variant Cover for Fairy Quest #1 by Alé Garza
So, let me say a special THANK YOU to all current and future Fablewood fans. We know we are making a book that you can pass down to many future generations of your family. As we go, we will always be here to answer any questions on the message board or at our email address: fairyquesthelp@gmail.com. If you have any ideas, questions, problems (heaven forbid!) or just want to shoot the breeze, please write to us in either place and our crack team of email ninjas will get right back to you.
Let's build this thing together!QUALITY
Quite aside from the story and art, we want to make sure our book is of the highest quality; a prized possession that we can all keep in our bookshelves for many years to come, which can be passed down to future generations. Check out the embossing and spot UV varnish!

In 1996, after a period being typecast as an artist for comics oriented to young children, Conner became the lead artist for <strong><i>Vampirella</i></strong> at the height of the ""bad girl"" trend. She capped off Tom Sniegoski's beloved run by concluding the original <strong><i>Vengeance of Vampirella</i></strong> series and the hyped-up death of the character. Chronicling the expected resurrection and proceeding blockbuster relaunch, Amanda became to many the next definitive artist of the character at the time, following Jose Gonzalez from decades prior.

In 1996, after a period being typecast as an artist for comics oriented to young children, Conner became the lead artist for Vampirella at the height of the ""bad girl"" trend. She capped off Tom Sniegoski's beloved run by concluding the original Vengeance of Vampirella series and the hyped-up death of the character. Chronicling the expected resurrection and proceeding blockbuster relaunch, Amanda became to many the next definitive artist of the character at the time, following Jose Gonzalez from decades prior.

<h3>Welcome to the Ultraluminals Universe!</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Gisele and I've been in the comic book business for roughly 2 decades. I've done interiors and/or cover work for Dynamite, Udon, IDW, Archie Comics and Marvel. I've also created many webcomics over the years, Ménage à 3 being the most popular one. Since 2009, I've been publishing creator-owned work under my publishing company, Pixie Trix Comix. In the last 3 years or so, my collaborators and I started building this superhero universe, and have created 5 series in this universe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultraluminals (the superhero team of the universe)</li>
<li>Incredibelle</li>
<li>Nightgale</li>
<li>Infernica Sinn</li>
<li>Carmen Chamelia</li>
</ul>
<p>In previous crowdfunding campaigns, focused on my webcomic series, we were able to fund a few comic book issues in this universe via stretch goals. With that said, we never did a true campaign for these properties. I'm hoping this campaign brings more attention to them. Ideally, each property would get its own campaign, but to simplify things for myself here, I'm starting with a combined campaign. Any future issues for each series will get its own campaign in the future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where Will the Funds Go?</h3>
<p>Since we've already gotten SOME funds via stretch goals in a very recent crowdfunding campaign for my Pixie Trix Comix webcomic series (yes, I use the publishing name for a webcomic series as well, sort of like Archie prints Archie!) we're not asking for much funds here. This campaign is more to supplement our current funds, and we're hoping that if it does well here, we can immediately start work on more issues. For now, <strong>the funds will help with the production and printing costs of these comic book issues:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Ultraluminals Issue #2</strong> (Issue #1 included in this campaign)</li>
<li><strong>Infernica Sinn Issue #1</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Incredibelle: Galactic Delights One-Shot #2</strong> (one-shot #1 available in this campaign)</li>
<li>
<strong>Carmen Chamelia: Bio(nique) Hazard One-Shot #4</strong> (one-shot 1 to 3 available as well)</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Technonaut Revolution</h3>
<p>Greeting fans!  The Technonaut Revolution is a high fantasy, industrial punk setting, with cosmic horror leanings, that follows The Pax Anti Daemus.  This is an elite investigation unit charged with hunting down and destroying demons on the mythical world of Ieo.  Think ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" but with magic.  A 1930-1940 'art deco' theme, classic dark noir style, not entirely unlike Film Noir, but with wizards, monsters, and demons.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603913340/e5spm37zydzjxn6odsqq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This is a world where magic and enchantments have become common, taking the place of technology and stunting social progress.  The story (originally published through Madness Heart Press) surrounds the massive city-state of Cordoba.  Inside the walls of Cordoba, the citizens live in fantastic plenty.  Outside the walls, the non-citizens live in abject squalor.  Here, a new unit of the Pax has been formed to investigate a possible lycanthrope.  This would normally be a simple job for the Pax, but through this they uncover an otherworldly conspiracy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603913444/dklfrrkulko9c5ja6mat.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The serial is already up to its 9th issue, but we think it deserves to be a comic!  If successful, we will do a full run of the entire serial, which looks like it will top out at 20-25 issues.  Finally, we plan to do the whole thing eventually as a graphic novel.</p>
<p>But to get there WE NEED YOU!!!  As you can tell from the video, we tried Kickstarter and failed to reach our goal.  SO!... We are starting over here on Indiegogo.  Please consider being a contributor. Many thanks for your support! </p>
<p>~Reed Alexander</p> <h3>Who is Reed Alexander?</h3>
<p>I'm a horror writer from the Capital Region, NY.  My writings deal in the horrific, bizarre, and macabre.</p>
<p>The Technonaut Revolution is the first thing I wrote that is purposefully, and specifically for the LGTBQAI community.  In fact, the serial has been free and open to trans and nonbinary individuals.</p>
<p>For this serial, I made two promises which I've carried through my writing career as a whole.</p>
<p>1) I will always fight to be as inclusive as possible with my writing. Real life is a diverse place and I have made a commitment to representing the true diversity of our world. My stories will always include individuals of a diverse cast of ethnicity, nationality, sexuality, gender, and disability. I aim for full and proper representation of all people including the LGTBQAI.</p>
<p>2) I will do everything in my power to assure these groups are represented properly by working with advocates from these communities.</p>
<p>The Technonaut Revolution has been an extremely important project to me as it deeply involves social issues I hold very dear.  These are issues of equality, both social, and economic.  Most importantly, I wanted to give all my LGTBQAI friends something that was specifically theirs, and theirs alone.  I'm openly Pansexual, and I wanted this serial to properly represent me, as well as all of my friends, in a way they could be proud.</p>
<p>Even if you just sling me a dollar for this project, it means the world to me.  It validates me as a person and as an artist.  It might just be one dollar, but to me, it's everything.</p>
<p>~Reed Alexander</p> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our first major hurdle is paying the artist.  The current price tag is $2200, at $100 for 22 pages of pencil, ink, and lettering.</p>
<p>I'm also budgeting $200 for the cover art in full color and $100 for two full pages of art. </p>
<p>We'll also need about $300 for printing services and another $300 for shipping/handling globally</p>
<p>I've already paid out about $300 for test pages and rough drafts.</p>
<p><u><strong>In total</strong></u>: I'm asking for a modest $3000 which might just about break me even if I'm lucky.</p>

</div></div>","The Technonaut Revolution
Greeting fans!  The Technonaut Revolution is a high fantasy, industrial punk setting, with cosmic horror leanings, that follows The Pax Anti Daemus.  This is an elite investigation unit charged with hunting down and destroying demons on the mythical world of Ieo.  Think ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,"" but with magic.  A 1930-1940 'art deco' theme, classic dark noir style, not entirely unlike Film Noir, but with wizards, monsters, and demons.
This is a world where magic and enchantments have become common, taking the place of technology and stunting social progress.  The story (originally published through Madness Heart Press) surrounds the massive city-state of Cordoba.  Inside the walls of Cordoba, the citizens live in fantastic plenty.  Outside the walls, the non-citizens live in abject squalor.  Here, a new unit of the Pax has been formed to investigate a possible lycanthrope.  This would normally be a simple job for the Pax, but through this they uncover an otherworldly conspiracy.

The serial is already up to its 9th issue, but we think it deserves to be a comic!  If successful, we will do a full run of the entire serial, which looks like it will top out at 20-25 issues.  Finally, we plan to do the whole thing eventually as a graphic novel.
But to get there WE NEED YOU!!!  As you can tell from the video, we tried Kickstarter and failed to reach our goal.  SO!... We are starting over here on Indiegogo.  Please consider being a contributor. Many thanks for your support! 
~Reed Alexander Who is Reed Alexander?
I'm a horror writer from the Capital Region, NY.  My writings deal in the horrific, bizarre, and macabre.
The Technonaut Revolution is the first thing I wrote that is purposefully, and specifically for the LGTBQAI community.  In fact, the serial has been free and open to trans and nonbinary individuals.
For this serial, I made two promises which I've carried through my writing career as a whole.
1) I will always fight to be as inclusive as possible with my writing. Real life is a diverse place and I have made a commitment to representing the true diversity of our world. My stories will always include individuals of a diverse cast of ethnicity, nationality, sexuality, gender, and disability. I aim for full and proper representation of all people including the LGTBQAI.
2) I will do everything in my power to assure these groups are represented properly by working with advocates from these communities.
The Technonaut Revolution has been an extremely important project to me as it deeply involves social issues I hold very dear.  These are issues of equality, both social, and economic.  Most importantly, I wanted to give all my LGTBQAI friends something that was specifically theirs, and theirs alone.  I'm openly Pansexual, and I wanted this serial to properly represent me, as well as all of my friends, in a way they could be proud.
Even if you just sling me a dollar for this project, it means the world to me.  It validates me as a person and as an artist.  It might just be one dollar, but to me, it's everything.
~Reed Alexander What We Need
Our first major hurdle is paying the artist.  The current price tag is $2200, at $100 for 22 pages of pencil, ink, and lettering.
I'm also budgeting $200 for the cover art in full color and $100 for two full pages of art. 
We'll also need about $300 for printing services and another $300 for shipping/handling globally
I've already paid out about $300 for test pages and rough drafts.
In total: I'm asking for a modest $3000 which might just about break me even if I'm lucky.

<p>Disgraced ex-cop, Conrad, seeks redemption by unraveling an unsolved murder during Southern California's fire season. Connie follows a lone clue—a discarded crucifix—to unravel the death of Karen Littleton, whose body was found amid a blaze that scorched 10,000 acres. The search leads Connie to clash with the victim's father and prime suspect, Robert Littleton, as well as hostile former colleagues on the local police force. All the while, Conrad combats his consuming alcoholism and fading faculties.</p>

<p>We're confident that you'll love this book as much as we do. But why take our word for it? </p>
<ul><li> <strong>“<i>Blacking Out</i> is as dark as the smoky California skies that fill its pages. And like smoke, this noir clings to you. Redemptive, surprising, &amp; bleak.”</strong> - Brian Azzarello, <i>100 Bullets, Moonshine </i>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li> <strong>“A tasty comics noir for your lockdown reading. A fast-paced page turner that really delivers.”</strong> - Derf Backderf, <i>My Friend Dahmer, Kent State</i> </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong> “A compelling story that moves like a rocket and artwork that’s stunning. When is award season, again?”</strong> - Mark Waid, <i>Kingdom Come, Irredeemable </i>

<strong> “Start with the inky atmospheric drawings. Take the narrative familiars: bad cop seeking redemption, small town with big secrets, people wanting what they can’t have. Toss them in the spin cycle.” </strong>- Betsy Willeford</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<strong><i>Blacking Out</i>, by Mosher and Krause, is a lovely fire-scorched brick to the head, in the Sweaty Noir tradition of <i>Hell or High Water</i> and <i>Dragged Across Concrete</i>. It takes place in one of the tired old ‘boom that went bust’ desert towns of the American heartland (California in this case) where it’s always 110 degrees in the shade, and most of the heart died long ago. There’s a murder that needs to be solved before all are forced to evacuate from the wild fires moving in on the town. It’s the fiction of regret, guilt and disenchantment, lacking any hint of fantasy, and even much in the way of kindness. If you liked <i>Left On Missio</i>n, you already know no one does this kind of hardscrabble tale better. It’s the story of a fallen cop, taking his one last boozy shot at redemption, and did I mention it’s very good? </strong>- Bill Willingham, <i>Fables</i>

<h2>Why the oversized hardcover format?</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592193241/gy5nszyaths0r5fblmsk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Having the privilege to attend the Angoulême International Comics Festival in France this past decade, writer and co-creator Chip Mosher has not only fallen in love with the oversized European hardcover format (~12.5"" x 9.5""), but also the creative aesthetic of what the French call bande dessinée or BD. Whereas American comics release on a monthly basis and demand tight deadlines, the standard 48 page BD album is drawn over 6 months or longer, allowing the creators to spread their wings and put their best work forward. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<ul><li>
<strong> “<i>Blacking Out</i> is a hard drinking, hard boiled mystery with a finale that lands like a ton of bricks—do not miss it</strong>.<strong>”</strong>  - Gerry Duggan, <i>Dead Eyes, Deadpool, Marauders </i>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>With this approach in mind, co-creator and artist Peter Krause worked on BLACKING OUT over several years, toiling over each page to create a tight 56-page graphic novel. (<i>Note: Chip needed some extra pages, so not keeping it to the standard French 48-page standard is his fault! - Pete.</i>) Working ""Marvel-style"" (the writer providing the artist a script with no panel breakdowns), Peter was able to exercise complete artistic control over the pacing of the story, a rarity in American comics. Chip then followed with a final lettering draft after Peter finished drawing all of the pages. This creative process ensured a deep collaboration between writer and artist... true co-creators in every sense.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul><li> <strong>""<i>Blacking Out </i>is a taut, nasty thriller about people you don't want to know, but will love watching. The slow burn (pun intended) leads to a gut punch that will leave you reeling. Well-done.”</strong> -Marc Andreyko, <i>Supergirl, Manhunter, Torso </i>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Ed Dukeshire then lettered the project with <i>Scalped</i> alumnus Giulia Brusco providing colors. Finally, Tom Muller designed the logo and the cover, working directly with Peter. In the spirit of the project, each contributor was guaranteed as much time needed to provide their best work.</p>
<p>In total, the team spent more than three full years creating this graphic novel. No expense was spared, no shortcuts were taken. This graphic novel was crafted without compromise; an unrushed, immaculately sculpted book with few peers. </p>

<h2><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Lobby Cards</span></h2>
<p>The BLACKING OUT crowdfunding campaign allows Chip and Peter to celebrate the traditions of film noir by offering 12 cinematic lobby cards from today's most acclaimed artists, with a special card drawn by Peter himself. Lobby cards are miniature movie posters used to promote films in the lobbies of theaters in Hollywood's golden era. Noir films historically offered some of the most vivid imagery of the medium, inspiring this reward tier. Chip and Peter reached out to some of today's greatest comic artists to provide their interpretations of scenes within BLACKING OUT. These artists include:</p>
<p><strong>Francesco Francavilla (<i>Afterlife with Archie</i>), Eduardo Risso (<i>Moonshine</i>), Mirka Andolfo (<i>Mercy</i>), Dan Panosian (<i>Slots</i>), Emma Ríos (<i>Pretty Deadly</i>), Jacob Phillips (<i>That Texas Blood</i>), Patric Reynolds (<i>The Mask</i>), Ryan Kelly (<i>Saucer Country</i>), Jamal Igle (<i>The Wrong Earth</i>), Elise McCall (<i>Spy Island</i>) and Peter Krause.</strong></p>
<p> Our lobby cards will be a smidge smaller than the book (~12.5"" x 9.5"").</p>
<p>Each lobby card will be printed on card stock and sized to ship within the book to ensure delivery in perfect condition. Additionally, backers can opt for a tier of ""naked"" versions of the lobby cards, sans any kind of BLACKING OUT branding. This tier includes a special card drawn by Peter Krause and colored by Jacob Phillips.</p>

Bottom line for backers: 
9/1/2021 - UPDATE
Well, that's all folks. If you missed getting the book here, then come find us at conventions to purchase one or contact these local comic shops that supported us at the retail level and may still have a copy or two left -- Comic VS Toys in US, The Dragon in Canada or Traveling Man in the UK. The last five orders go out this week and we're focused on our next release. More about that later!  Thanks, as always, for your support!
 
6/23/2021 - UPDATE
As of this date, we have 62 copies of the book left. We continue to send orders out every week. We're going to continue to leave this open for a bit and see how it goes.  Thanks for your support!
 
4/5/2021 - UPDATE
As of this date, we have 68 copies of the book left. We continue to send orders out every week. Given that we've sold 14 copies in a month, we're going to leave this open for a bit and see how it goes.  Thanks for your support!
3/17/2021 - UPDATE
As of today, we have 82 copies of the book left. We continue to send orders out every week. We're going to try and sell through this entire set by the end of March. At that point, we'll most likely call it a day and hang up this project to focus on the next one.
2/22/2021 - UPDATE
With fulfillment basically done for all backers on Kickstarter and IGG, we've decided to offer the last 100 copies for sale of the book. So for those that missed this the first time, these are the last 100 copies of the print run of 1,000. Pete and I have ~100 some copies stashed away, but those will only be sold at shows or maybe as a special incentive for future crowdfunding. So basically what i'm saying... when these are gone. They are basically gone.
We'll look to ship these out within 30 days or less from your order.
8/1/2020 - UPDATE: 
We've basically closed up shop so we can focus on fulfillment of orders in hand. If you still want a hardcover copy of the book, we are making that available for a premium price as these will come out of the limited supply of overprints we do. All the other tiers are printed to order and are in process. 

The graphic novel is complete and we have met our crowdfunding goal on another platform and are giving IndieGogo community a chance to get their hands on this book. A digital version of the book will be sent to you when the IndieGogo is complete!  Every tier with a reward will get the book! With the exception of the retailer tier, every tier 50 bucks or more will get the printed signed and numbered book, the main Lobby Card set, the digital bundle and the unlocked stretch goals. Higher priced tiers get more!  We unlocked up through the $40K stretch goal and are excited to unlock more... see below!

What's The Story...?  
Chip and Peter discuss Peter's contribution in detail during this special video shot a month after the main one, as Pete was not able to make it to Los Angeles.
 

 
 
Disgraced ex-cop, Conrad, seeks redemption by unraveling an unsolved murder during Southern California's fire season. Connie follows a lone clue—a discarded crucifix—to unravel the death of Karen Littleton, whose body was found amid a blaze that scorched 10,000 acres. The search leads Connie to clash with the victim's father and prime suspect, Robert Littleton, as well as hostile former colleagues on the local police force. All the while, Conrad combats his consuming alcoholism and fading faculties.

We're confident that you'll love this book as much as we do. But why take our word for it? 
 “Blacking Out is as dark as the smoky California skies that fill its pages. And like smoke, this noir clings to you. Redemptive, surprising, & bleak.” - Brian Azzarello, 100 Bullets, Moonshine 

 
 “A tasty comics noir for your lockdown reading. A fast-paced page turner that really delivers.” - Derf Backderf, My Friend Dahmer, Kent State 
 

 “A compelling story that moves like a rocket and artwork that’s stunning. When is award season, again?” - Mark Waid, Kingdom Come, Irredeemable 

​

 “Start with the inky atmospheric drawings. Take the narrative familiars: bad cop seeking redemption, small town with big secrets, people wanting what they can’t have. Toss them in the spin cycle.” - Betsy Willeford
 

Blacking Out, by Mosher and Krause, is a lovely fire-scorched brick to the head, in the Sweaty Noir tradition of Hell or High Water and Dragged Across Concrete. It takes place in one of the tired old ‘boom that went bust’ desert towns of the American heartland (California in this case) where it’s always 110 degrees in the shade, and most of the heart died long ago. There’s a murder that needs to be solved before all are forced to evacuate from the wild fires moving in on the town. It’s the fiction of regret, guilt and disenchantment, lacking any hint of fantasy, and even much in the way of kindness. If you liked Left On Mission, you already know no one does this kind of hardscrabble tale better. It’s the story of a fallen cop, taking his one last boozy shot at redemption, and did I mention it’s very good? - Bill Willingham, Fables

 
Why the oversized hardcover format?

Having the privilege to attend the Angoulême International Comics Festival in France this past decade, writer and co-creator Chip Mosher has not only fallen in love with the oversized European hardcover format (~12.5"" x 9.5""), but also the creative aesthetic of what the French call bande dessinée or BD. Whereas American comics release on a monthly basis and demand tight deadlines, the standard 48 page BD album is drawn over 6 months or longer, allowing the creators to spread their wings and put their best work forward. 
 


 “Blacking Out is a hard drinking, hard boiled mystery with a finale that lands like a ton of bricks—do not miss it.”  - Gerry Duggan, Dead Eyes, Deadpool, Marauders 

 
With this approach in mind, co-creator and artist Peter Krause worked on BLACKING OUT over several years, toiling over each page to create a tight 56-page graphic novel. (Note: Chip needed some extra pages, so not keeping it to the standard French 48-page standard is his fault! - Pete.) Working ""Marvel-style"" (the writer providing the artist a script with no panel breakdowns), Peter was able to exercise complete artistic control over the pacing of the story, a rarity in American comics. Chip then followed with a final lettering draft after Peter finished drawing all of the pages. This creative process ensured a deep collaboration between writer and artist... true co-creators in every sense.
 
 ""Blacking Out is a taut, nasty thriller about people you don't want to know, but will love watching. The slow burn (pun intended) leads to a gut punch that will leave you reeling. Well-done.” -Marc Andreyko, Supergirl, Manhunter, Torso 

 
Ed Dukeshire then lettered the project with Scalped alumnus Giulia Brusco providing colors. Finally, Tom Muller designed the logo and the cover, working directly with Peter. In the spirit of the project, each contributor was guaranteed as much time needed to provide their best work.
In total, the team spent more than three full years creating this graphic novel. No expense was spared, no shortcuts were taken. This graphic novel was crafted without compromise; an unrushed, immaculately sculpted book with few peers. 

(Letterer Ed Dukeshire crafted hand-drawn, custom balloons and manipulated fonts for word mood and emphasis.) 
 

“Hardcore characters in search for what they can’t name on a road they shouldn’t travel. A gut punch of crime fiction by Mosher and Krause.” -Gary Phillips, The Be-Bop Barbarians 

​

(Giulia Brusco's amazing color work on one of Chip and Peter's favorite pages.)
 

 “The writing is sharp like a razor, the sort of sharp that you don’t feel when it cuts you. It’s only when you see the blood begin to pool that you realize that you’re reading a really good book.” - Shannon Wheeler, Too Much Coffee Man, The New Yorker 

 
Digital Rewards
With the book completed, a PDF of BLACKING OUT will be immediately available to those who backed tiers including a digital copy of the book; all backers who receive any digital reward will immediately be able to read BLACKING OUT as soon as the IndieGoGo complete.

There are two additional digital items available: the Blacking Out Photo Reference PDF and a PDF of Chip's previous graphic novel, Left On Mission, co-created and drawn by Francesco Francavilla.
While writing BLACKING OUT, Chip Mosher took numerous pictures to serve as inspiration for the book. Traveling around Southern California, Chip took pictures of active forest fires in and outside Los Angeles and he then created collages of places that he imagined would serve as the setting for BLACKING OUT. This PDF served as inspiration for the art and coloring of the final work.

As a special bonus, Chip Mosher’s previous graphic novel with co-creator Francesco Francavilla, Left On Mission —which debuted in 2008, and is currently OOP — is included digitally within certain most tiers. Left On Mission recently reverted to co-creators Chip and Francesco, who are excited to get this critically acclaimed, but little seen, work in the hands of more people. 

Chip and Peter wish to thank Francesco for letting them include Left On Mission as part of this crowdfunding campaign.

The Lobby Cards
The BLACKING OUT crowdfunding campaign allows Chip and Peter to celebrate the traditions of film noir by offering 12 cinematic lobby cards from today's most acclaimed artists, with a special card drawn by Peter himself. Lobby cards are miniature movie posters used to promote films in the lobbies of theaters in Hollywood's golden era. Noir films historically offered some of the most vivid imagery of the medium, inspiring this reward tier. Chip and Peter reached out to some of today's greatest comic artists to provide their interpretations of scenes within BLACKING OUT. These artists include:
Francesco Francavilla (Afterlife with Archie), Eduardo Risso (Moonshine), Mirka Andolfo (Mercy), Dan Panosian (Slots), Emma Ríos (Pretty Deadly), Jacob Phillips (That Texas Blood), Patric Reynolds (The Mask), Ryan Kelly (Saucer Country), Jamal Igle (The Wrong Earth), Elise McCall (Spy Island) and Peter Krause.
 Our lobby cards will be a smidge smaller than the book (~12.5"" x 9.5"").
Each lobby card will be printed on card stock and sized to ship within the book to ensure delivery in perfect condition. Additionally, backers can opt for a tier of ""naked"" versions of the lobby cards, sans any kind of BLACKING OUT branding. This tier includes a special card drawn by Peter Krause and colored by Jacob Phillips.

<h3>HOW WAS WART THE WIZARD CREATED?</h3>
<p>Years ago when my daughter was younger, I would read to her every night at bedtime. Hundreds and hundreds of stories later, when it seemed like there was almost nothing left to read, she demanded a custom tale and Wart The Wizard was born! Night after night, when most children were already asleep, we'd stay up late laughing and joking about Wart's misfortune, and agreed that EVERYONE has a little bit of Wart The Wizard inside of them. He's the humor we find when things are sometimes at their worst, and the proof that anyone can overcome life's challenges if you look within yourself and dare to dream.</p>
<h3>IS WART THE WIZARD A CHILDREN'S BOOK?</h3>
<p>No! Wart The Wizard is a fun, adventure-filled tale that is age-appropriate for EVERYONE! The humor and content is similar to that of Big Hero 6, Shrek, Discworld, Monty Python, The Black Cauldron, and other Disney/Pixar films!</p>
<p>Adults will enjoy Wart's quirkiness, personality, and frequent nostalgic references while kids will love the antics, characters, jokes, and more!</p>

<p>We are the Brothers Bieser: Scott (cartoonist) and Frank (website/business manager and bon vivant), a pair of crazy Texans who've been producing web-comics under the Big Head Press banner since 2003, beginning with _A Drug War Carol_ (with Susan W. Wells) and the Prometheus award winning _The Probability Broach: The Graphic Novel (with L. Neil Smith).<br/><br/>We're also part of the Free Cosmos Project. (More about that later.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The success of this campaign will weigh greatly on whether the QUANTUM VIBE series will continue. Scott's getting old and is tired of surviving on oatmeal and peanut-butter sandwiches. If this doesn't pan out he'll have to give up his life-long dream of cartooning for a living, and go back to working at call-centers.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The art is done. We've published several books already but this will be the first using this printer. While Mixam comes highly recommended, when working with a printer for the first time, there can be some hiccups, but nothing that should cause more than a few weeks' delay.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know times are challenging for many of us and you might want to contribute but can't swing $25 for a book.

He emerges from his secret lair only when his watery home is in danger from outsiders. Or when he has to make a run to the bait shop to pick up groceries. Frankly, getting him off his couch is kind of a challenge most of the time.</p><p>Lazy and careless, Oddity is given strange powers and chosen by the spirit of the swamp to act as it's guardian and caretaker. It's a role he accepts reluctantly, and performs thoughtlessly. This dereliction of duty causes him to accidentally unleash monsters on the swamp and the local town. With the help of his mentor, a giant Housefly named Errow, and a local grad student with a dark past, Oddity must learn to embrace his powers and responsibilities and become the hero he never wanted to be.</p><p>Oddity is beautifully drawn by Sweens, written by David Shawn with letters by Eric Weathers. All of us are excited to bring you a comic full of action, horror, and a liberal dose of humor! We want to make you laugh out loud. No agendas, no politics, just a fun story with crazy characters.

<h3>What is Cloudscratcher?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627792110/a96qb7z1ymkui7xysxxy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><a href=""http://cloudscratcher.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cloudscratcher</a> is a webcomic throwback to 90's cartoons, emulating the look and feel of animated series and films of the time, featuring big adventure stories with a colorful cast of characters and an engaging story for readers both young and old. Likeable heroes, over-the-top villains, and plenty of toyetic designs!</p>
<p>Having been a labor of love for the past six years, Cloudscratcher has grown exponentially in readership, and is now nearing the finale of its fourth major story arc.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627792123/jaev21mwzpgncjtpwrfh.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The Volume 1 hardcover is set to contain the first two story arcs (or Episodes) ""Visitors and Venom"" and ""72 Hours,"" which come to a combined total of 7 chapters and 190 pages. Not only will there be various clean-ups and touch-ups of the pages to separate them from what is currently viewable on the website, but the book will also contain additional special features, such as exclusive artwork and side stories.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>As Cloudscratcher has grown in both size and audience, my goal is to see that growth through. This entails moving from simply a webcomic into a printed comic series, and even working on Cloudscratcher (and other comic projects) full time. But, to accomplish that, I'll need the support of current readers and a new, interested audience alike. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p>Simply migrating from the computer screen to the printed page is no simple task, I'm very well aware. This is why I've approached Vivid Publishing, and joined their team to have Cloudscratcher published by Vivid. But, while they may be handling the legwork on printing, fulfilling the campaign perks and shipping out books will fall squarely on my shoulders. This is a challenge I've already worked to prepare for, and should we reach our funding goal and no crisises arise, everything should move smoothly!</p>
<p>But, in the event that something does happen, you can rest assured all backers will be informed and kept up to date every step of the way!</p>

Cloudscratcher is a webcomic throwback to 90's cartoons, emulating the look and feel of animated series and films of the time, featuring big adventure stories with a colorful cast of characters and an engaging story for readers both young and old. Likeable heroes, over-the-top villains, and plenty of toyetic designs!
Having been a labor of love for the past six years, Cloudscratcher has grown exponentially in readership, and is now nearing the finale of its fourth major story arc.


Volume 1

The Volume 1 hardcover is set to contain the first two story arcs (or Episodes) ""Visitors and Venom"" and ""72 Hours,"" which come to a combined total of 7 chapters and 190 pages. Not only will there be various clean-ups and touch-ups of the pages to separate them from what is currently viewable on the website, but the book will also contain additional special features, such as exclusive artwork and side stories.
 

The Impact

As Cloudscratcher has grown in both size and audience, my goal is to see that growth through. This entails moving from simply a webcomic into a printed comic series, and even working on Cloudscratcher (and other comic projects) full time. But, to accomplish that, I'll need the support of current readers and a new, interested audience alike. 
 

Risks & Challenges

Simply migrating from the computer screen to the printed page is no simple task, I'm very well aware. This is why I've approached Vivid Publishing, and joined their team to have Cloudscratcher published by Vivid. But, while they may be handling the legwork on printing, fulfilling the campaign perks and shipping out books will fall squarely on my shoulders. This is a challenge I've already worked to prepare for, and should we reach our funding goal and no crisises arise, everything should move smoothly!
But, in the event that something does happen, you can rest assured all backers will be informed and kept up to date every step of the way!

Other Ways You Can Help

If you can't contribute financially, but want to help, just spreading the word to anyone you can will be more than enough! If you have a friend that seems like someone who'd dig Cloudscratcher, show them this page! Know someone who's a big supporter of indie comics? Send them our way! Every little bit helps.
What We Need & What You Get The goals for this campaign are based on the funding needs for production and shipping. printing costs, mailing fees, the basics.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>When a technological plague destroys the world, a handful of survivors descend on San Francisco, only to discover that they have only 24 hours before they, too, will be wiped out. Hoping to leave a legacy that will outlast them, they do what any good San Franciscan would; make art out of it.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a group of nihilistic programmers have their own deadly agenda and are seeking to expedite the apocalypse. Can the rival factions collaborate on a final act of creation or will humanity’s enduring epitaph be nothing more than sound and fury? </p>
<p>Ghost Band is a blistering meditation on our self-indulgent tech obsession wrapped in a coming-of-age adventure tale. Silicon Valley meets The Day After. </p>

<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>The goal of this Indy Go Go campaign is to support the creation of an original 96-page graphic novel and to ship it to backers.  We are going to produce and release the work as four digital issues over the next year and then collect the entire story in a printed graphic novel and ship it to backers. This is an ambitious undertaking for us and will require a year of work. </p>
<p>Previously I have crowd funded <i>The Rattler, Sucker V1, The Cicada, Sucker V2</i>, and <i>Nocturnal Commissions</i>. I am confident that I can manage this project and create a successful experience for all of our backers. Until the last copy ships, I work for you. </p>

When a technological plague destroys the world, a handful of survivors descend on San Francisco, only to discover that they have only 24 hours before they, too, will be wiped out. Hoping to leave a legacy that will outlast them, they do what any good San Franciscan would; make art out of it.  
Unfortunately, a group of nihilistic programmers have their own deadly agenda and are seeking to expedite the apocalypse. Can the rival factions collaborate on a final act of creation or will humanity’s enduring epitaph be nothing more than sound and fury? 
Ghost Band is a blistering meditation on our self-indulgent tech obsession wrapped in a coming-of-age adventure tale. Silicon Valley meets The Day After.

<h3>The Story...</h3>
<p>The Persian Empire 524 BC. Cambyses II, son of the Great Cyrus(founder of the Persian Empire), has conquered Egypt but hears rumors that his brother Bardiya has taken the throne back at home. With much speculation, Cambyses sends his most skilled Immortal(Asadi) to recon the alleged usurper. Asadi, a loyal member of the elite Persian Immortal Army and to the throne, rides out not knowing that unworldly monsters and demons have surfaced to stop him from uncovering the truth. Meanwhile, opportunists like Darius, a Mage and a demon King named Zahhāk are ready to seize the moment during this weak moment for the royal family.</p>
<p><strong>THE IMMORTAL ASADI</strong> is a 24 page, saddle stitched, full-color comic book with art done by Nick Unlisted, colors by Jeff Henry and written by Del and co-written and edited by Jermaine Colon-Mendez(JC) of Tier One Comics. This will be the first issue of a series that takes you into a world inspired by the Ancient Persian Empire and by Persian mythology.</p>
<p><strong>“History is written by the victors""</strong></p>
<p>A quote we all know too well. A lot of what we know about the Persian Empire comes from the accounts of Greek historians and what ruins have been left behind. Many have speculated the legitimacy of the Persian King Darius and his accounts of how he ascended to the throne. A series of assassinations, rumors, and rewritten records of what happened between the two sons of Cyrus, from which King Darius took the throne, surround debates even til today. This story takes the accounts of this piece of Persian history, mythology, and fantasy to bring you a story like no other!</p>

<p>Asadi: Persian soldier of “The Immortals”, an elite army unit of 10,000 fixed members. Asadi is well liked amongst the ranks and is popular for being undefeated against any challenger (man or beast). He does not see himself greater than anyone of his unit even though he is clearly  more exceptionally skilled in all areas of combat when compared to his peers. He is loyal to his unit, his chain of command, the King, and has never questioned his duty to protect the throne and its interests. Asadi has the ability to interpret dreams but mostly his own. In his dreams it is revealed to him the weaknesses of his enemies the night prior to confronting them. Many of his peers do not believe this to be true yet others remain suspicious.</p>

<p>Zahhāk: Known as Azhi Dahāka in ancient Persian literature. This demon king has origins in the mythology and Zoroastrianist beliefs of the Persian people. Here, he has come from the shadows and has found weakness in the state of the union of an expanding Persian empire. He plots to rule over man but plots to do so through shadow government, using a spear bearer for the king named Darius to gain control. He unleashes the mythological world of Ancient Persia that's filled with monsters and demons to create havoc within the empire. He will soon prove to be Asadi’s biggest challenge and test of immortality as the two will constantly cross paths due to their certain affiliations, end-state goals, and desires.</p>

<h3>We want you to be a part of this!</h3>
<p>In order to make this story something tangible that you can hold in your hands we have to cover the printing costs, artwork, coloring, and lettering. I've put a lot of my own money in and would like your help with making this book happen. Be a part of the journey!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we will push forward and complete this project, however it would be more rewarding making this a combined effort.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm very passionate about the history of ancient civilizations and am always inspired by storytelling using ancient mythology with historical figures. There are so many characters, historical figures, and events that have not been tapped into to create and tell great stories. This, I hope will introduce another world to many who are not familiar with Ancient Persian history and mythology and entertain those who do.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We, unlike many other independent creators are starting off with less material. We ask that if you're still on the fence about backing us, to check in regularly as we will be constantly working and updating the content of this book. The script is complete and we are now starting on the pages which will soon be posted. We're all military(the creative team) and are making good use of our time to create this book. Challenges will present themselves through this situation but we will be upfront and regularly update statuses of this project. We're here asking you all to help us fund and be a part of a product that WILL get finished. We will have the means to make it possible but hope you'll join us. </p>
<h3>Prints available!</h3>
<p>Below is ""The Immortal Mask"" worn by Asadi. These prints 8.5""x11"" prints that are signed by the artist Nick Unlisted.</p>

</div></div>","The Story...
The Persian Empire 524 BC. Cambyses II, son of the Great Cyrus(founder of the Persian Empire), has conquered Egypt but hears rumors that his brother Bardiya has taken the throne back at home. With much speculation, Cambyses sends his most skilled Immortal(Asadi) to recon the alleged usurper. Asadi, a loyal member of the elite Persian Immortal Army and to the throne, rides out not knowing that unworldly monsters and demons have surfaced to stop him from uncovering the truth. Meanwhile, opportunists like Darius, a Mage and a demon King named Zahhāk are ready to seize the moment during this weak moment for the royal family.
THE IMMORTAL ASADI is a 24 page, saddle stitched, full-color comic book with art done by Nick Unlisted, colors by Jeff Henry and written by Del and co-written and edited by Jermaine Colon-Mendez(JC) of Tier One Comics. This will be the first issue of a series that takes you into a world inspired by the Ancient Persian Empire and by Persian mythology.
“History is written by the victors""
A quote we all know too well. A lot of what we know about the Persian Empire comes from the accounts of Greek historians and what ruins have been left behind. Many have speculated the legitimacy of the Persian King Darius and his accounts of how he ascended to the throne. A series of assassinations, rumors, and rewritten records of what happened between the two sons of Cyrus, from which King Darius took the throne, surround debates even til today. This story takes the accounts of this piece of Persian history, mythology, and fantasy to bring you a story like no other!




 
The Characters

Asadi: Persian soldier of “The Immortals”, an elite army unit of 10,000 fixed members. Asadi is well liked amongst the ranks and is popular for being undefeated against any challenger (man or beast). He does not see himself greater than anyone of his unit even though he is clearly  more exceptionally skilled in all areas of combat when compared to his peers. He is loyal to his unit, his chain of command, the King, and has never questioned his duty to protect the throne and its interests. Asadi has the ability to interpret dreams but mostly his own. In his dreams it is revealed to him the weaknesses of his enemies the night prior to confronting them. Many of his peers do not believe this to be true yet others remain suspicious.

Zahhāk: Known as Azhi Dahāka in ancient Persian literature. This demon king has origins in the mythology and Zoroastrianist beliefs of the Persian people. Here, he has come from the shadows and has found weakness in the state of the union of an expanding Persian empire. He plots to rule over man but plots to do so through shadow government, using a spear bearer for the king named Darius to gain control. He unleashes the mythological world of Ancient Persia that's filled with monsters and demons to create havoc within the empire. He will soon prove to be Asadi’s biggest challenge and test of immortality as the two will constantly cross paths due to their certain affiliations, end-state goals, and desires.

We want you to be a part of this!
In order to make this story something tangible that you can hold in your hands we have to cover the printing costs, artwork, coloring, and lettering. I've put a lot of my own money in and would like your help with making this book happen. Be a part of the journey!
If we don't reach our goal we will push forward and complete this project, however it would be more rewarding making this a combined effort.

The Impact
I'm very passionate about the history of ancient civilizations and am always inspired by storytelling using ancient mythology with historical figures. There are so many characters, historical figures, and events that have not been tapped into to create and tell great stories. This, I hope will introduce another world to many who are not familiar with Ancient Persian history and mythology and entertain those who do.

Risks & Challenges
We, unlike many other independent creators are starting off with less material. We ask that if you're still on the fence about backing us, to check in regularly as we will be constantly working and updating the content of this book. The script is complete and we are now starting on the pages which will soon be posted. We're all military(the creative team) and are making good use of our time to create this book. Challenges will present themselves through this situation but we will be upfront and regularly update statuses of this project. We're here asking you all to help us fund and be a part of a product that WILL get finished. We will have the means to make it possible but hope you'll join us. 
Prints available!
Below is ""The Immortal Mask"" worn by Asadi. These prints 8.5""x11"" prints that are signed by the artist Nick Unlisted.

In Agoge, these children are sent forth into the wilds of the alien planet Relpek to prove they are worthy and up to the daunting tasks that lay ahead of them.</p><p>Here is a link to read the first 12 pages for free.</p><p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/s/iv7xcxbo599zcjl/COGVol0.108.pdf?"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/s/iv7xcxbo599zcjl/COGVol0.108.pdf?</a></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">About me and this projects creation.</h3><p>          Hello friends, family, and readers my name is Brian Brennan the writer and creator of Children of Genesis, the first 30-page issue of Children of Genesis is complete and test-printed. However, the work is just beginning.</p><p>          I must tell you as I hold the test print in my hands and flip through the pages, it is the most satisfying experience, next to holding my newborn sons, in my entire life. I am a carpenter by trade and writing became a hobby years ago after the idea for this comic came to me in a dream. I awoke in the middle of the night and furiously wrote down that dream. At first, those bleary-eyed writings were incoherent. Writing was never something I had even considered as a hobby. Since that fateful dream, however, I have spent several years organizing those ideas into several scripts.</p><p>          With the help of a childhood friend Anthony Jensen, who I had spent many a morning, noon and night drawing and writing homemade comics, we came up with a general outline for the first issue of those still incoherent scribbles. The last few years consisted of writing draft after draft until the finalized script for Children of Genesis: Agoge, as well as scripts for the next four volumes and outlines up to volume ten, were completed. </p><p>          My next step was to find an artist whose style matched my dream. That’s where Cristian Santos comes in. He took the concept art and my script and brought them to life. The final piece of the puzzle was through what can only be described as true serendipity.

In Agoge, these children are sent forth into the wilds of the alien planet Relpek to prove they are worthy and up to the daunting tasks that lay ahead of them.Here is a link to read the first 12 pages for free.https://www.dropbox.com/s/iv7xcxbo599zcjl/COGVol0.108.pdf?About me and this projects creation.          Hello friends, family, and readers my name is Brian Brennan the writer and creator of Children of Genesis, the first 30-page issue of Children of Genesis is complete and test-printed. However, the work is just beginning.          I must tell you as I hold the test print in my hands and flip through the pages, it is the most satisfying experience, next to holding my newborn sons, in my entire life. I am a carpenter by trade and writing became a hobby years ago after the idea for this comic came to me in a dream. I awoke in the middle of the night and furiously wrote down that dream. At first, those bleary-eyed writings were incoherent. Writing was never something I had even considered as a hobby. Since that fateful dream, however, I have spent several years organizing those ideas into several scripts.          With the help of a childhood friend Anthony Jensen, who I had spent many a morning, noon and night drawing and writing homemade comics, we came up with a general outline for the first issue of those still incoherent scribbles. The last few years consisted of writing draft after draft until the finalized script for Children of Genesis: Agoge, as well as scripts for the next four volumes and outlines up to volume ten, were completed.           My next step was to find an artist whose style matched my dream. That’s where Cristian Santos comes in. He took the concept art and my script and brought them to life. The final piece of the puzzle was through what can only be described as true serendipity. I met the writer of The Minds Behind the Games book series and creator/writer of the indie comic Condrey, Patrick Hickey Jr. Patrick took my final draft and edited it to what I would consider perfection.          So, seeing as the book is complete and the test print came out perfect, your contribution would help in a variety of ways. The necessary funding would not only support a print run of Children of Genesis, but would also fund a full-color version and the continuation of the series. I truly have lofty hopes that you all will fall in love with these characters which I have big plans for.",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

All 48 pages, plus covers.Markosia is my publisher, but they will publish only a digital version of Rammur #1.Markosia has kindly allowed me to reach out to you with this print offering. There will be no print version of Rammur #1 on Amazon or Barnes & Noble.And the only print edition that will be available is on NEWSPRINT paper. You remember newsprint? The way comics are supposed to look? I knew that you would. [[SEE UPDATE: NEWSPRINT DITCHED FOR SQUARE-BOUND FORMAT WITH SPINE, ON MATTE (NON-GLOSSY) PAPER.]]  Rammur #1 is a creator-owned comic book. I've done those before. But not like Rammur.What's so different about Rammur?First and foremost, I own the property outright; Rammur is my baby.  I have collaborators, most notably the three artists who contributed to the distinct visual likeness of Rammur. Those three fine artists--Paulo Peres, Andrew Wendel, and Joe Staton--made invaluable contributions and they will participate in the profits of Rammur.  What else is makes Rammur different from other comics being produced today? Everything. The concept, the approach to story, the approach to art.Rammur is a master thief in a future police state. That's it. Seven-word elevator pitch. Simple.The stories will be self-contained, with beginnings, middles, and endings. And relatively short, by today's standards. (Story page counts in Rammur #1: 24 pages, 6 pages, 2 pages, 4 pages.) Plus ten pages of ""making of"" (""Steps"") stuff, illustrating the development of the dynamic splash page--from script to finished art--for the lead story, ""Dead on the Ground."" The Steps section also includes an alternative cover, a TOPS Tales of the Police State cover, a must-have propaganda poster by Matt Chic (aka trashydreams) which is also a crowdfunding bonus, Paulo's ""Aspects of Rammur"" tryout page, and a sneak peak at Rammur #2. (More about TOPS below.)  Want page-after-page of clever dialogue, with word balloons crowding out the artwork? Look elsewhere. Rammur stories are told visually--what a concept!Want tired, clichéd, elaborate ""backstory"" that just gums up the works? Again, you won't find it in Rammur. You'll be too caught up in what Rammur is doing now to care a whit about what he might have done in the distant past.Want a cast of thousands? Crowd scenes? ""Epic"" scope? Sorry on those counts, too. Rammur takes a handful of characters (or less) and launches into action. No galactic wars and hordes of zombies In Rammur. Just tight little crime dramas with an intriguing (anti)hero, slimy antagonists, and good-looking women.  Origin story? You've got to be kidding! Zilch, zero, nada.  The lead story, ""Dead on the Ground,"" is drawn by Paulo Peres. Here's the teaser:A museum heist gone wrong. Two thieves dead. Rammur’s fusion gear damaged. The target of the break-in—a banned objet d’art—destroyed. But that’s just the beginning of Rammur’s problems, because one of his colleagues is a police informant. Can Rammur figure out who’s tipping off the cops before he finds himself in a Global Freedom Authority labor camp?The Rammur back-up story by Marco Perugini (who created the boffo video) is called ""Handiwork,"" and by the time you're finished with this little gem you will probably have caught on that double-crosses are a running theme in Rammur. These are crime stories, remember? In ""Handiwork"" Rammur passes on a heist he thinks is just too risky. End of story? No--beginning of story. Rammur finds that walking away from this heist might be deadlier than taking the job.This is the Rammur Manifesto:If you think testosterone is a kind of poison…If you think that ""macho"" is a dirty word...If you want comics to be safe…and “sensitive”…Then Rammur is not for you!Rammur: no man can stop himRammur: no woman can resist himRammur: no prize can daunt him.You'll notice Rammur's visual style is not the currently fashionable, ""busy,"" heavily rendered, ultra-modeled-color type of art you see everywhere. If you want that, there are plenty of places to go.I decided that Rammur's style would be the ""animated"" style, made popular by DC Comics' tie-ins to the 1990s Batman animated cartoon.Rammur will be a bit more mature than that, but not by much. It's PG-13 or so. (""12+ only"" to be exact.) A little blood, no gore, implied sex. Some low cussing.  Fun factoid: Rammur’s gear is powered by a compact fusion reactor strapped to his back. Is Rammur the first and only comic book character powered by hydrogen/fusion power? Maybe. That would be cool. A ridiculous concept, you say? Totally impossible, scientifically? Yeah, but this is comics, where a kid who got his powers from getting chomped on by a radioactive spider is all the rage. Is that any sillier?Note: that thing on Rammur's chest is a ram-scoop. It sucks up hydrogen atoms. Hence, the name ""Rammur.""  Here's a glossary of terms to help introduce you Rammur's world:Ruptors: robot cops.GFA/Global Freedom Authority: the world-wide future government that runs everything. Or tries. They have, of course, bitten off more than they can chew, so a guy like Rammur can make a living and mostly stay under the radar and out of jail.Dominaytra/“Dommie”: the Big Sister at the head of the GFA; she may or may not be a real person.Above: this is the ""Dommie"" mini-propaganda poster.

I have personally collected comics of almost every type and genre since 1974, and I can say that during the past 30 years, we have published some of the greatest and best independent comics out there. Our publishing history includes titles like Gold Digger and Ninja High School. The comic industry has changed over the years, so we have started this Kickstarter program to help introduce new projects from our talented group of creators.</p><p>Over the years, we have published a number of series. Prominent among these is Fred Perry's ingenious title, <i>Gold Digger</i>, which Fred describes as a mixture of <i>Indiana Jones</i> and <i>Final Fantasy</i>. The idea for <i>Gold Digger</i> was first conceived during Fred's tour of duty in the first Gulf War, and it debuted in Antarctic Press's anthology comic, <i>Mangazine</i>, in 1991. A four-issue miniseries followed in 1992, and a regular monthly black-and-white series followed starting in 1993. The current color series began in 1999 and has continued since then. It is the second-longest-running solo-created title in the industry. In 2013, Fred was honored at Comic Con International in San Diego, where he received an Inkpot Award for his work on <i>Gold Digger</i>.</p><p>Over the past years, we have released other Color <i>Gold Brick</i>s as Kickstarter projects. We are now releasing the eighth Color <i>Gold Brick</i>, which features issues 226 through 250 of the <i>Gold Digger</i> series. (This is actually the 10th <i>Gold Brick</i>. More on that below.) If you haven't seen or read <i>Gold Digger</i>, this is your chance to enjoy one of the best and longest-running ongoing series in comics. Like the other <i>Brick</i>s, this one lets new readers join in easily, so you don't have to be shy!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1609870203/smqbvobeh1vn30ocb1tq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The two earliest Brick volumes, <i>Gold Brick 1</i> and Gold Brick 2, were black and white. Then Fred began his color series, so Bricks 3-6 were printed in color. Gold Brick 3 was originally printed in limited quantities, and Fred's only reference copy became thoroughly destroyed from years of constant use. Kickstarter was used to make this out-of-print edition available again as Color Brick 1. By this time, the original stock of Brick 4 had sold out as well, so we offered a new printing of that through Kickstarter as Color Brick 2.  However, the original Bricks 5 and 6 were still in stock at the time, so we skipped ahead to produce Gold Brick 7 (Color Brick 5), collecting material not previously available in this format, and have continued the sequence from there. (We know this can still be confusing, so we have a numbering guide at the bottom of this page.)</p><p>Since the original printings of Gold Bricks 5 and 6 have since sold out, we'll eventually go back to reprint these other volumes to match the new Kickstarter printings' format. We want everyone to have nice editions. For now, however, in addition to reasons already mentioned, many backers in previous campaigns have asked if we could skip ahead, since they had already purchased the earlier editions. Skipping ahead allows these backers to have a nice, new volume for their shelves. At the same time, we also help backers who missed the earlier Brick offerings way back in the day to catch up via the reprints.</p><p>You can actually read the color series up through issue #99 online at <a href=""http://antarcticpresslibrary.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://antarcticpresslibrary.com/</a> and see what you've been missing.</p><p> </p><p><strong>What are we going to do with the Campaign money?</strong></p><p>Plain and simple, we're going to print and ship the <i>Gold Digger Color Gold Brick</i> 8.</p><p>The <i>Color Gold Brick</i> is over 600 pages in FULL COLOR. Printing the actual books is the biggest single expense. The first print run of a typical <i>Gold Brick</i> is quite expensive, as most printers require a minimum run to make it cost-effective. We are thus using Kickstarter to assist us with those costs. If the amount seems high, you must remember that we are printing at least a thousand copies of a 600+ page book. Another cost is shipping: First we will have to ship the books from the printer to our offices, and once we get them, send copies to all our supporters and distributors. Several thousand pounds of books represents a significant shipping expense.</p><p>Here is a breakdown of our expenses.</p><p>Printing: $12,500 (which includes hard and softcover)</p><p>Shipping: $3,000 (Sending a 600-page book is costly, especially overseas.  The cost for shipping just one copy overseas is now around $34.)</p><p>Fees: $1500 (Indiegogo takes their fees off the top)</p><p>Handling/Supplies: $1500 (We have to pay for boxes and pay people to pack those boxes.)</p><p>That does not include cost for sending the large PDF files to all the supporters and other miscellaneous costs.</p><p>Those basic expenses total $18,500.</p><p>So what do you get?</p><p>The brick is 6 x 9 inches and will contain issues 226 through 250 of the <i>Gold Digger</i> series. You can see the covers to all 25 issues below.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>REWARDS</strong></p><p>Here are the rewards we are offering. Some of you may ask why there are not any sketch editions with these rewards as in previous campaigns. Without going into details, Fred is a very busy man and has taken on more responsibilities, both family- and work-wise. At this time, we did not want to burden him with any further work. We hope you understand.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610131216/ekgwtytgf95m5lyo2rrw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>ADD-ONS</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610131270/ruqplhvzhez7jkesxukb.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>We hope to print other Gold Bricks, both earlier ones as they sell out and new ones never before collected. As you know, this volume will reprint 25 issues of the color series, but there are over 200 issues of Gold Digger, and this printing of 600+ pages only covers about 10% of the entire run. Many of the early issues are the ones that are most desperately out of print. Being a small, independent publisher, we are forced to try to keep our cost margins as narrow as possible, and the end result is many of our books sell out quickly and become unavailable. Hopefully, we can use this campaign to help us keep all of our books in print. This is especially important with Gold Digger, since new readers discover the comic every day.

Then there was a 4 issue mini-series that got this joint a poppin'. Lo, there came the regular <i>Gold Digger</i> (Black and White) issues #1-50. Then, when mankind was ready and their fingers grew tired of newsprint stains, Fred Perry and Antarctic Press begat <i>Gold Digger</i> (Color) issues #1-149 on the glossy paper. Many years passed while readers enjoyed those amazing issues, and the world was ready for re-numberification. Thus spake Fred Perry: There shall be a number, and the number shall be #150—no, WAIT!—it shall be... #200, and all the <i>Gold Digger</i> numbering was reintegrated. 50+150=200.  And the world rejoiced, and the numbering has continued ever since! (So, why didn't we include the 4-issue mini-series in the reintegrated numbering? That needed some SPECIAL treatment: GOLD DIGGER: REMASTERED BOOK ONE.  But that is a different tale.)</p><p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p><p>There are always risks inherent in any project. This project has very few risks; the book is already done, and all we just need to do is raise the funds, pay the printer, and get it made. Our biggest risk is that we won't get the funding, and then the book won't be made. We have been printing and releasing books for close to 30 years, so we have a good relationship with our printer and do not anticipate any hiccups. There is always the risk that we won't be able to get the books in on time due to a variety of factors, but again, we do not anticipate that sort of problem. We believe in full disclosure and we will make sure to keep you all updated on the progress of the book and all the incentives. As you can see we have had positive responses to all our previous campaigns and have had no difficulty fulfilling our obligations. The printer we are using for this project is the same one that we have dealt with for many years so we do not anticipate any printing issues.</p></div>","It's time to print and release the newest volume of the GOLD DIGGER COLOR GOLD BRICK SERIES, which collects issues 226 through 250 of Gold Digger!  If you supported the previous color Gold Bricks, thank you very much, and we hope you support this campaign too.

Like the other Bricks, this one lets new readers join in easily, so you don't have to be shy!The two earliest Brick volumes, Gold Brick 1 and Gold Brick 2, were black and white. Then Fred began his color series, so Bricks 3-6 were printed in color. Gold Brick 3 was originally printed in limited quantities, and Fred's only reference copy became thoroughly destroyed from years of constant use. Kickstarter was used to make this out-of-print edition available again as Color Brick 1. By this time, the original stock of Brick 4 had sold out as well, so we offered a new printing of that through Kickstarter as Color Brick 2.  However, the original Bricks 5 and 6 were still in stock at the time, so we skipped ahead to produce Gold Brick 7 (Color Brick 5), collecting material not previously available in this format, and have continued the sequence from there. (We know this can still be confusing, so we have a numbering guide at the bottom of this page.)Since the original printings of Gold Bricks 5 and 6 have since sold out, we'll eventually go back to reprint these other volumes to match the new Kickstarter printings' format. We want everyone to have nice editions. For now, however, in addition to reasons already mentioned, many backers in previous campaigns have asked if we could skip ahead, since they had already purchased the earlier editions. Skipping ahead allows these backers to have a nice, new volume for their shelves. At the same time, we also help backers who missed the earlier Brick offerings way back in the day to catch up via the reprints.You can actually read the color series up through issue #99 online at http://antarcticpresslibrary.com/ and see what you've been missing. What are we going to do with the Campaign money?Plain and simple, we're going to print and ship the Gold Digger Color Gold Brick 8.The Color Gold Brick is over 600 pages in FULL COLOR. Printing the actual books is the biggest single expense. The first print run of a typical Gold Brick is quite expensive, as most printers require a minimum run to make it cost-effective. We are thus using Kickstarter to assist us with those costs. If the amount seems high, you must remember that we are printing at least a thousand copies of a 600+ page book. Another cost is shipping: First we will have to ship the books from the printer to our offices, and once we get them, send copies to all our supporters and distributors. Several thousand pounds of books represents a significant shipping expense.Here is a breakdown of our expenses.Printing: $12,500 (which includes hard and softcover)Shipping: $3,000 (Sending a 600-page book is costly, especially overseas.  The cost for shipping just one copy overseas is now around $34.)Fees: $1500 (Indiegogo takes their fees off the top)Handling/Supplies: $1500 (We have to pay for boxes and pay people to pack those boxes.)That does not include cost for sending the large PDF files to all the supporters and other miscellaneous costs.Those basic expenses total $18,500.So what do you get?The brick is 6 x 9 inches and will contain issues 226 through 250 of the Gold Digger series. You can see the covers to all 25 issues below.  REWARDSHere are the rewards we are offering. Some of you may ask why there are not any sketch editions with these rewards as in previous campaigns. Without going into details, Fred is a very busy man and has taken on more responsibilities, both family- and work-wise. At this time, we did not want to burden him with any further work. We hope you understand. ADD-ONS  We hope to print other Gold Bricks, both earlier ones as they sell out and new ones never before collected. As you know, this volume will reprint 25 issues of the color series, but there are over 200 issues of Gold Digger, and this printing of 600+ pages only covers about 10% of the entire run. Many of the early issues are the ones that are most desperately out of print. Being a small, independent publisher, we are forced to try to keep our cost margins as narrow as possible, and the end result is many of our books sell out quickly and become unavailable. Hopefully, we can use this campaign to help us keep all of our books in print. This is especially important with Gold Digger, since new readers discover the comic every day. We hope to be able to include other items as push goals, which may include getting other Bricks out to you.  NUMBERING GUIDEGold Brick #1 (B/W #1) - The first Gold Brick, which collects the first 25 issues of the black-and-white regular series. (Not offered on Kickstarter.) Gold Brick #2 (B/W #2) - The second Gold Brick, which collects issues #26 – 50 of the black-and-white regular series. (Not offered on Kickstarter.) Gold Brick #3 (COLOR BRICK #1) - The third Gold Brick, the first to collect the COLOR Gold Digger series issues #1 – 25. (New Printing on Kickstarter ended on January 1, 2014.) Gold Brick #4 (COLOR BRICK #2) - The fourth Gold Brick, but the second to collect the COLOR Gold Digger series, containing issues #26 – 50. (New Printing on Kickstarter ended on May 16, 2014.) Gold Brick #5 (COLOR BRICK #3) The fifth Gold Brick, collects issues #51 – #75 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. Currently sold out.  New printing planned for a future campaign, but not yet scheduled.Gold Brick #6 (COLOR BRICK #4) The sixth Gold Brick, collects issues #76 – #100 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. Currently sold out.  New printing planned for a future campaign, but not yet scheduled. Gold Brick #7 (COLOR BRICK #5) The seventh Gold Brick, collects issues #101 – #125 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. (First Printing! Kickstarter project ended on December 12, 2014.) Gold Brick #8 (COLOR BRICK #6) The eighth Gold Brick, collects issues #126 – #150 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. As of color issue #150, we integrated the 50 black-and-white issues into the numbering to emphasize Fred's landmark achievement.  The 150th color issue was therefore published as Gold Digger #200, and the issue numbering proceeds from that point. (First Printing! Kickstarter project ended on August 2, 2016.)Gold Brick #9 (COLOR BRICK #7) The ninth Gold Brick, collects issues #201 – #225 of the COLOR Gold Digger series. (First Printing! Kickstarter project ended on May 15, 2017.)GOLD BRICK #10 (COLOR BRICK #8) The tenth Gold Brick, collects issues #226- #250. NEVER PRINTED BEFORE AND NOW AVAILABLE ON KICKSTARTER.GOLD DIGGER- Publication History- In the beginning, there was an issue of Mangazine, which introduced Gold Digger to the world, and the issue was good. Then there was a 4 issue mini-series that got this joint a poppin'. Lo, there came the regular Gold Digger (Black and White) issues #1-50. Then, when mankind was ready and their fingers grew tired of newsprint stains, Fred Perry and Antarctic Press begat Gold Digger (Color) issues #1-149 on the glossy paper. Many years passed while readers enjoyed those amazing issues, and the world was ready for re-numberification. Thus spake Fred Perry: There shall be a number, and the number shall be #150—no, WAIT!—it shall be... #200, and all the Gold Digger numbering was reintegrated. 50+150=200.  And the world rejoiced, and the numbering has continued ever since! (So, why didn't we include the 4-issue mini-series in the reintegrated numbering? That needed some SPECIAL treatment: GOLD DIGGER: REMASTERED BOOK ONE.  But that is a different tale.)Risks and challengesThere are always risks inherent in any project. This project has very few risks; the book is already done, and all we just need to do is raise the funds, pay the printer, and get it made. Our biggest risk is that we won't get the funding, and then the book won't be made. We have been printing and releasing books for close to 30 years, so we have a good relationship with our printer and do not anticipate any hiccups. There is always the risk that we won't be able to get the books in on time due to a variety of factors, but again, we do not anticipate that sort of problem. We believe in full disclosure and we will make sure to keep you all updated on the progress of the book and all the incentives. As you can see we have had positive responses to all our previous campaigns and have had no difficulty fulfilling our obligations. The printer we are using for this project is the same one that we have dealt with for many years so we do not anticipate any printing issues.",4.0,0,"13 Campaigns

THE SHOW IS ABOUT TO BEGIN...You have your popcorn, soda, and a creepy sense of foreboding as you make your way into the darkened theater. You’re ready to settle into your seat and let the latest horror film wash over you like a deluge of viscous blood pouring from an Overlook Hotel elevator. You like to be scared. You like to scream, to bolt upright in your seat, to cover your eyes, then open them again-- to see the mysterious maneuvers of a ghostly apparition, the twisted machinations of a sinister spirit, the splatter from a psycho’s blade, a monster mash, a demonic possession, a zombie moan, and everything in between.You like horror movies. So do we. You like comics. So do we. You like horror comics. So do... well, you get the idea.Thanks for joining us at the Nightmare Theater. Hope nothing grabs you in the dark... Risks and challengesThe book is 100% complete and we have selected our printer. Right now, the biggest risk is that the recent postal service disruptions will continue into next year. We sincerely hope this nightmare scenario doesn't play out... but if it is, we'll get your books to you via an alternate service. See? We're not so scary.",39.0,0,"6 Campaigns

A four-issue miniseries followed in 1992, and a regular monthly black-and-white series followed starting in 1993. The current color series began in 1999 and has continued since then.</p><p><i>Gold Digger</i> is the second-longest-running solo-created title in the industry, and the second-longest-running female-lead comic series after <i>Wonder Woman</i>. In 2013, Fred was honored at Comic Con International in San Diego, where he received an Inkpot Award for his work on <i>Gold Digger</i>. He's been working on Gold Digger since 1991. That's almost 30 years! That's like if Jack Kirby started work on <i>Fantastic Four</i> in 1962 and drew it up until the launch of, well, <i>Gold Digger</i> in 1991.

For no less than thirteen years, Le Fay will serve this group, and at the end of that service she will be given the means by which she can restore her power. Until that time, she will be their trouble shooter, on call 24/7, no job too big or too small. The Triple Moon’s very own private investigator."" Paul- Pullbox Reviews

<p>What makes this book different from the other superhero books, is that this isn't only a simple origin story. It is an event that forces the protagonist to step up, while we learn how he became the hero he's meant to be. It'll kickstart a whole new story to this world.</p>

We need funds to cover the <strong>printing </strong>of a book with the total of 76 pages, <strong>production</strong>, <strong>postage</strong>, <strong>shipping </strong>and a <strong>very small fee</strong> to Indiegogo. </p>
<p>We take our backers and fanbase seriously, while we interact with them and ask what they'd <strong>love to see and get</strong>. We're asking for this overall goal to make sure we give you the <strong>best quality</strong> we can while maintaining it <strong>cheap</strong>.

</div></div>","RAPTOR: The Preamble is a 56 page full-color comic book, with some extra fan art pages. Raptor is a superhero that I (Milton Aguiar) have created years ago, and spent a lot of time developing with my friend Bruce Berrueco, later meeting Ryan Haack, a super talented writer that was a huge contributor to this book and its story. I'm so glad to meet them, it helped to give a lot of depth and to encourage me to do this! Let's make this a long lasting universe!


Brian Brens returns to his city from serving in the military for several years. When The Shrie, an evil alien force returns to attack the people of Earth, Brian uses his new resources to take on the enemy! We'll meet allies and, of course, enemies! Find out on this book! 
What makes this book different from the other superhero books, is that this isn't only a simple origin story. It is an event that forces the protagonist to step up, while we learn how he became the hero he's meant to be. It'll kickstart a whole new story to this world.
RAPTOR: The Preamble is also the first part out of two on his origin story.


At ImaginAction, we work to get the best creative members we can, and here's the one's behind the book since it began:
Milton Aguiar (Artist/Creator) - My name is Milton Aguiar, and I'm a Portuguese aspiring comic book artist and creator. I'm 21 years old and I've been creating this universe almost 10 years ago.
Ryan Haack (Writer) - My name is Ryan Haack and I love writing comics! I've been writing comics for the better part of 7 years now, and each day I try to hone my craft and learn from mistakes along the way. It's my goal to make the best comics I can. I am the creator of BRIC-A-BRAC and the UNSPEAKABLE TEXT. 
Bruce Berrueco (Co-Plotter) - My name is Bruce Berrueco and I've always loved comics, so I had the opportunity to help write and start this story on Raptor and beyond. 



We are starting this project from scratch, which is why we found it necessary to fund on Indiegogo. We need funds to cover the printing of a book with the total of 76 pages, production, postage, shipping and a very small fee to Indiegogo. 
We take our backers and fanbase seriously, while we interact with them and ask what they'd love to see and get. We're asking for this overall goal to make sure we give you the best quality we can while maintaining it cheap. Our biggest and most important things is our backers and possible backers, and our story.
UPDATE: Please, check out the FAQ on the top of the page.

P.S.: These pages (only these ones) could suffer alterations or even be remade in case if there's problems about important elements such as text or other things being cut out of the page when printing.











These are all the items for the Rewards that you can get. You can check each tier on the top right of this page and choose the ones you like! 
They are:

PDF copy of the book;
Physical copy of the book;
A3 poster;
Raptor T-Shirt;
Blank Sketch Cover;
Drawn Sketch Cover with a character chosen by you, drawn by Milton Aguiar. (Character requests need to be sent by e-mail).

There's low risks as almost half of the work has been completed, but there's always a chance that the book might take time to be completed due to personal schedules and unexpected situations. In any case, we'll keep you posted with updates of the progress, and deliver you the best we can and as soon as possible. The major challenges are being able to make this into an on-going series and expand our Universe.

<p>Its a story about a smuggler, who drives a van...  </p>
<p>Follow the handsome smuggler, <strong>Hansel</strong>, who drives a sweet custom van he calls ""The Falcon,"" his best friend and co-pilot <strong>Chuey</strong>, an illegal immigrant from Guatemala who medicates with cannabis, which is why no one understands him, <strong>Lucas</strong>, the young farm boy who doesn't like farming and the smart, confident, beautiful, <strong>Princess</strong>. Her father is the self-proclaimed King of Barstow, <strong>Doctor Don Væder, M.D. </strong>a proctologist and a gynocologist, and wants to be Vice President of the United States.

<p>We already raised $11,501 in May and we're here on INDIGOGO IN DEMAND to grow our audience and give more people the chance to pre-order the book and be among the first people to get the 48-page double-issue comic in December 2019.  </p>
<p>Indiegogo is an amazing platform to connect creators (that's us!) with fans (like YOU!) who want to play a part in the making of their own entertainment. (You do, don't you?)  This crowd-sourced graphic novel is an important first-step to launch the ""Summer of '74"" political satire-parody, and we want you guys to be a part of the journey.  By supporting us now and pre-ordering Book One, there are some really amazing perks and ways that you can not only get the book, but be a part of its evolution, and be one of the very first to help birth SUMMER OF '74: BOOK ONE.</p>

This giant-sized comic is being brought to you by creator, and award-winning artist, Rusty Gilligan and the Rusty Ink! studio.</p><p><strong>Who is The Symbol ? For that answer, we need to go back to World War II...</strong><br/>On an alternate Earth where the Axis is winning the war, US Army sergeant David Wayne is asked to go on a secret mission to expose saboteurs and black-marketeers. SO, to protect his identity, he fashions a costume to help make his mission easier. He had become the first and only hero on his world.. and aside from the honor of having that distinction, it also became a problem.<br/>Doing his patriotic duty, <strong>The Symbol</strong> participated in a government experiment to travel to another reality, in the hopes of bringing back troops and equipment to help with the war effort, which was going poorly at the time.<br/>But, as fate would have it , <strong>The Symbol</strong> became trapped in a ever-repeating cycle of reality hopping - popping in and out of universes - living through alternate Earth origins - and meeting new and exciting characters.</p><p><strong>What is The Symbol ? For that answer, we need to go back to 1995...</strong><br/><strong>The Symbol</strong> was created for Marvel Comics back in 1994 as part of a planned resurgence of retro and golden age titles. But, the project was scrapped and the character just sat unused.<br/>In 1996/1997 MAIN Publishing released Test Drive #1, an anthology with a <strong>Symbol</strong> cover and story - his first time in print.<br/>Since then <strong>The Symbol</strong> has had stories printed in various comics and spot appearances in other comics and publications. This special volume displays both published and unpublished stories, as well as a new adventure, along with a few retellings and behind-the-scenes art.</p><p><strong>When, Where, Why is The Symbol ?

☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆Mini-interviews coming soon !☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆Let us introduce to you The Symbol, a golden age superhero thrust into the modern world. This giant-sized comic is being brought to you by creator, and award-winning artist, Rusty Gilligan and the Rusty Ink! studio.Who is The Symbol ? For that answer, we need to go back to World War II...On an alternate Earth where the Axis is winning the war, US Army sergeant David Wayne is asked to go on a secret mission to expose saboteurs and black-marketeers. SO, to protect his identity, he fashions a costume to help make his mission easier. He had become the first and only hero on his world.. and aside from the honor of having that distinction, it also became a problem.Doing his patriotic duty, The Symbol participated in a government experiment to travel to another reality, in the hopes of bringing back troops and equipment to help with the war effort, which was going poorly at the time.But, as fate would have it , The Symbol became trapped in a ever-repeating cycle of reality hopping - popping in and out of universes - living through alternate Earth origins - and meeting new and exciting characters.What is The Symbol ? For that answer, we need to go back to 1995...The Symbol was created for Marvel Comics back in 1994 as part of a planned resurgence of retro and golden age titles. But, the project was scrapped and the character just sat unused.In 1996/1997 MAIN Publishing released Test Drive #1, an anthology with a Symbol cover and story - his first time in print.Since then The Symbol has had stories printed in various comics and spot appearances in other comics and publications. This special volume displays both published and unpublished stories, as well as a new adventure, along with a few retellings and behind-the-scenes art.When, Where, Why is The Symbol ? For those answers, you'll need to read the book...This special cover was penciled by Darren Taylor and inked by Rusty! back in 2001... and then recently colored by Terry Pavlet. *Symbol's Debut Story (1996/1997)Originally presented in MAIN Magazine's ""Test Drive"" #1 comic featuring art by John Orlando with a story by Rusty ! This story was originally silent, but will be shown for the first time with a script lettered by Michael H.eitkemper. ""Test Drive"" was the industry's first multiple crossover comic that featured the works of Rich Buckler, Rob Liefeld, Ben Dunn, Rusty Gilligan, and Gil Kane (to name a few) and won awards from Diamond Comics Distribution and Styx in Canada. ""Secret Missions"" (1998)Originally presented in a Comic Book Legal Defense Fund limited edition comic, this is another silent story that will presented with a new script. Art was provided by Mike Tucker from a script by Rusty Gilligan. ""Hurricane Relief"" (2004)This story was the first story in the rare ""Hurricane Relief"" charity comic book that featured both Marvel and DC characters and pinups. This serious story was pencilled and lettered by Jeff Austin with a script and inks by Rusty Gilligan. ""What Heroes Nightmare"" (2016)This story was originally presented in ""Chronicles of Terror"" by a failed publisher in the UK. Art was provided by Martinho Duarte Abreu from a script by Rusty Gilligan. Due to licensing problems, the story was re-lettered by Rusty. It was originally pencilled by Jeff Austin, but the UK publisher asked that it be re-done for publication.""The Skygate Blade of Freedom"" (2017)A brand new 25-page story in a pulpish golden age style featuring the writing of Don Smith, the beautiful artwork of Martinho Duarte Abreu, and the lettering of Nikki Sharman. Is this the TRUE origin of The Symbol... or, another alternate Earth tale ? Only time will tell !""The Other Day Machine"" (2015)As an added bonus, readers will get to see the 15-page pulp story of The Symbol and the incredible adventure he has with Mac and Trouble, as well as the golden age FearDevil. This great prose story was originally seen in ""Amazing Tails"" #2 written by Arthur Gibson with art stylings by the incredible Laura Inglis.PLUS... never-before-seen sketches and behind the scenes art and pin-ups !!☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆    ☆RETAILERS...

<p>A massively destructive force, something both unknown and terrible, is devouring Altarix, the capital planet of the Willow Consortium and jeopardizing all one thousand worlds under the Consortium's rule.</p>
<p>If the Willow Consortium falls to this mysterious, other-dimensional force, what hope remains for the rest of the universe?

<p>Originally published by Epic Comics in the early 80’s, Dreadstar’s story was crafted through the singular vision of series creator Jim Starlin who, working with several inkers over the years, as well as several different publishers, created an unparalleled, cosmic body of work that was finally collected in its ultimate, Omnibus format by Creation.Ink.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590031307/l95bqflo5hfj9f0yel8h.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Comic fans everywhere believed the Omnibus Editions would be the end of Dreadstar’s journey. A career ending injury to Mr. Starlin's drawing hand all but confirmed that there could never be a new Dreadstar adventure written and drawn by Jim Starlin.</p>
<p>But quietly, secretly, Jim Starlin had other ideas. As he slowly began to overcome the injury to his hand, Dreadstar, the most personal of all of his legendary creations had continued whispering to Starlin. Tugging at the back of his mind. Refusing to go quietly into that good night.</p>
<p>Dreadstar had decided it was time to return and he was bringing Jim Starlin, with his inking collaborator <strong>Jaime Jameson</strong>, along for the ride.</p>

</div></div>","Vanth Dreadstar has a serious problem.
A massively destructive force, something both unknown and terrible, is devouring Altarix, the capital planet of the Willow Consortium and jeopardizing all one thousand worlds under the Consortium's rule.
If the Willow Consortium falls to this mysterious, other-dimensional force, what hope remains for the rest of the universe? With the fate of all existence at stake can Dreadstar, along with the catlike Oedi, cybernetic psychic Willow and powerhouse Tueton, find a way to defeat this all-powerful menace?
When Dreadstar uncovers a hidden connection between this omnipotent nightmare and his own past, the answer becomes a resounding no.
After 30 years, Vanth Dreadstar finally returns... just in time to die!
About Jim Starlin
Jim Starlin was already a legend in the comic industry, but his influence now extends across the globe, as the Marvel Cinematic Universe has embraced his creations and storylines to dominate worldwide box offices.  Jim’s signature creation, Thanos, has powered both the Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame movies, two of the most successful films in history. The storyline, adapted from Jim’s Infinity Gauntlet saga, is known the world over.
Jim’s creations, Drax the Destroyer and Gamora lead the Guardians of the Galaxy film franchise, and his co-creation Shang-Chi, Master of Kung Fu, will headline his own Marvel film franchise in 2021.
Some might say it’s Jim Starlin’s universe, we’re just living in it.

Dreadstar returns!
The first all-new Dreadstar adventure in thirty years, written and illustrated by series creator and living legend JIM STARLIN, has arrived!
In coordination with the exciting release of Dreadstar Returns, Jim Starlin and Creation.Ink have also produced an official handbook to the Dreadstar universe, The Dreadstar Guidebook. 
 

 
For almost three decades, fans of Dreadstar have pleaded with Jim Starlin to continue the adventures of Vanth Dreadstar and company. The long wait is finally over! 

Vanth Dreadstar has a huge problem.
A massively destructive force, something both unknown and terrible, is devouring Altarix, the capital planet of the Willow Consortium and jeopardizing all one thousand worlds under the Consortium's rule. 
If the Willow Consortium were to fall to this mysterious, other-dimensional force, what hope exists for the rest of the universe?
With the fate of all existence at stake can Dreadstar, along with the catlike Oedi, cybernetic psychic Willow and powerhouse Tueton, find a way to defeat this all-powerful menace? 
When Dreadstar uncovers a hidden connection between this omnipotent nightmare and his own past, the answer becomes a resounding no. 
After 30 years, Vanth Dreadstar finally returns... just in time to die! 

 
DREADSTAR RETURNS in Vanth Dreadstar's most cosmic, and personal, adventure ever in this all-new, over-sized 100-page hardcover written and illustrated by series creator and comic book legend Jim Starlin! 
The original, long-running Dreadstar series centered on the exploits of Vanth Dreadstar, newly arrived in the Empirical Galaxy after the necessary destruction of the Milky Way. Vanth attempts to live a pastoral existence on a planet populated by peaceful cat-people. That peace is quickly disturbed when Dreadstar and the crew he assembles are thrust into the conflict between the two major forces in the galaxy: The Monarchy and the Theocratical Instrumentality and its Lord High Papal.
Many years later, the  battle continues in new and surprising ways...


Near frozen and left for dead after the brutal slaying of his parents, Vanth Dreadstar is saved by the Sword of Power, giving him newfound might and abilities. With sword in hand, he travels the galaxy on a quest for revenge, but what he finds is much, much more.
 

Derived from an experimental race of cat people at the hands of The Church of Instrumentality, Oedi joins Vanth on his journey after an epic war destroys his people.
 

 A blind telepath, Willow can not only influence sentient minds, but has the power to affect the minds of cybernetics and computers as well. Joined by her seeing-eye monkey Rainbow, Willow uses the power of her inner light, but is fueled by a dark past.
 

Ravaged by his own mystical powers, Syzygy Darklock is kept alive only by cybernetic parts and a will to abolish evil. His faith makes him a ready companion and powerful ally in Dreadstar’s quest, but his heart remains focused on his own ambitions.
 

Freebooter Skeevo uses his friendship with Oedi to join the crew, and the fight. He serves as the ship’s lowbrow pilot.
 

 
 Tueton smash!

Originally published by Epic Comics in the early 80’s, Dreadstar’s story was crafted through the singular vision of series creator Jim Starlin who, working with several inkers over the years, as well as several different publishers, created an unparalleled, cosmic body of work that was finally collected in its ultimate, Omnibus format by Creation.Ink.

 
Comic fans everywhere believed the Omnibus Editions would be the end of Dreadstar’s journey. A career ending injury to Mr. Starlin's drawing hand all but confirmed that there could never be a new Dreadstar adventure written and drawn by Jim Starlin.
But quietly, secretly, Jim Starlin had other ideas. As he slowly began to overcome the injury to his hand, Dreadstar, the most personal of all of his legendary creations had continued whispering to Starlin. Tugging at the back of his mind. Refusing to go quietly into that good night.
Dreadstar had decided it was time to return and he was bringing Jim Starlin, with his inking collaborator Jaime Jameson, along for the ride.
(Click here to read more about Mr. Starlin's journey back to the drawing table- and to Dreadstar.  Jim Starlin in the Hollywood Reporter ).
 


 
Creation.Ink is honored to once again team with the legendary Jim Starlin to produce DREADSTAR RETURNS, an original 100-page hardcover graphic novel thirty years in the making!
 

 
To help celebrate this momentous occasion, we’ve also pulled together, in collaboration with Starlin and veteran writer Bob Greenberger, a brand-new companion volume: THE DREADSTAR GUIDEBOOK!

<p> </p>
<p>Tales From Neroesville is an anthology comic book with no singular star, rather the city itself serves as the backdrop for our entire universe with different stars and story types in each arc. Some stories will be a single issue, others will run multi-issue arcs, all taking place in a shared universe with shared continuity. </p>
<p>TFN is inspired by the 80's indie comics boom. Books like Cat &amp; Mouse, Roachmill, Dalgoda, Ex-Mutants, Grips, Legion X-1, Mighty Mites, etc are the books that lit our creative fires and drove us to create our own characters and universe. The '80s were a magical time for indie comics, and that atmosphere and creative enthusiasm are what we're trying to recapture. When asked in interviews to describe TFN, I tell people ""Imagine if Astro City was published in the 1980s by Eternity or Eclipse comics. Fun, entertaining comics for escapism's sake. No morality of political leanings shoehorned in. Entertainment. Period.""</p>
<p>Entertaining readers and giving them a lot of bang for their buck are our main objectives. Having readers enjoy the books and feel like they got a good deal will keep them coming back to see what our heroes and villains are going to do next. Solid writing, interesting characters, and top-notch art are what we have to offer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Alright, as for the issues in this campaign: 3 issues, 88 pages!</strong></p>
<p><u><i><strong>TFN Issue #4</strong></i></u> introduces readers to Eustace Kinsley, or “Raven D’Spair”, as he prefers to be called. Raven is a typical goth teenager. Unfortunately, he’s decided life is no longer worth living, and suicide seems like his best option. Despite his best efforts, Raven can’t seem to die. While contemplating this revelation, he sees a report that the supervillain Puffenstein is tearing up downtown Neroesville. New plan: Death by supervillain! But can even a psychotic, undead monster kill Raven? Can anything? (16 pages + 9 page backup story)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622897148/ykuttdqqgcaw9sh7kkya.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u><i><strong>In TFN Issue #5</strong></i></u> we meet the superhero team “THE WATCHGUARD.” Not what anyone would call a top-tier team, The Watchguard just can’t seem to catch their big break or make a name for themselves in Neroesville. Most of the team doesn’t care and just want to serve the greater good. Sgt Dixx, however, longs for fame, fortune, and his day in the spotlight. Wanting The Watchguard to be one of Neroesville’s premier superhero teams, Dixx blames team leader Valedictorian for the team’s lack of prestige. Not to worry, Dixx has a sure-fire, can’t-fail plan to send the team straight to the top. What could possibly go wrong? Oh, you’ll see! (23 pages + 9 page backup story)</p>

<p><u><i><strong>HotL issue 1:</strong></i></u> Hero On The Lam is a self-contained 3 issue TFN miniseries. We will be including one issue HotL in each of our next 3 campaigns.</p>
<p>          When the body of popular superhero HappyJack is found murdered in an alley, all of Neroesville is shocked and saddened. But no one is more shocked than James Kinkead, the real HappyJack, who is very much alive and well. Who is behind this charade? What role does villain Von Droog play in all this? And how many more people will have to die before the truth come out? As the body count grows, so does the number of questions. (22 pages + 9 page backup story)</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Just like the first 3 issues of TFN, each book in this campaign will feature a short backup story.</strong></p>
<ul><li>Issue #4 features the first part of the backup story “<u><i><strong>Who’s Yer Daddy?</strong></i></u>” featuring private detective Michael Murphy. Michael is hired by a teenage girl’s mother to look into the girl’s relationship with the skeevy superhero “Big Daddy Bad Ass.” What starts as a simple case quickly turns into a murder investigation.</li></ul>

<ul><li>Issue #5 features part 2 of “<u><i><strong>Who’s Yer Daddy?</strong></i></u>” The investigation takes PI Michael Murphy deeper down the rabbit hole, which only leads to more questions and more death. Can this former Neroesville Police Detective solve the case or will he end up in the morgue too?</li></ul>

<ul><li>HotL #1 features the backup story “<u><i><strong>Mr. Cameron Goes To Neroesville.</strong></i></u>” Some people come to Neroesville seeking fame and fortune. Others are just looking for a fresh start. Some find what they’re looking for, some are chewed up and spit out. Which one will Luke Cameron be? So excited to get this short story out.

After you've read this, please check out the ""GIVEAWAY"" video to learn about the cool idea we came up with as a way to say thank you to our backers.

 
*OPENING DAY GIVEAWAY!!!!!*The first 5 backers of any physical perk receive a free, limited edition HappyJack keychain illustrated by the great SixAMComics (@sixamcomics on Twitter)!

 
Tales From Neroesville is an anthology comic book with no singular star, rather the city itself serves as the backdrop for our entire universe with different stars and story types in each arc. Some stories will be a single issue, others will run multi-issue arcs, all taking place in a shared universe with shared continuity. 
TFN is inspired by the 80's indie comics boom. Books like Cat & Mouse, Roachmill, Dalgoda, Ex-Mutants, Grips, Legion X-1, Mighty Mites, etc are the books that lit our creative fires and drove us to create our own characters and universe. The '80s were a magical time for indie comics, and that atmosphere and creative enthusiasm are what we're trying to recapture. When asked in interviews to describe TFN, I tell people ""Imagine if Astro City was published in the 1980s by Eternity or Eclipse comics. Fun, entertaining comics for escapism's sake. No morality of political leanings shoehorned in. Entertainment. Period.""
Entertaining readers and giving them a lot of bang for their buck are our main objectives. Having readers enjoy the books and feel like they got a good deal will keep them coming back to see what our heroes and villains are going to do next. Solid writing, interesting characters, and top-notch art are what we have to offer.
 
Alright, as for the issues in this campaign: 3 issues, 88 pages!
TFN Issue #4 introduces readers to Eustace Kinsley, or “Raven D’Spair”, as he prefers to be called. Raven is a typical goth teenager. Unfortunately, he’s decided life is no longer worth living, and suicide seems like his best option. Despite his best efforts, Raven can’t seem to die. While contemplating this revelation, he sees a report that the supervillain Puffenstein is tearing up downtown Neroesville. New plan: Death by supervillain! But can even a psychotic, undead monster kill Raven? Can anything? (16 pages + 9 page backup story)

In TFN Issue #5 we meet the superhero team “THE WATCHGUARD.” Not what anyone would call a top-tier team, The Watchguard just can’t seem to catch their big break or make a name for themselves in Neroesville. Most of the team doesn’t care and just want to serve the greater good. Sgt Dixx, however, longs for fame, fortune, and his day in the spotlight. Wanting The Watchguard to be one of Neroesville’s premier superhero teams, Dixx blames team leader Valedictorian for the team’s lack of prestige. Not to worry, Dixx has a sure-fire, can’t-fail plan to send the team straight to the top. What could possibly go wrong? Oh, you’ll see! (23 pages + 9 page backup story)

HotL issue 1: Hero On The Lam is a self-contained 3 issue TFN miniseries. We will be including one issue HotL in each of our next 3 campaigns.
          When the body of popular superhero HappyJack is found murdered in an alley, all of Neroesville is shocked and saddened. But no one is more shocked than James Kinkead, the real HappyJack, who is very much alive and well. Who is behind this charade? What role does villain Von Droog play in all this? And how many more people will have to die before the truth come out? As the body count grows, so does the number of questions. (22 pages + 9 page backup story)

 
Just like the first 3 issues of TFN, each book in this campaign will feature a short backup story.
Issue #4 features the first part of the backup story “Who’s Yer Daddy?” featuring private detective Michael Murphy. Michael is hired by a teenage girl’s mother to look into the girl’s relationship with the skeevy superhero “Big Daddy Bad Ass.” What starts as a simple case quickly turns into a murder investigation.

Issue #5 features part 2 of “Who’s Yer Daddy?” The investigation takes PI Michael Murphy deeper down the rabbit hole, which only leads to more questions and more death. Can this former Neroesville Police Detective solve the case or will he end up in the morgue too?

HotL #1 features the backup story “Mr. Cameron Goes To Neroesville.” Some people come to Neroesville seeking fame and fortune. Others are just looking for a fresh start. Some find what they’re looking for, some are chewed up and spit out. Which one will Luke Cameron be? So excited to get this short story out. It's being illustrated by my super talented daughter and will be her first published work.
