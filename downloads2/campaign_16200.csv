<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Yiqing Zhao. I'm an NYC-based Asian actress/singer ( More about me: <a href=""http://www.yiqingzhao.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.yiqingzhao.com</a>) This is my first play and I'm so excited to produce it this summer!</p>
<p>""Lost and Found "" will be produced at Hudson Guild Theatre with an all-Asian cast, as a part of the NY Summerfest.</p>
<p>Play Synopsis: After a dark secret has been revealed, Tommy separates with his girlfriend. Meanwhile, he meets with Maggie, now a successful writer, who was in love with him in high school. As he is inspired by Maggie and ready to start a career with her, he is devastated by the multiple blows that come at him. Will he survive?</p>
<p>I am launching this campaign to gather funds for the production. Your help means a lot to me!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Campaign Details:</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise $1,000 for the entire production of this play. This will cover:</p>
<p>The participation fee of the theatre festival( $257), rehearsal space rental( $15 per hour, 30 hours of rehearsal), props purchase( $200, including books, plates, cups and utensils, fake food, etc), Marketing expenses( $150, including printing of posters and postcards, playbills, etc).</p>

</div><h3>Perks:</h3><p>Whoever donates over $50 will get a postcard from us signed by all our cast!</p><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This original play explores the ideas of friendship, romantic relationships, deception, integrity, ambition, and life and death, by telling the life stories of four young people who reunite in NYC 6 years after high school graduation. It's moving, it's based on true stories, and it has an all-Asian cast, which is not very common in theatre. By contributing to this campaign, you are helping a female playwright put her story into life. You are also helping a bunch of young actors shine on their beloved stage! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Together, we can make an amazing, hilarious, and empowering show, on this conservative budget, that will inspire young women to stop playing small. It will inspire everyone who sees the show to value the feminine all around them:</p>
<ul>
<li>As a circus-theatre artist, I tackle big questions with charm and bawdiness. As a teacher, I have seen how kids are often taught to value the masculine ways of doing things, without regard to compassion and equilibrium.</li>
<li>We had a great show last year, which was thought-provoking and touching. It inspired hundreds of people to think about how feelings can guide us as much as what's 'been done before.' How letting our hearts break is a sign of being on the right path, rather than being a weakness. How following our heart's desires is more than a Disney song. Everything I wish my Granny had said.</li>
<li>I am taking this material to a residency in Maine, working with a new director, and getting the show ready to tour college campuses.</li>
<li>Art is a powerful way to incite change in our world. A show like mine gets into people's hearts and affects them in a way  political campaigns can fail to do.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since I am <strong>fiscally sponsored</strong> by Fractured Atlas, your donations are <strong>TAX-DEDUCTIBLE!</strong>
</li>
<li>The bulk of this funding is for rehearsal fees and paying my director what she's worth. This show has also been accepted to a <strong>residency </strong>in Maine this summer, which has a $1400 price tag. The full budget:<ul>
<li><p>Director &amp; Rehearsal Fees: $2240</p></li>

<li><p>NACA Membership to book College Venues: $634</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Your dollars (VOTES!) count. Where you choose to spend your money, and what you help to flourish, speaks loudly. This campaign will help you make your voice even louder, with help to <strong>contact your representatives about where you want your money to go</strong>.</li>
<li>And there are funny greeting card perks, too! So you can <strong>improve the world, one laugh at a time.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Funding that used to be available to artists like myself is getting scarcer and scarcer through the world of grants. The new paradigm is groundroots: people like you supporting arts and messages that you believe in.</li>
<li>Your dollars can counteract proposed cuts the the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the National Endowment for the Arts.</li>

During the night their stories counterpoint each other and diverge when a third character Adila, a young Syrian protester, influences the future of the Displaced Woman while Marie's execution is inevitable.</p><p style=""margin-left:0.25in;"">The play is relatable to all people who have lost their homes and families due to war, political oppression or catastrophic circumstances.

Aside from directing, Louanne is a stellar actress, an accomplished writer, mother and activist.Elizabeth Huffman: Actor, Playwright, Artistic Director and founder of Chain Reaction, a new producing company specifically for international exchanges and multi ethnic productions. Elizabeth has been the Artistic Director of 4 classical companies and has won a total of 8 Drammy Awards for her directing, and costume designs.  She has taken 6 productions to Europe through her former company ICAP and invited two productions to come to Los Angeles from Germany. Elizabeth will be directing another one of her plays, Bon Temps Roulez at the Shakespeare Café, in January 2017 for the renowned Bremer Shakespeare Company in Bremen, Germany.   She is an award winning Equity actress and has performed in regional theatre across the USA and internationally.What Is This About?We are in the process of raising the funds to finish creating our new multi-media touring production of our acclaimed solo show: Not My Revolution.  This unique and powerful solo show resonates to current events as a timely cautionary tale and in the midst of the devastation of war, finds its way toward redemption. Not My Revolution reaped immediate critical acclaim and has been challenging audiences to question their position on refugees, to recognize that war is the great leveler, and that everyone is vulnerable.  After seeing the play and discussing it in talkbacks, many audience members are moved to ask what they can do to help.  We want to keep this conversation going, to reach into the heartland of America as well as the cultural landscape abroad to those who have been resistant to the idea of welcoming refugees into their community and impact that dynamic through experiencing this theatrical journey.In the play, audiences witness a wealthy and successful Syrian woman’s descent into displacement and her loss of family and home due to a bloody revolution at the same time we meet another woman who shares a similar journey but in a different revolution in time: Marie Antoinette. During the night their stories counterpoint each other and diverge when a third character Adila, a young Syrian protester, influences the future of the Displaced Woman while Marie's execution is inevitable.The play is relatable to all people who have lost their homes and families due to war, political oppression or catastrophic circumstances. Anyone is susceptible - from the richest in the land to the poorest. The conversation in the post-play talkbacks have been tremendously moving and inspiring.Why We Think Not My Revolution is an Important Project to Support!If we can help people to engage in conversation together after seeing the show, we can assist the audiences toward empathy and a better understanding of the refugees lives and circumstances. We want to inspire them to reach a place of compassion in their hearts and welcome them in their community;  to aid them to get back on their feet again and become the valued members of society they had been before war destroyed their lives.  Your contribution to this project will be supporting that effort, one step and one show at a time. What your contribution will help us to achieveTo complete the editing of the newly filmed portion of the show      To complete the creation of our unique and portable set      To purchase a projector and laptop to run the show anywhere on tour      To rent rehearsal and theatre space for our presentation in late August       To pay our designers, director and technicians for their time and considerable skills      To hire an assistant to help with marketing, grant writing and booking arrangements      To create brochures, promo videos, postcards and website        To help purchase plane, train & automobile fares, housing and festival fees                            What We Will Give You for Your SupportWithout a doubt you would have our most heartfelt thanks.

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<h3> We're Chase What Flies: Progressive Theatre, Classic Words.</h3>
<p>In the summer of 2014, actors Frank Weidner and Jordan Klomp met when they shared the stage and worked in education  at Will Geer's Theatricum Botanicum. They quickly developed a friendship over a shared love of Shakespeare, social consciousness, and theatre education. Several years, productions, and co-taught classes later, Jordan approached Frank with an idea: a production of William Shakespeare's <i>Cymbeline</i>, performed by an ensemble of passionate and hardworking Classical Actors who shared in the duo's desire to tell an important story with rich language. They gathered friends and actors from across LA's premier theatre companies, and performed to an enthusiastic, sold-out crowd in 2016, and decided to name their ensemble after one of the play's most whimsical passages. And so, Chase what Flies was born. They now turn their attention to telling a sad story about the death of kings with <i>Richard the Second</i>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chase What Flies is a completely self-funded collective: we have no corporate backing or grants, only ticket sales and donations. We are not a company; rather, a group of artists putting in our own time and money to bring quality theatre to our community. Every cent we receive from donations goes directly towards set construction, theatre rental, and most importantly, reimbursing our tireless team for all of their talent and dedication. For Richard the Second, we have set our goal for $6000, in order to keep ticket prices affordable while simultaneously fairly compensating our cast and crew.</li>
<li>Of course, your generosity and support won't go unrewarded! We're offering a variety of perks to express our gratitude, including complimentary concessions and wine, comped tickets with preferred seating, and even a title of nobility from the imagination of our very own Richard II, Frank Weidner. Visit the perks page for all of the details!</li>
<li>Even if we are unable to reach our goal, EVERY CENT will do a little bit more to ensure our artists are cared for, and that Chase What Flies can continue to tell classic and poignant tales for the years to come.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chase What Flies is a true rarity in Los Angeles: an ensemble almost entirely made up of Professional Stage actors of the Actor's Equity Association, performing in an intimate setting with tickets readily affordable to all audience members. No concepts, gimmicks, or bells and whistles; instead, the performance of resonant works of theatre with a focus on theme and language.</li>
<li>Thanks to contributions and attendance from so many of you, our debut production of Cymbeline enjoyed a celebrated and sold-out run, where every member of our team was able to be reimbursed for their work. We wish to continue that tradition, and you--our friends, family, fellow artists, and audience--are an instrumental part of the Chase What Flies team. We need to to make it all happen!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Perhaps our biggest challenge with Richard the Second is the play itself. As with Cymbeline, we have taken on another highly complex piece.

</li>
<li><font>Fortunately, we've assembled a dynamite cast and crew with the chops, creativity, and passion to make Richard the Second thrive. The R2 team is captained by our director Mark Bramhall, an award-winning actor in all artistic mediums, and an expert in unearthing the hidden gems in Shakespeare's text. His familiarity with the play and ability to simultaneously direct actors and help them grow as artists are a big reason why we're certain this will be a show to remember. </font></li>
<li><font>​We aren't just risking ourselves artistically: to make Richard the Second happen, our team has donated an incredible amount of their time and energy. Our actor-producers have dug into their savings to fund the show and reimburse our artists. All to bring this timely tale of misrule and political corruption to you. We know the reward to perform for you all is more than worth the risk!</font></li>

<h3>vision</h3>
<p>Mallory Fabian (artistic director &amp; founder of fabe), along with many dancers, and collaborators are currently investigating the idea of stripping away layers that are often misconstrued as identity. We are in constant discussion about the way humans treat each other based on physical and personal attributes such as gender, race, sex, how we comply to behavioral norms, etc. Many people who live outside of ""the norm"" work endlessly to create an honest-to-self image and present it in a way that establishes something genuine and non-performative. While honoring that, we are working hard to strip away the boundaries that these efforts work to break. We are curious. Regardless of the stereotypes, is it possible to <strong>unknow</strong> the bias' that we hold and see the human beings in front of us for who they are?</p>
<p>fabe makes work that is fresh and unseen. We develop movement that comes from genuine interaction and is rooted from a deep place of exhaustion. Mallory is more interested in the experience for the dancer and viewer, not the technical perfection of the piece. As a whole, nothing is ever done the same, and the dancers are forced to think at all times about who they are in relation to each other and to the audience. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to us because we are dedicated to continuing this investigation beyond the premiere in June. Our piece that premieres in November will be centered around these same ideas but from a different vantage point. There are thousands of ways to tell someone who you are and we choose to do that with movement. </p>
<p>Your support not only funds our collaborators but it helps our investigation. The ability to continue an inclusive dialogue about identity is why we create. We are proud to have a diverse cast with different backgrounds, and the ability to bring these people together. The goal is to create a relatable and raw experience for everyone involved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>""The movement [is] very physical, intrusive and confrontational"" </i></p>
<p><i>""Fabian exposes the reality of accepting who we are, what we look like, and choices we make.""</i></p>

</div></div>","vision
Mallory Fabian (artistic director & founder of fabe), along with many dancers, and collaborators are currently investigating the idea of stripping away layers that are often misconstrued as identity. We are in constant discussion about the way humans treat each other based on physical and personal attributes such as gender, race, sex, how we comply to behavioral norms, etc. Many people who live outside of ""the norm"" work endlessly to create an honest-to-self image and present it in a way that establishes something genuine and non-performative. While honoring that, we are working hard to strip away the boundaries that these efforts work to break. We are curious. Regardless of the stereotypes, is it possible to unknow the bias' that we hold and see the human beings in front of us for who they are?
fabe makes work that is fresh and unseen. We develop movement that comes from genuine interaction and is rooted from a deep place of exhaustion. Mallory is more interested in the experience for the dancer and viewer, not the technical perfection of the piece. As a whole, nothing is ever done the same, and the dancers are forced to think at all times about who they are in relation to each other and to the audience. 
This campaign is important to us because we are dedicated to continuing this investigation beyond the premiere in June. Our piece that premieres in November will be centered around these same ideas but from a different vantage point. There are thousands of ways to tell someone who you are and we choose to do that with movement. 
Your support not only funds our collaborators but it helps our investigation. The ability to continue an inclusive dialogue about identity is why we create. We are proud to have a diverse cast with different backgrounds, and the ability to bring these people together. The goal is to create a relatable and raw experience for everyone involved.
 
""The movement [is] very physical, intrusive and confrontational"" 
""Fabian exposes the reality of accepting who we are, what we look like, and choices we make.""

what's to come?
We want to give back to our donors the best we can. We will be having a work in progress showing of unknow in June and after the premiere we will be hosting a mixer for all of our donors.

<h3>Announcement!</h3>
<p>""Bad Ass Beauty: The Rock Opera"" is an official selection of 2018 New York Musical Festival's Next Link Project!  Show dates have been announced at the largest Off Broadway Theater on Theater Row in the largest musical festival in the world!  Opening night is Wednesday, July 11th.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is <i>Bad Ass Beauty: The Rock Opera</i>
</h3>
<p>A new musical set to real rock music sung by an atypical rock vocalist who can wail.   It's like Hedwig &amp; The Angry Inch starring Aretha Franklin set to the music of Nine Inch Nails.</p>
<p>Aralyn Ford is an ugly duckling who never realized she was a swan thanks to years of abuse at the hands of her father.  She’s been careening through life putting everyone else’s needs before her own to the point where even she doesn’t know which face she’s going to be wearing that day.  Now, she’s on a quest to pull herself together and release her inner Alpha Female.  She, her multiple personalities and her hard rockin’ band of misfits tell it like it is in this rough, raw soliloquy of sound.</p>
<p><strong>Every dollar we raise with this campaign will go towards our upcoming production in New York City and it is coming up quickly!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>So... it's important because.....</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>This is actual rock n' roll.  The music and lyrics are unapologetic and the vocals are like Janis Joplin... but bigger.  The style of music is not what one expects in musical theater.</li>
<li>The theme of female empowerment anchors the show.  Two of the three writers are women and the company is comprised of 10 women and 6 men... Now that's the way we like it!</li>
<li>You'll witness rock concert energy with deep, socially relevant contemporary issues... and it's funny as shit!</li>
<li>The diversity of all of the elements of this piece is appealing, which makes musical theater accessible to folks who might not normally check it out.   Therefore, the show broadens the audience for musical theater!</li>
</ul>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>January 10, 2018<br/>Dixon Place<br/>New York City</i></p>
<p><strong><i>Going South</i></strong> takes place in North Carolina, today (2017). On a normal Monday morning, four cases appear on the same docket: ""Custody,"" ""Cake,"" ""Co-Eds,"" and ""Coco."" The cases deal with divorce, discrimination, campus rape, and transgender issues, respectively. <i>Going South</i> addresses the outdated and outrageous laws that still reign supreme in the American South in the 21st Century.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why tell this story?</h3>
<p><i>Going South </i>addresses many difficult topics at the forefront of current political discussion, so we believe it to be an important piece of current musical theatre. As the show is in its early stages of development, this initial production will benefit immensely from a rehearsal process and audience, which is why we have decided to accept Dixon Place's offer for the workshop performance. Combined with great storytelling and music, this initial in-progress workshop production will attract attention and visibility the show needs to continue growing and developing towards Off-Broadway and touring destinations in the future.</p>

<p>THML Theatre Company is dedicated to the growth and development of projects such as Going South, and we are equipped with both positivity and realistic expectations.

Going South takes place in North Carolina, today (2017). On a normal Monday morning, four cases appear on the same docket: ""Custody,"" ""Cake,"" ""Co-Eds,"" and ""Coco."" The cases deal with divorce, discrimination, campus rape, and transgender issues, respectively. Going South addresses the outdated and outrageous laws that still reign supreme in the American South in the 21st Century.
Why tell this story?
Going South addresses many difficult topics at the forefront of current political discussion, so we believe it to be an important piece of current musical theatre. As the show is in its early stages of development, this initial production will benefit immensely from a rehearsal process and audience, which is why we have decided to accept Dixon Place's offer for the workshop performance. Combined with great storytelling and music, this initial in-progress workshop production will attract attention and visibility the show needs to continue growing and developing towards Off-Broadway and touring destinations in the future.

The title song, ""Going South.""
Why Dixon Place? 
Dixon Place is a non-profit cultural institution that has nurtured over 10,000 artists in its 30 year history. DP presents new works & works-in-progress in theater, music, dance, literature, performance art, puppetry, variety, circus arts, burlesque and visual art. Providing an opportunity for artists to develop new work is the core of their mission. Katya Stanislavskaya, THML Theatre Co., Kayla Friend, and John Albert Harris are honored to be given this opportunity to bring Going South as a work-in-progress to such a prestigious theatre for new works in the city.

Kayla Friend and the THML Theatre Co. team is also gearing up for their third fully staged production, Trial by Ashley Griffin, which will be directed by Lori Petty, running at the American Theatre of Actors Beckmann Theater throughout January 2018.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>GUNPOWDER was selected for the 2018 FailSafe Festival, a five-day festival of live performance, taking place in the Times Square/Hell's Kitchen area of New York City. FailSafe Festival provides a space for artists to push beyond what they consider ""safe"" to present, giving them an opportunity to show work that may not have a home elsewhere.</p>
<p>GUNPOWDER tells the story of two of the most notorious, influential, and wealthy entrepreneurs and burlesque performers of the young United States, while blurring the past and the present. Klondike Kate entertained miners in the Yukon, generating a fortune with her infamous dances and wit, and invested, lost, and invested again in theatre spaces and cinemas across the nation. Lillian Russell sang and danced her way to the top of American society, becoming one of the first obsessed-over celebrities. She shaped the fledgling Actors Equity Association, advocated for women's suffrage, and contributed to the passage of the restrictive Immigration Act of 1924. Kate is a stubborn, fiercely independent survivor who also gives away her fortune for love. Lillian is a loveable, excitable, brilliant woman, who is also a racist isolationist. The form itself of burlesque lampooned powerful elite and served as an economic avenue for its female starts’ independence while using blackface and redface to make a buck and a laugh. The show will explore these contradictions and paradoxes while engulfing the audience in satire, evocative dance, and live music.</p>

Esta imagen idealizada, que los medios colaboran con proyectar, oculta las verdaderas experiencias que vivimos las mujeres en torno a la maternidad y la no maternidad. Creemos que el primer paso en la búsqueda de nuestros derechos y libertades es compartir nuestras experiencias entre mujeres.</p><p><strong>Proyecto MATERNIDADES </strong>es una investigación escénica documental sobre los derechos sexuales y reproductivos de las mujeres en el Perú. El resultado del proyecto es una obra de teatro testimonial que pone en escena a seis mujeres, quienes comparten sus historias de vida a partir de sus distintas experiencias con la maternidad y la no maternidad. Esta obra de teatro es un espacio para reconocemos en las otras y en las problemáticas que compartimos.</p><p>El proceso de creación de<strong> MATERNIDADES tiene tres etapas:</strong></p><p><strong>1. Investigación: </strong>Realizamos entrevistas a diferentes mujeres en Lima sobre sus experiencias en relación a la maternidad y la no maternidad. También organizamos un espacio de encuentro colectivo: La Feria de la mujer chorrillana, donde conversamos con las mujeres del barrio de Chorrillos sobre sus decisiones de maternidad.</p><p><strong>2. Laboratorio:</strong> Luego convocamos a seis mujeres entrevistadas en la etapa anterior a formar parte de un laboratorio de tres meses, en el que a la vez profundizamos en sus testimonios y compartimos dinámicas artísticas. Este ha sido un espacio increíble de encuentro y diálogo entre experiencias y posiciones absolutamente diferentes, pero que comparten mucho.</p><p><strong>3.  Montaje:</strong> Actualmente trabajamos en la organización en escena de los testimonios y documentos recogidos durante el proceso, para crear una obra de teatro testimonial. Este año presentaremos el proyecto en dos funciones de ingreso gratuito. Las funciones serán en el Teatro de la Universidad del Pacífico el 25 y 26 de noviembre.</p><p><strong>¿Quiénes somos?</strong></p><p>Somos un equipo multidisciplinario de artistas escénicxs, plásticxs y audiovisuales que venimos trabajando desde hace más de un año en la creación y gestión de este proyecto. Leonor Estrada y Maricarmen Gutiérrez, directoras artísticas, son directoras de teatro, performers y activistas feministas. Leonor ha trabajado como directora adjunta de obras de teatro testimonial, como “Desde afuera”, dirigida por Sebastián Rubio y Gabriel de La Cruz y “Tregua”, de Sebastián Rubio. Maricarmen ha dirigido y participado en performances en espacios públicos en el marco de campañas por la despenalización del aborto en casos de violación en el Perú como Déjala Decidir y Todas somos Mariana.</p><p><strong>Nuestro equipo</strong></p><p>Testimoniantes: Gina Guerrero, Haydee Massoni, Hellen Meier, Lilith Albornoz, Olga Mori, Verónica Ferrari</p><p>Productora: Milagros Felipe</p><p>Director de arte: Jorge Baldeón</p><p>Dirección audiovisual: Gabriela Urco</p><p>Jefa de comunicaciones: Karen Bernedo</p><p>Asistencia de producción: Jimena Acuña</p><p>Asesorxs de gestión: Silvia Tomotaki y Alejandro Larco</p><p>Directoras: Leonor Estrada y Maricarmen Gutiérrez</p><p>Este proyecto es una iniciativa artística independiente que ha recibido el respaldo de artistas e investigadorxs y de instituciones como el Goethe Institute- Perú, Teatro de la Universidad del Pacífico, Centro Cultural de España en Lima, PROMSEX y El Centro Cultural Cine Olaya. El apoyo de estxs aliadxs nos ha permitido concretar las dos primeras etapas del proceso y garantizar el espacio y la cobertura de las necesidades técnicas para las presentaciones que tendremos en el mes de noviembre.</p><p><strong>Tu donación </strong>nos permitirá concluir la última etapa del proceso de creación, el montaje.

<li>Cubrir los costos de movilidad y honorarios de las seis participantes</li>
<li>Cubrir los costos del diseño y producción de escenografía, vestuario y video del montaje.</li>

Muchas gracias por ayudarnos a hacer realidad este sueño.</p><p>¡Te esperamos el 25 de Noviembre!</p><p>Para más información puedes escribir a <strong>proyectomaternidades@gmail.com </strong>o a <strong>milagros.obando@gmail.com</strong></p><p>________________________</p><p><strong>About the project:</strong></p><p>In Peru, maternity is still seen by society and by the state as an obligation of women, a blessing, and a goal we should all aspire to. This idealized image, which the media helps to project, hides the real experiences that women live around maternity and non-maternity. We believe the first step to take in the search of our rights and freedom is to share our experiences among women.</p><p>The <strong>MATERNITIES Project</strong> is a performing documentary research about the sexual and reproductive rights of women in Peru. The project’s result is a testimonial play that puts on stage six women, who share their life stories from their maternity and non-maternity experiences. This play is a space to recognize ourselves among each other and the problems that we share.</p><p>The creation process of <strong>MATERNITIES</strong> <strong>has three phases:</strong></p><p><strong>Research:</strong> We interviewed various women in Lima about their experiences in regards of Maternity and non-Maternity. We also organized a space for a community meeting: La Feria de la Mujer Chorrillana (Women from Chorrillos Fair), where we talked with women from the neighborhood of Chorrillos about their maternity decisions.</p><p><strong>Laboratory: </strong>We called six women, who had been interviewed in the previous phase, to become part of a three-month laboratory, where we deepen in their testimonies and share artistic dynamics. This has been an incredible space for encounter and dialogue between completely different experiences and positions, that share many things in common.</p><p>Production: We are currently working in the organization of the testimonies and documents collected throughout the process, to create a testimonial play. This year we will present the project twice and free of admission.

Esta imagen idealizada, que los medios colaboran con proyectar, oculta las verdaderas experiencias que vivimos las mujeres en torno a la maternidad y la no maternidad. Creemos que el primer paso en la búsqueda de nuestros derechos y libertades es compartir nuestras experiencias entre mujeres.Proyecto MATERNIDADES es una investigación escénica documental sobre los derechos sexuales y reproductivos de las mujeres en el Perú. El resultado del proyecto es una obra de teatro testimonial que pone en escena a seis mujeres, quienes comparten sus historias de vida a partir de sus distintas experiencias con la maternidad y la no maternidad. Esta obra de teatro es un espacio para reconocemos en las otras y en las problemáticas que compartimos.El proceso de creación de MATERNIDADES tiene tres etapas:1. Investigación: Realizamos entrevistas a diferentes mujeres en Lima sobre sus experiencias en relación a la maternidad y la no maternidad. También organizamos un espacio de encuentro colectivo: La Feria de la mujer chorrillana, donde conversamos con las mujeres del barrio de Chorrillos sobre sus decisiones de maternidad.2. Laboratorio: Luego convocamos a seis mujeres entrevistadas en la etapa anterior a formar parte de un laboratorio de tres meses, en el que a la vez profundizamos en sus testimonios y compartimos dinámicas artísticas. Este ha sido un espacio increíble de encuentro y diálogo entre experiencias y posiciones absolutamente diferentes, pero que comparten mucho.3.  Montaje: Actualmente trabajamos en la organización en escena de los testimonios y documentos recogidos durante el proceso, para crear una obra de teatro testimonial. Este año presentaremos el proyecto en dos funciones de ingreso gratuito. Las funciones serán en el Teatro de la Universidad del Pacífico el 25 y 26 de noviembre.¿Quiénes somos?Somos un equipo multidisciplinario de artistas escénicxs, plásticxs y audiovisuales que venimos trabajando desde hace más de un año en la creación y gestión de este proyecto. Leonor Estrada y Maricarmen Gutiérrez, directoras artísticas, son directoras de teatro, performers y activistas feministas. Leonor ha trabajado como directora adjunta de obras de teatro testimonial, como “Desde afuera”, dirigida por Sebastián Rubio y Gabriel de La Cruz y “Tregua”, de Sebastián Rubio. Maricarmen ha dirigido y participado en performances en espacios públicos en el marco de campañas por la despenalización del aborto en casos de violación en el Perú como Déjala Decidir y Todas somos Mariana.Nuestro equipoTestimoniantes: Gina Guerrero, Haydee Massoni, Hellen Meier, Lilith Albornoz, Olga Mori, Verónica FerrariProductora: Milagros FelipeDirector de arte: Jorge BaldeónDirección audiovisual: Gabriela UrcoJefa de comunicaciones: Karen BernedoAsistencia de producción: Jimena AcuñaAsesorxs de gestión: Silvia Tomotaki y Alejandro LarcoDirectoras: Leonor Estrada y Maricarmen GutiérrezEste proyecto es una iniciativa artística independiente que ha recibido el respaldo de artistas e investigadorxs y de instituciones como el Goethe Institute- Perú, Teatro de la Universidad del Pacífico, Centro Cultural de España en Lima, PROMSEX y El Centro Cultural Cine Olaya. El apoyo de estxs aliadxs nos ha permitido concretar las dos primeras etapas del proceso y garantizar el espacio y la cobertura de las necesidades técnicas para las presentaciones que tendremos en el mes de noviembre.Tu donación nos permitirá concluir la última etapa del proceso de creación, el montaje. Lo recaudado en esta campaña será invertido en:
Cubrir los costos de movilidad y honorarios de las seis participantes
Cubrir los costos del diseño y producción de escenografía, vestuario y video del montaje.

This idealized image, which the media helps to project, hides the real experiences that women live around maternity and non-maternity. We believe the first step to take in the search of our rights and freedom is to share our experiences among women.The MATERNITIES Project is a performing documentary research about the sexual and reproductive rights of women in Peru. The project’s result is a testimonial play that puts on stage six women, who share their life stories from their maternity and non-maternity experiences. This play is a space to recognize ourselves among each other and the problems that we share.The creation process of MATERNITIES has three phases:Research: We interviewed various women in Lima about their experiences in regards of Maternity and non-Maternity. We also organized a space for a community meeting: La Feria de la Mujer Chorrillana (Women from Chorrillos Fair), where we talked with women from the neighborhood of Chorrillos about their maternity decisions.Laboratory: We called six women, who had been interviewed in the previous phase, to become part of a three-month laboratory, where we deepen in their testimonies and share artistic dynamics. This has been an incredible space for encounter and dialogue between completely different experiences and positions, that share many things in common.Production: We are currently working in the organization of the testimonies and documents collected throughout the process, to create a testimonial play. This year we will present the project twice and free of admission. It will take place in the Theatre of the Universidad del Pacifico the 25th and 26th of November.Who are we?We are a multidisciplinary team of performing, plastic and media artists, that have been working together for over a year in the creation and management of this project.

<h3>Who and What is No Peeking Theatre?</h3>
<p>No Peeking restructures theatre by providing a 'Blind' Theatrical Experience.  The audience is blinded for the entirety of the show and the play is augmented with sensory and immersive elements that stimulate other senses such as taste, smell, touch, and hearing.  </p>
<p>No Peeking Theatre is comprised of a Board of Directors, a Design Team, A Full Cast, Stage Crew, and of course our current playwright!</p>
<p>This new structure has created accessibility to theatre in multiple ways. From Casting to our designers and production staff our mission is to recreate the ""face"" of theatre. We give volume to new voices with new stories, for all to access and identify with! </p>
<p>THIS SUMMER, our goal is to raise $9000 to bring our latest production ""The Shit Show"", home to the playwright, in Los Angeles California! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Los Angeles is a BIG STEP.</h3>
<p>The money we raise is towards the travel, development, marketing, rental space, rehearsals, and everything that goes into making a No Peeking Production!  we have a cast of 9, and a crew of 8!  This is no easy feat and we NEED YOUR HELP! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What's the Big Deal?</h3>
<p>Premiering in Los Angeles will be one of our most ambitious moves in order to expand our company. As we are transitioning into a <strong>non profit THIS YEAR</strong>, we want to further our reach and share this accessible, diverse, innovative theatre with the world.  Los Angeles will be the first and most important step, but trust me it won't be the last! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Biggest Obstacles! </h3>
<p>Three things we always need, no matter what show? </p>
<p>SPACE, PROMOTION, AND A RELIABLE TEAM! </p>
<p>Luckily, we already have a Board of Trustees that help guide No Peeking, a full cast of 9, and a full crew of 8 people!  So that just leaves Space and Promotion.  Both of these in Los Angeles are not easy nor free. Every single dollar counts, so even if it's just $5, you've helped in some way with our production!</p>

<h3><strong>About the Show...</strong></h3>
<p>From the classic John Thompson lesson books, daily piano practicing and ticking metronomes, Cynthia enjoyed her cheerful Colorado childhood of music-making. All it took was picking up a random New Yorker magazine in her pediatrician’s office to awaken her artistic soul and fixate her desires on New York City and its ​esteemed​ Manhattan School of Music.</p>
<p>Realizing her musical “holy grail”, however, proves to be a bit more difficult than she innocently expected. As she struggles with her self-sabotaging demons, shaky memorization, insufficient technique and the fear that no one truly wants to listen to her play, she masters resilience.<br/>She endures sweltering practice rooms, music-hating neighbors, condescending teachers AND a falling piano. These and other obstacles confront this naive, wide-eyed young classical pianist who tackles the Big Apple!</p>
<p>In this autobiographical show, Cynthia embodies the youthful determination of her younger self as well as the many idiosyncratic characters who inspired her, each of whom impresses in their own unique kindly, worldly, insightful, brilliant, intimidating and arrogant way. She thrills her audience with musical impersonations of world-famous classical pianists as she remembers hearing them at the legendary Carnegie Hall. ​AND​...she beautifully demonstrates her own musical sensitivity and formidable technique performing live classical piano music, featuring Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Debussy and Schubert. <a href=""http://www.VelvetDetermination.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.VelvetDetermination.com</a></p>

From the classic John Thompson lesson books, daily piano practicing and ticking metronomes, Cynthia enjoyed her cheerful Colorado childhood of music-making. All it took was picking up a random New Yorker magazine in her pediatrician’s office to awaken her artistic soul and fixate her desires on New York City and its ​esteemed​ Manhattan School of Music.
Realizing her musical “holy grail”, however, proves to be a bit more difficult than she innocently expected. As she struggles with her self-sabotaging demons, shaky memorization, insufficient technique and the fear that no one truly wants to listen to her play, she masters resilience.She endures sweltering practice rooms, music-hating neighbors, condescending teachers AND a falling piano. These and other obstacles confront this naive, wide-eyed young classical pianist who tackles the Big Apple!
In this autobiographical show, Cynthia embodies the youthful determination of her younger self as well as the many idiosyncratic characters who inspired her, each of whom impresses in their own unique kindly, worldly, insightful, brilliant, intimidating and arrogant way. She thrills her audience with musical impersonations of world-famous classical pianists as she remembers hearing them at the legendary Carnegie Hall. ​AND​...she beautifully demonstrates her own musical sensitivity and formidable technique performing live classical piano music, featuring Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, Debussy and Schubert. www.VelvetDetermination.com

<h3><i>Sleeping Giant</i></h3>
<p><i>""Mable, I think you'll find that people don't need to be made to do horrible things. In fact, I think you'll find that many people are just looking for a reason to do horrible things. And as soon as that reason comes along, off they go to do the things that would shock you.""</i></p>
<p>- The Butterfly King</p>
<p>From the deliciously twisted mind of writer <strong>Steve Yockey</strong> (TV's <i>Supernatural </i>and <i>Scream</i>) comes a brand new pitch black comedy, <i>Sleeping Giant</i>. When Ryan's firework-filled marriage proposal awakens an ancient creature in a nearby lake, residents of the surrounding town become consumed by stories about ""the thing"" and the strange effects it is having on those who touch it. </p>
<p>Starring Tony Award-winner <strong>Daisy Eagan</strong>, <strong>Adam Silver</strong> (Showtime's <i>Masters Of Sex</i>), <strong>Rick Cosnett</strong> (The CW's <i>The Vampire Diaries</i> and <i>The Flash</i>), and <strong>Katherine Skelton</strong> and from director <strong>Michael Matthews</strong> (2010's Edinburgh Fringe hit <i>The Bacchae</i>) and producers <strong>Nathan Frizzell</strong> (last year's hit <i>Tilda Swinton Answers an Ad On Craigslist</i>), <strong>Christopher Sepulveda</strong> and <strong>Mark Giberson</strong>, this creepy little play is a little too much like our world right now. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Aim</h3>
<p>Producing at The Edinburgh Fringe Festival- especially when traveling from outside the UK- can be an expensive proposition. We are seeking to raise <strong>$10,000</strong> to help us cover <i>only part</i> of our total budget- which includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production costs</li>
<li>Travel for both cast and production staff</li>
<li>Lodging for both cast and production staff</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Your help will ensure that we produce a thrilling, cutting-edge production of this terrific new work by such an exciting author. <i>Sleeping Giant</i> is a play that deserves to be seen by audiences near and far. Please note also that, as we are producing <i>Sleeping Giant</i> in association with the non-profit Celebration Theatre, everything that is contributed to this campaign is <u>tax-deductible</u> and will go directly to production costs and fees. </p>

<h2>""THE DOG THE NIGHT AND THE KNIFE"":</h2>
<p>In its heart of hearts, Marius von Mayenburg’s play The Dog, The Night, and The Knife is a dystopian love story.</p>
<p>In the nameless Kafkaesque town in the middle of the endless night time is stuck at 5.05 (or is it S.O.S?). The character of ""M"" is hunted down and trying to survive until morning. A dystopian Reality Trip ridden by blood-thirsty strangers, shape-shifting characters, rampant wolves and humans, and fatal knife wounds. ""M"" is trying to make sense of the absurd and hallucinatory world. In this town, desire to love translates into desire to possess. In this town, your lover is your prey. In this town, I want you translates into I want to eat you. Quite literally.</p>
<p>That is until M meets Younger Sister.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>It is a pleasure to meet you!! My name is Tamara Adira and I’m artistic director of Arte y Pasión, a San Antonio based company known for pushing the boundaries of flamenco and Spanish dance and one of the most contemporary Spanish dance companies in the country.  Every performance is a chance to build on our joyful and experimental approach while allowing us to repeat and perfect our work.  We see our work as an opportunity to generate abundance for the arts community in greater San Antonio, and we’ve been around for over 10 years. </p>
<p>We have launched this campaign to give you, our public, the opportunity to contribute directly to our upcoming season.  Due to funding cuts to the arts, government closures and funding freezes, we have noticed funding grind to a slow trickle for arts across the country.  At a time we need the most to speak out on human rights crises here in our backyard, it is crucial to us that we keep moving forward, as our expression is our work.  </p>
<p>In this light, we have decided that 2019 would be the year we focus entirely on human rights issues.   Your contribution will empower and enable us to continue.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have 60 days to run this campaign.  Since I told myself “Go Big or Go Home,” we are shooting for the stars and are asking for $18K. If we fall short of this, we will also make it work.  Depending on how much this campaign makes, we will in turn scale the size and impact of our season.  </p>
<p>A small production can be made for approximately $2-4K, and a medium sized one $12K.  We would like to put on 5-6 small productions over the upcoming season.  Your funds will go to these places, including but not limited to: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Renting the theater:</strong> the spaces we work in have utility bills, upkeep, and staff to pay.  As much as they would like to give us their space for free, we wish to compensate them for what they provide us with. </li>
<li>
<strong>Compensating our artists:  </strong>Your funds will pay for hours and hours of rehearsal time, equipment, costumes, study time, and artistic honoraria. Many of our artists only do this work for a living. Your contribution will help these artists continue to pursue their work and continue to perfect their art.</li>
<li>
<strong>Travel: </strong>Your funds will help defray costs of travel for visiting artists. </li>
<li>
<strong>Classes and continued study: </strong>Your contribution will enable us to continue our studies and continue to improve our work. </li>
<li>
<strong>Administrative costs:</strong> Your funds will defray the costs for our proposal team, who works hours and hours preparing documents for each production, press releases, publicity, and administrative support. </li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is valuable to me, and it is valuable to the world because we are using the art of flamenco as a vehicle to spread the message of kindness, peace, and compassion.  </p>
<p>The art of flamenco is here and strong in San Antonio for a definitive reason. When the Spaniards looked for hospitable land here in the New World, they settled here.  Flamenco prevails as testimony to a civilization evolving in complexity. San Antonio emerges parallel to Spain in many ways for her climate, culture, and landscape, with the art of flamenco very much a presence in our daily lives.  </p>
<p>A true sign of advancement in a civilization is the arts.  Arte y Pasión, a member of San Antonio Dance Umbrella, has been a major player in the dance and music community of San Antonio and Texas since 2010. We explore evolution and specific subject matter while preserving the foundation of the great art form, inscribed in 2010 by UNESCO on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  We have participated as an a DreamWeek Partner and with the Artist Foundation. </p>

<h2>What does Pastich<strong>e mean?</strong>
</h2>
<p>•  A pastiche is an artwork that copies the style of another work or that combines various, distinct styles together into one work. A pastiche can also be a musical medley, or the piecing together of various songs.</p>
<p>•A piece of art, music, literature, etc. that intentionally copies the style of someone else’s work or is intentionally in various styles, or the practice of marking art in either of these ways.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<p>Hi, I’m Britt Quentin, creator and writer of Pastiche.  I’ve been in the entertainment  industry professionally for over 25 years as a performer, vocal arranger, record producer, artistic director, music teacher, and writer.  I recently finished a 10-year stint as Resident Director for a long-running, successful show in London’s prestigious West End.  This culmination of experiences have led me to create Pastiche.</p>
<p>This show is a modern ‘nod’ to Broadway, using the melodies and lyrics of these songs in a new and interesting way.  Whilst all of the songs are indeed from Broadway Musicals, most people won’t realize this  because these songs are fairly familiar to the general public.  The twist is,  these songs are re-arranged, remixed, or mashed-up with  top-40 songs from other decades.  This is  a concert-style, trendy, production show that is equal parts artistic, innovative, and classy, yet edgy, unapologetic, and highly entertaining.</p>
<p>The show is written for 8 singers, and these highly skilled vocalists will tilt the scale towards classy and poetic as they sing in elaborate harmony together, while maintaining dynamic individual solo voices and stage personas.  These singers are combined with commercially-trained, but technically advanced dancers who will tilt the scale towards edgy and commercial entertainment.  A live band, including a horn section, supports this outfit which stylistically covers everything from Pop, Rock, and R&amp;B, to Jazz, Swing, and Salsa.  This creation is truly where artistic excellence meets bold, ‘in-your-face’ entertainment.  This is not a typical Cabaret or Tribute show recreating visual imagery and scenes we’ve seen before from the original stage productions.  It feels more like a concert, less like a legit broadway show.  This is something new and progressive combining theatre, music videos, and commercially televised dance shows, with the sounds of your favorite vocal groups and the aesthetic of top-40 concert tours from today’s biggest artists.</p>
<p>The goal right now is to raise money to film a short (promo-style) video of the show to have something tangible to show producers and production companies.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>History</strong></h2>
<p>I started writing this show back in 2013 while I was Resident Director on another show in London.   During this time, I was commissioned to write a couple of vocal arrangements for a European singing group, and I noticed the chosen songs had a similar theme.  They were all Jazz Standards that originated as ‘show tunes’. The group disbanded before I finished the charts, but I was intrigued by the underlining theme, so…I kept writing.  I’ve always loved vocal ensembles of any style:  The Carpenters,  Earth, Wind, and Fire, The Beach Boys,  any Motown group,  The Manhattan Transfer, The Rascal Flats, Take 6 ( to name a few).  These sounds are always present  in most of what I create.  This idea and the sound created for Pastiche has turned into a combination of all the things that I love:  great entertainment, ensemble singing, extended harmonies, arena shows, dance, music videos, and the magic of theatre.  I couldn’t be more excited about it!  I want people to experience entertainment in a new way with this show…in a way that challenges them, moves them, impresses them, inspires them….and not only in the way that entertains them .</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Team</strong></h2>
<p>I’ve met many incredibly talented people on my journey, and I’ve recruited  some of these creative treasures to help me construct this short video.  This team of seasoned singers (and professional dancers) were all sought-after, hard-working soldiers of the entertainment industry, pre Covid, and all have beautiful souls passionate about bringing this project to life.</p>
<p><i><strong>Aubrie Hamrick</strong></i></p>
<p>From Denver, Colorado, Aubrie has been singing all her life,  everything from opera and Disney to classic rock and Motown. In the last few years she’s had the opportunity to perform with Hans Zimmer at 1STBANK Center, Ramin Djawadi in the Game of Thrones Concert Experience, and with Cirque Dreams Holidaze. She made her Red Rocks debut with Megan Burtt and the Cure for Love in 2016, and in 2018 she had the pleasure of working with the incredible Susan Draus on her new productions, Reunion ‘85 and Reunion ‘69.  Aubrie is honored (and thrilled!) to be apart of the Pastiche journey!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Samantha Johnson</strong></i></p>
<p>Samantha is a singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and actress originally from Southeastern Massachusetts and currently living in Las Vegas.  Formerly of ‘Thriller Live’ West End and world-touring productions, Samantha placed as a semi-finalist on Season 10 of American’s Got Talent and went on to self-release her debut EP 27UNDERGROUND.  She now stars in 'Vegas! The show' and Michael Jackson ONE by Cirque du Soleil, both on the Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Jill Marie Burke</strong></i></p>
<p>Jill is a Los Angeles - based professional singer, and has portrayed Disney characters such as Princess Jasmine, Ariel, &amp; Pocahontas, and is also a Jingle singer for the popular ""Priceline Negotiator!"" commercials.   For the last 20 years, she’s been The National Anthem vocalist for the Anaheim Angels.   Jill also has her own band playing tribute to Pat Benatar, called “LIVE FROM EARTH”, and debuted Pat Benatar as a headliner in ‘Legends in Concert’ on the world-famous Las Vegas Strip.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Taylor O’Donnell</strong></i></p>
<p>Known for her exploratory use of vocal timbre and texture in her musical stylings, Taylor O’Donnell uses her roots in R&amp;B, folk, jazz, rock, and classical music training to communicate her unique musical dialogue. Highlights of Taylor’s career have been an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show working with producer David Foster, performances at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in NYC, her time working with Grammy award winning producer Rudy Perez in Miami, and has been a featured soloist with symphony orchestras throughout New England.  Taylor is known as the front-woman for retro-soul band, Mother Superior &amp; The Sliding Royales, the electronica duo Novel/Novella, and is the lead soprano in the Boston-based vocal group, Vintage Vocal Quartet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Britt Quentin</strong></i></p>
<p>This dynamic vocalist, producer, director, musician, and prolific song-writer has traveled the world on the laurels of his music, touring with many different ensembles over the years.  His formal training in voice, piano, and violin, in conjunction with his experience in bands and vocal ensembles, gives him a unique perspective on the execution of music and entertainment.  Britt’s also had the honor of sharing the stage with a host of artists from pop superstars like Stevie Wonder, Sheryl Crow, Babyface, Lionel Richie, Kid Rock, and John Meyer to Jazz legends like Natalie Cole, Herbie Hancock, and Kenny G.  Now living in Las Vegas, he recently finished a 10-year run as Resident Director of ‘Thriller Live’ in London, and is the creator and writer of ‘Pastiche’.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Fletcher Sheridan</strong></i></p>
<p>Fletcher Sheridan has been singing professionally for over 25 years, and has made a name for himself as an outlier of versatility with his background, which spans the classical, jazz and pop worlds.  Fletcher’s credits are a veritable who’s who of the musical world – John Williams, Michel Jackson, Sir Paul McCartney, and Bobby McFerrin to name a few. He has sung on countless movie scores, most recently contributing his vocal talents to the scores of Lion King, Mulan &amp; Call of the Wild. His TV credits include multiple spots for Family Guy, The Simpsons, Glee, and Elena of Avalor.  In the choral/classical world, Fletcher was a member of the prestigious Los Angeles Master Chorale, and sang with the Grammy-Award® winning Los Angeles Chamber Singers. Bringing all of his experiences together, Fletcher has become a sought-after vocal arranger and vocal producer. He has gone on to contract vocal sessions for film, TV, and live entertainment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Jarrett Johnson</strong></i></p>
<p>Jarrett is a Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter living in Los Angeles, CA.  He’s traveled the world with various acts including Michael Bublé and Take 6, been featured on projects by Quincy Jones, David Foster, and Childish Gambino, and performed behind numerous artists like Billie Eilish, Alicia Keys, Kristen Chenoweth, Jamie Foxx, and Cynthia Erivo.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What we need </h2>
<p>Creatively, most of the show is conceived, all the music is written, and the majority of the project has been digitally staged.  Your support will go towards funding the video needed to show potential producers and investors an idea of what the show will ultimately look like.  Your generosity will go towards getting the team to Las Vegas, rehearsal space, theatre rental, equipment rental, hotels, audio/video needs, and team stipends. And remember, you don't have to  donate an amount listed and receive perks associated with that amount, any amount is is acceptable and you don't have to sign up for perks!</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>Creating anything new has its natural challenges.  But, at this point,  the only challenge for me is raising the funds to logistically get the video filmed!  The team is ready to go.  Luckily, most of us have worked together before on previous shows, or other gigs.  Everyone is very experienced with what we’re trying to achieve and I’m confident we’d be able to overcome any artistic or technical  challenges that could potentially set us back.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Ways you can help</strong></h2>
<p>While a financial donation, big or small, will help, it’s understandable during this time of uncertainty that not everyone is in a position to give monetarily.  So, you can always help by spreading the word and sharing the campaign page with others!!</p>

The group disbanded before I finished the charts, but I was intrigued by the underlining theme, so…I kept writing.  I’ve always loved vocal ensembles of any style:  The Carpenters,  Earth, Wind, and Fire, The Beach Boys,  any Motown group,  The Manhattan Transfer, The Rascal Flats, Take 6 ( to name a few).  These sounds are always present  in most of what I create.  This idea and the sound created for Pastiche has turned into a combination of all the things that I love:  great entertainment, ensemble singing, extended harmonies, arena shows, dance, music videos, and the magic of theatre.  I couldn’t be more excited about it!  I want people to experience entertainment in a new way with this show…in a way that challenges them, moves them, impresses them, inspires them….and not only in the way that entertains them .
 
The Team
I’ve met many incredibly talented people on my journey, and I’ve recruited  some of these creative treasures to help me construct this short video.  This team of seasoned singers (and professional dancers) were all sought-after, hard-working soldiers of the entertainment industry, pre Covid, and all have beautiful souls passionate about bringing this project to life.
Aubrie Hamrick
From Denver, Colorado, Aubrie has been singing all her life,  everything from opera and Disney to classic rock and Motown. In the last few years she’s had the opportunity to perform with Hans Zimmer at 1STBANK Center, Ramin Djawadi in the Game of Thrones Concert Experience, and with Cirque Dreams Holidaze. She made her Red Rocks debut with Megan Burtt and the Cure for Love in 2016, and in 2018 she had the pleasure of working with the incredible Susan Draus on her new productions, Reunion ‘85 and Reunion ‘69.  Aubrie is honored (and thrilled!) to be apart of the Pastiche journey!
 
Samantha Johnson
Samantha is a singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and actress originally from Southeastern Massachusetts and currently living in Las Vegas.  Formerly of ‘Thriller Live’ West End and world-touring productions, Samantha placed as a semi-finalist on Season 10 of American’s Got Talent and went on to self-release her debut EP 27UNDERGROUND.  She now stars in 'Vegas! The show' and Michael Jackson ONE by Cirque du Soleil, both on the Las Vegas Strip.
 
Jill Marie Burke
Jill is a Los Angeles - based professional singer, and has portrayed Disney characters such as Princess Jasmine, Ariel, & Pocahontas, and is also a Jingle singer for the popular ""Priceline Negotiator!"" commercials.   For the last 20 years, she’s been The National Anthem vocalist for the Anaheim Angels.   Jill also has her own band playing tribute to Pat Benatar, called “LIVE FROM EARTH”, and debuted Pat Benatar as a headliner in ‘Legends in Concert’ on the world-famous Las Vegas Strip.
 
Taylor O’Donnell
Known for her exploratory use of vocal timbre and texture in her musical stylings, Taylor O’Donnell uses her roots in R&B, folk, jazz, rock, and classical music training to communicate her unique musical dialogue. Highlights of Taylor’s career have been an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey Show working with producer David Foster, performances at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center in NYC, her time working with Grammy award winning producer Rudy Perez in Miami, and has been a featured soloist with symphony orchestras throughout New England.  Taylor is known as the front-woman for retro-soul band, Mother Superior & The Sliding Royales, the electronica duo Novel/Novella, and is the lead soprano in the Boston-based vocal group, Vintage Vocal Quartet.
 
Britt Quentin
This dynamic vocalist, producer, director, musician, and prolific song-writer has traveled the world on the laurels of his music, touring with many different ensembles over the years.  His formal training in voice, piano, and violin, in conjunction with his experience in bands and vocal ensembles, gives him a unique perspective on the execution of music and entertainment.  Britt’s also had the honor of sharing the stage with a host of artists from pop superstars like Stevie Wonder, Sheryl Crow, Babyface, Lionel Richie, Kid Rock, and John Meyer to Jazz legends like Natalie Cole, Herbie Hancock, and Kenny G.  Now living in Las Vegas, he recently finished a 10-year run as Resident Director of ‘Thriller Live’ in London, and is the creator and writer of ‘Pastiche’.
 
Fletcher Sheridan
Fletcher Sheridan has been singing professionally for over 25 years, and has made a name for himself as an outlier of versatility with his background, which spans the classical, jazz and pop worlds.  Fletcher’s credits are a veritable who’s who of the musical world – John Williams, Michel Jackson, Sir Paul McCartney, and Bobby McFerrin to name a few. He has sung on countless movie scores, most recently contributing his vocal talents to the scores of Lion King, Mulan & Call of the Wild. His TV credits include multiple spots for Family Guy, The Simpsons, Glee, and Elena of Avalor.  In the choral/classical world, Fletcher was a member of the prestigious Los Angeles Master Chorale, and sang with the Grammy-Award® winning Los Angeles Chamber Singers. Bringing all of his experiences together, Fletcher has become a sought-after vocal arranger and vocal producer. He has gone on to contract vocal sessions for film, TV, and live entertainment.
 
Jarrett Johnson
Jarrett is a Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter living in Los Angeles, CA.  He’s traveled the world with various acts including Michael Bublé and Take 6, been featured on projects by Quincy Jones, David Foster, and Childish Gambino, and performed behind numerous artists like Billie Eilish, Alicia Keys, Kristen Chenoweth, Jamie Foxx, and Cynthia Erivo.
 
What we need 
Creatively, most of the show is conceived, all the music is written, and the majority of the project has been digitally staged.  Your support will go towards funding the video needed to show potential producers and investors an idea of what the show will ultimately look like.  Your generosity will go towards getting the team to Las Vegas, rehearsal space, theatre rental, equipment rental, hotels, audio/video needs, and team stipends. And remember, you don't have to  donate an amount listed and receive perks associated with that amount, any amount is is acceptable and you don't have to sign up for perks!
 
Risks and Challenges
Creating anything new has its natural challenges.  But, at this point,  the only challenge for me is raising the funds to logistically get the video filmed!  The team is ready to go.  Luckily, most of us have worked together before on previous shows, or other gigs.  Everyone is very experienced with what we’re trying to achieve and I’m confident we’d be able to overcome any artistic or technical  challenges that could potentially set us back.
 
Ways you can help
While a financial donation, big or small, will help, it’s understandable during this time of uncertainty that not everyone is in a position to give monetarily.  So, you can always help by spreading the word and sharing the campaign page with others!!

<h3><strong>Hey! What's this all about? Well, let us tell you.</strong></h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Sarah. I was born and raised in Chicago and I’ve never known life without dance, but I turned my life upside down when I moved to Nashville two years ago to follow my dream. Now, I am creating a space that allows other artists to realize their dreams. I need your help.</p>
<p>Dance is about movement, but too often, we find ourselves trapped within opposing structures, like ability vs. disability, professional vs. amateur, written vs. improvisation, mature vs. youth, ground vs. air. At least, that’s how I felt – so I created Satellite Dance. </p>
<p>Satellite Dance is a performing arts company that focuses on the exploration of contemporary dance from the ground and air. (In other words, we’re really into aerial dance!) We’re also so much more. We’re founded and powered by women, plus one woke man. <strong>We’re proud to promote inclusivity in a completely, unapologetically bold way, which only silks hanging from a ceiling can provide. </strong>We also believe in the healing power of movement. If you take a look inside our studio, you’ll see how movement has already brought our growing community together.</p>
<p>Speaking of, it’s only been two years, but our artists made it clear: they want more opportunities to engage in the performing arts community and to share their love of aerial dance with the community at large. I couldn’t be more excited to make that happen, but without your help, we’re stuck.</p>
<p>With your contribution, we can bring the power of movement to so many more artists in the greater Nashville area, who are just waiting to be self-discovered. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We’re fundraising for <strong>$34,500</strong>. </p>
<p>The money that we raise will be used to fund: </p>
<ol>
<li>Four (4) additional performance opportunities per year for our Youth, Community and Professional programs</li>
<li>Rehearsal stipends for choreographers and professional guest artists (because we take care of our own, Hunnie!)</li>
<li>Performance expenses, including costumes, lighting and sound rentals, space rentals, and music licensing</li>
</ol>
<p>We have so many artists in our community and we have awesome perks when you donate, including serious swag from pins to t-shirts, a surprise special gift from one of our artists, season tickets to Satellite performances, a dance in your honor (in fact, come dance with us!), advertising space on our website, and more!</p>
<p>We know we can. However, if we don’t reach our entire fundraising goal, our funds will be happily used to support: </p>
<ol>
<li>Additional performances, scaled-down in size and both rehearsal and space rental time</li>
<li>Performance outreach to populations in need, including local hospitals and community centers</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Here’s our reality today:</p>
<p>All performances are currently being held at So Fly Studio with donated space and materials, from aerial rigging to lighting to music to insurance, which means that Satellite time is forfeited when studio space is reserved for paid services. </p>
<p>All of our participants, from the aerialists to the stage manager, are volunteers. These dedicated folks don’t receive any financial compensation for their time and commitment.</p>
<p>We’re losing out on opportunities to learn from, and work with, guest artists. With no financial compensation, we’re perpetuating the “work for exposure” issue.</p>
<p>The impact of these funds will instead ensure that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Satellite Dance can stand alone and have the budget to sublease, securing its own space for both rehearsal and performances for even more artists. </li>
<li>Satellite Dance can provide volunteer participants with some actual, tangible benefits (not just the warm-fuzzy feels!) that will impact their daily lives.</li>
<li>Satellite Dance can offer contracts to guest artists, helping to address and then solve the “work for exposure” issue, at least within our community. </li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>I run a small business. I get reality checks daily, so I personally have at least two burning questions that are always top of mind:</p>
<p>What if we don’t raise enough money?</p>
<p>What if no one comes to the performances?</p>
<p>However; because I already run a small business, I’ve got us covered thanks to prior experience in producing these performances as well as a strong network of support: </p>
<p><strong>We successfully produced (5) evening-length performances since April 2018.</strong> They were no high-school production value performances either. We were grateful and proud to partner with professional lighting experts and photographers, including a stage manager for run of show. We invited two guest artists from the Nashville community to pull in attendees outside our passionate community, and provided two shows: one for youth, one for adults. We also offered advanced ticket sales, to encourage a faster sell-out timeframe and guaranteed full house. Additionally, my experience in running similar performances provides me with an understanding of actualized costs to more accurately forecast future fees and expenses.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>If you can't financially contribute, we would greatly appreciate you spreading the word about Satellite Dance and our goal.</p>
<ol>
<li>Please share this campaign with your friends and coworkers.</li>
<li>Donate materials to our performance space: e.g. chairs, lights, costumes, set pieces!</li>
</ol> <p>Thank you so much for reading through some or all of this. We couldn’t do it without you!</p>

<p>After a lifetime
of struggling with my sexuality I finally came to terms with the fact that I am
and always have been bisexual. For better or worse I found myself 15 years into
an ailing marriage with two teen-aged kids when I came to this realization. </p>
<p>In the fall of
2009 I reluctantly drove my wife up to the top of Cypress mountain to tell her
what I'd come to learn about myself. I pulled over and parked on the shoulder
of the deserted road. Unable to speak, I stared out my side window to gather my
courage and savour the final moments of our previous life together, knowing
that things were about to change between us, irrevocably.<span>  </span></p>
<p>That night Lianna

each other to explore emotional and sexual landscapes beyond our fenced-in monogamous
garden. </p>
<p>No longer held
down by the ballast of monogamy, Lianna and I leapt off the cliff together and
immediately began to soar. What we discovered in the great land beyond was so
surprising, so amazing, so counter-intuitive and contrary to all we've been led
to believe about life without monogamous borders that we knew we had to talk
about it with others.</p>

individually and as a couple, discovering new levels of love, intimacy and
connection deeper than any we had ever imagined possible. </p>

one-person show, however; it encompasses an entire project, the scope of which
reaches far beyond the theatre. </p>
<p>In 2010 I began
writing ""Confessions of a Bisexual Husband"", the book version of our
story, upon which the play is based. As a formerly-closeted married bisexual

other form of relationship is pejorative at best, and punishable by death at
worst. </p>

<p>The sad irony is
that lifelong, heterosexual monogamous unions work for only a very small

This is an original play about us, our personal journey.  Confusion, marriage, almost divorce, revealing bisexuality, risking an open-relationship, jealousy, fear and the discovery of love - this one-man show tells it all!We have been through an incredible exploration together. We have been
married now for 20 years now, have two teenage kids, and are more in love than we have ever been. Knowing that there was little information out there, this was a journey we needed to talk about. This may be the
only piece of true theatre I've seen in 15 years in Vancouver. Remarkable, thought-provoking,
psyche stretching.... Go see it!""   - Jeffery Lando (Film Writer/Director)We have shown the play in Vancouver,  Seattle, Berkeley and Minneapolis. Now we are heading to New York and this is a BIG ONE. We need your help.
Great job. The performance was so raw and real.
We loved it!
-Kamala Devi (Speaker, Coach, star of HBO “Polyamory: Married & Dating)BUDGETWe'd like to
continue doing this work. We need your support right now to do so.
Presenting the
show in New York is a big deal, and the timing could not be more perfect. The budget is $8,500 US. The recent depreciation of the
Canadian dollar to the US means these costs have increased by over 20% for us,
putting the budget at $10,200 CDN.  
We'll be using
the money to pay for the hard costs of producing the show, food, lodging, and
transport. The numbers break down as follows:




Transportation


$1,700




Production Costs


$2,900




Hotel


$2,200




Food 


$1,700




Total:


$8,500

After a lifetime
of struggling with my sexuality I finally came to terms with the fact that I am
and always have been bisexual. For better or worse I found myself 15 years into
an ailing marriage with two teen-aged kids when I came to this realization. 
In the fall of
2009 I reluctantly drove my wife up to the top of Cypress mountain to tell her
what I'd come to learn about myself. I pulled over and parked on the shoulder
of the deserted road. Unable to speak, I stared out my side window to gather my
courage and savour the final moments of our previous life together, knowing
that things were about to change between us, irrevocably.  
That night Lianna
and I decided to throw our old marriage over the cliff of Cypress mountain, freeing
each other to explore emotional and sexual landscapes beyond our fenced-in monogamous
garden. 
No longer held
down by the ballast of monogamy, Lianna and I leapt off the cliff together and
immediately began to soar. What we discovered in the great land beyond was so
surprising, so amazing, so counter-intuitive and contrary to all we've been led
to believe about life without monogamous borders that we knew we had to talk
about it with others.
Opening our
relationship had saved our marriage, not ruined it. We began to flourish both
individually and as a couple, discovering new levels of love, intimacy and
connection deeper than any we had ever imagined possible. 
""Bi, Hung,
Fit... and Married"" is the theatrical version of our story, and represents
one of the many leaps we've been taking ever since our drive up to Cypress
mountain. ""Bi, Hung, Fit... and Married"" is much more than an
one-person show, however; it encompasses an entire project, the scope of which
reaches far beyond the theatre.

<p>Adolescent Anarchy (AA) is a start-up theatrical program in Des Moines, Iowa. AA was founded in 2012 by nine students from the Des Moines area who have come together sharing a common passion for the theatre. Our project's mission is to build a foundation of involvement for teens in the theatre by innovating the way theatre is viewed and produced. This year Adolescent Anarchy presents Big Fish: The Musical, which will be performed in the Viking Theater at Grandview University. You may be thinking, ""This seems like a challenging project for young adults to handle!"" However, our goal with Adolescent Anarchy is to prove teens are capable of handling much more than given credit for. We want to prove kids and young adults can rise to the occasion, and create a production not only on par with past productions across the country; but one that will exceed all expectations of what ""children"" are capable of.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are trying to raise the $6,000 dollars necessary to fully stage this production. The set, the costumes, the sound, and the makeup- everything a fully staged musical needs. DM Young Artists' Theatre fully supports this project and has provided us with space to rehearse as well as a home for Adolescent Anarchy's headquarters. Each member of the production team also works with the help of a mentor. These are professionals in each of the positions we, as teenagers, are taking on, who can advise us on our respective jobs, giving us help where we need it.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As everyone knows, putting on a <i>real</i> production takes <i>real</i> money. This money will fully costume all cast members, buy all the supplies necessary to build the set, and allow us to purchase and/or build the props we will need.</p>
<p>Adolescent Anarchy used Kickstarter in 2013 to fund our first production, Lord of the Flies. Our budget for this production was $4000 and we were lucky enough to reach that goal and end with $4500, allowing us to expand our original concepts into something greater.<br/><br/>Hopefully you find this as exciting as Adolescent Anarchy does! We hope that you'll consider donating to our cause; so we can not only produce this show, but leave a legacy  for future teens hoping to pursue their dreams of theatre.

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are obvious risks with a venture such as this. For example . . .</p>
<p>""What if you get the money, but nobody is interested in auditioning?"" <br/>Adolescent Anarchy has stirred much interest in the Des Moines theater community. In past year we have had no trouble finding a talented and well rounded cast. This year we are reaching out to more high school drama programs and trying to get more youth involved in the project.</p>
<p>""Do you really think this is an attainable production for such a young age group?"" <br/>Adolescent Anarchy has put on multiple successful productions in the few years of our existence. Every year we have succeeded in putting on a fully reimagined and well attended production. Though this is the biggest challenge we have given ourselves, the skills and lessons we have learned in these past years have fully prepared us for a production of this scale.</p>
<p>No only are we learning independence from this experience, we are also continuously gaining experience from professional mentors in our respective theatrical fields. We also discuss all actions and plans with David A. VanCleave, Artistic Director of DM Young Artists' Theatre.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>There is a lot more than money that goes into a production:</p>
<p>One very important volunteer position is that of an actor. Our auditions are on February 8th, 2015 at 6 pm. Actors will need to bring 16-32 measures of a prepared song with either a CD or piano accompaniment. Though Adolescent Anarchy is a teen led initiative, we plan on casting people of all ages, as we have done in the past. We will be casting around 10-12 women (ages 18+), 10-12 men (ages 18+), and 2-5 boys (ages 8-17), and 2-5 girls (Ages 8-17).</p>
<p>Backstage is just as important as being onstage. We will need a crew to do shift work as well as someone to run lights and sound.We also will need help with set builds and assistance with costuming. If this interests you, please email us at <a href=""mailto:adolescentanarchy1@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">adolescentanarchy1@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>If none of these options interest you, we would love for you to attend Big Fish, showing May 1-3 and May 8-10 as well as getting the word out about our project!</p>

In past year we have had no trouble finding a talented and well rounded cast. This year we are reaching out to more high school drama programs and trying to get more youth involved in the project.
""Do you really think this is an attainable production for such a young age group?"" Adolescent Anarchy has put on multiple successful productions in the few years of our existence. Every year we have succeeded in putting on a fully reimagined and well attended production. Though this is the biggest challenge we have given ourselves, the skills and lessons we have learned in these past years have fully prepared us for a production of this scale.
No only are we learning independence from this experience, we are also continuously gaining experience from professional mentors in our respective theatrical fields. We also discuss all actions and plans with David A. VanCleave, Artistic Director of DM Young Artists' Theatre.   Other Ways You Can Help There is a lot more than money that goes into a production:
One very important volunteer position is that of an actor. Our auditions are on February 8th, 2015 at 6 pm. Actors will need to bring 16-32 measures of a prepared song with either a CD or piano accompaniment. Though Adolescent Anarchy is a teen led initiative, we plan on casting people of all ages, as we have done in the past. We will be casting around 10-12 women (ages 18+), 10-12 men (ages 18+), and 2-5 boys (ages 8-17), and 2-5 girls (Ages 8-17).
Backstage is just as important as being onstage. We will need a crew to do shift work as well as someone to run lights and sound.We also will need help with set builds and assistance with costuming. If this interests you, please email us at adolescentanarchy1@gmail.com.
If none of these options interest you, we would love for you to attend Big Fish, showing May 1-3 and May 8-10 as well as getting the word out about our project!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

thank you for your interest in Sleeping Beauty The Musical.

<p>My name is
Ian Curran and I started writing this new musical version of the traditional
fairytale in the hope that I could inspire an audience whilst admittedly trying
to make a quick buck. </p>
<p>Still I
wanted to create a show that was an engaging family show. Not a show that
parents begrudgingly took their children to watch but one that everyone could
enjoy. I wanted to create something with artistic integrity that would not
condescend to its audience or belittle its subject matter but still provide a
fun night at the theatre.</p>
<p>I asked a
Musical Director friend Simon Hanson if he'd be interested in collaborating and
thankfully he and his writing partner Peter Vint were looking for a new project
and said ""yes."" I sent them lyrics; they replied with melodies and it
soon transpired that this show could be something very special. </p>
<p>We have
workshopped the hour version of the show in London and are currently finishing
off the remaining few songs that will see the show become a full scale
musical. </p>
<p>This campaign
is to raise money to get the show from its current pre-production stage into
production. Any donation you make will go directly into the show. At this stage
we are looking to pay an animator to create animated backdrops that will not
only move the plot along but will also be engaging to this new generation of
iPad audiences.</p>
<p>We need
studio space, recording facilities, theatre hire and all that goes into
creating a high quality professional theatrical experience.</p>
<p>ANY money
that you can give, however small the donation, will be gratefully received and
used to get my dream on stage.</p>

<div>The Boys Next Door is a one-act play written by Tom Griffin and directed by Griffin Johnston and Vaughn Sherman, both juniors at Catalina Foothills High School. In this heartwarming show about four mentally handicapped adults and their caretaker, they learn what it means to laugh and love in a world that isn't always fair. The main goal of doing this show is to help spread awareness of people with similar situations as our characters take on the journey to laugh and love like everybody else. We aimed to perform a show outside the ""norm"" with a deeper meaning that would leave an impact on the audience.</div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
The Boys Next Door is a one-act play written by Tom Griffin and directed by Griffin Johnston and Vaughn Sherman, both juniors at Catalina Foothills High School. In this heartwarming show about four mentally handicapped adults and their caretaker, they learn what it means to laugh and love in a world that isn't always fair. The main goal of doing this show is to help spread awareness of people with similar situations as our characters take on the journey to laugh and love like everybody else. We aimed to perform a show outside the ""norm"" with a deeper meaning that would leave an impact on the audience.

What We Need & How You Can Help

 Altogether we'd like to raise $13,500. We are trying to send 9 people to Lincoln, Nebraska for the international competition. This results in a cost of $1,500 for each person. If we do not reach our goal all proceeds will go to the Catalina Foothills Theater Department to be used in the betterment of the program.
The Impact 
Our goal with performing the show is to spread awareness of the handicapped. We took on the challenge of truly transforming ourselves into these characters and helping the audience see life through their eyes. After watching our performance at the Arizona State Thespian Festival, a judge commented that we ""made handicapped people proud.""
  Risks & Challenges Some of the challenges we've faced through doing this show were how to portray a handicapped person without making fun of the character. Right from the beginning it was made clear that by no means were we trying to make fun of anyone, but to instead show people what life is like for those with lives like theirs.

<div><i>Thriving Amateur Dramatics society  (with good sense of humour, loves an audience and lovely assets ) seeks gorgeous generous piles of cash for fun times! Would enjoy excavation and renovation of old dank and tiny orchestra pit and conversion to shiny new exciting musical and theatrical facility.  Likes to support the community, and have fun doing it and would love to meet the money of awesome people who share their interests.</i></div>
<div><ul>
<li>We would like to renovate our very small unsuitable orchestra pit so we can improve the condition for our musicians in our shows, productions and events</li>
<li>We want to do it in a way that will allow for flexible seating and staging options depending on the needs of the production</li>
<li>We want to continue to support the community, and talents of our members by providing high quality shows and opportunities to develop.</li>
<li>We need to raise at least £10,000 to do this!</li>
</ul></div>
<div>For more details read on!</div>
<h3>So what's this all about anyway?</h3>
<div>Picture the scene - you are a part of a successful thriving amateur dramatics group lucky enough to have the freehold to their own small but much beloved theatre: a theatre that survives by putting on quality performances from musicals, plays, shows and standup comedy right through to panto for the local community, all through the voluntary efforts of members passionate about the theatre.  The Wells Little Theatre, home of the Wells Operatic Society, is a wonderful resource and a dream come true for any amateur dramatics society with one main drawback. The orchestra pit is...well, the pits!</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296277/files/20150315090637-_MG_9303.jpg?1426435597"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>Wells Little Theatre, small but perfectly formed! If it looks a bit familiar, it might be because some scenes  from Hot Fuzz were filmed  here - indeed some of our members got to be extras in the film! The pit is so small it is barely visible  from this angle.</i>
</div>
<div>
<i></i><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296306/files/20150315091618-_MG_9291.jpg?1426436178"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This gives you an idea of the proportional  size of the pit. </div>
<div>We feel quality live music in performances is something that gives a real theatre experience; it raises the quality of our productions and gives a fantastic experience for performers and audience alike.  As such, we love having an orchestra pit for live musicians, but unfortunately, the current orchestra pit is something that needs considerable renovation to make it fit for purpose. To put it bluntly, it is cramped, cold and claustrophobic. <span>We shoehorn musicians into it and they spend the equivalent of the three hours of a performance night trying to play quality music while semi-crouched, trying not to get their eyes poked by enthusiastic violinists and courting pneumonia from the dank conditions!</span>
</div>
<div><span><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1296261/files/20150315090010-_MG_9319.jpg?1426435210"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>The current pit - as you can see, the  minimum of drums take up nearly half the space. Now imagine trying to fit up to nine very uncomfortable musicians into this tiny area with keyboards and guitars, violins, wind instruments...</i></p></span></div>
<div>In all seriousness, the Wells Operatic Society has recognised that renovating and improving the orchestra pit will attract more quality musicians to play in the Wells Little Theatre. (We are at a point where many musicians will refuse to play in the Pit due to the conditions.) Our plans also include ways to make this space much more adaptable and flexible. It would allow for some innovative staging that has a lot of potential directors very excited about the possibilities it could offer on a wider scale. This would benefit not just the musicians but the whole theatre and allow us to offer more to the community and allow even more of our talented members to develop their skills in live performance.</div>
<div>All we need is your help! </div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Nitty Gritty</h3> <p>What we want...what we really, really want is...</p>
<p>A solution that will give us a flexible size of orchestra pit and staging, depending on the needs of different productions. Is this impossible? No!</p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>We have a plan - and a cunning plan it is too.</span></p>
<p><span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span>We are proposing to create a flexible space of 1.6meters in front of the current pit wall. This space will have two rows of removable seating. Which allows for additional performance space on multiple levels. On top of this, this area will also have a removable floor that will cover an extended pit. This will give us the option of expanding the pit in 0.8 meter sections giving us three potential pit configurations. A second entrance to the auditorium would be made  available to accommodate this change. The exciting thing about this is that it allows for a huge amount of flexibility.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></span></p>
<p><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>The cost of these improvements is £27,000. We hope to receive £17,000 from the Arts Council from an application we have submitted, and it is down to the theatre to find the remaining £10,000.</span></p>
<p><span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As a not-for-profit organisation, any revenue from </span>ticket<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> sales have already been ploughed back into the theatre itself so we are pretty much starting from scratch. The theatre always needs improvements, new </span>equipment<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and basic maintenance so all funds are used positively. Anything you can spare will be gratefully received and we will be working hard as a society to raise this money in as many ways as we can manage.</span></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>But what will this do? Really?</h3>
<div>Those of us in the Wells Operatic Society pride ourselves in giving talent a chance to shine, and including everyone in our performances and theatre community. Modesty aside, our frequent nominations and wins in many of the South West's amateur dramatics awards are  an indication of how well we 'punch above our weight' when it comes to comparing the quality of our shows against many other societies with greater resources at their fingertips. We give many children and young people their first experiences of live performance and are fortunate enough that those who have decided to that this is their passion have secured prestigious further education places and scholarships which are in no small way due to their experiences at the theatre. We would like to continue and improve upon that record by updating and upgrading the facilities we have the best we can.</div>
<div>Having the capacity to attract quality live music opens up a lot of possibilities and benefits not just for members but for the local community as well. We really are all inclusive - there are very few other places where such a diverse mix of people can form such a tight knit social group. We have had members aged from 5 to 85 on stage in the same show, for example!</div>
<div>The Wells Operatic Society has been in existence since 1902, so we are not likely to vanish overnight!  It was in 1979 that the society was offered the chance to buy the building's freehold and the members of the time did a truly epic amount of fundraising and managed to achieve this incredible goal. Since then we have a track record of keeping the society going, running the building, making improvements and all of this managed by unpaid volunteers.</div>
<div>Fundraising this amount of money will always be a challenge - and  if the Arts Council funding is not secured this will raise the level of difficulty even higher! However, we believe that the theatre needs improvements to keep it attractive to members and the local community and this particular aspect is first on our theatre improvement list. If people are incredibly generous, who knows, we might get heating in the changing rooms next! (I know! Unimaginable luxury!) Or upgrades to the auditorium seating....or new lighting equipment! The point to be made is, no-one's generosity would be wasted . There are always requirements and we will appreciate anything and everything you can spare us.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px;"">Er..well, I'd love to help but I'm a bit strapped for cash at the moment...</span><br/>

</div></div>","Wanted: Help to make our Orchestra Pit, ""a Little Pit Bigger!""
Thriving Amateur Dramatics society  (with good sense of humour, loves an audience and lovely assets ) seeks gorgeous generous piles of cash for fun times! Would enjoy excavation and renovation of old dank and tiny orchestra pit and conversion to shiny new exciting musical and theatrical facility.  Likes to support the community, and have fun doing it and would love to meet the money of awesome people who share their interests.

We would like to renovate our very small unsuitable orchestra pit so we can improve the condition for our musicians in our shows, productions and events
We want to do it in a way that will allow for flexible seating and staging options depending on the needs of the production
We want to continue to support the community, and talents of our members by providing high quality shows and opportunities to develop.
We need to raise at least £10,000 to do this!

For more details read on!
So what's this all about anyway?
Picture the scene - you are a part of a successful thriving amateur dramatics group lucky enough to have the freehold to their own small but much beloved theatre: a theatre that survives by putting on quality performances from musicals, plays, shows and standup comedy right through to panto for the local community, all through the voluntary efforts of members passionate about the theatre.  The Wells Little Theatre, home of the Wells Operatic Society, is a wonderful resource and a dream come true for any amateur dramatics society with one main drawback. The orchestra pit is...well, the pits!


Wells Little Theatre, small but perfectly formed! If it looks a bit familiar, it might be because some scenes  from Hot Fuzz were filmed  here - indeed some of our members got to be extras in the film! The pit is so small it is barely visible  from this angle.


This gives you an idea of the proportional  size of the pit. 
We feel quality live music in performances is something that gives a real theatre experience; it raises the quality of our productions and gives a fantastic experience for performers and audience alike.  As such, we love having an orchestra pit for live musicians, but unfortunately, the current orchestra pit is something that needs considerable renovation to make it fit for purpose. To put it bluntly, it is cramped, cold and claustrophobic. We shoehorn musicians into it and they spend the equivalent of the three hours of a performance night trying to play quality music while semi-crouched, trying not to get their eyes poked by enthusiastic violinists and courting pneumonia from the dank conditions!


The current pit - as you can see, the  minimum of drums take up nearly half the space. Now imagine trying to fit up to nine very uncomfortable musicians into this tiny area with keyboards and guitars, violins, wind instruments...
In all seriousness, the Wells Operatic Society has recognised that renovating and improving the orchestra pit will attract more quality musicians to play in the Wells Little Theatre. (We are at a point where many musicians will refuse to play in the Pit due to the conditions.) Our plans also include ways to make this space much more adaptable and flexible. It would allow for some innovative staging that has a lot of potential directors very excited about the possibilities it could offer on a wider scale. This would benefit not just the musicians but the whole theatre and allow us to offer more to the community and allow even more of our talented members to develop their skills in live performance.
All we need is your help! 
   The Nitty Gritty What we want...what we really, really want is...
A solution that will give us a flexible size of orchestra pit and staging, depending on the needs of different productions. Is this impossible? No!
We have a plan - and a cunning plan it is too.
We are proposing to create a flexible space of 1.6meters in front of the current pit wall. This space will have two rows of removable seating. Which allows for additional performance space on multiple levels. On top of this, this area will also have a removable floor that will cover an extended pit. This will give us the option of expanding the pit in 0.8 meter sections giving us three potential pit configurations. A second entrance to the auditorium would be made  available to accommodate this change. The exciting thing about this is that it allows for a huge amount of flexibility.
The cost of these improvements is £27,000. We hope to receive £17,000 from the Arts Council from an application we have submitted, and it is down to the theatre to find the remaining £10,000.
As a not-for-profit organisation, any revenue from ticket sales have already been ploughed back into the theatre itself so we are pretty much starting from scratch. The theatre always needs improvements, new equipment and basic maintenance so all funds are used positively. Anything you can spare will be gratefully received and we will be working hard as a society to raise this money in as many ways as we can manage.

    But what will this do? Really?
Those of us in the Wells Operatic Society pride ourselves in giving talent a chance to shine, and including everyone in our performances and theatre community. Modesty aside, our frequent nominations and wins in many of the South West's amateur dramatics awards are  an indication of how well we 'punch above our weight' when it comes to comparing the quality of our shows against many other societies with greater resources at their fingertips. We give many children and young people their first experiences of live performance and are fortunate enough that those who have decided to that this is their passion have secured prestigious further education places and scholarships which are in no small way due to their experiences at the theatre. We would like to continue and improve upon that record by updating and upgrading the facilities we have the best we can.
Having the capacity to attract quality live music opens up a lot of possibilities and benefits not just for members but for the local community as well. We really are all inclusive - there are very few other places where such a diverse mix of people can form such a tight knit social group. We have had members aged from 5 to 85 on stage in the same show, for example!
The Wells Operatic Society has been in existence since 1902, so we are not likely to vanish overnight!  It was in 1979 that the society was offered the chance to buy the building's freehold and the members of the time did a truly epic amount of fundraising and managed to achieve this incredible goal. Since then we have a track record of keeping the society going, running the building, making improvements and all of this managed by unpaid volunteers.
Fundraising this amount of money will always be a challenge - and  if the Arts Council funding is not secured this will raise the level of difficulty even higher! However, we believe that the theatre needs improvements to keep it attractive to members and the local community and this particular aspect is first on our theatre improvement list. If people are incredibly generous, who knows, we might get heating in the changing rooms next! (I know! Unimaginable luxury!) Or upgrades to the auditorium seating....or new lighting equipment! The point to be made is, no-one's generosity would be wasted . There are always requirements and we will appreciate anything and everything you can spare us.
    
Er..well, I'd love to help but I'm a bit strapped for cash at the moment...

 We know the feeling! Actually, if you want to help in other ways, we'd really appreciate help in getting the word out.  Have a word with that millionaire who lives down the road (what do you mean you don't live down the road from a millionaire?!) or share on facebook, twitter, - anywhere you can think of!

<p>
</p><p><span>Following
a group of hopeful assistants, this world premiere musical comedy explores the
superiority complex of Hollywood and the glamorous lifestyle that seems to
elevate its participants above “ordinary” people. Through a string of heartfelt

hostile environments in the name of their big dream. All alone in the bustling
city of L.A., the characters find that in order to survive, they may need some
assistance of their own.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>One
of the reasons that you should help with THIS show is that it is a world
premiere. With more movies being made into plays, and more plays being made
into movies, it is rare that a genuinely new idea gets to flourish and be
supported in the entertainment industry. Supporting the development of new work
ensures that the artistic world will continue to grow and change with our
society, rather than be merely a reflection of the past. In addition, this show

</p><p><span>The
reason you should support this show NOW is because <i>Assistants </i>is a show that is
incredibly relevant to the Hollywood industry TODAY. With multimedia constantly
growing and Twitter feeds bringing people their news, it is time for a show to
reflect how our current, fast-paced society has had an effect on the
entertainment business. Doing the show in this year's Hollywood Fringe Festival
gives us access to new audiences and marketing opportunities that we may not
have otherwise.</span></p>

<div>My name is David McDonald. I am a documentary filmmaker, director of the films ""Woodstock Revisited,"" and ""The Culture Wars,"" and video contributer to publications like The New York Times and Chronogram Magazine (for clips of my work, see the ""Gallery"" page.)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>About three years ago, I stumbled onto a story that was so incredibly good that I found it very hard to believe no one had told it before. Apparently, the world-famous artist Marc Chagall had spent a portion of his life living in New York, both in the city and Upstate, in the 1940s. The story of his American exile had pretty much been wiped out of the history books because of concerns of a scandal at the time. Far from being scandalous, the tale was truly poignant. I decided to make it <i>mine.</i>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Three years later an I had finished a 106 page screenplay. Time to get it out to Hollywood! But wait, things don't come that fast, especially if you don't have a track record there. A few months ago, we did a staged reading of the first 15 pages or so in New York City.  It was absolutely buzzing with electricity. The actors playing the roles quickly embodied their characters. To my utter surprise, the whole thing not only worked, it worked <i>beautifully. </i>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At around the same time, a friend of mine who is affiliated with a theater space in Upstate New York floated the idea of making the space available while we labbed the production for an eventual theatrical run. Again, it was an idea I had not conceived of before, but the more I thought about it, the more logical the idea seemed to be! And what fun it would be too! From finding the actors, blocking out the action, building the sets, and transforming some of the filmic special effects into theatrical action. When a young Marc Chagall goes to the synagogue with his father and imagines the old men floating out of their pews...how would we do that on stage? A wonderful set of challenges. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The story of Marc Chagall's life...always on the run...a man without a real country...represents to me what I view to be possibly the single-greatest allegory of the Jewish diaspora of the 20th century.  When people experience it for the first time, the one response I always get is: <i>""I cannot believe this story hasn't been told yet!""</i> It is such an affecting and powerful story, whether it's on film or it's on stage, it's going to move people. I want to share it with the world. You can help me make that happen! </div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Well, obviously, we are going to need a theater, or something resembling one. Although some theaters have offered us a space to lab the production, they cannot be expected to host us without some recompense. The goal of this project is to create a living, breathing marketable production. That production will then hopefully be monetizable for whatever theater space chooses to host us down the road, but I foresee the ""lab"" part and the rehearsals taking two months of preparation, and only if we work on this intensely.</p>
<p>Then there's the question of finding the right actors and crew, none of whom should be expected to work for free. Set builders will be needed, etc. I intend to direct but I will seek out experienced stage people to manage the production. </p>
<p>Further costs will include things like copyright clearances for Chagall imagery, legal rights in general, and compensating our musical composers for their time and work.  Those who are familiar with my film work know that music has always played  a big role.</p>

</div></div>","Who I am?
Hi! I´m Eliana Lopez , an accomplished  actress in my native country of Venezuela. Before I moved to San Francisco to have a family, I spent my life shuttling between studios, rehearsals and national or international tours. Six years ago, I married an American politician from San Francisco and came with him to start a new life, a new family. We began to construct a life together, had a son, and I began a long process of adjustment to a new culture.  It wasn’t easy but, in spite of a lot of bumps on the road, my husband and I were figuring out how to blend two very different cultures and emotional styles.  Then, almost overnight, my life was turned inside out. Suddenly, a private argument with my husband exploded into a citywide controversy about domestic abuse.  Without my consent or control, my personal life as a political wife became a political football.  San Francisco advocacy groups and political factions in the city administration, including forces aligned with our powerful Mayor, tried to turn me into a a symbol of female victimhood and to derail the career of my husband, who is a well known progressive reformer.    

In Venezuela, I was used to being in the public spotlight.  But here, in San Francisco, as I watched the news, I was a spectator of my own life. Everybody was talking ABOUT me, but not WITH me. I felt used, powerless. For the first time I experienced what it feels to be voiceless. 
It took me almost two years before I could sit and watch everything that we endured as a family without getting emotional. In 2014 I decided to tell ""my story"" and do something that would allow me to heal and forgive. The medium that I know best  is theater, so in collaboration with my brother Alfonso Lopez, we wrote the script for this play.
As an actress and artist I´m taking this nightmare and turning it into something positive, not just for myself but for anyone who is concerned with the injustices and political  and social biases that impact immigrants in the United States.  This story of of self-transformation and human growth reflects the experiences of many of those trying to adjust to a new culture just as it portrays the obstacles many reformers confront when they challenge powerful political interests.
Through the most difficult moments in this experience,
the Latino community and the community of color stood fiercely beside me.
Their strong support and outrage against what I was facing, helped to
change the course of the story and it was an invaluable source
of strength for me. It is why I want to make this show a bilingual
one. Just as interracial families and immigrant communities live between
two languages so two this theatrical performance is told in both
Spanish and English, with supertitles so that everyone who comes can
understand.



In collaboration with the ""Victoria Theater"" we bring back  to you “WHAT IS THE SCANDAL,” a one woman show, in which I will play a dozen characters and will expose current issues. Definitely, It is not only my voice, but it is the reality of many others as well. 
The proposal:
Like every art project we need the support of all of you to make it happen. One year ago we decided to raise $ 18.000  to produce a three week run of ""What Is The Scandal?"" in San Francisco. Thanks to contributions from many generous sponsors we reached that goal.  Now we need your help to raise $ 10.000  more to make this new show a reality and bring it to a broader audience.  To do this,  we need to organize our community to bring them to the Theatre. Some members of our community can not afford to pay for a ticket. It is why we are reaching out to organizations and offering half prices tickets and group rates. In some cases, we are also offering free tickets.
Your contribution, a deeply appreciated gift, will go toward the cost of 50% of the production and 50%  sponsor tickets to the community.

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Full Spectrum Theatre Company's mission is to expand our perceptions of who ""looks"" and ""sounds"" American in order to highlight our connections beyond the surface of race, ethnicity and accents.  Through racially integrated casting and artistic excellence, our repertory of plays and musicals focus on universal themes with no forced cultural associations, other than being set in today's America.  By presenting ""every day"" American characters with integrated casting, we believe our audiences will not only ""see"" a diverse ensemble on stage, they will also ""see"" characters that are easily relatable through the universal experiences of family dynamics, friendships, and growing pains. The ""full spectrum"" of racial and ethnic diversity also encompasses the ""full spectrum"" of the human condition and ultimately ties us all together as fellow Americans.
 

We chose Rabbit Hole because it's a beautifully written Pulitzer Prize winning play by David Lindsay-Abaire.  It's also traditionally cast with a singular race and we believe the story is just as effective and relatable when you see it presented with talented actors who happen to look different from each other.

<div>
<p>                                              Elegante’…A mostly
true story</p>
<p>  Vincent
Avigone is twenty-three years old, lives in Brooklyn N.Y. and works as the
“pasta guy” in his family’s Italian restaurant. He works there with his four
uncles...Uncle Johnny, Uncle Ray, Uncle Mike and Uncle Unc. His entire family
including his mother Marie, Aunts Annmarie, Maryanne and Antionette live within
three blocks of each other in the same neighborhood in Brooklyn. Vincent
doesn’t know exactly how he feels about the direction in which he sees his life
heading. It’s nothing he can quite put his finger on but, he thinks there must
be something different, something other than the world in which he lives.</p>
<p>Marcy
Slotnick is a Jewish girl from Long Island who with her family, happens on one
particular Mother’s Day in 1991 to patronize Vincent’s family’s restaurant. Marcy
is a no non-sense girl who knows exactly who she is and where she’s going.
She’s a strong, independent young woman who’s looking forward to graduating with
a degree in speech-language pathology. Marcy has her whole life ahead of her
and everything is going according to plan...until that one particular Sunday in
May...when she meets Vincent.</p>
<p>What follows
is a sweet, funny, touching story of two people from different worlds, whose
obstacles, including family pressures and cultural differences draw them into
an unlikely love story. A love story with some pretty rough edges at
times...this is Brooklyn remember.</p>
<p>Allow
yourself for a few moments to be taken to a small family trattoria in Brooklyn
circa 1991. Enjoy the sounds of a bustling restaurant; the loud voices coming
from the kitchen mixed with the even louder ones across the kitchen table of a
Jewish household in Bellmore Long Island. Be a fly on the wall and enjoy
witnessing what happens when a strong willed Jewish Princess meets a sweet,
unsure of himself Italian boy next door. There’s a place just up the street and
around the corner where all are welcome...all are family. It’s a place called
Elegante’.</p>

<p><b>WHERE
YOUR DONATIONS GO</b><br/>
<span>I have BIG plans for this show. I'm not looking
for this to be a one time, month long run. I intend this to be just the first run
in many that will take the show from off Broadway, to Broadway, to the Tony
Awards, to television, the movies, action figures and beyond. Well maybe not
action figures. I believe in this play and the story it tells enough to think
it appeals to a very wide audience and can be enjoyed for years to come. With
this in mind I intend on making this first run of Broadway quality in terms of
the sets, lighting, talent, etc. The following is a list of items we need to
make this show all it can be.<br/><b>
1. A GREAT THEATER:</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I'm
planning on approximately a 100 seat house. This is big enough to give us off-Broadway
status yet intimate enough to convey the feeling of a nice family restaurant in
Brooklyn.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>2. SETS:</b></span></p>
<p>The
show takes place mostly in the kitchen, dining room and bar of the restaurant.
I intend to build a full bar and working kitchen-counter with various food
prep stations. Both of these scenery pieces will be on wheels, making them
easier to move on and off the stage. Other set pieces such as Marcy's bed, both
families’ kitchen tables, nightclub set, and additional set pieces will be needed.<br/>
<span><b>3. PROJECTION SCREEN:  </b></span></p>
<p>The
most impressive and significant part of the set will be a large projection
screen on the back wall of the stage. This screen will act as the background
for each scene. For instance, the scene inside the restaurant will include live
footage that has been previously recorded at an Italian restaurant rolling as
the background.  During the scenes, the actors
and set pieces will be in the foreground while the video of restaurant patrons
will be seen in the background, giving those scenes a more realistic look. This
feature is unique, original, and promises to be very exciting… it's going to be
awesome!<br/>
<b>4. EQUITY STATUS: </b> </p>
<p>The
plan for this production is that it carry an Off-Broadway equity status which
will help give the production more legitimacy. That necessitates salaries for
cast/crew for each rehearsal and performance.<br/>
<span><b>5. PUBLICIST:</b></span></p>
<p>In
order for this show to get the exposure it deserves, it will need the proper
promotion. Elegante is very much a New York story and in turn, will attract and
appeal to real New Yorkers.  It is our intention to draw the interest of
people who are influential and notable, concerned with promoting authentic New
York theater.</p>
<p><b>6. PROMOTIONAL
MATERIALS:</b></p>
<p>Most theatrical
productions will incur promotional expenses. This includes advertising,
playbills, flyers, etc.</p>
<p><b>7. MUSIC:</b></p>
<p>Elegante takes place
in 1991. I believe music is the only true time machine we have. The soundtrack
is as important as any character in the play. It sets the tone and moves the
story along. With that in mind, I have carefully chosen specific songs from the
time period for each scene to communicate the story effectively.  This is briefly demonstrated in the music
chosen for our promotional video.  Purchasing the rights to use artists’ music is
a cost.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><b>A
TRUE NEW YORK STORY </b><br/>
Every character in this play is a real person or
based on a real person. There is a Ray and a Mike and an Unc and Coma; and I
did work with them in a restaurant called Elegante. Marcy and her family are
also real and most of the incidents in the story are true events that took
place. Almost all of the events and situations depicted in the play occurred.  I simply put them to paper. <br/>
Elegante' takes place in Brooklyn and Long Island
New York, 1991. This was a time of big hair, Z Cavariccis, Good Fellas, and neon
colored clothes. Elegante’ illustrates the look and feel of that time. It
represents what it was like living in those areas and working in an Italian
restaurant.  Many people can relate to
the struggles and conflicts within Vincent and Marcys’ families. This multi-dimensional
story will be portrayed true to life. This quality boldly comes across in the
script. One need not be from New York or of Italian or Jewish decent to relate
to these characters or their story... if you have a family or have ever
struggled with love, Elegante' has something for you. </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;""><b>One Man's Efforts</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;""><b></b></span></p>
<p>Up until now, I have had a few
friends help along the way, but I am essentially supporting this project by
myself.  I do not have a team or theatre
group behind me. I am just one man trying to produce and share his work.
Writing Elegante’…a mostly true story was a labor of love. Please help me bring
it to the stage.</p>

communities, ranging from Mike’s upbringing in Middlebury, Vermont; to Lawrence’s
childhood in Metairie, Louisiana; to Ted's small town life in
Madisonville, Kentucky.  We bonded a strong friendship due to the commonality of our perspectives, and launched our theater show with the
goal of attracting attention to the plight of small farmers and creating a greater awareness of our
environment.  </p>

<p><i>Buzzy's</i> material is mainly developed
in Mike’s home in West Oakland, CA from conversations that have lasted a decade.
These rehearsals are often day-long creative sessions and are infused with
friendship, eating and drinking, and lots o' music.  Sometimes, it can be hard-to-tell when we’re
creating new material, when we’re rehearsing established material, or when we’re just horsing around.  But
these sessions have resulted in several popular sketches, as well as more than
a dozen #1 hits!*</p>

<p>One of our popular sketches
follows a young Vermont farmer who moves to the Big City after being
“tricked off his land”. Nearing despair, he discovers that he has one skill and
one skill only that is valued in The City… performing the world’s greatest
chicken impression!  </p>

“An Awkward Romance”, “The Bottle Dance”, and “The
Secret Asian Man”, along with Ted’s, Mike’s and Lawrence’s embarrassingly
intimate friendship, are featured with plenty of music, sing-a-longs, short monologues
and dialogues, dances, mimes, fictitious advertisements, and irreverent comedy
skits, many of which also present positive lessons in diversity, friendship,
learning, and respect for the environment.</div>

<p><b>Mike: </b><i>“I was born

comedy conspirators, Lawrence and Ted, all about my home state.  It’s been
a big part of our shared labor of love, our comedy troupe, Uncle Buzzy.
 After ten years, I’m finally bringing them home with me!  I can’t
wait to see their faces!  I can’t wait to see my hometown through their
eyes!  (And I hope I haven’t been exaggerating too too much!) Ha!”</i></p>
<p><b>Lawrence:</b> <i>“<i>Mike has been talking about
Vermont and putting the Green Mountain
flavor in our shows for 10 years now. Vermont has been such a big part of Uncle
Buzzy. For me, going to Vermont

going to visit his home country!  It is an honor &amp; a privilege to
finally play in Vermont,
and to bring to life all of our humor, music, and down-home perspectives in

Please help Uncle Buzzy get back home to Vermont this July for a rollicking tour through the state,
followed by a triumphant return to California!  We are trying to perform in

June 26th:  The Velo Rouge Café in San Francisco
NEW!  July 10th: Elderly Services in Middlebury, Vermont! 

July 12th: The Town Hall Theater in Middlebury, Vermont (Mike's

Also trying to book two live radio broadcasts, from Pt. Reyes Station, California and the other possibly

And trying to book more! (with your support)




CLICK HERE FOR LATEST TOUR DATES & INFO!



Uncle Buzzy is currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area, but we are a looooooong way from home.  We definitely need your support to produce and book these shows, and to cover expenses.  And if we exceed our goal, we'll be able to add-on more shows in the SF Bay Area after our Vermont Tour!  







Who is Uncle Buzzy?




Uncle Buzzy’s Hometown Theater Show was founded in 2004, by Mike
Sommers, Lawrence
Radecker and Ted Wee, with the mission of performing
entertaining, comedic, and musical sketches often with agricultural and
environmental themes centering on their friendship.  We're all actors, writers and musicians who have deep roots in varied agricultural
communities, ranging from Mike’s upbringing in Middlebury, Vermont; to Lawrence’s
childhood in Metairie, Louisiana; to Ted's small town life in
Madisonville, Kentucky.  We bonded a strong friendship due to the commonality of our perspectives, and launched our theater show with the
goal of attracting attention to the plight of small farmers and creating a greater awareness of our
environment.  







Okay, but what is it really?
Uncle Buzzy’s Hometown Theater Show is down-home sketch comedy with
grass-fed musical surprises starring your friends and neighbors!  (It’s kinda like Saturday Night
Live, plus music with a sense of humor like Flight of the Conchords,
all with a hometown country feel like Prairie Home Companion)…and we like to get local
people from your town to guest star in the show with us!




Buzzy's material is mainly developed
in Mike’s home in West Oakland, CA from conversations that have lasted a decade.
These rehearsals are often day-long creative sessions and are infused with
friendship, eating and drinking, and lots o' music.  Sometimes, it can be hard-to-tell when we’re
creating new material, when we’re rehearsing established material, or when we’re just horsing around.  But
these sessions have resulted in several popular sketches, as well as more than
a dozen #1 hits!*
*Self-proclaimed



During the past several years, Uncle Buzzy has made progressively larger strides in writing, creating and performing our original musical and sketch comedy vignettes throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.  We've performed at The Exit Theater, Yerba Buena Center for the Arts, The Off-Market Theater, Thick House, Xenodrome, Velo Rouge Café, on the radio at KPFA, San Francisco's City Hall Park, The Dance Palace in Pt. Reyes Station, and more!  In addition, we've expanded our perspective to promote literacy, history, geography, and ecology and have recently performed at community events, libraries, retirement homes and schools, including performances at The Redwoods Retirement Community in Mill Valley, CA and Glenview Elementary School in Oakland, CA.


One of our popular sketches
follows a young Vermont farmer who moves to the Big City after being
“tricked off his land”. Nearing despair, he discovers that he has one skill and
one skill only that is valued in The City… performing the world’s greatest
chicken impression!  

“An Awkward Romance”, “The Bottle Dance”, and “The
Secret Asian Man”, along with Ted’s, Mike’s and Lawrence’s embarrassingly
intimate friendship, are featured with plenty of music, sing-a-longs, short monologues
and dialogues, dances, mimes, fictitious advertisements, and irreverent comedy
skits, many of which also present positive lessons in diversity, friendship,
learning, and respect for the environment.






What does this all mean to us?

Mike: “I was born
and raised in Middlebury, Vermont.  For ten years I've been telling my best friends and
comedy conspirators, Lawrence and Ted, all about my home state.  It’s been
a big part of our shared labor of love, our comedy troupe, Uncle Buzzy.
 After ten years, I’m finally bringing them home with me!  I can’t
wait to see their faces!  I can’t wait to see my hometown through their
eyes!  (And I hope I haven’t been exaggerating too too much!) Ha!”
Lawrence: “Mike has been talking about
Vermont and putting the Green Mountain
flavor in our shows for 10 years now. Vermont has been such a big part of Uncle
Buzzy. For me, going to Vermont
will be like going to school with a foreign exchange student, and then finally
going to visit his home country!  It is an honor & a privilege to
finally play in Vermont,
and to bring to life all of our humor, music, and down-home perspectives in
front of the actual people who inspired it all!  I truly can’t wait for
this to happen!”

Ted: “This
tour is a ‘rock-star-dream-come-true’ experience for me.  Traveling
throughout the state, getting drunk with my troupe-mates, groupies in every
town, trashing hotel rooms, and rockin' and rollin', man!  [Mike
& Lawrence:  “Ted! Ted! Ted! We're going to VERMONT. And we are NOT Mötley Crüe!”]  Oh well...still beats doing math.
 This has been a childhood fantasy of mine ever since I picked up the
guitar at 16.  This is gonna rock!  Yay!”



Your Impact
 Uncle Buzzy was formed over 10 years ago and has performed throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.  But we have NEVER performed in Vermont, where Buzzy's roots were first laid to ground.   In a way, you can say that Vermont has been underserved with Buzzy's brand of entertainment for all these years.  It is high time that we perform for the good folks of the Green Mountain State, and bring our down-home humor and music back to the place that inspired it all!  

We need at least $3,667.00 in order to play several shows throughout Vermont & California.
The money will be used as follows:

Show production expenses, such as bookings, stage props, marketing and other show-related expenses.
Travel expenses for three cast members, including round-trip airfare from SFO to BTV, rental car, and low-rent accommodations throughout the tour. 

Your support can make this happen as Uncle Buzzy celebrates its 10th year anniversary!

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Elements Theatre Collective</span><br/>
</h3> <p>Our mission is to engage the local community by creating professional quality theatre that is accessible to all audiences.  We believe that making theatre accessible will inspire people who haven't experienced theatre and spark a conversation about topics that are pertinent to our community.</p>
<p>This year marks our fourth season, and we have decided to tackle the theme of Power and Influence.  We kicked off the season with <i>Nixon's Nixon </i>by Russell Lees. An astounding, personal evening with President Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger the night before Nixon resigns.  <i>Nixon's Nixon</i> was widely acclaimed, and brought Elements our second Indy award for our amazing ensemble!</p>
<p>We are closing the season with <i>A</i> <i>Bright New Boise </i>by Samuel D. Hunter.  In this powerful play, a man who gave up his son at birth, reconnects with him 20 years later.  The father decides to take a job at the same Hobby Lobby where his son works, in an effort to get to know him before disclosing that he is the biological father. </p>
<p><i>A Bright New Boise</i> is a thought provoking work that explores internal and external struggles with religion and family. We have our cast, and our crew, and we want to take this show on the road!  We will travel throughout Santa Barbara County, with performances in Carpenteria, Santa Barbara, Goleta and Lompoc.  All spaces are donated and, as always, tickets are FREE! </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need to raise $3,500 to bring <i>A Bright New Boise </i>to life.  Elements always keeps our shows free to audiences by partnering with venues who donate their spaces for our use, and by working with amazing volunteers through out the run of the show. In addition, local friends and businesses have donated materials for our sets, costumes and other production needs. </p>
<p>With the generous support of our community, and our dedication to keeping costs low, we are able to keep our ticket prices FREE, and reach more audiences. However, we need your help. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Please consider becoming part of our community and our collective by supporting our campaign today with a tax- deductible donation.</span></p>
<p>We want to make this production our best one yet! And you can help!</p>
<p><b>Here's where the funds we raise will go:</b></p>
<p>~ $900 will cover the small stipends to pay our actors, our director and our stage manager</p>
<p>~$700 With this money, we'll purchase the rights to the script, which will allow us to take this show to 13 different places in the Santa Barbara area.<br/></p>
<p>~$700 will cover the costs of transporting the show to our diverse venues across Santa Barbara County.  The truck for carrying supplies has been generously discounted for our use! <br/></p>
<p>~$500 A lot of our supplies for the set will be donated, but we'll still need to purchase some items. (We have to build an old, functioning TV, and lockers! )</p>
<p></p>
<div>~$300 This is our first year providing our own insurance!  This will help cover the cost of insurance for this production. </div>
<p>~$200  This will go to costumes and props.  We'll need some of those fancy work smocks!  </p>
<p>~$200 will help us promote the show and reach out to new audiences through advertising outlets and cover the cost of printed materials.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">The Impact</span></p>
</div><div> <p>Your contribution will help make our final production of this season the best one so far!  We are continuously growing and you have helped our small company through all the growing pains!  With our previous campaign we asked your help to purchase lighting equipment.  You responded with enthusiasm and now we are able to keep costs down by using our own amazing LED lights that travel with us show to show. This show has one of our largest casts yet, and the most involved set (even with our minimalist mindset!!!).  We love supporting the range of diverse talent in the area. We also believe that providing performance opportunities to artists will help cultivate the artistic community even further.</p>

</div></div>","Elements Theatre Collective
 Our mission is to engage the local community by creating professional quality theatre that is accessible to all audiences.  We believe that making theatre accessible will inspire people who haven't experienced theatre and spark a conversation about topics that are pertinent to our community.
This year marks our fourth season, and we have decided to tackle the theme of Power and Influence.  We kicked off the season with Nixon's Nixon by Russell Lees. An astounding, personal evening with President Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger the night before Nixon resigns.  Nixon's Nixon was widely acclaimed, and brought Elements our second Indy award for our amazing ensemble!
We are closing the season with A Bright New Boise by Samuel D. Hunter.  In this powerful play, a man who gave up his son at birth, reconnects with him 20 years later.  The father decides to take a job at the same Hobby Lobby where his son works, in an effort to get to know him before disclosing that he is the biological father. 
A Bright New Boise is a thought provoking work that explores internal and external struggles with religion and family. We have our cast, and our crew, and we want to take this show on the road!  We will travel throughout Santa Barbara County, with performances in Carpenteria, Santa Barbara, Goleta and Lompoc.  All spaces are donated and, as always, tickets are FREE!    What We Need & What You Get We need to raise $3,500 to bring A Bright New Boise to life.  Elements always keeps our shows free to audiences by partnering with venues who donate their spaces for our use, and by working with amazing volunteers through out the run of the show. In addition, local friends and businesses have donated materials for our sets, costumes and other production needs. 
With the generous support of our community, and our dedication to keeping costs low, we are able to keep our ticket prices FREE, and reach more audiences. However, we need your help. Please consider becoming part of our community and our collective by supporting our campaign today with a tax- deductible donation.
We want to make this production our best one yet! And you can help!
Here's where the funds we raise will go:
~ $900 will cover the small stipends to pay our actors, our director and our stage manager
~$700 With this money, we'll purchase the rights to the script, which will allow us to take this show to 13 different places in the Santa Barbara area.
~$700 will cover the costs of transporting the show to our diverse venues across Santa Barbara County.  The truck for carrying supplies has been generously discounted for our use! 
~$500 A lot of our supplies for the set will be donated, but we'll still need to purchase some items. (We have to build an old, functioning TV, and lockers! )

~$300 This is our first year providing our own insurance!  This will help cover the cost of insurance for this production. 
~$200  This will go to costumes and props.  We'll need some of those fancy work smocks!  
~$200 will help us promote the show and reach out to new audiences through advertising outlets and cover the cost of printed materials.
The Impact
 Your contribution will help make our final production of this season the best one so far!  We are continuously growing and you have helped our small company through all the growing pains!  With our previous campaign we asked your help to purchase lighting equipment.  You responded with enthusiasm and now we are able to keep costs down by using our own amazing LED lights that travel with us show to show. This show has one of our largest casts yet, and the most involved set (even with our minimalist mindset!!!).  We love supporting the range of diverse talent in the area. We also believe that providing performance opportunities to artists will help cultivate the artistic community even further.
We believe in bringing our shows to people who wouldn't have access to theater otherwise, which is why we love to perform at Casa Esperanza Homeless Center, the Carpinteria Women's Club, and Friendship Manor amongst our many other venues.  This time, we've received requests to bring our shows to even more locations.  Including a new location in Isla Vista, and our furthest reach yet, in Lompoc.  We want to bring this powerful piece of theatre to as many places as possible! Your donation could make the difference for an entire community.
Risks & Challenges

With every show we do, we always have to overcome some unforeseen obstacle, no matter how we plan!  Actors get sick, venues close, and cars break down.  By funding our campaign you'll allow us to keep our reserve funds available for all those pesky road blocks, and for our future seasons.
As we become a stronger company with our growth, we have accumulated more 'stuff'.  One of the largest obstacles in our way has been with transportation.  Currently we're borrowing, renting, and bribing van and truck owners to help out when they can.  Keeping this cost down is challenging!  We hope that by subsidizing A Bright New Boise with this fundraiser, we'll be able to keep saving for a vehicle of our own.
    Other Ways You Can Help We get that sometimes donating money isn't an option.  But there is a plethora of volunteer opportunities!

<p><i>Theatre is a wonderful, magical place where anything can happen...if you have the right people in your corner.

<p><i> As a small boutique theatre company, we have an amazing group of people collaborating on this show (and most of them are volunteering outside of their regular work/home/life duties), but we also have the challenge of limited resources.We want to raise the bar and take our production to the next level, and we want you to join us on the journey. </i></p>
<p><i>If we reach our fundraising target, it will open the door to fabulous materials, resources and opportunities that we would love to access to ensure Merrily is the best it can possibly be. Anything you can contribute will help make our show that little bit more magical so please, dig deep, join the JYM family, and know that you've helped create the magic!</i></p>

<p><i>Merrily We Roll Along </i>begins in the present and moves <i>backwards</i>, tracing the lives of wealthy, jaded composer Franklin Shepard and his two estranged friends in this thrilling and compelling Broadway fable about friendship, compromise and the high price of success. Stephen Sondheim and George Furth expertly blend the excitement and energy of a backstage musical with a poignant and emotional contemporary story about the importance of staying true to one's ideals. <i>Merrily We Roll Along </i>crackles with the wit, humour and intensity that embody the spirit of New York City and is a spirited and moving cautionary tale for anyone who has ever pursued a dream. </p>

</div></div>","JYM Theatre Co. is a Melbourne-based company and prides itself on producing exceptional musical theatre and has built a reputation on nurturing and developing talent and highly valuing our cast, crew and supporters.
JYM provides the opportunity for people to get involved in all aspects of musical theatre production and encourages diversity in it's membership. It's all about creativity, teamwork, friendship and fun.
Staging sell-out hits such as Avenue Q, The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee and The Producers, the JYM team are excited to be staging Sondheim's Tony award winning musical Merrily We Roll Along. 
Producing theatre is a costly endeavour and unfortunately small companies like ourselves are unable to operate on box-office sales alone. As a not-for-profit company, we rely on the generosity of supporters to help to raise the bar and take our production to the next level. 
A message from the Team
We're so glad that you're thinking about supporting our show and we really hope you come on board. 
Theatre is a wonderful, magical place where anything can happen...if you have the right people in your corner. It's not just about the people who get up on stage, but all of the people who help make a show happen, from the person who buys a program, to the person who operates the spotlight. 
 As a small boutique theatre company, we have an amazing group of people collaborating on this show (and most of them are volunteering outside of their regular work/home/life duties), but we also have the challenge of limited resources.We want to raise the bar and take our production to the next level, and we want you to join us on the journey. 
If we reach our fundraising target, it will open the door to fabulous materials, resources and opportunities that we would love to access to ensure Merrily is the best it can possibly be. Anything you can contribute will help make our show that little bit more magical so please, dig deep, join the JYM family, and know that you've helped create the magic!
Tickets for the show can be purchased through the JYM Theatre website:  www.jymtheatre.com

<p>As part of the SPF (Summer Performance Festival) run by Joe Landini, Porter premieres at ODC Theater July 10 and 12, 2015 at 9pm through the Summer Performance Festival run by SafeHouse Arts.</p>
<p>Directed by Bianca Cabrera with an original score composed by Ben Juodvalkis and performed by Mallory Markham, Rebecca Morris, Odessa Avianna Perez, Emma Salmon, Nell Suttles and Ali Weeks.</p>
<p>Tickets at <a href=""http://odcdance.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">odcdance.org</a></p>
<p>Porter uses the singular history of West Oakland rail workers as inspiration to create a dance considering the widespread poetics of history, belonging, change and invention. Porter is an abstract story about the feast/famine nature of evolving and devolving neighborhoods. Using physical themes of locomotion, coming, going, union, and isolation, Porter examines the aftermath of abundance, embodies the persistent green life that bursts upward out of rubble, and imitates cycles of prosperity and cycles of exclusivity. Particularly inspired by the now uninhabitable 16th Street Train Station in West Oakland, Blind Tiger imagines the stories inside those walls as physical fables. This lonely relic in West Oakland was completed in 1912 to accommodate the city’s surging population in the wake of the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What we need, why we need it </h3> <p>We need to raise $4900 to pay for our artist's blood, sweat and tears. This all star cast rehearses 12 hours a week during this 6 month process. Everything raised here on Indiegogo is directly routed to the pockets of these heroes. </p>
<p>Here's why the Porter Artists think you should get involved as a societal donor:</p>
<p>Bianca Cabrera - I have invited an incredible cast of collaborators to help me bring Porter to greater heights than any other BTS production to date. I know this is a powerful team and it is because of their unfaltering commitment that I can create this amazing new work. Each artist brings a distinct and specific gift to this project; each one deserves compensation that matches their commitment. </p>
<p>Ben Juodvalkis - Ben Juodvalkis' goal for this project is 'more heart.' What does that mean? Find out! benjuodvalkis.com</p>
<p>Mallory Markham - In the 4 years I have been dancing with Bianca Cabrera and Blind Tiger Society, I have been constantly pushed to reach new heights in my creative and athletic self. BTS allows me to find my artistic voice in an atmosphere void of judgement. We are hungry for adventure and curious in nature. Explorative, ferocious, raw, and vulnerable, the movement transcends the 4th wall creating an experience both performer and audience member can share.</p>
<p>Rebecca Morris - In Blind Tiger, Rebecca becomes beyond human, with wings extending from her fingertips and tap roots reaching from her toes, doing work that peels back the layers of well-formed technique to find the bold and true underneath. This is her second season with Blind Tiger Society. </p>
<p>Odessa Avianna Perez - Blind Tiger satisfies Odessa's curiosity in where the fantastical meets the physical, where the fierce growl meets the tender purr, and challenges her assemblage of where sequence meets presence. This is her second go-round this rodeo.</p>
<p>Emma Salmon - Blind Tiger  Society provides a space that wholly supports embodied honesty, palpable physicality, unapologetic authenticity and the celebration of all bodies. </p>
<p>Nell Suttles - Blind Tiger is where Nell pursues her passion for intriguing, powerful and stunningly evocative movement while pushing her strength and finesse beyond it's limits.</p>
<p>Ali Weeks -  Blind Tiger Society feeds her desire for the intensely theatrical, aggressively athletic, and unabashedly bold while progressing her technique and opening her mind. This is her second season with BTS.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How your tax deductible donation makes an impact</h3> <p>Here are some the ways your tax deductible donation will  impact this process:</p> <ul> <li>You are making it possible for Blind Tiger create a professional work environment where the bar is set high.</li>
<li>Dancers are able to arrive at rehearsal unencumbered by the financial burden that often accompanies participation in a dance project. </li>
<li>We are able to round out a beautiful composition of dance with an amazing sound score and handmade costumes.</li>
<li>We are free to concentrate efforts into promotion and marketing of the performances. </li> <li>Your donation makes a statement about the importance of arts and culture in your community thereby creating a visible, viable and valuable paradigm shift.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What else we have going on</h3> <p>Producing a dance show is very expensive! Artist fees are only a percentage of what the actual cost is for performances. Most of the other fees will be paid out of pocket by the Artistic Director. Your donation vastly increases Blind Tiger's ability to resource energy for these other major costs.</p> <ul> <li>Theater rental costs</li> <li>Marketing and promotional costs</li>
<li>Rehearsal space costs</li>
<li>Materials for costumes</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>You can still help even if you can't donate!</h3>

Rebecca Morris - In Blind Tiger, Rebecca becomes beyond human, with wings extending from her fingertips and tap roots reaching from her toes, doing work that peels back the layers of well-formed technique to find the bold and true underneath. This is her second season with Blind Tiger Society. 
Odessa Avianna Perez - Blind Tiger satisfies Odessa's curiosity in where the fantastical meets the physical, where the fierce growl meets the tender purr, and challenges her assemblage of where sequence meets presence. This is her second go-round this rodeo.
Emma Salmon - Blind Tiger  Society provides a space that wholly supports embodied honesty, palpable physicality, unapologetic authenticity and the celebration of all bodies. 
Nell Suttles - Blind Tiger is where Nell pursues her passion for intriguing, powerful and stunningly evocative movement while pushing her strength and finesse beyond it's limits.
Ali Weeks -  Blind Tiger Society feeds her desire for the intensely theatrical, aggressively athletic, and unabashedly bold while progressing her technique and opening her mind. This is her second season with BTS.
    How your tax deductible donation makes an impact Here are some the ways your tax deductible donation will  impact this process:  You are making it possible for Blind Tiger create a professional work environment where the bar is set high.
Dancers are able to arrive at rehearsal unencumbered by the financial burden that often accompanies participation in a dance project. 
We are able to round out a beautiful composition of dance with an amazing sound score and handmade costumes.
We are free to concentrate efforts into promotion and marketing of the performances.  Your donation makes a statement about the importance of arts and culture in your community thereby creating a visible, viable and valuable paradigm shift.    What else we have going on Producing a dance show is very expensive! Artist fees are only a percentage of what the actual cost is for performances. Most of the other fees will be paid out of pocket by the Artistic Director. Your donation vastly increases Blind Tiger's ability to resource energy for these other major costs.  Theater rental costs Marketing and promotional costs
Rehearsal space costs
Materials for costumes    You can still help even if you can't donate!

<p><b><b>At this time of change and social realignment, artists around the world must develop a spherical view of their profession in order to thrive.  Even though artistic training is broadly available, opportunities for stable work are scarce and artists must take matters into their own hands to build artistic communities within their respective cities and countries.</b></b></p>
<p><b>Thessaloniki Opera Festival is a prototype of the

provide an operating template for the future. For all of us who love this art
form, an investment this projectg will enable everyone else going forward access to
this beautiful music. Because Opera should be for everyone!!! </b></p>
</div>
<p>Our efforts have the following goals:</p>

The Impact

At this time of change and social realignment, artists around the world must develop a spherical view of their profession in order to thrive.  Even though artistic training is broadly available, opportunities for stable work are scarce and artists must take matters into their own hands to build artistic communities within their respective cities and countries.
Thessaloniki Opera Festival is a prototype of the
future being able to produce top notch productions while keeping our costs low
allowing us to thrive as we go forward. Not only will your contributions to Thessaloniki Opera Festival help us get opera to the greater public of the Thessaloniki, they will also help all of the arts to survive as we
provide an operating template for the future. For all of us who love this art
form, an investment this projectg will enable everyone else going forward access to
this beautiful music. Because Opera should be for everyone!!! 

Our efforts have the following goals:
· To provide the public of Thessaloniki  with the opportunity to attend such spectacles with ease.
· To provide opportunities for local artists to perform and help build their resume.
· To give the opportunity to young artists to be a part of professional productions as an internship.
· To help create a better image for Thessaloniki and Greece in general, through the establishment of the opera festival. 
· To create an opening for cooperation with foreign artists as an expression of European cooperation and solidarity. 
· To assist with charity work as part of the festival’s main agenda. 
   What We Need & What You Get 
As you can clearly see from the detailed budget plan the wages for the orchestra, the chorus and even the soloists are nominal and everybody is actually going for the project on a semi volunteer basis. 
Even with such a tight budget , because of the financial woes of our land, we are very worried that our potential sponsors may fall through.  Even though there is tremendous interest around our work, there are banking problems and liquidity problems that may make it impossible to process our applications for sponsorship. 
We request your assistance to keep this idea alive and to remind the world that Greece is first and foremost a land with great culture and people filled with the desire to prosper through hard, honest work.  We sincerely hope that we will be able to show the world that Greece is a source of inspiration and we are hoping that with this assistance we may inspire our countrymen to pick up where they left off, before the difficulties began.  We are going to provide more than 70 people with work. So where does your money go

Risks & Challenges

 Developing a new opera festival is a huge undertaking. Developing an opera festival in Greece, with FREE ADMISSION, this September, well, some people just think we are crazy! 
The people assembled to form the team of Thessaloniki's Opera Festival have many talents and years of experience producing and creating.  And if that isn’t enough, add discipline, drive and indefatigable energy!  That’s the kind of passion you find when you get involved with #ThessalonikiOperaFestival.  We won’t give up on our commitment to fulfill every aspect of our mission.  We are personally working on this project every single day for the past two years - that's the kind of commitment you are getting. 
 But we also believe passionately that opera should be for everyone! With your help, we can make sure to keep it thriving by moving Thessaloniki Opera Festival closer to reality- and sharing that journey with you through our campaign profile and facebook group!

HELP BIG NOISE THEATRE COMPANY CONTINUE MAKING NOISE IN OUR 2016 SEASON!!




Meine Damen und Herren, Mesdames et Messieurs, Ladies and Gentlemen! 
Willkommen, Bienvenue, & Welcome to all our BEAUUUUTIFUL friends, family and supporters. As we, the ""Big Noise Theatre Company"" prepare to close our first production of the 2016 season, (Congratulations on a FABULOUS run to the Cast & Crew of ""Love, Loss & What I Wore""), we give our sincerest thanks to our loyal supporters. We appreciate knowing that we are a part of a community that values our efforts as a small but widely impacting artistic venue within Des Plaines. We are now launching into preparations for the 2nd production of our season. It is for this reason that we ask you to assist our fundraising efforts by donating to this campaign. We want to continue to serve our surrounding communities, but we simply cannot do it alone! 


""'So... What?' What IS this production?"" you may be asking? Well, 'Don't Tell Mama' but we have a  production in store... but due to some contract stipulations, we cannot mention the name. BUT, DON'T FRET 'MEIN HERR'!! We have plenty of ways to share the news! 
We could tell you that this production is the 1967 Tony Awards Winner for Best Musical, Best Original Score, Best Featured Actor, Best Featured Actress, Best Direction of a Musical, Best Choreography, Best Scenic Design & Best Costume Design... ONLY TO COME BACK IN 1998 and sweep the Tony Awards for Best Revival, Best Performance by a Leading Actor, Best Performance by a Leading Actress, Best Featured Actor & Best Featured Actress.
We could also tell you this musical was created by the 'Perfectly Marvelous' creative team of Kander & Ebb, the team behind ""Chicago"" & ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"".
Trust us! It couldn't please us more to be able to say the name right now. But, since we cannot, we simply ask that YOU: Our Family, Friends, ""Friend of Friends"", Fellow Thespians, Artists & Artisans alike: HELP US CONTINUE TO MAKE SOME NOISE!!

A QUICK Look at... 




Winnetka Community Theatre, successor-in-spirit to the Winnetka Drama Guild that counted a young Charlton Heston (That's right... Moses himself..) among its casts in the 1940s, mounted its first show in 1973 thanks in large part to the necessary spark, energy, and outstanding leadership of Rolf Blank. Doug Diggs then became the driving force behind the continued success and artistic growth of the company, which underwent a name change to Winnetka Theatre.

When the Winnetka Community House underwent a significant renovation, WT temporarily relocated to the Des Plaines Prairie Lakes Community Center. As a following developed in that area, the relocation became permanent. By the 2005-2006 season, it was decided that a new name was in order... and thus Big Noise Theatre Company was born: an independent community entity managed by a volunteer Board of Governors.  



THE BNT BOARD OF GOVERNORS:


Peter Rasey | PresidentDaiva Paulis | Vice PresidentMarian Kaderbek & Amy Stricker | SecretaryMartha Shuford & Gail Soberski | TreasurerAshley Kammrath | MarketingRoy BrownDarius Colquitt


Julia MachollRebecca FortierDavid GeinoskyBrad KisnerNoreen PatelKen PreussMike Weaver 





The Impact
BNT has been a successful, long-running company because of the good works of our boards, current & emeritus, and all the performers that lend a hand. The Board, in full, often pays for a lot of the company's expenses (out of pocket) & put in hours upon hours of extra work for the overall success of this amazing legacy. Our casts grow together: From first rehearsals to Closing Sunday Communal Set Strikes...




YES. OUR ACTORS HELP US TAKE OUR ENTIRE SETS APART. THAT'S COMMITMENT!!! We serve a community... but we also cultivate one. We want to continue to do so... So, we're making efforts to raise the funds to continue our extensive, ""over 50 year"" history. 

   What We Need & What You Get





WHERE WILL FUNDING GO??All funding will go directly into the 
production budget for OUR NEXT PRODUCTION:


 ""Come here the music play, in a club where a raucous ensemble take the stage nightly to tantalize the crowd--and to leave their troubles outside."" This sophisticated, sexy, and dramatic piece was written by the popular team of Kander and Ebb, whose hits include “Chicago” and ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"", is one of the most popular and powerful shows of the 20th century!  This Tony, Grammy, and Oscar winner, where “the girls are beautiful, the audience is beautiful, and even the orchestra is beautiful!” is set to run April 22 - May 8, 2016





PERKS! PERKS! PERKS!



All donations made will be recognized with a Donor's credit in the playbill and on Social Media, based upon the level of your donation! You will also receive special, limited edition gifts for your generous contribution. (Please see the Perks for more information.)

overrides bodily autonomy.Drawing on women's true stories and lived experiences, devised in just two weeks, combining verbatim text, movement, spoken word and dance, Vessel originally  played a sell-out run at An Táin Arts Centre, Dundalk in November 2015. Now we are bringing it to Dublin to reach a wider audience and contribute more broadly to the desperately needed social conversation, to amplify women’s voices, shatter the national silence, and ask the question: what would you do?We can't however do this alone and therefore are urging anyone who is interested and affected by this issue to help us bring this production to our nation's capital by donating anything you can - every little helps!Your money will directly cover the costs of bringing a production such as this to Dublin, including: venue hire, prop purchases, printing costs, music licences, and actor's expenses. Helping us uncover all our upfront costs will allow all profit from ticket sales to go directly to the talented artists behind the project. About the CompanyAs a company Quintessence seeks to explore the human
condition through the most theatrical means available to us: the actor
themselves, and their imagination. We harness the full potential of the actor’s
body through heightened physical approaches, mime and a playful ensemble. We
seek to surprise, move and provoke our audiences, entertaining them and
creating dynamic, innovative, visceral and compassionate story telling that
touches on issues at the heart of Irish society here and now. Previous productions include The Picture of Dorian Gray, Alice in Wonderland and Vessel. We are excited to be bringing our work to Dublin to share with you all.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b> My Mission</b></p>
<p>As little kids some
of us dream of being astronauts, superheroes, doctors, or unicorns.  I have always dreamed of being a dance teacher.  It is my dream to bring the magic and wonder
back into dance.  As time has gone on
dance studios have become so competitive and harsh.  The love and fun has been torn away leaving
it cold and scary.  I believe that in
every job that must be done there is an element of fun.  I want to create a dance space where children,
teens, and adults can come to learn and be creative.  I want to teach how to love the art of dance on
all levels not only from a competitive stand point but from a recreational
standpoint as well.  All ages are welcome
to join in the fun and love your imagination again! It takes a lot to believe
in yourself.  It’s very scary to put
yourself out there and to speak your mind. 
Today we are all so stuck in our technologies that we forget about
everyday interaction.  Bringing in a
dance studio that involves all ages and styles can help us open up again.  It will help us to interact on many levels
instead of burying our faces in a computer screen.  Life is out there waiting so go and get
it.  Join me on my journey.  Open different doors, you may find a you you
never knew was yours.  </p>

Festival. However, if our goal is not met, it will be a fruitless and 
low attended run. I have a friend here who will help explain what your impact will mean to us. This is  Dave.

Dave produced a play in the 2015 Hollywood Fringe Festival. But Dave forgot to advertise. So Dave's play flopped. And Dave's cast didn't like that.

Help us to not be like Dave. 
  Risks & ChallengesThe only risk involved with this production is going over budget (and it is a small budget.) But so far all of the unforeseen budgeting concerns have all been marketing related.  Then again, there's always the concern of the cast killing each other over who gets top billing. But let me deal with that. You can help alleviate our primary risk by providing us with the capital needed to navigate the festival's vast marketing plain.
  Other Ways You Can HelpOther than that, just help spread the word! Donation or not, we need all the help we can get letting folks know we're here and we're ready to entertain! So don't be stingy with that share link, or you'll end up like this guy.Yeesh...",6.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<br/>Hi!</div><div>My name is Patrick Barry, AKA Patch, and together with Greg, Emily, Marie, Nessy and Georgia, we are the cast and
team of Cutting Edge's, offering at the 2015 Ventnor Fringe which we will be perfroming from the 13th to the 16th of August (for more on the Fringe visit <a href=""http://ventnorexchange.co.uk/vfringe"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ventnorexchange.co.uk/vfringe</a>).</div><div>We are presenting two shows: 'Condensed Histories: Highwayman, Jugglers and Fools', a one-man comedy show written and performed by Greg, and 'The Hanged Man', a six-hander play written by myself. The 'Condensed Histories' production is fully financed and will not be receiving any direct funding from this project, although all of the advertising materials will be promoting both shows.</div><div>
<p>'The Hanged Man' has never been performed before, so I guess you might say the Fringe performance is the world premier! The production's potential is entirely unexplored but given our enthusiasm, The West End, Broadway, and Hollywood might yet see it produced - who knows!!!

I like sword fighting, I can’t deny it; I like theatre with drama, humour, and
action, and I also like supporting The Ventnor Fringe. This will be the fourth
year I have performed there and the second year performing a piece written by
me... The first being The Return of the Musketeers, a grand Swashbuckler
following (yes, you have guessed)  the
adventures of Dumas’s greatest heroes, D’Artagnan, Porthos, Aramis and Athos
(and of course that most auspicious hero – Captain De’Treville, played by Greg!!
Not forgetting our heroines and villainesses played by Emily and Nessy!!!).  

<p>'The Hanged Man', is not a costume drama – it is set in the
modern day, it’s not an all action adrenalin pulsating seat of the pants piece
instead I might describe it as a quirky look at a marriage on the brink of
sinking (Titanic like). Greg’s take might be slightly different to mine... </p>
<p>But no play of mine would be complete without the sword-fighting I so love!!!
And 'The Hanged Man'? Well, that is no different. 'The Hanged Man' has a
sword fight that is integral to the plot, or, to be more precise, it has a
three way light sabre duel, that needs to look absolutely awesome and only the
best Battle-Ready Light Sabres will inspire the impact the audience deserve... </p>

<p>Ok, slight lie. The first thing that struck me was the epic potential for a three way lightsaber battle choreographed by Patrick. Then the metaphysical stuff. </p>
<p>What made me say yes to the project was a combination of Patch being at the helm, and the fact that the script manages to deal with some deep issues with sincerity and comic dark undertone that flows throughout the whole play. It is often hard to keep the balance of those two things, either becoming morbid and deep, or going for the laughs and forgetting the sincerity, fortunately the script perfectly balances the two on this knife-edge. (Or should I say lightsaber edge... Do lightsabers even have edges?) Our job now is to carry this balance into the performance!""</p>

<p>So why do we need your help? <br/>
<br/>
Advertising is a biggy, the better our advertising campaign the greater our potential
for attracting sell-out audiences. And that after-all, is what it is all about
- our audience!! Our ideal budget for an advertising campaign, inclusive of
posters, flyers, programs and distribution will be about £390.<br/>
<br/>
The next big expense will be props and effects. We actually have a lot of the
required props already but we are lacking three light sabres – yes, that is the
right, the shiny, bright sticks the Jedi and Sith hit each other with!!! The final scene of The Hanged Man has a three way light sabre duel which will
be complimented best by the use of three Battle Ready light sabres with a full
sound and LED lighting rig. We feel these sabres are the ones to be used as
they are powerful enough to be heard throughout the auditorium and bright enough to
light the entire stage with their glow – we want the audience to be wowed and
leave the theatre wanting more awesomeness!!! We reckon the three lightsabres we really want will cost approximately £800. Unfortunately the mass produced lightsabres, are not battle ready and will not offer the durability we require for the duels. We do have a second choice of lightsabers which will allow us to do almost everything we want, and it is these that are covered with the advertising in the £1100. If we reach our goal we can get those, and will look to the stretch goal or other funding to see if we can get the best quality ones we are aiming for.</p>
<span>The rest of the money will be used to

</div><div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Also, as Greg already runs a series of videos with his Condensed Histories, he and Patch are planning to create a series of videos available free on YouTube under the 'Cutting Edge' banner, aimed at explaining some basics of stage combat, and taking some techniques of old sword and fencing masters and applying these to the lightsaber!</div>

<p>The Hanged Man, will be the first time Cutting Edge, has produced a play. Although Cutting Edge has been involved with numerous local productions, it has done so to support another established company with its fight choreography and sourcing of equipment and props... <br/><br/>Cutting Edge, to date has helped out with:<br/>The Thieves of Malmby Hall (Adlib)<br/>Treasure Island (Adlib)<br/>Blackgang Pirates (Vectis Ventures)<br/>Robin Hood (Adlib &amp; Vectis Ventures)<br/>NIght Watch (Adlib)<br/>Sleeping Beauty (Wight Strollers)<br/>Pirates of Penzance (Island Savoyards)<br/>The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arreton Players)<br/>Merchant of Venice (Apollo Theatre)<br/>Robinson Crusoe (Wight Strollers)<br/>The Comedy of Errors (Arreton Players)<br/>The Tempest (Apollo Theatre)<br/>The Herbal Bed (Apollo Theatre)<br/><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Return of the Musketeers (Adlib)<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Henry IV (IOW Shakespeare Company)<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Various Workshops for Vectis Ventures and Island Schools.</span></p>
<p><br/>Helping Cutting Edge deliver on this production will aid our long term plan to improve the equipment and services we offer to local performance groups. It will also extend the range of workshops we can offer schools and other groups, All people need to enjoy exercising the mind and the body and in my opinion helping people to understand a script and choreograph the fight that best complements the characters and needs of the scene is the perfect symbiotic relationship.<br/><br/></p>

</div><div> <p>The risks are minimal. All the Perks have been carefully calculated to be self sustaining and provide the production budget. The show has been booked into the Ventnor Fringe Roster, the cast has been chosen. The show will happen no matter what. The true challenge is the fight choreography, sourcing Light Sabres that are capable of taking the punishment during each show and rehearsal they are used.  <br/><br/>I do not want to compromise on the impact the final scene could offer to it's audience, Getting the best LightSabres available might make the difference between watching something that is fun, or something that is fun and powerful in its authenticity!</p>

You may wonder what we intend to do with these lightsaber said following the run at the Fringe. For starters we are hoping to put the play on again at further venues in 2016.


Also, as Greg already runs a series of videos with his Condensed Histories, he and Patch are planning to create a series of videos available free on YouTube under the 'Cutting Edge' banner, aimed at explaining some basics of stage combat, and taking some techniques of old sword and fencing masters and applying these to the lightsaber!


   The Impact

The Hanged Man, will be the first time Cutting Edge, has produced a play. Although Cutting Edge has been involved with numerous local productions, it has done so to support another established company with its fight choreography and sourcing of equipment and props... Cutting Edge, to date has helped out with:The Thieves of Malmby Hall (Adlib)Treasure Island (Adlib)Blackgang Pirates (Vectis Ventures)Robin Hood (Adlib & Vectis Ventures)NIght Watch (Adlib)Sleeping Beauty (Wight Strollers)Pirates of Penzance (Island Savoyards)The Merry Wives of Windsor (Arreton Players)Merchant of Venice (Apollo Theatre)Robinson Crusoe (Wight Strollers)The Comedy of Errors (Arreton Players)The Tempest (Apollo Theatre)The Herbal Bed (Apollo Theatre)The Return of the Musketeers (Adlib)Henry IV (IOW Shakespeare Company)Various Workshops for Vectis Ventures and Island Schools.
Helping Cutting Edge deliver on this production will aid our long term plan to improve the equipment and services we offer to local performance groups. It will also extend the range of workshops we can offer schools and other groups, All people need to enjoy exercising the mind and the body and in my opinion helping people to understand a script and choreograph the fight that best complements the characters and needs of the scene is the perfect symbiotic relationship.
Risks & Challenges
 The risks are minimal. All the Perks have been carefully calculated to be self sustaining and provide the production budget. The show has been booked into the Ventnor Fringe Roster, the cast has been chosen. The show will happen no matter what. The true challenge is the fight choreography, sourcing Light Sabres that are capable of taking the punishment during each show and rehearsal they are used.  I do not want to compromise on the impact the final scene could offer to it's audience, Getting the best LightSabres available might make the difference between watching something that is fun, or something that is fun and powerful in its authenticity!

<li>My name is Tess Holbrook. I have been working in theatre, specifically with Shakespeare plays, for ten years. Macbeth has certainly become one of my favorite plays for its thrilling observation of the human mind and soul. Most of my work has been through the delightful acting camp: Get Thee To The Funnery! (I'm the one in the hat)</li>
<li>I've decided to take this excellent script and switch the genders of each character. In this day in age we have been switching the lead characters, but I wanted to take it a step further and switch ALL the characters. I think this will be the first in a long line of changes we will be seeing in the future when it comes to gender identification.</li>
<li>The play will be performed at the amazing Off Center theatre in Burlington Vermont. Which I have worked with many times in the past couple years. We will have minimal set decorations and props so we can focus primarily on the performance. That being said we will need a lot of help paying for the theatre and rehearsal space.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I think because this play deals with a gender-less concept, it is the perfect platform to switch genders of all the characters. All the males will be female and played by women and all the females will be male and be played by men. Except the children will be gender-less. I wont be changing anything in the play except the gender roles. So whatever stereotypes the audience sees in the play will be their own perception of gender. I believe we are entering a new era where many of today's youth no longer identify as <i>she</i> or <i>him</i>, but instead <i>they</i>, <i>them</i>.</p>
<p>            I hope this production is a thrill and thought provoking.

Now, more than ever, is the time to step forward and support women in the theatre industry and projects about women’s issues. THML Theatre Company and IN OUR WORDS have chosen to team up to bring a production of <i>Cagebirds</i> by David Campton to New York City as a response to these shifts in our political and social environment.</p><h3>About the Show</h3><p>Our creative team has chosen to take this play in a very realistic and sobering direction- our setting will be in a Center for Troubled Women, hearkening back to the days when women were sent to psychiatric wards for “female ailments” like hysteria. The year is 2020, three years into the new presidential administration. <i>Cagebirds</i> will explore the narratives of the women in the center as they encounter a new addition to the group. This will be an intentional and intersectional all-female cast. We are creating characters that are immigrants, Muslims, Jews, transgender women, southern belles, curvy women, women of color, and women battling mental illness. Our production will tell stories- women’s stories. Current issues. Corrupt, manipulative leadership. Fear. Hate. Gossip. Vanity. Freedom. It is all packed into this one hour show. We are confident that <i>Cagebirds</i> will impact the community we serve here in New York City.</p><h3>About THML</h3><p>THML is a new theatre company in New York City dedicated to engaging audiences with stories of women who survive and thrive. Tahamul is a word in Arabic and Farsi which translates, “to endure,” or “to bear the burden.” The Arabic letters which form this word are ta, ha, miim, and laam (THML). Kayla Friend, the founder of THML and director of <i>Cagebirds</i>, created the company out of her desire to see disenfranchised women of all backgrounds empowered through the arts. Her aim is to engage, to invade comfortable spaces, and to change lives by changing the conversation through performance. </p><h3>Our Partnership</h3><p>THML is delighted to partner with IN OUR WORDS for this particular project. IN OUR WORDS is a project under the non-profit, Fractured Atlas. Alan Bounville, the founder of IN OUR WORDS, has been working with playwrights and actors on new, edgy, and engaging pieces of theatre in New York City since 2013. The mission of IN OUR WORDS is to “positively transform lives and communities…by sharing the words of real people and by helping to advance progressive social change agendas.” IN OUR WORDS decided to partner with THML for the production of Cagebirds because of its content and intention- to positively transform lives and help advance progressive social change agendas. Fifteen percent of every ticket sale for our production will be donated to a local organization that has boots on the ground, in the thick of creating social change and responding to community needs. Our current partnering organizations for educational talkback nights are Let My People Go, The National Organization for Victim Assistance, The Arab American Association of New York, and The New York Anti-Violence Project.</p><h3>Our Goals</h3><p>Our fundraising goal for this project is $13,000.00. These funds will enable us to secure our venue, pay a stipend to our actors and production team, build our set pieces, purchase and assemble our costumes, pay for the rights to the material, and rent our rehearsal spaces. We aim to reduce the costs wherever possible; we will be rehearsing in a donated space at least once a week throughout the production process. Because of our partnership with IN OUR WORDS, all of our funds will be raised through crowdsourcing and private donations. All donations made through IN OUR WORDS will be processed through Fractured Atlas and will be tax deductible to the extent permitted by law.</p><p>We began fundraising January 15th, 2017 and we were able to raise $2,000 in just under three weeks simply by reaching out to friends and family. This first benchmark helped us secure our venue for the production and pay for the rights to the material. THML and IN OUR WORDS is seeking partnership through individuals like you and the companies that you represent to make this production happen. Independent productions such as these require a great amount of sacrifice and effort for everyone involved; they are truly a labor of love. We do not anticipate making any profit off of this production- we to see this piece as an investment in our community and an opportunity to publicly empower women of all shapes, sizes, colors, and creeds within the arts. <i>Cagebirds</i> is a chance to give back and invest in the people of New York City.</p><p> </p><p>Theatre has the power to transform lives. Theatre can challenge the status quo. Theatre can amplify voices that are brushed aside in our mainstream social discourse. THML and IN OUR WORDS aspire to present work that elevates narratives often forgotten or ignored by broader culture. We realize that funding for this type of work is sparse today; this is why we need your partnership. Our team seeks to use theatre as a transformative tool in our community. If you feel as we do, that is our job to elevate the narratives of the oppressed and underrepresented, then we invite you to partner with us on this project by donating.

</p><p>Hello, </p>
<p>WE are stronger believers that the arts are not only a way of expressing your
feelings, I believe that if you are passionate about dance in all of the
different disciplines, music, acting and you have the talent and the passion
you SHOULD be able to have the chance to receive the training and education so
you can follow your dream and be able to work on this field. </p>
<p>This is the exact reason why we started this project. In my country we have
great talent, but we do not have a full education in performance arts, which is
why the dancers can not make a career out of what they love. </p>
<p>Here in Nicaragua, we do not have much teachers with
global tendencies, and the academies where we can find up to date dance techniques are very expensive for the majority of the aspiring artists here in Nicaragua.<br/></p>
<p>Last year we were able to see perform a group of professional
dancers from TROPICANA CABARET FROM CUBA and we started a friendship with them,
and we decided that one day we were going to give the chance to let young
artists from my country to be trained by one of those dancers. </p>
<p>That day came and we decided to sell our business,  and
we started to negotiate with one of the best dancers from Tropicana who is also
a professor  to come and train a few dancers, so we donated all our money on
this project, we made auditions,  and announced that we were going to
train them and be part of the first Cabaret Dance Company in Nicaragua, at the
beginning no one understood us, but with time we started giving more
information of the tendencies of the cabaret dances and the background of the Tropicana
and the audition was a success, which we taped and a few professional
nicaraguan dance teachers volunteer to help us picking the young artists, one
of them his name is Christopher he is 17 years old he made a beautiful
performance and in the interview he said, I quote "" No parent want his kid
to be a dancer"", I asked why you think is that and he said I would never
to be able to sustain myself as a dancer. </p>
<p>This confirmed our passion for the project, and we picked 12 kids, between
the ages of 15 and 24 we even have one dancer who is almost 30 his name is
Leonid, he said, I've always dreamed with being a student of an international
professor. Allison, 15 years old, she started at 3 and went to the public
school that had a little fee of the equivalent of US$5, she got a full
scholarship because she couldn't afford that fee and she is an amazing dancer. </p>
<p>We were able with the funds we donated to pay for the flight ticket, housing
food and classes for 45 days and put together a show we called ""Noches de
Cabaret"" we made a deal with a medium size theater and presented the show, it
was a success, the costumes weren't as good as I would like to but it was what we could afford, the kids said ""It doesn't matter how our costumes are we
will leave our hearts on the show"", and they did, we taped it and we are
working on a demo ourselves so we can get a few contracts so this artist can
get financial income out of their dance.</p>
<p>In the process after getting to know the dancers and their lives we decided
to not just make a CABARET DANCE COMPANY, we want to make this an educational
project, of course we want them to be able to get financial income by dancing
but this goes beyond that.</p>
<p>There is a long way to go, this can not stop here, we still need to train
the dancers, there's a lot more to learn, and we literally ran out of money, we
can't even afford a space to practice, a nicaraguan teacher said she could help
us giving her knowledge and ""cleaning""the choreography if we can only
give her transportation and of curse a space to practice.</p>
<p>This young artists deserve the
opportunity to get the best education they can get, I know dancers from other
countries who could come and train them but we don't even have the funds to
practice what we already paid for. </p>
<p>To be able to pay a full year of training, renting a space for practice,
giving the kids a little financial help for transportation (since their houses
are in the outside of the city at very poor neighborhoods), adding details for
the costumes to make them better, financial help for the nicaraguan professor,
shoes for the dancers we need US $10800 exactly. I know is a lot of money but I
know they worth it, and we are working hard to become self sustainable, in t he
future we want this artists to give classes and train future generations of dancers
in Nicaragua. </p>
<p>I can not imagine a world without the arts, especially DANCE, I understand is a lot of money, if one of you
can not help us with money, there are OTHER WAYS to support us, by spreading
the word, INDIEGOGO have share options, or making little donations. Please help
us, this is a beautiful project, we can send all the information you require
and we can backup every dollar you send us and give you prove that the money
you give us goes 100% to the project.</p>

school that had a little fee of the equivalent of US$5, she got a full
scholarship because she couldn't afford that fee and she is an amazing dancer. 
We were able with the funds we donated to pay for the flight ticket, housing
food and classes for 45 days and put together a show we called ""Noches de
Cabaret"" we made a deal with a medium size theater and presented the show, it
was a success, the costumes weren't as good as I would like to but it was what we could afford, the kids said ""It doesn't matter how our costumes are we
will leave our hearts on the show"", and they did, we taped it and we are
working on a demo ourselves so we can get a few contracts so this artist can
get financial income out of their dance.
In the process after getting to know the dancers and their lives we decided
to not just make a CABARET DANCE COMPANY, we want to make this an educational
project, of course we want them to be able to get financial income by dancing
but this goes beyond that.
There is a long way to go, this can not stop here, we still need to train
the dancers, there's a lot more to learn, and we literally ran out of money, we
can't even afford a space to practice, a nicaraguan teacher said she could help
us giving her knowledge and ""cleaning""the choreography if we can only
give her transportation and of curse a space to practice.
This young artists deserve the
opportunity to get the best education they can get, I know dancers from other
countries who could come and train them but we don't even have the funds to
practice what we already paid for. 
To be able to pay a full year of training, renting a space for practice,
giving the kids a little financial help for transportation (since their houses
are in the outside of the city at very poor neighborhoods), adding details for
the costumes to make them better, financial help for the nicaraguan professor,
shoes for the dancers we need US $10800 exactly. I know is a lot of money but I
know they worth it, and we are working hard to become self sustainable, in t he
future we want this artists to give classes and train future generations of dancers
in Nicaragua. 
I can not imagine a world without the arts, especially DANCE, I understand is a lot of money, if one of you
can not help us with money, there are OTHER WAYS to support us, by spreading
the word, INDIEGOGO have share options, or making little donations. Please help
us, this is a beautiful project, we can send all the information you require
and we can backup every dollar you send us and give you prove that the money
you give us goes 100% to the project.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>The Restless Observers Theatre Project</strong> is a <strong>student led company</strong> in Logan, Utah. The five members vary in fields of theatrical study with members being involved in the Bachelor of Fine Arts in Acting, A Bachelor of Arts in Theatre, and Theatre Education. </p>
<p><strong>The process began six months ago</strong> when a member of our company, Brendon Henderson, read the play <i>Slipping </i>by Daniel Talbott. The play follows a teenager named Eli who moves from San Francisco to the middle of nowhere Iowa. Upon moving to Iowa, he meets a boy named Jake who once again opens him up to the idea of love again, an idea that had been shattered after an abusive relationship and the death of his father. We follow Eli on a tumultuous coming of age journey where he battles with discovering himself and with trusting other people. </p>
<p><strong>Brendon was drawn to the fact</strong> that the play touched on various themes that audiences could relate to. <strong>Themes</strong> such as<strong> not feeling good enough for people, feeling comfortable in your own skin, loving so much but not having them love back, and of course the danger of closeness and being swallowed by it.</strong>  He knew that it was a story that needed to be told, because it was powerful enough to expose people to a new way of thinking. However, he also realized that the play dealt with themes that were extremely controversial, especially for a Utah audience. He knew that the only way he would be able to get it produced would mean having to do propose something a little bit crazy... </p>
<p><i><strong>The only way to get the story told would be to pose the show as a ""no conflict"" to the University and to have it be completely student produced.</strong></i></p>
<p>This means that<strong> nothing is provided </strong>to the students from the University except a location to put on the show, bare minimum furniture for a ""set"" and a few props. This has resulted in the creation of an extremely <strong>barebones </strong><strong>theatre experience. </strong>  The cast will be on stage throughout the entire course of the play and will be extremely open with the audience. Costume changes will be made on the set, sets will be built using a few benches and black boxes, and the lighting will just be a simple dimmer switch. It is a huge undertaking as the five students have assumed the role of producer, marketer, actor, costume designer, lighting designer, set designer and director. </p>
<p><strong>With that being said we still need help!</strong> The money that you help us raise will go towards <strong>buying costumes, helping us secure the licensing rights and a house manager for our four day run (which is a necessity if we are to use the Black Box Theatre)</strong>. The show is completely <strong>not for profit </strong>and the actors in the show are only being <strong>paid in experience. </strong></p>
<p>In a way of showing our extreme gratitude for your help in funding this experience we have a large variety of different packages available for sale ranging from $1-$300! The various packages include: </p>
<p>$1 The Slight Stumble Package</p>
<p>$5 The Talbott Package </p>
<p>$30 The Jan Package</p>
<p>$50 The Chris Package</p>
<p>$100 The Jake Package </p>
<p>$200 The Eli Package</p>
<p>$300 The Slipping Package </p>
<p>(More information can be found in the <strong>PERKS </strong>section) </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The reason for this project is simple and honest. </strong>Your donation will help with opening the door for creativity and growth of knowledge for not only us, but for the community that we are going to be sharing this story with. That's because <i>Slipping </i>is being independently produced by young aspiring actors who want to expose audiences to a different way of thinking and to push our limits and comfort zones as artists. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>With this being a student led project, there are many road blocks and obstacles that we have had to and that we are going to overcome. The main one right now being working without a budget. This is restricting us from securing the rights to the play, a house manager, and getting simple costumes for our characters. We also run the high risk of protest for this show, specifically because the lead characters are homosexual. If we let fear influence our decisions, however, we would have backed out long ago. All of us firmly believe that this is a beautiful look into the human mind and that it is a story that <i>deserves </i>to be told. Plus let's be honest...controversy adds a little bit of fun! </p>

<h3><u>What We're Doing</u></h3>
<p>Brittany Belland and Weslie Lechner are the writers and creators of the original live satire musical, <i>Willy Wonka and the Weed Factory. </i> <i>WWWF</i> is the story of five ""Golden Spliffin"" winners invited by a hemp enthusiast to come tour his factory and experience all that cannabis has to offer. Inspired by the beloved Roald Dahl classic, <i>WWWF</i> explores the history of weed's criminalization and its ties to social and racial injustice, as well as all the medicinal and environmental benefits that cannabis has to offer. It’s more than just a story about smoking weed, it’s a story of love, trust, and above all, acceptance of others.</p>
<p>We've created this show because as climate change becomes increasingly imminent, the U.S. needs to finally recognize Hemp as the sustainable solution. With the ability to make over 25,000 environmentally friendly products (such as plastic, cotton, and even biofuels), it's baffling that the hemp plant is still illegal to produce in over half the country. </p>
<p>The goal of<i> WWWF</i>  is to reduce the stigma associated with cannabis use, both medicinally and recreationally, and to reintroduce hemp into society for what it really is - a plant that can save the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></h3>
<p>We need your help in our endeavor to reduce the stigma surrounding cannabis because producing a thirteen cast member musical is expensive!</p>
<p>We're requesting $6,000 in funding to be distributed as follows,</p>
<ul>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Advertisements</li>
<li>Hiring of crew (lighting technician, stage manager, musicians and ushers)</li>
<li>Hiring of cast (all thirteen characters)</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497548319/uwq91qqin5koecycbimf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If we're unable to raise our goal funding amount, the professionalism of our show and our efforts to educate about the uses of hemp will suffer... and we <i>really</i> don't want that. So, we've offered a series of custom perks for your donations! View them to the right!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>We'll be opening our show at The Fremont Centre Theater in South Pasadena, California from July 20th till July 24th. After our initial run of five performances, we hope to take our show on tour across the country to spread the message of the benefits of cannabis.  We believe that the more who see our show and learn about marijuana's universal use, the greater the possibility of cannabis legalization and sustainable hemp production. Knowledge is power.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>While <a href=""http://www.wellandproductions.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Welland Productions</a> has experience producing short films and sketches, this is our very first full length, live musical production. We've received consultation and mentoring from many top industry professionals about our budget and our goals, but the risk of unforeseen issues popping up and not budgeting enough money is always a possibility. </p>
<p>However, we greatly believe in the message of this show and are determined to produce it, no matter the difficulties. Thankfully, we've got an incredible network of support from our friends and family to help us along the way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></h3>
<p>If you're unable to provide a monetary contribution but believe in our show's message as much as we do and would like to be apart of it, <i>please </i>reach out to us.</p>
<p>We're still looking for assistance in set design, stage managing, publicity and sponsorship, and would love any and all help you're willing to offer.  You can also help us out by -</p>

</div></div>","What We're Doing
Brittany Belland and Weslie Lechner are the writers and creators of the original live satire musical, Willy Wonka and the Weed Factory.  WWWF is the story of five ""Golden Spliffin"" winners invited by a hemp enthusiast to come tour his factory and experience all that cannabis has to offer. Inspired by the beloved Roald Dahl classic, WWWF explores the history of weed's criminalization and its ties to social and racial injustice, as well as all the medicinal and environmental benefits that cannabis has to offer. It’s more than just a story about smoking weed, it’s a story of love, trust, and above all, acceptance of others.
We've created this show because as climate change becomes increasingly imminent, the U.S. needs to finally recognize Hemp as the sustainable solution. With the ability to make over 25,000 environmentally friendly products (such as plastic, cotton, and even biofuels), it's baffling that the hemp plant is still illegal to produce in over half the country. 
The goal of WWWF  is to reduce the stigma associated with cannabis use, both medicinally and recreationally, and to reintroduce hemp into society for what it really is - a plant that can save the world. 

What We Need & What You Get
We need your help in our endeavor to reduce the stigma surrounding cannabis because producing a thirteen cast member musical is expensive!
We're requesting $6,000 in funding to be distributed as follows,

Costumes
Props
Advertisements
Hiring of crew (lighting technician, stage manager, musicians and ushers)
Hiring of cast (all thirteen characters)


If we're unable to raise our goal funding amount, the professionalism of our show and our efforts to educate about the uses of hemp will suffer... and we really don't want that. So, we've offered a series of custom perks for your donations! View them to the right!

The Impact
We'll be opening our show at The Fremont Centre Theater in South Pasadena, California from July 20th till July 24th. After our initial run of five performances, we hope to take our show on tour across the country to spread the message of the benefits of cannabis.  We believe that the more who see our show and learn about marijuana's universal use, the greater the possibility of cannabis legalization and sustainable hemp production. Knowledge is power.

Risks & Challenges
While Welland Productions has experience producing short films and sketches, this is our very first full length, live musical production. We've received consultation and mentoring from many top industry professionals about our budget and our goals, but the risk of unforeseen issues popping up and not budgeting enough money is always a possibility. 
However, we greatly believe in the message of this show and are determined to produce it, no matter the difficulties. Thankfully, we've got an incredible network of support from our friends and family to help us along the way.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you're unable to provide a monetary contribution but believe in our show's message as much as we do and would like to be apart of it, please reach out to us.
We're still looking for assistance in set design, stage managing, publicity and sponsorship, and would love any and all help you're willing to offer.  You can also help us out by -

<li>I've been in the theatre since I was seven and have always been apart of it in one fashion or another. For 27 years the theatre has been my home and my passion. I've toured locally and internationally and I've been in two feature films and the TV show Crash. I was also the Unit Production Manager for a Telly Award Winning film. Moreover, I was the director of a nationally recognized acting and modeling school. My experience with on-screen acting, musical theatre, voice, dance and make-up application makes me extremely well suited to teach this craft to others.</li> <li>All my life I've wanted to inspire others through the theater and this campaign gives me the perfect platform to do so. My goal is to have a very successful and inspirational place for students to learn and grow. I'm excited to share my gift with others and to help them find theirs.</li>
<li> I need your support to make this dream a reality. To be a positive influence to the young children of today so we may all have a better tomorrow will mean a brighter future for us all! With your help, I can be the catalyst for this type of change.</li> </ul> <p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <ul>
<li>In order to make my venture successful I need your help to achieve my goal  to raise $12,000 for start-up costs so I can open the doors to this new and exciting endeavor.</li> <li>I will be offering some amazing perks for those going above and beyond to help me; however, all donations are appreciated.  One of the exciting perks is your name on a wall as a beneficiary. Another exciting perk is a professional photoshoot with a well known New York City photographer.</li> <li>No matter what amount I receive, I know this pursuit will be successful and flourish because of your generous donation.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Promoting a positive environment in which our children can thrive in is vital to the health and well being of not only the participant and those they touch but of the entire planet. This is my mission.<br/>
</li> <li>The success I've had with my students has been overwhelming.  I've helped students get into their college of choice; some have gone on to become singers/songwriters and actors. Students have won awards and been offered exciting opportunities in the arts; such as special invitations to perform with award winning performing artists in New York City and Las Vegas.</li> <li>I have an outstanding reputation in the community for being professional, caring, energetic and inspiring to my students and the community as a whole.  Without the arts the community would be a less exciting and vivacious place to be.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul>
<li>The only challenge I face in this journey is a monetary one.  I know I have the skills and drive to succeed.  I just need the capital.</li> <li>I'm reaching out to the small business community for help and guidance in securing funding, support and business expertise so that my venture will be very successful.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you cannot contribute financially there are other ways you can help.  I can supply postcards and flyers for you to distribute and a simple word-of-mouth goes a long way.  </li>

I was also the Unit Production Manager for a Telly Award Winning film. Moreover, I was the director of a nationally recognized acting and modeling school. My experience with on-screen acting, musical theatre, voice, dance and make-up application makes me extremely well suited to teach this craft to others. All my life I've wanted to inspire others through the theater and this campaign gives me the perfect platform to do so. My goal is to have a very successful and inspirational place for students to learn and grow. I'm excited to share my gift with others and to help them find theirs.
 I need your support to make this dream a reality. To be a positive influence to the young children of today so we may all have a better tomorrow will mean a brighter future for us all! With your help, I can be the catalyst for this type of change.  What We Need & What You Get
 
In order to make my venture successful I need your help to achieve my goal  to raise $12,000 for start-up costs so I can open the doors to this new and exciting endeavor. I will be offering some amazing perks for those going above and beyond to help me; however, all donations are appreciated.  One of the exciting perks is your name on a wall as a beneficiary. Another exciting perk is a professional photoshoot with a well known New York City photographer. No matter what amount I receive, I know this pursuit will be successful and flourish because of your generous donation.    The Impact

Promoting a positive environment in which our children can thrive in is vital to the health and well being of not only the participant and those they touch but of the entire planet. This is my mission.
 The success I've had with my students has been overwhelming.  I've helped students get into their college of choice; some have gone on to become singers/songwriters and actors. Students have won awards and been offered exciting opportunities in the arts; such as special invitations to perform with award winning performing artists in New York City and Las Vegas. I have an outstanding reputation in the community for being professional, caring, energetic and inspiring to my students and the community as a whole.  Without the arts the community would be a less exciting and vivacious place to be.    Risks & Challenges 
The only challenge I face in this journey is a monetary one.  I know I have the skills and drive to succeed.  I just need the capital. I'm reaching out to the small business community for help and guidance in securing funding, support and business expertise so that my venture will be very successful.    Other Ways You Can Help

If you cannot contribute financially there are other ways you can help.  I can supply postcards and flyers for you to distribute and a simple word-of-mouth goes a long way.  
Also, remember you can also share my indiegogo sight with all your friends and family.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

In addition, you will be supporting a diverse artistic community in Seoul and allowing us to continue to create theatrical art in Korea’s international community.  </p><p><strong><u>An Introduction to Seoul Shakespeare Company</u></strong></p><p>Seoul Shakespeare Company is an all-volunteer theatre company that brings Shakespeare’s works to Seoul audiences in English, with Korean subtitles. We have existed since 2010, and have put on fully-staged productions since 2011. We typically produce one major show per year in Korea's theatre district of Daehangno, with smaller fundraising events throughout the year, as well as acting workshops that are open to the community.</p><p>We serve three main populations in Korea: </p><p>1) Korean audience members (including students) who would like to see Shakespeare performed in the original language, </p><p>2) English-speaking audience members (including students from international schools) who would like to see theatre performed in a language they understand </p><p>3) English-speakers (both foreign and Korean) who want to participate in making theatre and hone their craft in the theatrical arts. </p><p>By being an all-volunteer company, we are able to allow people of all nationalities to participate freely in the creation of theatre. At the same time, we aim to put on productions that are professional in quality, so that we are worth the time and effort of people who are serious about a future career in the theatre. Some of our past company members are now pursuing a professional career in theatre in other countries, and one of our core purposes is to provide an opportunity for English-speaking theatre people living in Korea to continue to develop their craft, while also contributing positively to Korean society.</p><p>Last year's production of <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i> brought a new vibrancy to our productions and was very popular with audiences, defying expectations of what could be done in Seoul's theatre community. It also marked the expansion of interest in our company among international schools in particular, and for the first time we had many groups of English-speaking students from these schools attend our performances. For many in our audience (not just students), our shows are their first exposure to live theatre or to live Shakespeare performance in particular.</p><p><strong><u>What we need</u></strong></p><p>This fundraising campaign is to raise the $5,000 that we need in order to make the second payment on our theatre space, which is due when we move into the theatre. It is absolutely crucial that we be able to make this payment.</p><p>We have already paid for our rehearsal space and made our first payment to the theatre using last year's ticket sales, and the ticket sales from this year's show should cover our third theatre payment as well as reimbursing our producer for our other expenses, like printing, advertising, costumes, set, and props. As long as ticket sales do well, this $5,000 is the last bit we need to make this production happen.</p><p><u><strong>More about <i>The Winter’s Tale</i></strong></u></p><p>This year's production of <i>The Winter's Tale</i> builds upon the success of last year's <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, shifting from last year’s Elizabethan setting to a roughly Victorian/Edwardian period. <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>’s warm and joyful mood, in which we placed an emphasis on music and dance, is carried over into the middle section of <i>The Winter’s Tale</i>, which takes place in a rustic, pastoral Bohemia, but is contrasted with a stark, melancholic, tragic world of Sicilia in the beginning of the play. </p><p>The themes in <i>The Winter’s Tale</i> run a bit deeper and are broader in scope than those in <i>Much Ado</i>, and reflect Shakespeare’s most mature (and experimental, rule-bending) period of writing. Many of Shakespeare’s plays explore the psychology of heads of state, and the effects that power can have on those who wield it. In the first half of <i>The Winter’s Tale</i>, we explore the themes of jealousy and tyranny. Whereas in <i>Othello</i>, the emphasis is on the slow development of Othello’s misplaced jealousy, ending with violence, and in <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, Claudio’s jealousy is a plot device that is comedically cleared up in the end, in <i>The Winter’s Tale</i>, Leontes’ jealousy is acted upon near the beginning of the play. The emphasis in this play is on what unfolds afterwards as a result. We see King Leontes’ jealousy turn into tyranny, as he orders the poisoning of his friend (the Bohemian King, Polixenes), imprisons his own innocent wife (Queen Hermione), accusing her of adultery and a plot to murder him, and refuses to listen to truth or dissent, accusing even his closest advisors of being traitors when they try to persuade him that he is wrong. The strongest resistance to him comes from one of Shakespeare’s most outspoken female characters, Paulina, but even she ultimately fails to change Leontes’ mind, and Leontes orders that his newborn daughter (whose paternity he questions) be abandoned in a foreign land. In the play’s famous trial scene, Leontes’ imperviousness to truth reaches is zenith when even the oracle to the god Apollo, normally trusted religiously by Leontes, declares Hermione’s innocence and calls Leontes a jealous tyrant. Leontes calls the oracle's decree ""falsehood"" and insists on continuing with the trial. It is only when, in an apparent retaliation by the gods, Leontes’ beloved son Mamillius suddenly dies, followed immediately after by Hermione, that Leontes realizes he was wrong and accepts the furious wrath of a distraught Paulina. He devotes his life to repentance, and takes on Paulina as a trusted advisor and reminder of the wrongs he committed. For the next 16 years, he mourns and punishes himself for the deaths of his son and his wife, and the abandonment of his baby daughter.</p><p>So we begin with the themes of jealousy, tyranny, and tragedy. However, this mini-tragedy is only the first half of the play. In the second half, with a 16-year jump forward in time and a movement of the action to Polixenes’s rustic kingdom of Bohemia, we see Perdita, the abandoned baby daughter of Leontes and Hermione, as a 16-year old, who has grown up as the adopted daughter of a shepherd, and who captures the admiration of those around her with her elegance and wit. Not knowing of the events that led to this point in the play, she and Prince Florizel (the son of Bohemian King Polixenes) have fallen in love, and Florizel is determined that they will marry, despite her low social status, even if it means facing the wrath of his father and forfeiting his right to the crown. We see them on the day of a local sheep-shearing celebration, where events unfold that bring about a sudden escape to Leontes’ Sicilia, the reunion of Perdita and her long-repentant father Leontes, a reconciliation between the two kings, and one of Shakespeare’s most moving final scenes—which we won’t spoil for you here—a scene of reunion and forgiveness, and a testament to the healing effects of Time.</p><p><strong><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></strong></p><p>Even if you can't give directly to our production, you can help us by sharing our campaign through social media, and, if you're in Korea, coming to our show!  Ticket reservations for the show are already available: <strong><a href=""http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/up-next-the-winter-s-tale"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/up-next-...</a></strong></p><p><u><strong>Korean Bank Transfer Option</strong></u></p><p>If you have a Korean bank account, you can also contribute via bank transfer.  Your contribution won't show up in our Indiegogo total, but we can still send you the perks listed above.  Send us an email to let us know that you've contributed, and whether you would like to receive the associated perks, and we'll add you to our list of donors.  Here is a link to our bank information: <strong><a href=""http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/make-a-contribution"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.seoulshakespearecompany.org/make-a-c...</a></strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>Thank you for anything you are able to give to support this production!</strong></p><p>  </p><p><strong>****Please note that, on Indiegogo, making a contribution does not automatically sign you up to receive a perk.  If you would like to receive a perk, you must specifically click on the perk you would like to receive!

Il teatro classico, l’opera, spettacoli ispirati dalla letteratura e poesia francesi ma anche teatro contemporaneo saranno rappresentati in questo festival.L'idea è di portare sulla scena italiana truppe francesi che sono attualmente in scena in Francia e dunque, portare un pezzo della cultura francese in Italia. Scegliendo spettacoli che mantengono un legame con l'Italia, il ponte viene creato tra i due paesi; tra due culture che sono spesso descritte come cugine.Tuttavia, invece di concentrare gli spettacoli in un breve periodo come per i festival classici, ci è sembrato più interessante cospargere la stagione teatrale romana 2018-2019 con le nostre piccole gocce di teatro francese.Gli spettacoli in lingua francese saranno sottotitolati in italiano.Per chi?Per tutti i francofoni e francofili, per tutti gli amanti del teatro e tutti i curiosi!Dove? Quando?Il festival si svolgerà presso il Teatro Vascello a Roma durante tutta la stagione teatrale 2018-2019.Il Teatro Vascello è stato fondato quasi 30 anni fa da Giancarlo Nanni e Manuela Kustermann nel 1989. Il teatro è specializzato in produzioni contemporanee e gestisce un laboratorio “La Fabbrica dell’attore”.Oggi il teatro è gestito da Manuela Kustermann, direttrice artistica e Marco Ciuti, direttore amministrativo e organizzativo e ha 360 posti.Maggiori informazioni => http://teatrovascello.it/sezioni/teatro.htmLa nostra prima goccia, La Traviata del Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, si terrà dal 6 al 7 ottobre. La nostra prima goccia: La Traviata del Théâtre des Bouffes du NordLo spettacolo è un adattamento della famosa opera di Giuseppe Verdi, lui stesso ispirato da La Signora delle Camelie da Dumas figlio, che scrisse dopo la sua tragica relazione con la cortigiana Marie Duplessis. Violetta, cortigiana parigina in vista e Alfredo, un giovane borghese provenzale, si amano follemente. Violetta rinuncia alla sua vita mondana, ma il padre di Alfredo la costringe alla rottura.La Traviata è quindi una storia francese, adattata per l'opera da un compositore italiano, poi trasformata in un'opera teatrale in Francia, torna in Italia a Roma per il festival Gocce di teatro. Le Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, una famosa compagnia francese, presenta Traviata - Ti meriti un futuro migliore , prima in tournée della stagione.Le Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord dice:""Nella Traviata - Ti meriti un futuro migliore, gli spettatori sono invitati nell'intimità di Violetta a vedere da vicino il fuoco in cui è coinvolta, tra gli ospiti di questa festa musicale e fantasmagorica che mescola teatro e opera, voci parlate e voci cantanti, dove la distinzione tra strumentisti e cantanti è confusa, dove Charles Baudelaire siede accanto a Christophe Tarkos e dove muoiono i fantasmi di questa Parigi in piena espansione, di cui ora viviamo il futuro.""   http://www.bouffesdunord.com/fr/la-saison/traviata Il crowdfunding: A cosa serviranno i fondi?A portare la famosa Compagnia Théatre des Bouffes du Nord a Roma!

En choisissant des spectacles qui gardent un lien avec l’Italie ou l’italien,  le pont est ainsi créé entre les deux pays; ces deux cultures qu’on décrit souvent comme cousines.Cependant, au lieu de concentrer les spectacles sur une courte période comme pour les festivals classiques, il nous est apparu plus intéressant de parsemer la saison théâtrale romaine de nos petites gouttes de théâtre français.Les spectacles seront en français et sous-titrés en italien. Pour qui?Pour tous les francophones et les francophiles, pour tous les passionnés de théâtre et pour tous les curieux! Où et quand?Le Festival aura lieu au Théâtre Vascello à Rome tout au long de la saison théâtrale 2018-2019.Le théâtre Vascello a été créé il y a presque 30 ans en 1989 par Giancarlo Nanni et Manuela Kustermann. Le théâtre est spécialisé en productions contemporaines et gère un atelier “La Fabbrica dell’attore”.Aujourd’hui le théâtre est dirigé par Manuela Kustermann, directrice artistique et Marco Ciuti, directeur administratif et compte 360 places.Plus d’informations => http://teatrovascello.it/sezioni/teatro.htmNotre première goutte, La Traviata, du Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, se tiendra les 6 et 7 octobre. Notre première goutte: La Traviata du Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord Le spectacle est une adaptation du célèbre opéra de Giuseppe Verdi, lui même inspiré par La Dame aux Camélias de Dumas fils qu’il écrivit après sa tragique relation avec la courtisane Marie Duplessis. Violetta, courtisane parisienne en vue et Alfredo, jeune bourgeois provençal, tombent éperdument amoureux. Violetta renonce à sa vie mondaine, mais le père d’Alfredo la contraint à rompre.La Traviata, issue d'un roman d'un auteur français adapté à l'opéra par un compositeur Italien,  transformée en une pièce de théâtre en France, revient en Italie à Rome pour le festival Gouttes de théâtre. Le Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord, compagnie française parisienne de renom, vous présente Traviata- Vous méritez un avenir meilleur, sa première représentation en tournée de la saison.Le Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord en parle:“Dans Traviata - Vous méritez un avenir meilleur, les spectateurs sont invités dans l'intimité de Violetta à voir de tout près le feu auquel elle se livre, parmi les convives de cette fête musicale et fantasmagorique où se mêlent théâtre et opéra, voix parlées et voix chantées, où la distinction entre instrumentistes et chanteurs se brouille, où Charles Baudelaire se trouve assis près de Christophe Tarkos et où chantent et meurent les fantômes de ce Paris en plein essor industriel dont nous vivons à présent l'avenir.” http://www.bouffesdunord.com/traviata Le Crowdfunding: A quoi serviront les fonds récoltésA faire venir la célèbre compagnie des Bouffes du Nord à Rome:

The show features a diverse cast of six actor-musicians; three men and three women. It explores the universal desire for human longing and connection from the perspective of people who post on Craigslist.  It was developed and premiered at the Arts Club Theatre, Vancouver, BC, 2012.  Craigslist was originally produced in a 20 minute version by Theatre Replacement as a co-commission with PuSh and Theatre Conspiracy, Vancouver, BC, 2009.  It has since had productions in Toronto, ON, Calgary, AB, and Edmonton, AB.<br/></p>
<blockquote>From one of the Authors:<br/><i>""A few years ago, with not much more than fun in mind, we hauled some Craigslist ads free of their moorings. Veda Hille set them to music. With Amiel Gladstone, she put together a cast of Vancouver singing actors and performed the show as a 20-minute musical. It was meant to end there. What we didn’t count on was that, even in that hurried first go-around, we would find the evidence of so much tenderness, folly, and longing. There was more there than we suspected or knew. It was funny, but it was compelling. So, we kept on working, adding, subtracting, rearranging, as one does.""- </i>Bill Richardson</blockquote> </div> <div> <h3>Where has Craigslist been?</h3>

</div></div>","What is Missed Connections: A Craigslist Musical? 'Craigslist'  is a new original musical out of Canada based on real Craigslist Ads – “Your Personal Ads Set To Music” written by Canadian Humorist Bill Richardson, Indie Folk Artist Veda Hille and Amiel Gladstone. The show features a diverse cast of six actor-musicians; three men and three women. It explores the universal desire for human longing and connection from the perspective of people who post on Craigslist.  It was developed and premiered at the Arts Club Theatre, Vancouver, BC, 2012.  Craigslist was originally produced in a 20 minute version by Theatre Replacement as a co-commission with PuSh and Theatre Conspiracy, Vancouver, BC, 2009.  It has since had productions in Toronto, ON, Calgary, AB, and Edmonton, AB.
From one of the Authors:""A few years ago, with not much more than fun in mind, we hauled some Craigslist ads free of their moorings. Veda Hille set them to music. With Amiel Gladstone, she put together a cast of Vancouver singing actors and performed the show as a 20-minute musical. It was meant to end there. What we didn’t count on was that, even in that hurried first go-around, we would find the evidence of so much tenderness, folly, and longing. There was more there than we suspected or knew. It was funny, but it was compelling. So, we kept on working, adding, subtracting, rearranging, as one does.""- Bill Richardson   Where has Craigslist been?

<p><a href=""http://www.thecatladyplay.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.thecatladyplay.com</a></p>
<h3>About the Writers and the Play:</h3>
<p>The inception of The Cat Lady Play began in the Fall of 2015 when Markuz and I got together for the first time in nearly 15 years. We'd been good friends in high school with Markuz acting in the school plays and me having written a couple of the scripts. So, it felt like fate when we were together again as friends and the creative spark ignited into a serendipitous surprise. The Cat Lady was born from the most raucous muses in the cosmos of our minds. The full-length play about a 30-something cat lady's quest to pay rent and find love is laugh-out-loud funny, charming, and even romantic.</p>
<p>I, David Vaughn, am a professional humor writer based in San Diego. I've contributed to the <a href=""http://www.thehuffingtonpost.com/david-vaughn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Huffington Post</a> and am the author of the middle-grade fantasy book, <a href=""http://www.themidnightglass.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Midnight Glass</a>. My other plays include <i>Bird in the Mirror</i> (2002) and <i>How to Make Money at a Lemonade Stand</i> (2001).</p>
<p>Markuz Rodriguez is a professional actor based in San Diego. He has performed at San Diego's famous The Old Globe Theatre, The La Jolla Playhouse, The Diversionary Theatre, and the acclaimed <i>PUNKS</i> at the Ion Theatre. Mr. Rodriguez was selected as a contestant for the reality series, <i>Studio 4</i>.</p>
<p>Combining our talents has been overwhelmingly fun and inspiring. This play is a HUGE dream of ours! We deeply care about this characters and <u>we need help bringing it to the stage</u>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>The theatre rental for 8 shows August 3 - 12, 2017 at the Tenth Avenue Theatre in downtown San Diego</li>
<li>Paying the lead and supporting actors, the crew, rehearsal spaces, and funding the set pieces</li>
<li>Advertisements needed to spread the word and help fill the seats to pay for the rest of this project!</li>
</ul>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Essentially what we're doing is a pre-sale of our tickets. We would do the normal pre-sale on our site, but the buzz, at the moment, isn't high enough. This campaign is designed to create excitement and to give you a reason to want to watch this play! We'll post updates as we cast out actors and fun tidbits to show you how truly exciting this production will be to watch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every contribution comes with one or more tickets. When the campaign has concluded, you will be offered a choice of night, and the tickets will be held at Will Call for you.</li>
<li>If you can't make the show, but want to contribute, there are options to donate student tickets. These greatly help with college students on budget who crave local arts.</li>
<li>Businesses, please advertise with us! Your ad will appear in our program and a banner under ""sponsored"" our website's front page!</li>
<li>Like VIP? We have you covered! Get an exclusive package with premier seats, behind-the-scenes glimpses, and a meet-and-greet with the actors and playwrights before the show!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With films making astronomical sales worldwide, we want to show viewers that the theatre is just as exciting – if not ever more so! The venue is reserved, the dates are set, and we'll soon begin the casting process. Thus, we need the funds by mid-May 2017 in order to start rehearsals. The funds raised here will only cover about half of the costs. The rest we hope to make up in ticket sales, and if we can exceed our current IndieGoGo Goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The show is happening! Our main objective is to fill the seats, have fantastic sets, and the ability to pay the lead and supporting actors what they deserve. Without hitting our goal, all of this will be at risk.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>This is by far the biggest thing that any of us have ever tried to accomplish. We worked without rest for 8 weeks to put this production on in a warehouse/gallery space in Bushwick, Brooklyn last Fall. After rave reviews and a rapidly growing audience we are now jumping onto the Off-Broadway circuit at The Kraine Theatre in Manhattan.</li>
<li>Manhattan is very expensive and productions are very expensive, but we have a story we need to share with the world, and it can happen with support from all of you!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<ul>
<li>For this to work we need 52,900 dollars. As we all know, it isn’t cheap to rent a theatre in New York City. And living here isn’t easy either, so we need to pay our actors and crew as well. Plus of course the costs of costumes, props, and everything else. <p> </p>
<p>According to Actor’s Equity guidelines and our best estimations. This is the breakdown of money that we need to raise:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Theatre Rental for 4 weeks: 10,800</p>
<p>12 Actors under AEA for 4 weeks: 24,000</p>
<p>3 musicians for 4 weeks: 6,000</p>
<p>Crew for 4 weeks: 5,600</p>
<p>Stage Manager: 2,600</p>
<p>Advertising: 3,500</p>
<p>Program costs: 2,000</p>
<p>Costumes and Props: 2,000</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a potentially world changing project. Your support will be greatly appreciated and I will give all donors an extra shout out in our program (along with whatever perk you choose.) </p>
</li>
<li>We have all kinds of perks for those of you who donate! We have Original Cast Recordings, we have posters and t-shirts, we have free tickets, and we have even fancier prizes for the big spenders!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>Everyone who saw our Bushwick, Brooklyn run of the production last year agrees that this is a production that needs to be shared with the world.  </li>
<li>Our first run started out with a lot of empty seats and ended with three nights of a packed house in a row. This is in a neighborhood where people don't usually like theatre... or anything, really.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>We understand that we're asking for a lot for an art form that some people would say is on the decline, but we truly believe that what we have here is worth the risk. </li>
<li>With the help of people like you, we CAN do this. And we will.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Our mission is to create, produce, and promote extraordinary theatre by women by:<br/><br/><u>Producing a festival every summer where all shows are:</u><br/>1. Written by playwrights who identify as female or non-binary. </p><p><strong>2018: </strong><i>Crumble (Lay Me Down, Justin Timberlake)</i> by Sheila Callaghan, <i>Parallel Lives</i> by Mo Gaffney and Kathy Najimy, <i>Goblin Market</i> by Polly Pen and Christina Rossetti, <i>Eclipsed</i> by Danai Gurira &amp; <i>These Shining Lives</i> by Melanie Marnich</p><p>2. Have a cast makeup of 50% women or higher. <b>2018 - DONE!</b></p><p>3. Have at least 50% of the roles open to actors who are people of color. <strong>2018 - Casting still in process, but moving toward the goal quickly!</strong></p><p>In addition to our mainstage shows, we host workshops, classes, panel discussions, produce a 24-hour play festival (Occupy the Stage), and are developing year-round programming. WTF is a force in the community and hopes to inspire change in the triangle so that theatre programming is 50/50 by 2020 across the board.</p><h2>What Are We Doing?</h2><p>WTF is launching our 3rd annual season of extraordinary theatre by women in the Triangle with our 2018 theme being Women Are Heroes. We create great theatre, provide opportunities, and we are a leader in the shift of better gender representation in our theatrical community.</p><h2>Why Should You Be a Member?</h2><p>A Membership to the WTF community not only means that you’re helping us mount remarkable shows, but you’ll help shift the mindset of what truly diverse theatre can do. Our 2018 Membership program also has a lot more to offer this year. Keep reading to see how we intend to reward our members this year.</p><h2>What Can We Offer You?</h2><p>In the past, membership to WTF meant paying $5 in dues and, in exchange, you got the right to vote on the shows you’d like to see us produce. Our membership team has been reaching out and listening to you. What we’ve heard is that you want more out of your membership--more opportunities for meaningful engagement, more involvement, more connection, more pathways for growth, and more communication.</p><p>With our new Tiered Membership Program, we think we’ve got you covered! You’ll still have the option of paying just $5 for your annual dues for voting privileges, but we’ve loaded every level with perks, privileges, and special opportunities!</p><h3>$5 Value Membership</h3><ul>

Our mission is to create, produce, and promote extraordinary theatre by women by:Producing a festival every summer where all shows are:1. Written by playwrights who identify as female or non-binary. 2018: Crumble (Lay Me Down, Justin Timberlake) by Sheila Callaghan, Parallel Lives by Mo Gaffney and Kathy Najimy, Goblin Market by Polly Pen and Christina Rossetti, Eclipsed by Danai Gurira & These Shining Lives by Melanie Marnich2. Have a cast makeup of 50% women or higher. 2018 - DONE!3. Have at least 50% of the roles open to actors who are people of color. 2018 - Casting still in process, but moving toward the goal quickly!In addition to our mainstage shows, we host workshops, classes, panel discussions, produce a 24-hour play festival (Occupy the Stage), and are developing year-round programming. WTF is a force in the community and hopes to inspire change in the triangle so that theatre programming is 50/50 by 2020 across the board.What Are We Doing?WTF is launching our 3rd annual season of extraordinary theatre by women in the Triangle with our 2018 theme being Women Are Heroes. We create great theatre, provide opportunities, and we are a leader in the shift of better gender representation in our theatrical community.Why Should You Be a Member?A Membership to the WTF community not only means that you’re helping us mount remarkable shows, but you’ll help shift the mindset of what truly diverse theatre can do. Our 2018 Membership program also has a lot more to offer this year. Keep reading to see how we intend to reward our members this year.What Can We Offer You?In the past, membership to WTF meant paying $5 in dues and, in exchange, you got the right to vote on the shows you’d like to see us produce. Our membership team has been reaching out and listening to you. What we’ve heard is that you want more out of your membership--more opportunities for meaningful engagement, more involvement, more connection, more pathways for growth, and more communication.With our new Tiered Membership Program, we think we’ve got you covered! You’ll still have the option of paying just $5 for your annual dues for voting privileges, but we’ve loaded every level with perks, privileges, and special opportunities!$5 Value Membership
