<p>If there is one thing that I have learned in my 10+ years of working as an artist, manager, and technician in professional theater it is this: everyone has a story to tell. Everyone. Admittedly, I did not come to this conclusion with ease or urgency. I spent years feeling like a martyr for other people’s stories, doing thankless jobs behind the scenes. I grew quite bitter. So, after a fairly routine 20-something-year-old heartbreak, I decided to skip the bangs, the Ben and Jerry’s, the swipe-right-for-a-good-time remedies and try something that would truly change my life: I resolved to tell my stories, though I had no idea how. At that time, I had an eye for lighting and design, had an ear for sound and music, had the thick skin for long days of fine-tuning in tech booths, and I had management skills, but I was still lacking confidence. It was so easy to watch other artists, with all their charm and determination, and decide that I could never be that. In the end, I learned that was true. I could never be other artists, because I’m just me. I’m just Katie Keirs. I make mistakes, I learn, I get curious, I explore. </p>
<p>So, I forgave myself for being a human, and I stopped comparing myself to other humans. I stopped being concerned with how to tell my stories, and just started looking for chances to do it. I picked up an old guitar that had been neglected for almost all of the 15 years I had it, and began telling stories with music. I did not have professional training as a musician, nor did I have any experience with writing lyrics, but that didn’t stop me. I abandoned my previous career to learn as much as I could about music production on my own. I stopped wanting to be an artist and started working on just being a human who loves music. Turns out, there are a lot of us out there telling our stories any way we can (particularly at regional music festivals!), and there are a ton of resources for the DIY musician. My apartment transformed into a studio, and my stage began to vary from campfires to car rides to conventional venues. Music has brought me so much joy. Applause is nice, audiences are reassuring, but my songs, they are the only thing I get to keep. They are mine. They are my stories to share. </p>
<p>I’m Katie Keirs, a regular human who has endured and will continue to endure all of the awkward growth life throws at me. I have learned to love and take great comfort in my regular human story. Now, I am determined to inspire other humans to do the same. My Roving Hi-Fi Studio will be a place where we can all record our stories through song, through poetry, through traditional storytelling. It will provide affordable, high quality production for all humans-- for those of us who grace the stage, and those of us who mop it, because everyone has a story to tell. Everyone.</p>
<p>All I need is the vehicle, capitol for renovations, and a little extra cash for vending fees. My goal is to raise $10,000 and have my first roving studio on the road by April 20th, 2020. I cannot do it without your help! Any amount will help tremendously, but I have some cool incentives for contributions starting at just $10. </p>
<p>I really believe in this project and cannot wait to hit the road!</p>
<p>What I Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>The goal is to raise $10,000. </p>
<p>$5000 - buy a compact school bus </p>
<p>$1500 - renovations to the bus</p>
<p>$500 - misc. recording equipment (new cables, a couple new microphones)</p>
<p>$2000 - a new computer </p>
<p>$1000 - start-up vending fees</p>
<p>There will inevitably be some odds and ends to pick up along the way, and unexpected obstacles that I will need to overcome. Should any of my budget projections overshoot the actual cost, all surplus funds will be reserved for emergencies (flat tires, repairs, etc.), and vehicle expenses (gas, insurance, etc.). Your contributions will only be used for the Inky Pocket Roving Hi-Fi Recording Studio project!</p>
<p>Contribution PERKS!</p>
<p>$10 - a personalized shout out on instagram (@kikiandtherev)</p>
<p>$25 - a personalized video shout out on social media</p>
<p>$50 - a personalized original jingle by Kiki and The Rev</p>
<p>$100 - a FREE recording session with Inky Pocket Productions (in the roving studio!)</p>
<p>$500+ - VIP pass to the soft opening in Pittsburgh and a spot on Inky Pocket's VIP Producers List</p>
<p>In the event that we do not reach the full $10,000, all contributions will go towards the purchase of a compact school bus. </p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>I truly believe that music is a universal love language. I just want to spread the love by making music production affordable, accessible, and exciting for everyone. Get on the bus! Try something that intimidates you, make a memory with friends, get your ideas down, learn about the recording process, get your start! The Roving Hi Fi Studio is here to help.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>I am trying something truly unique to regional musical festivals. Branding will be the first challenge. What is a roving recording studio? Who are these Inky Pocket people? Will they understand my sound?</p>
<p>I have a structured marketing plan for social media leading up to the soft opening, but the best way to introduce the Roving Hi Fi Studio is by showing up, giving folks a chance to have a look, and providing free 10 minute consultations to perspective clients. Music festivals are about the visceral experiences: hearing the music, dancing to the tunes, talking with new friends. I am committed to producing professional work, but am also just a regular human who enjoys music like everyone else at the festival. This shared passion will make my studio a fun and approachable attraction.</p>
<p>They may not know Inky Pocket's Roving Hi Fi Studio yet, but once they do, I know they will dig it. </p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>I absolutely know what it is like to not have extra cash to spare [ literally eating ramen noodles for dinner right now], so I understand if you simply cannot afford to contribute with money at this time. No worries! There are still plenty of ways to help out. </p>
<p>Please share this campaign on social media. You're friends might be interested in contributing! </p>

<p>(Portuguese translation below/<i>tradução em português abaixo)</i></p>
<p>I'm a Brazilian-Canadian singer, songwriter and percussionist living in Toronto. I'm asking for your help to complete my second album. My first album, Flores Tambores e Amores got a lot of love. I was overwhelmed by the reaction from my incredible fans. It also received wide critical acclaim, ended up on several best of the year lists and earned me a Juno Award nomination. I wanted to follow it up with something truly special, which is why I took such time and care in the making of my second album. It's a very personal album. The songs reflect on my experiences as a Brazilian woman living in Toronto. It's about the blending of cultures and how you have to rediscover yourself in a new environment.</p>
<p>I took some big creative risks on this album. The music is experimental and eclectic and features lush vintage production. We recorded the bed tracks live off the floor to analog tape. Over 20 musicians play on the album, including a large string section. Producer David Arcus and I knew it was a gamble to invest so much in the recording process, especially on an independent album. We knew our budget wouldn't get us all the way to the finish line. But we also knew that's what the songs needed and we had to take the leap. The resulting recordings turned out even better that we could have hoped. We can't wait to share them with you. But before we can, we need some help to get this project across over the finish line!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds I receive will go towards mixing, mastering and manufacturing the album.</p>
<p>Mixing: $3390<br/>Mastering: $1450<br/>Artwork/Design/Photography: $1500<br/>Vinyl Manufacturing: $2050<br/>CD Manufacturing: $1250<br/>Indiegogo Fees: $670</p>
<p>TOTAL: $10,310</p>
<p>To show my gratitude for your support, I've put together some amazing perks including advance digital downloads, CDs, vinyl records, and admission to an intimate concert at a secret location in downtown Toronto!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your support will help me realize the full potential of the album. I'm so excited about what I've achieved so far, but without a professional mix and mastering job, the songs won't shine and fully come to life. We're so close! With your help I can finish the album the way I intended. I have the team in place to do it and with your support, we can make it happen!</p>
<p>I'm also asking for help with the artwork and manufacturing of the records so I can have a beautiful physical product to match the music and so the album can reach as many people as possible.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, don't worry! Just spreading the word is a huge help. You can use the indiegogo share tools or just like/share my posts on social media. I'm immensely grateful to you for being a part of the process and helping in any way you can</p>

<p>* SEE THE PORTUGUESE TRANSLATION BELOW</p>
<p>Sou um cantora, compositor e percussionista brasileira e canadense radicada em Toronto. Estou pedindo sua ajuda para completar meu segundo álbum. Meu primeiro álbum, Flores Tambores e Amores, ganhou muito amor. Fiquei impressionada com a reação do publico. O disco também recebeu elogios da crítica, acabou em várias listas dos melhores do ano e me rendeu uma indicação ao Juno Award. Eu queria continuar com algo verdadeiramente especial, e é por isso que dediquei tanto tempo e cuidado na criação do meu segundo álbum. É um álbum muito pessoal. As músicas refletem sobre minhas experiências como brasileira vivendo em Toronto. É sobre a mistura de culturas e como você deve se redescobrir em um novo ambiente. Eu assumi alguns grandes riscos criativos neste álbum. A música é experimental e eclética e apresenta uma exuberante produção vintage. Gravamos as faixas guias ao vivo em fita analógica. Mais de 20 músicos participam no álbum, incluindo uma grande seção de cordas. O produtor David Arcus e eu sabíamos que era arriscado investir tanto no processo de gravação, especialmente em um álbum independente. Sabíamos que nosso orçamento não nos levaria até a linha de chegada. Mas também sabíamos que era disso que as músicas precisavam e tivemos que dar o passo. As gravações resultantes foram ainda melhores do que esperávamos. Mal podemos esperar para compartilhá-las com você. Mas antes disso, precisamos de ajuda para levar esse projeto ao longo da linha de chegada! </p>
<h2>O que precisamos e o que você ganha:</h2>
<p>Os fundos que eu receber irão para a mixagem, masterização e fabricação do álbum.<br/>Mixagem: $ 3390<br/>Masterização: $ 1450<br/>Arte / Design / Fotografia: $ 1500<br/>Fabricação de vinil: $ 2050<br/>Fabricação do CD: $ 1250<br/>Taxas do Indiegogo: $ 670<br/>TOTAL: $ 10.310<br/>Para mostrar minha gratidão por seu apoio, reuni algumas vantagens incríveis, incluindo downloads digitais avançados, CDs, discos de vinil e admissão a um concerto íntimo em um local secreto no centro de Toronto!</p>
<h2>O impacto </h2>
<p>Seu apoio me ajudará a perceber todo o potencial do álbum. Estou super feliz e empolgada com o que consegui até agora, mas sem uma mixagem profissional e um trabalho de masterização, as músicas não brilharão e e nao farão jus ao seu potencial.  Estamos tão perto! Com sua ajuda, posso terminar o álbum da maneira que pretendia. Eu tenho a equipe para fazer isso e, com o seu apoio, podemos fazer isso acontecer!Também estou pedindo ajuda com a arte e a fabricação dos discos, para que eu possa ter um belo produto físico para combinar com a música e para que o álbum atinja o maior número possível de pessoas.</p>
<h2>
<br/>Outras maneiras de ajudar</h2>
<p>Se você não pode contribuir, não se preocupe! Apenas espalhar a palavra é uma grande ajuda. Você pode usar as ferramentas de compartilhamento do indiegogo ou simplesmente curtir / compartilhar minhas postagens nas mídias sociais. Sou imensamente grato a você por fazer parte do processo e ajudar de qualquer maneira que puder</p>

The resulting recordings turned out even better that we could have hoped. We can't wait to share them with you. But before we can, we need some help to get this project across over the finish line!
 

What We Need & What You Get
The funds I receive will go towards mixing, mastering and manufacturing the album.
Mixing: $3390Mastering: $1450Artwork/Design/Photography: $1500Vinyl Manufacturing: $2050CD Manufacturing: $1250Indiegogo Fees: $670
TOTAL: $10,310
To show my gratitude for your support, I've put together some amazing perks including advance digital downloads, CDs, vinyl records, and admission to an intimate concert at a secret location in downtown Toronto!
 

The Impact
Your support will help me realize the full potential of the album. I'm so excited about what I've achieved so far, but without a professional mix and mastering job, the songs won't shine and fully come to life. We're so close! With your help I can finish the album the way I intended. I have the team in place to do it and with your support, we can make it happen!
I'm also asking for help with the artwork and manufacturing of the records so I can have a beautiful physical product to match the music and so the album can reach as many people as possible. 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute, don't worry! Just spreading the word is a huge help. You can use the indiegogo share tools or just like/share my posts on social media. I'm immensely grateful to you for being a part of the process and helping in any way you can

Sou um cantora, compositor e percussionista brasileira e canadense radicada em Toronto. Estou pedindo sua ajuda para completar meu segundo álbum. Meu primeiro álbum, Flores Tambores e Amores, ganhou muito amor. Fiquei impressionada com a reação do publico. O disco também recebeu elogios da crítica, acabou em várias listas dos melhores do ano e me rendeu uma indicação ao Juno Award. Eu queria continuar com algo verdadeiramente especial, e é por isso que dediquei tanto tempo e cuidado na criação do meu segundo álbum. É um álbum muito pessoal. As músicas refletem sobre minhas experiências como brasileira vivendo em Toronto. É sobre a mistura de culturas e como você deve se redescobrir em um novo ambiente. Eu assumi alguns grandes riscos criativos neste álbum. A música é experimental e eclética e apresenta uma exuberante produção vintage. Gravamos as faixas guias ao vivo em fita analógica. Mais de 20 músicos participam no álbum, incluindo uma grande seção de cordas. O produtor David Arcus e eu sabíamos que era arriscado investir tanto no processo de gravação, especialmente em um álbum independente. Sabíamos que nosso orçamento não nos levaria até a linha de chegada. Mas também sabíamos que era disso que as músicas precisavam e tivemos que dar o passo. As gravações resultantes foram ainda melhores do que esperávamos. Mal podemos esperar para compartilhá-las com você. Mas antes disso, precisamos de ajuda para levar esse projeto ao longo da linha de chegada! 
O que precisamos e o que você ganha:
Os fundos que eu receber irão para a mixagem, masterização e fabricação do álbum.Mixagem: $ 3390Masterização: $ 1450Arte / Design / Fotografia: $ 1500Fabricação de vinil: $ 2050Fabricação do CD: $ 1250Taxas do Indiegogo: $ 670TOTAL: $ 10.310Para mostrar minha gratidão por seu apoio, reuni algumas vantagens incríveis, incluindo downloads digitais avançados, CDs, discos de vinil e admissão a um concerto íntimo em um local secreto no centro de Toronto!
O impacto 
Seu apoio me ajudará a perceber todo o potencial do álbum. Estou super feliz e empolgada com o que consegui até agora, mas sem uma mixagem profissional e um trabalho de masterização, as músicas não brilharão e e nao farão jus ao seu potencial.  Estamos tão perto! Com sua ajuda, posso terminar o álbum da maneira que pretendia. Eu tenho a equipe para fazer isso e, com o seu apoio, podemos fazer isso acontecer!Também estou pedindo ajuda com a arte e a fabricação dos discos, para que eu possa ter um belo produto físico para combinar com a música e para que o álbum atinja o maior número possível de pessoas.

Outras maneiras de ajudar
Se você não pode contribuir, não se preocupe! Apenas espalhar a palavra é uma grande ajuda. Você pode usar as ferramentas de compartilhamento do indiegogo ou simplesmente curtir / compartilhar minhas postagens nas mídias sociais. Sou imensamente grato a você por fazer parte do processo e ajudar de qualquer maneira que puder",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Campaign</h3>
<p>There are considerable costs when it comes to manufacturing and releasing an album on multiple physical platforms. As an independent, unsigned band, we mostly generate money through playing live shows and selling merchandise/our music. This money is saved and used for things such as recording, travelling away for gigs and creating new merchandise (sadly it does not end up in our pockets).</p>
<p>We are looking to YOU, our fantastic fan base and supporters to help us bolster our funds towards producing a top quality end product for our latest album. With your help, we will not have to cut corners or make any compromises when releasing what we have worked so hard on over the last couple of years.</p>

<li>We are looking to raise £2000 to cover the cost of manufacturing records, CDs, cassettes and merchandise for the album.</li>
<li>There are set “perks” detailed above. Each donation amount gets something different to say thank you and show our appreciation for your support! We understand that not everyone can afford to back these amounts. So there is a “back it” button also, where you can pledge as little or as much as you feel comfortable with. Every penny helps. </li>
<li>If we do not reach the coveted £2000 mark, the amount raised will still go toward the manufacturing of the album, it may just mean that it will take a little longer to get it “out there”. </li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only real challenge regarding getting the album released on multiple platforms, is the issue of getting everything ready for release at the same time.

<h3>Over 20 Years in the Making!</h3>
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>My name is Chris Mazurk and I'm launching this Indiegogo campaign to try to help fulfill a lifelong dream of mine - to record an album of music and press it to vinyl.</p>
<p>In high school, I was the guy who walked around with a guitar in his hand all the time. I spent all of my free time with my band, Alien - recording songs in our garage and having the time of my life.</p>
<p>After high school, I continued to write songs and play in bands until I was about 25 - when I decided to shift gears and focus on my career.</p>
<p>So, here I am at 40 - ready to record that album. After deliberating over writing new songs or working on old tunes I realized that the most awesome option would be to record professional versions of the songs from my high school rock band.</p>
<ul></ul>
<div><ul></ul></div>
<div><h3>Preparations</h3></div>
<p>Back in the mid-90's, my band mates and I spent hours each day in my garage rehearsing the same 14 songs over and over and over. We recorded some of the rehearsals to cassette tapes on an my old stereo. I spent the first month of this year digging through those old tapes, re-learning the guitar parts, deciphering the lyrics, and figuring out the bass and drum parts for the first time. Then, I spent the next two months recording demos of each song.</p>
<p><strong>You can find those demos here:</strong></p>

</ul>
<p>With the demos recorded, the next step was to lock down the band. Here are the rock stars who will be joining me in the studio:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The brains behind the production will be Roger Urich - a phenomenally talented music producer.</p>
<p>The final step was to secure the artist for the album cover. I'm excited to announce that more details around this will be coming soon.</p>
<div><ul></ul></div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We're seeking $15,000 in funding to rent the recording studio, commission the album art, and press the album to vinyl.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we hit $5,000 we’ll record at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TheOmenRoom/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Omen Room</a> - a premiere studio in our hometown</li>
<li>At $10,000 we’ll instead record at <a href=""https://www.ranchodelaluna.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rancho de la Luna</a>, where bands like <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/7jy3rLJdDQY21OgRLCZ9sD?si=hL8AmSU_QnOv60MGv--wVQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Foo Fighters</a> and <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/2AM4ilv6UzW0uMRuqKtDgN?si=5G5EpimDQ7mX5Rpz_DcjJA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ZZ Top</a> recorded (huge influences for Alien)</li>
<li>When we nail $13,000 we’ll do a run of 100 12” vinyl records (180g for you audiophiles)</li>
<li>Finally, at $15,000 we’ll add a run of 100 7” vinyl records to make sure all 14 songs are included</li>
</ul>

<div><br/></div>
<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">The spacebetweenus is a living multi-media creative hub where inspired people work together to complete their creative mission.</span><br/>
</h3> <p><br/></p>
<p>Located at the intersection of 2 alleyways in downtown Toronto, ""the Spacebetweenus"" is a coach-house garage that houses the Vault Studio, a sound recording studio and production space, and a multi-media art studio. The band of musicians, painters, scientists, dancers, lovers and good people that keep this ship running are a kind of family, who show up for each other by creating real-time! We know our talents and we want to share them with this transforming world.</p>
<p>My name is Ayse Kapaklili. In my 27 years of life I have had a lot of very different experiences with people from all over the world and I have been trying to find a way to weave those experiences together, in a way that makes sense to me and that is beautiful. I have always had the unconditional support of my family and those closest to me. Their love is my glue! This foundation of unconditional love is what gives me the space and assurance to keep steady on my mission to keep the Spacebetweenus alive and kicking. </p>
<p>As a painter and creative person, I am glad to be meeting and connecting with people who are on a similar wavelength. I want to take things to the next level and I need more support.</p>
<p>This summer I incorporated a sound studio into the Spacebetweenus. World renowned engineer Rasbagle di Dubscientis brings over 25 years of experience in Dub music to the studio. On his world tour as as head engineer, Front of House, with South African Theatre Production ""UMOJA - The Spirit of Togetherness,"" the scientist tuned into a sound that people want to hear. His studio ""The Vault"" provides recording, mixing, editing, live-off-the floor services etc..</p>
<p>His long anticipated album ""Rasbagle in Dub: Vol. 1"" brings together artists from all over the world. Our vision is to launch the album in May 2016 and to bring this creation on tour, collaborating with other artists along the way.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal;"">The immediate operating costs of the building have to be secured ($9000) first and very URGENTLY.</span><br/>
</h3>
<div>Next, we want to connect with more people, experiment with and create new media-mixes and invite more cross-disciplinary artistic collaboration into the Spacebetweenus and the Vault Studio.<br/>
</div>
<div>You can join our movement on Indigogo by contributing to this campaign. The ""perks"" in our campaign are creations that are currently living in the Spacebetweenus: Ayse Kapaklili's paintings and drawings, Rasbagle di Dubscientis's sound and tickets to the shows, dances and events that we mobilize around.</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>*SHARE* <i>your</i> strength</h3>

The spacebetweenus is a living multi-media creative hub where inspired people work together to complete their creative mission.
 
Located at the intersection of 2 alleyways in downtown Toronto, ""the Spacebetweenus"" is a coach-house garage that houses the Vault Studio, a sound recording studio and production space, and a multi-media art studio. The band of musicians, painters, scientists, dancers, lovers and good people that keep this ship running are a kind of family, who show up for each other by creating real-time! We know our talents and we want to share them with this transforming world.
My name is Ayse Kapaklili. In my 27 years of life I have had a lot of very different experiences with people from all over the world and I have been trying to find a way to weave those experiences together, in a way that makes sense to me and that is beautiful. I have always had the unconditional support of my family and those closest to me. Their love is my glue! This foundation of unconditional love is what gives me the space and assurance to keep steady on my mission to keep the Spacebetweenus alive and kicking. 
As a painter and creative person, I am glad to be meeting and connecting with people who are on a similar wavelength. I want to take things to the next level and I need more support.
This summer I incorporated a sound studio into the Spacebetweenus. World renowned engineer Rasbagle di Dubscientis brings over 25 years of experience in Dub music to the studio. On his world tour as as head engineer, Front of House, with South African Theatre Production ""UMOJA - The Spirit of Togetherness,"" the scientist tuned into a sound that people want to hear. His studio ""The Vault"" provides recording, mixing, editing, live-off-the floor services etc..
His long anticipated album ""Rasbagle in Dub: Vol. 1"" brings together artists from all over the world. Our vision is to launch the album in May 2016 and to bring this creation on tour, collaborating with other artists along the way.
   What We Need & What You Get 

The immediate operating costs of the building have to be secured ($9000) first and very URGENTLY.

Next, we want to connect with more people, experiment with and create new media-mixes and invite more cross-disciplinary artistic collaboration into the Spacebetweenus and the Vault Studio.

You can join our movement on Indigogo by contributing to this campaign. The ""perks"" in our campaign are creations that are currently living in the Spacebetweenus: Ayse Kapaklili's paintings and drawings, Rasbagle di Dubscientis's sound and tickets to the shows, dances and events that we mobilize around.

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Erin Accomando here, the lead vocalist of ELSIE BINX! As some of you know, I've been working on this project for almost 2 years now. I began the recording process of my ""solo"" album in January 2015 and it became something much larger than myself, and much larger than I intended. I ran crowdfunding campaigns in April and July of  2015, and managed to raise a total of $9,000 to go toward production of the album. We were able to release the debut album in October 2015 and thus began the band, ELSIE BINX.</p>
<p>Since then, we've been writing new music and are finally ready to begin the process of recording our second album entitled ""That's What She Said"".</p>
<p>Now, we've already worked on the album for 4 days, having gotten all the drum tracks complete, along with some bass and guitar tracking done as well. Kevin (our producer &amp; engineer) is taking the hit for now, but we are counting on our friends and family to get us through this one. Let me break it down a little bit more...</p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
Hi there!
Erin Accomando here, the lead vocalist of ELSIE BINX! As some of you know, I've been working on this project for almost 2 years now. I began the recording process of my ""solo"" album in January 2015 and it became something much larger than myself, and much larger than I intended.

Kevin (our producer & engineer) is taking the hit for now, but we are counting on our friends and family to get us through this one. Let me break it down a little bit more...
What We Need



So we've done the math and this is what we'll need:



Recording/Mixing: 11 songs @ $500/ea = $5500

Other Musicians: (Strings, Keys, Organ, etc.) = $700 (or more)
Mastering: 11 songs @ $75/ea = $825
Distribution: Internet Streaming = $100
Printing CDs: $600 (or more)
Album Artwork: $300 (or more)
Licensing: $200
Merchandise: New T-shirts, lighters & hats = $900
Indiegogo 5% Fee : $10,000 x 5% = $500

With just those expenses, the total is over $9500, and I'm sure there's more that I'm not thinking of at the moment.

To put it simply though, if every one of our Facebook fans donates just $10, we'd raise $16,000. Can you imagine what we could do with that kind of funding?! We can...

What You Get
Please take a look at all the perks listed on the right side of this campaign page! When you donate just $10, you'll get the digital copy of the album before ANYONE else!

The bottom line is that if you donate ANYTHING at all, you're going to get a thank you from us, from the bottom of our BINXIE hearts!

The Impact 
So you may be wondering, ""Why should I donate to this project?"" 
My answer to you is this: it's all of our dreams (everyone in the band) to do this big. We want to go on the road, and we want to make this band our lives. I mean, this band already IS our lives. We want to use any fame or fortune toward bettering ourselves and society. We want to spread good music and love around the world. We're good people with big dreams, and only you can help us accomplish those goals.   
Risks & Challenges Since we've already begun the recording process, there is a built-in risk here. We already owe money toward studio time, merchandise and artwork.

<b>Extracts of  ''Wasted years '' <b>reviews</b> :<br/>
</b><p>''Attention,

parangon de la rencontre des influences orientales et occidentales...''</p>
<p><span> 
( Metal and Oddities )</span></p>
<p>''...
NAWATHER s'impose comme le fer de lance d'un courant de métissage terriblement
pénétrant. Et croyez moi, malgré son titre, <em><span>Wasted Years</span></em>
ne vous fera pas perdre votre temps. Il stimulera votre imaginaire, et vous
emmènera si loin qu'il vous faudra plus de mille et une nuits pour en
revenir. ''</p>
<p><span> 
(  Metal and Oddities  )</span></p>
<p>''... Jouissant d’une excellent production, Wasted Years a tout pour devenir
un des meilleurs albums de 2016 et ce, même si l’année vient à peine de
commencer. Le talent des musiciens est là, les guitares sont excellentes, la
rythmique basse/batterie est solidement ancrée et les voix tant féminines que
gutturales sont en parfaite symbiose avec la musique de Nawather.</p>
<p>Un excellent album à découvrir en ce début d’année pour ceux qui n’ont pas
froid aux yeux et qui souhaitent pimenter leur Métal et s’ouvrir l’esprit pour
découvrir un monde fascinant. ''  </p>

sur ce délicieux album qui prouve une nouvelle que le Metal apporte beaucoup à
cette Culture, mais surtout que cette Culture continue d’apporter énormément au
Metal…''</p>

(  The unchained .net  )</p>
<p>''...De la technique, un chant à la dualité parfaitement
rendue (si l’osmose est la même sur scène, j’ai hâte de voir ce que ça peu
donner), des riffs à la frontière du prog et du métal, des
influences orientales clairement assumées et maîtrisées… La grande classe !''</p>

Extracts of  ''Wasted years '' reviews :
''Attention,
album unique, fortement destiné à devenir mythique avec le temps! ... Le
premier album des Tunisiens de NAWATHER est une pure merveille, et presque
parangon de la rencontre des influences orientales et occidentales...''
 
( Metal and Oddities )
''...
NAWATHER s'impose comme le fer de lance d'un courant de métissage terriblement
pénétrant. Et croyez moi, malgré son titre, Wasted Years
ne vous fera pas perdre votre temps. Il stimulera votre imaginaire, et vous
emmènera si loin qu'il vous faudra plus de mille et une nuits pour en
revenir. ''
 
(  Metal and Oddities  )
''... Jouissant d’une excellent production, Wasted Years a tout pour devenir
un des meilleurs albums de 2016 et ce, même si l’année vient à peine de
commencer. Le talent des musiciens est là, les guitares sont excellentes, la
rythmique basse/batterie est solidement ancrée et les voix tant féminines que
gutturales sont en parfaite symbiose avec la musique de Nawather.
Un excellent album à découvrir en ce début d’année pour ceux qui n’ont pas
froid aux yeux et qui souhaitent pimenter leur Métal et s’ouvrir l’esprit pour
découvrir un monde fascinant. ''  
 
Note 9/10  ( hurlemort.com
) 
'' ...Dès son premier effort, Nawather est parvenu à se faire une place de choix
à la table des « grands » du metal oriental...''
 
(  The unchained .net  )
''... je ne peux que vivement vous recommander de vous jeter
sur ce délicieux album qui prouve une nouvelle que le Metal apporte beaucoup à
cette Culture, mais surtout que cette Culture continue d’apporter énormément au
Metal…''
 
(  The unchained .net  )
''...De la technique, un chant à la dualité parfaitement
rendue (si l’osmose est la même sur scène, j’ai hâte de voir ce que ça peu
donner), des riffs à la frontière du prog et du métal, des
influences orientales clairement assumées et maîtrisées… La grande classe !''
 
Note  8/10  (  Soil Chronicles  )
''...Rares sont les occasions de découvrir ce genre de
talent, mais là, ces mélanges réussissent à créer un album qui nous scotch et
nous hypnotise du début à la fin !''
  ( 
Musique Alliance  )
''... Pour un premier album, Nawather a réussi à se forger
un style incomparable et qui évite
le cliché même du groupe de musique orientale.''
  Note  9.5/10

<p>My name is Shawn Tolley and I am a digital artist, composer, and educator living in Spokane, WA.  Recently I was commissioned to turn a house into a digital art space making use of interactive art works and electronic music.  This represents a turning point for me as a composer and digital artist since it is my first large scale solo gallery presentation.  I have been working in the field of digital arts for many years both as an artist and advocate.  My works cover the spectrum from fixed media electronic music to interactive digital music spaces to computer controlled textile art works.  In my work as an elementary general music teacher I have instituted clubs in digital arts that bring technology, maker culture, and experimental art to the 4-6 graders in my school.  This campaign will cover the purchase of a 3D printer which will be my main means of fabrication and the components necessary to build the first art piece.  The piece will be made of three LED panels that can be controlled by the viewer.  As viewers rotate the panel, they will change colors of the LEDs and adjust the overall music of the room.  If I am able to build this first art work I can use it as a means of demonstrating my concept and raising the funds necessary to build the six other pieces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be needing $1,800 total for this campaign.  The money will be used to purchase an Afinia 3D printer and the different types of filaments that I will need (including natural, conductive, and clear), as well as the LED Panels, accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, wireless x-bees, and even more.  To thank you for your contribution I am offering a range of perks including 3D prints in many sizes (either designed by me or of your own choice), custom songs, digital art pieces, chances to see and help me test the products before the show if you live in Spokane or do a digital walkthrough of the show, and even possibly a Makey Makey controlled conductive instrument!  If I do not meet my funding goal then the money raised will be used as seed money to get as much of the supplies as I can and to save for the 3D printer purchase which is the most expensive and necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This campaign will help to introduce Spokane to the concepts of digital and experimental arts (DXArts) and increase interest in interactive electronic music.  As technology continues to expand, the world of art and music is in need of a movement toward more interactive and digitally integrated art works.  DXArts represents a group of artists trying to integrate technology more directly into their art to capture this growing interest in technology.  Last year I created an electronic music piece that gave the computer the ability to make decisions about when to perform sounds, analyze the music that was playing, and choose melodic ideas to play back.  This music interacted with a textile art piece telling the integrate fiberoptic fabric and sewn LEDs, when to light up.  Currently, I am finishing a globally interactive graphic score which will make use of online computer programs and Twitter.  Large and experimental projects like this always run risks though.  In this particular case, there is a large amount of engineering and planning that must be put into the piece to be certain that it will work as planned.  While I have the experience and knowledge to make each interactive art piece work it is possible that the overall scope of the project may be more then I am betting on.  To overcome this hurdle I am planning to build each piece one at a time and test them rigorously prior to any performance is set.  Should there be a problem with running the whole gallery simultaneously that I cannot work out, I will enlist the help of other maker friends of mine to troubleshoot.  If you are unable to help me fund this project please help me by spreading the word; talk about my campaign with friends, share on social networks, use the Indiegogo tools.  Honestly, anything that you can do to help me achieve this goal is so appreciated and hopefully you can come and see the performance when it opens.</p><p></p></div>","My name is Shawn Tolley and I am a digital artist, composer, and educator living in Spokane, WA.  Recently I was commissioned to turn a house into a digital art space making use of interactive art works and electronic music.  This represents a turning point for me as a composer and digital artist since it is my first large scale solo gallery presentation.  I have been working in the field of digital arts for many years both as an artist and advocate.  My works cover the spectrum from fixed media electronic music to interactive digital music spaces to computer controlled textile art works.  In my work as an elementary general music teacher I have instituted clubs in digital arts that bring technology, maker culture, and experimental art to the 4-6 graders in my school.  This campaign will cover the purchase of a 3D printer which will be my main means of fabrication and the components necessary to build the first art piece.  The piece will be made of three LED panels that can be controlled by the viewer.  As viewers rotate the panel, they will change colors of the LEDs and adjust the overall music of the room.  If I am able to build this first art work I can use it as a means of demonstrating my concept and raising the funds necessary to build the six other pieces.

We have been playing shows in Texas and have been sharing stages with local, regional and national acts. Now the time has come for the next phase of the band. The campaign is a modest approach to cover the expense of the studio, the pressing, and the art work to deliver the full complete package for you.

<p> </p>
<p>Back Story:</p>
<p>Sebastian started his career in music in 2007 when he decided to download FL Studios, a music production program, that taught him how to make beats. Upon graduating high school, in June 2007, Sebastian was undecided about the course his life would take and if he should attend college. With the encouragement of his family, he decided to apply to Columbia College Chicago's Music Business Management program with a concentration in Music Production.   </p>
<p>This is where it all began. With the excitement of living in a brand new city, with no friends or family, Sebastian quickly adapted to the change of scene and was introduced to the music industry for the first time. Here is where he developed life long relationships, which have played a major part in his journey, as he is now living in Los Angeles, California. </p>
<p>A few of the people he met were a group of musicians that had been in Chicago, and had already made a name for themselves, ""THEMPeople."" Sebastian had a desire to learn, and members of the group openly welcomed him into their family of music, and this was a pivotal point in his life. ""THEMPeople"" have been responsible for a lot of the music that has come out of Chicago. They produced/recorded a few tracks on Chance The Rapper's debut project, ""10 day,"" the Mick Jenkins ""Waves"" project, and a plethora of other artists from Vic Mensa to BJ the Chicago Kid.</p>
<p>In 2014, Sebastian Francis was offered the opportunity to move to Los Angeles. With all of the knowledge and experience he gained in Chicago, he applied what he learned and started releasing music and creating waves on the west coast. Having produced for Nuri Hazzard, THEMPeople, Gyasi Kamau, Raliq Bashard, and many others, his reach has spread from LA to Chicago, New York and DC. With him now focusing on himself as an artist, he started a project series called ""Still Dreamin,"" which he started releasing in summer of 2015. Since then, he has made great strides in his career. From landing interviews and shows with some of the best up and coming Indie platforms, such as Prime TV, Indie Syn, and RAW Artist, Sebastian is on the brink of crossing the threshold and becoming a major label artist. He is also the owner of his own production company, ""So S.O.U.L. Productions.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p><font size=""3"">       The mission statement of the brand, ""So S.O.U.L. Productions,"" that Sebastian incorporated is to ""create opportunities for those that will create opportunities for others.""  The ""Soul"" in So S.O.U.L stands for ""Sharing Our Universal Love."" Sebastian has geared all of his efforts towards helping out the community of artists he has been involved in since he started in Chicago. Now in LA, #SoSoulSundays is becoming one of the premier events in DTLA for up and coming talent and Sebastian has ambitions of making it a yearly festival on the level of ""Made in America"" and ""OVO Fest.""</font></p>

The reason he is on this path of being a musician is much bigger than him, and to have people travel overseas with him to see a different part of the world and experience a new culture will definitely inspire everyone to push the envelope of they're creativity. </p>

<h3>The WONDER story. </h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, I'm Jean. I've been singing since before I can remember and playing violin since I was seven. My musical journey has been long and difficult at times. It was birthed in me as a child, grew in places  like conservatories and orchestras and bloomed as a recording career which has taken me to around the US, the UK and Ireland! And here I am today about to give birth to my eighth and most adventurous recording project ever! </p>
<p>'WONDER' is incredible! (well at least I think so, and I am my own worst critic) What does it sound like? Well, it has a real 'world music feel'. It is ethereal, other-worldly, peaceful, worshipful, powerful, moving, and simply WONDERful. You just have to trust me on this one! I can't wait for you to hear it. I have a friend who is in a lot of pain from the effects of cancer who listens to it all the time and apparently finds it very soothing!</p>
<p>Who's on it? ME. What a surprise. I am singing, playing lots of violin, piano, and doing some the arranging. Billy Smiley did a stellar job producing, arranging, and finding exquisite musicians to join me. John Ellis of 'Tree63' played and sang an all new arrangement and duet of 'Blessed Be Your Name which is sooooooo sweet! Can't wait for you to hear it!  Steve Hindalong of 'The Choir' played percussion on many of the songs. So creative! Peter Furler of 'The Newsboys' also played percussion on one of the tracks which was very fun. Then to top it all off, the incomparable <strong>Michael W. Smith</strong> accompanied me on piano for a new arrangement of his song, ""I Can Hear Your Voice"".  I was so honored! Jonathan Crone tied the whole project together with truly anointed programming and everything else but the kitchen sink. There were many other great musicians involved whose names I don't have room to include here. YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE IT! </p>
<p> I am so proud of this work, but as a Christian artist in full time ministry, I pay all my own production costs, travel expenses, graphic design, marketing, and promotion.  We are down to the wire now. Professional recording projects are not cheap. We have paid the bills to this point but now funds are needed to finish it and launch it so that people know about it. Which brings me to...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The WONDER opportunity. </h3>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>I am estimating that I need approximately $8000 to launch WONDER well. This covers the cost of graphic design, outstanding production costs, including recording, mixing and mastering of bonus tracks, video expenses (so we can show the WONDER which is so important), and travel expenses to get me back to Nashville again to wrap things up!</li></ul>
<p>As you have blessed me, I would love to bless you!  Please check out the perks I am offering. As a 'Wonder' partner, you will have exclusive access to pre-release downloads, autographed CDs, concerts, Skype voice lessons, or your name appearing in the credits of WONDER videos. I would offer to cook and clean for you too, but it's probably in everyone's best interest to have me stick to music. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Wonder Impact.</h3>
<p>The exciting thing about this project is that I have partnered with a distributor called 'NAXOS' which has great reach into the secular music world. For the first time, my music has the possibility to be offered to audiences beyond the 'Christian' market which is where I believe it needs to go.  How amazing to think that people may listen to this music because they love the sound and be drawn closer to God in the process! </p>
<p>The vision for my recordings has never been about entertainment. I believe God uses music to soften hearts and reveal His love. I have seen Him do it over and over again in concerts and through recordings. What a privilege to use this tool to share the love of Christ! </p>
</div><div>
<p>I chose the Indiegogo campaign to help fund WONDER because, quite simply, I have felt burdened, and the Lord said to ask for help! I did a ""Kickstarter"" campaign in the past, but some people found the payment method cumbersome, and I found it stressful. </p>
<p>This is NOT an 'all or nothing' campaign. In other words, there is no pressure on anyone to make a financial goal. I am simply asking for help so that I am not shouldering the costs alone and can promote it well. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Sharing the WONDER.</h3>
<p>Times are tough, I know there are some who would love to give financially but simply can't at this time. I completely understand. I have been there! Here are some other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let your friends, family, Facebook friends, Twitter feed, etc etc know about WONDER! Help me make some noise! Indiegogo makes it easy with Indiegogo share tools!</li>
<li>Please pray for me and my family as we go forward in music and ministry. I have a packed schedule of speaking and singing events this autumn and will truly need God's grace! </li>
<li>Above all, no matter how much or how little you become involved, thank you from the bottom of my heart for checking out WONDER and for encouraging me. I hope you enjoy the music and are inspired to chase after God's best for your life! </li>

are a truly experimental jazz band. We're not “trying” to fuse
things together. It's more about getting inspiration from a wide
range of sources and then dropping all inhibitions and letting our
ears guide us. This is how we operate in a live setting and it is
exactly how we plan to create our
first studio album. The nice thing about the recording process is
that artists don’t have to make all of their decisions instantly.
When you are performing live and suddenly you want there to be
strings, congas or a harmony line here or there, you basically have
to put those desires to rest. In the studio, anything is possible! We
have already started planning a few extra layers to add to some of
our songs and we are looking forward to exploring even more.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We've

<p>
</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We
picked out a fantastic studio, we got a great producer on board and
we've already started working on the album art. All the details of
our
plan can be found below. The only problem is that we are all
(near-)starving artists with extremely shallow pockets. We are hoping
that you can help us overcome this ... speed bump.</span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Finishing
this first professional album will help us achieve all our future
goals. A
studio album is the foundation of any good press kit. We have made a
DIY live EP available, but most festivals require a professional
version before they make the investment of flying artists across the
continent to perform. In this way, your contribution to this
Indiegogo campaign will help us play more live gigs and get our music
into the hands, ears and
hearts of people across the planet.</span></p>

together a full-length high quality album costs a lot of money!
Here's where it will all be going:</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Tracking
(initial recording process): $1800</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We
are planning to record in the beautiful chapel space at Coalition Music
studio.. Coalition is a Toronto studio housed in an old convent. The
Convent was fitted with state of the art modern equipment paired with
some timeless classic vintage gear which makes for super clear, crisp
recordings that still have that warm analog feeling that everyone
wants. The $1800 listed above pays for renting the space for 3 days
and for an engineer. David Henriques has agreed to be our live
engineer and our mix engineer. Which brings us to the mixing...</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Mixing:
$1600 </b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">A
big mistake that a lot of people make is paying a lot of money for
tracking and then cutting corners in postproduction. By hiring David
(who knows our music and understands the aesthetic) we will avoid
this common pitfall. David also has an excellent working relationship
with Peter Letros of Wreckhouse Media, who will be mastering the
record. Which brings us to mastering...</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Mastering:
$750</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Good
mastering can make the difference between a pretty-good-sounding
recording and an amazing-sounding recording. But
what exactly is mastering? Mastering is the part of the process where
the overall tone of the sound gets balanced. Mastering engineers deal
with the subtle dynamics, compression, equalization, coloration and
the sense of space in the sound. This is the last step before the
physical CDs are produced.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Production:
$1450</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">This

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We
are excited to announce that Kevin Brunkhorst has
agreed to lend us his ears to help make this record the best possible
version of itself. Kevin has years of experience in the record
industry and just as many in playing, writing, recording and
producing music. The $2000 listed above includes his airfare from
Nova Scotia and lodging in Toronto for the duration of the recording
process. Both Scott and Peter learned composition with Kevin during
their undergraduate studies at St. Francis Xavier University. This
long-term musical relationship built on respect, trust, understanding
and shared musical language, is sure to make this album a thing of
beauty!</span><br/></p>

get to help us push ourselves to the next level and see just how far
we can take our art form. But more than simple curiosity for our
own benefit, we do this because of how rewarding it is to share
the fruits of our labour with other human beings. The purpose of
this project is to dramatically increase the scope of that
sharing and the size of our audience. We are both excited and
proud of this work and wish to invite you to be a vital part of
the process.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As
creators and musicians, we need you, the listener. Without you, all
our efforts are totally meaningless. This
Indigogo campaign is designed to help us build a community of
like-minded people that comes together to share the simple experience
of music. Having this studio album will allow people to take home
a reminder of the experience they had and relive it with every
listen. </span><br/></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So
what happens if we don't raise all the funds necessary for us to make
our dream album exactly the way we want to? Easy answer: we do what
we do best and get creative! Rest assured, your donation will not go
into the ramen noodle fund. No
matter what, we will honor your generosity by creating the best album
we possibly can with all the resources we can gather. Here are some
possible scenarios: </span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If
we raise between $4000 and $5000, the plan is to do all the tracking
with our producer Kevin at Coalition Music and then hire a
professional grant writer to apply for various government grants so
that we can complete the postproduction. </span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If
we raise between $3000 and $4000 we will likely complete the tracking
(with Kevin) in a less expensive studio and apply for grants to
complete the record, as above.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If
we don't make it to the $3000 mark would consider self-producing or
recording fewer songs in a cheaper studio.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Your
participation will mean the difference between our recording
ourselves with cheap mics in an okay-sounding room and our going to a
studio where professionals will use the best gear out there to make
the CD sound even clearer than if you were in the front row at one of
our concerts! We are going to make this happen on whatever budget we
have to; with your help, we can create the high quality professional
CD
that we want and that you deserve!</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b><br/></b></h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Challenges</b></h2>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">One
of the biggest challenges for us will be capturing the interactive
energy of our live performances on this recording. It's easy enough
for us to feed off each others’ energy when we are rehearsing
together in a single room or playing to an intimate audience from a
small stage.
But when we are in the recording studio, we will need to isolate the
saxophone at the very least. This means that Anthony will either be
in another room (separated by a glass wall) or in the same room but
in a large box with a little window for communication. Obviously this
will make things difficult, but there are solutions!</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">First
of all, we will be doing everything we possibly can make sure that we
are as physically close together as possible in the studio with clear
lines of sight between all of us. If you watch old videos of the
Charles Mingus group performing, they always stand extremely close
together. Even if they are on a massive stage they are inches away
from bumping into each other so that they can be as interactive and
musical as humanly possible. </span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We
will try a few different techniques while we are rehearsing in
preparation for the studio session, such as playing with our backs to
each other so we can focus on communicating through sound alone in
case we can't achieve good visual communication in the studio.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We
love playing for an audience so we will be inviting people into the
studio with us! (Check out ""Witness the Magic"" in the perks

<p><br/></p><p></p></div>","Hi!
Thanks for checking out our Indie-go-go campaign! Dog Leg
Dilemma is an energetic, playful, hard-hitting electric jazz quartet
that borrows from a wide variety of styles including heavy metal,
reggae, rock, funk, fusion, world music
and movie soundtracks. We
are a truly experimental jazz band. We're not “trying” to fuse
things together. It's more about getting inspiration from a wide
range of sources and then dropping all inhibitions and letting our
ears guide us. This is how we operate in a live setting and it is
exactly how we plan to create our
first studio album. The nice thing about the recording process is
that artists don’t have to make all of their decisions instantly.
When you are performing live and suddenly you want there to be
strings, congas or a harmony line here or there, you basically have
to put those desires to rest. In the studio, anything is possible! We
have already started planning a few extra layers to add to some of
our songs and we are looking forward to exploring even more.We've
been gigging for about a year now in the Toronto area and people keep
asking us “Where's the album? When are you going to record this
amazing band?"" We've heard you, and we've come up with a solid
plan to make it happen! 

We
picked out a fantastic studio, we got a great producer on board and
we've already started working on the album art. All the details of
our
plan can be found below. The only problem is that we are all
(near-)starving artists with extremely shallow pockets. We are hoping
that you can help us overcome this ... speed bump.Finishing
this first professional album will help us achieve all our future
goals. A
studio album is the foundation of any good press kit. We have made a
DIY live EP available, but most festivals require a professional
version before they make the investment of flying artists across the
continent to perform. In this way, your contribution to this
Indiegogo campaign will help us play more live gigs and get our music
into the hands, ears and
hearts of people across the planet.


Meet
the Band

The Harmonauts (Ska). 


Where
Does All That Money Go?

Putting
together a full-length high quality album costs a lot of money!
Here's where it will all be going:

Tracking
(initial recording process): $1800

We
are planning to record in the beautiful chapel space at Coalition Music
studio.. Coalition is a Toronto studio housed in an old convent. The
Convent was fitted with state of the art modern equipment paired with
some timeless classic vintage gear which makes for super clear, crisp
recordings that still have that warm analog feeling that everyone
wants. The $1800 listed above pays for renting the space for 3 days
and for an engineer. David Henriques has agreed to be our live
engineer and our mix engineer. Which brings us to the mixing...

Mixing:
$1600 
A
big mistake that a lot of people make is paying a lot of money for
tracking and then cutting corners in postproduction. By hiring David
(who knows our music and understands the aesthetic) we will avoid
this common pitfall. David also has an excellent working relationship
with Peter Letros of Wreckhouse Media, who will be mastering the
record. Which brings us to mastering...

Mastering:
$750
Good
mastering can make the difference between a pretty-good-sounding
recording and an amazing-sounding recording. But
what exactly is mastering? Mastering is the part of the process where
the overall tone of the sound gets balanced. Mastering engineers deal
with the subtle dynamics, compression, equalization, coloration and
the sense of space in the sound. This is the last step before the
physical CDs are produced.

Production:
$1450

This
is the cost for the first thousand CDs, including shipping! We have
not finished our design yet but the first draft by Brandon Johnston
already looks amazing! 

Too
see some of Brandon's other work go
to brandonjohnstonphoto.com

Producer:
$2000
We
are excited to announce that Kevin Brunkhorst has
agreed to lend us his ears to help make this record the best possible
version of itself. Kevin has years of experience in the record
industry and just as many in playing, writing, recording and
producing music. The $2000 listed above includes his airfare from
Nova Scotia and lodging in Toronto for the duration of the recording
process. Both Scott and Peter learned composition with Kevin during
their undergraduate studies at St. Francis Xavier University. This
long-term musical relationship built on respect, trust, understanding
and shared musical language, is sure to make this album a thing of
beauty!

What's
in it for You?
If
you want the literal answer to this question, check out the full list
of Perks! Besides getting copies of the CD, T-shirts, Skype concerts,
lessons and dinner with the band, you get to play a part in creating
something truly unique.

You
get to help us push ourselves to the next level and see just how far
we can take our art form. But more than simple curiosity for our
own benefit, we do this because of how rewarding it is to share
the fruits of our labour with other human beings. The purpose of
this project is to dramatically increase the scope of that
sharing and the size of our audience. We are both excited and
proud of this work and wish to invite you to be a vital part of
the process.
As
creators and musicians, we need you, the listener. Without you, all
our efforts are totally meaningless. This
Indigogo campaign is designed to help us build a community of
like-minded people that comes together to share the simple experience
of music. Having this studio album will allow people to take home
a reminder of the experience they had and relive it with every
listen. 

What
if we don't get reach our goal?
So
what happens if we don't raise all the funds necessary for us to make
our dream album exactly the way we want to? Easy answer: we do what
we do best and get creative! Rest assured, your donation will not go
into the ramen noodle fund. No
matter what, we will honor your generosity by creating the best album
we possibly can with all the resources we can gather. Here are some
possible scenarios: 

If
we raise between $4000 and $5000, the plan is to do all the tracking
with our producer Kevin at Coalition Music and then hire a
professional grant writer to apply for various government grants so
that we can complete the postproduction. 

If
we raise between $3000 and $4000 we will likely complete the tracking
(with Kevin) in a less expensive studio and apply for grants to
complete the record, as above.

If
we don't make it to the $3000 mark would consider self-producing or
recording fewer songs in a cheaper studio.

Your
participation will mean the difference between our recording
ourselves with cheap mics in an okay-sounding room and our going to a
studio where professionals will use the best gear out there to make
the CD sound even clearer than if you were in the front row at one of
our concerts! We are going to make this happen on whatever budget we
have to; with your help, we can create the high quality professional
CD
that we want and that you deserve!

Challenges
One
of the biggest challenges for us will be capturing the interactive
energy of our live performances on this recording. It's easy enough
for us to feed off each others’ energy when we are rehearsing
together in a single room or playing to an intimate audience from a
small stage.
But when we are in the recording studio, we will need to isolate the
saxophone at the very least. This means that Anthony will either be
in another room (separated by a glass wall) or in the same room but
in a large box with a little window for communication. Obviously this
will make things difficult, but there are solutions!

First
of all, we will be doing everything we possibly can make sure that we
are as physically close together as possible in the studio with clear
lines of sight between all of us. If you watch old videos of the
Charles Mingus group performing, they always stand extremely close
together. Even if they are on a massive stage they are inches away
from bumping into each other so that they can be as interactive and
musical as humanly possible. 

We
will try a few different techniques while we are rehearsing in
preparation for the studio session, such as playing with our backs to
each other so we can focus on communicating through sound alone in
case we can't achieve good visual communication in the studio.

We
love playing for an audience so we will be inviting people into the
studio with us! (Check out ""Witness the Magic"" in the perks
section to the right)

<p>My name is Lynnea Rose, and I am a folk singer/songwriter based in Lawrencetown (HRM) and originally from Annapolis Royal, NS. I have been pursing music professionally for the better part of a decade,  and in doing so have performed all across Canada promoting my debut album ""Lynnea Rose"". It's been nearly  3 years since the release of my first album, and I am now ready to record and release 10 new songs!</p>
<p>I have the very exciting opportunity to work with Canadian Folk Music Award Winning team Tom Terrell (producer) and Karl Faulkenham (engineer). We are set to start recording in February with some incredibly talented local musicians and I couldn't be more excited! Of course, doing a project like this is quite costly, and finding funds to contribute can be challenging, especially for  an independent musician! That's where you come in! :) </p>
<p>With help from contributors like yourself, I will be able to create a fresh new 10 song album which I will <span>promote, sell at shows, tour across Canada with, promote to radio, submit for TV placement, pitch to management companies and labels...the list goes on! However, it won't just be a tool to help me further my music career. I see it as an opportunity to truly explore and express my art and find the true creative potential of the songs. I hope to create something that can be enjoyed and appreciated by listeners while contributing to and reflecting on Nova Scotian heritage and culture.</span></p> <p><span>By contributing you will be making this recording project possible. I simply can't do it without your help! The money raised through this campaign will cover all aspects of creating my new album. This includes recording studio costs, producer and engineering fees, studio musician fees, mixing, mastering, digital artwork and CD duplication. </span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>The total project will cost $7500. This cost includes:</span><br/></p>
<p>$1000-Recording Studio rental</p>
<p>$1500 - Producer Cost</p>
<p>$1800-Engineer Cost</p>
<p>$1000- Studio Musician Fees</p>
<p>$1000- Mastering Fees</p>
<p>$200- Digital Artwork</p>
<p>$1000 Duplication Fees (500 CDs)</p>
<div><br/></div>
<div>When you contribute you get perks! Who hoo! These include signed albums of the new recording, Lynnea Rose T-shirts, Custom made Cajones and guitar stands, music lessons, a song written for you, a handcrafted table lamp and cutting boards, baby quilts, handmade slippers, dinners/concerts and even a house concert!!!</div>
<div>
<span>If I don't reach my goal of $7500 then the funds contributed will still go towards the recording project...it might just mean that it will have to be scaled back to a 6 song  EP unless I can raise the funds in other ways. Other forms of fundraising would include writing grants, fundraising concerts and hopefully winning the lottery! ;) </span><br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>With help from contributors like yourself, I will be able to create a brand new album that will act as a tool to help my music career flourish. But what's in it for you you ask??? Well, my hope is that my new album will be something that can be enjoyed by listeners like yourself. Something that will evoke emotion, and something that will inspire. <span>The best moments of music career have been the times I've been  approached by someone who was impacted by one of my songs.

probabilities of opportunities, and various levels of ""success"". We 
intend to succeed by any means necessary, but we hope to do it without

the least of which is our desire to bring a videographer to help

will be the only ONLY female-fronted band out of 35 other bands.

We cannot understate the importance of exposing our music to its other
 half, and this is, possibly, the most important first step to broadening our pathways to world markets.As with any business, the level to
 which one invests, and prepares, directly influences the statistical 
probabilities of opportunities, and various levels of ""success"". We 
intend to succeed by any means necessary, but we hope to do it without 
falling into crippling debt, and there is a vast list of expenses, not 
the least of which is our desire to bring a videographer to help 
document our trip, and provide extra content to send all of you lovelies.
Videographer travel, shelter, and the most basic of human upkeepVarious travel expenses (transporting merchandise, instruments, and costumes adds up)New MerchandiseBroken gear that needs fixing (amps, instruments, pedal board)Upgrades to improve performances (mics, amps, pre-amps, in ears, keyboard upgrades, etc)Seemingly endless accessories (strings, cables, batteries, sticks, picks, cameras, hard drives, etc)Costumes/clothingRent
 (saddly, we still have to keep our apartments and band recording/rehearsal studio, and our
 landlords have refused payments of ""good intentions"")BillsFood (it takes a lot of fuel to rock this hard)

<h3><b><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Here is what I've already done with the help
of A LOT of people</p>
<p>1 - Debut album “Tus Colores”:</p>

<p>That was a lot of work done in the spare time
of the 12 musicians involved and with the limited time I had with borrowed
equipment. Everything was recorded from January 2014 to September 2015. All the
mixing and mastering of the audio was done by Giscard Valero. “Tus colores” has
12 songs and 42 minutes of music.</p>

</ul>
<p>This is what I need to take this project to
the next level. All additional funds will go towards equipment buying, I’ve
always wished to take piano lessons and I need a keyboard or midi controller to
learn to play and produce music from a piano. </p>
<p>If you contribute, you'll get some interesting
perks like album downloads, and your name buried in a time capsule under a
weeping willow. You can see all the rewards listed on the “Rewards section” or
once you decide to contribute.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>The weeping willow</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve always wanted to plant a weeping willow,
I think that this tree reflects the nature of this album. Believe it or not, I’m
planning to plant a tree every time I do something important in my life. In
this opportunity I will bury a time capsule under the tree and I will record
all the process on a video. Your name can be engraved on a metal plate with the
names of all the people that contributes the most to make this album come true
and that plate is going to be inside the capsule.</p>
<p>The capsule will also contain a copy of the
album, song lyrics and all the interesting stuff I can collect from the
musicians involved with the album. </p>
<p>All the names of the people that contribute
to this crowdfunding campaign will be listed on my social networks with
mentions and in a special section that will be created on my webpage
<a href=""http://www.yalungtang.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.yalungtang.com</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>It’s a promise</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>I promise to keep going on this musical path,
to sing and scream out loud everything that’s coming from my soul and from my
heart. I promise to keep producing music and to love every smile in every gig.</p>
<p>When you fund this project you will give me a
breath to keep all the good energy and to share it with every person I can.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Delays are to be expected, but expect them to be short because all the recording and editing is already done. I have set the release for May 2016, which gives me a lot of headroom, but there is no absolute guarantee that I can make that date. I'm gonna try as hard as I can to do it!</p>
<p>If I don't make my goal, I will have to cut costs in some way and the release could not be as expected. The only way to cut costs will be to print less albums, and to reduce marketing costs. Cutting costs could affect the success of this release.</p>

<h3>Breve reseña</h3> <p></p>Soy un cantautor Venezolano, canto y toco guitarra con un espíritu bastante blues. Tengo 25 años y quisiera esparcir mi música por el mundo. Es por eso que he estado trabajando duro en mi primer álbum titulado ""Tus Colores"". Este proyecto es música gritada desde lo más profundo de mi alma y quiero que esos gritos sean escuchados, solo para decirle a la gente que no están solos. Este álbum tiene todos mis sentimientos y mi vida, enlatados en ondas de audio.<p> </p> </div><div>

Short Summary
I'm a Venezuelan singer, guitarist and songwriter with a bluesy spirit. I’m 25 years old and I would like to spread my music out to the world. That's why I've been working very hard on my first album titled ""Tus Colores"" (Your Colors). This project is music being shouted from the deepest of my soul and I want all those screams to be heard, just to tell people they’re not alone. This music has all my deepest feelings and life canned into audio waves.

12 songs and 42 minutes of music.
What I still need to do is listed

This is what I need to take this project to

always wished to take piano lessons and I need a keyboard or midi controller to
learn to play and produce music from a piano. 
If you contribute, you'll get some interesting
perks like album downloads, and your name buried in a time capsule under a
weeping willow. You can see all the rewards listed on the “Rewards section” or
once you decide to contribute.



The weeping willow

I’ve always wanted to plant a weeping willow,
I think that this tree reflects the nature of this album. Believe it or not, I’m
planning to plant a tree every time I do something important in my life. In
this opportunity I will bury a time capsule under the tree and I will record
all the process on a video. Your name can be engraved on a metal plate with the
names of all the people that contributes the most to make this album come true
and that plate is going to be inside the capsule.
The capsule will also contain a copy of the
album, song lyrics and all the interesting stuff I can collect from the
musicians involved with the album. 
All the names of the people that contribute
to this crowdfunding campaign will be listed on my social networks with
mentions and in a special section that will be created on my webpage
www.yalungtang.com


It’s a promise

I promise to keep going on this musical path,
to sing and scream out loud everything that’s coming from my soul and from my
heart. I promise to keep producing music and to love every smile in every gig.
When you fund this project you will give me a
breath to keep all the good energy and to share it with every person I can.


Risks & Challenges
Delays are to be expected, but expect them to be short because all the recording and editing is already done. I have set the release for May 2016, which gives me a lot of headroom, but there is no absolute guarantee that I can make that date. I'm gonna try as hard as I can to do it!
If I don't make my goal, I will have to cut costs in some way and the release could not be as expected. The only way to cut costs will be to print less albums, and to reduce marketing costs. Cutting costs could affect the success of this release.

Breve reseña Soy un cantautor Venezolano, canto y toco guitarra con un espíritu bastante blues. Tengo 25 años y quisiera esparcir mi música por el mundo. Es por eso que he estado trabajando duro en mi primer álbum titulado ""Tus Colores"". Este proyecto es música gritada desde lo más profundo de mi alma y quiero que esos gritos sean escuchados, solo para decirle a la gente que no están solos. Este álbum tiene todos mis sentimientos y mi vida, enlatados en ondas de audio.  



  Lo que necesito y lo que obtienes 
Esto es lo que ya he hecho con la ayuda de un MONTÓN de personas
1 - Album Debut “Tus Colores”:



Composición


Ensayos


Músicos de sesión


Grabación/Edición/Mezcla/Master del audio


Arte del disco


2 - Videoclip Debut “Paraguas para ti”:



Concepto


Producción


Filmación


Arte gráfico


Dibujos animados


Edición de video


Eso ha sido un montón de trabajo hecho en el tiempo libre de los doce músicos involucrados y con el tiempo limitado que tenía con equipo prestado. Todo fue grabado desde Enero de 2014 hasta Septiembre 2015. La mezcla y máster del audio fue hecho por Giscard Valero. “Tus colores” tiene 12 canciones y 42 minutos de música.
Lo que todavía necesito hacer es lo siguiente: 



Imprimir CDs y Empaque + Duplicación de CD y Vinyl - $1,500


Promoción del videoclip “Paraguas para ti” – 1000$


Promoción del álbum “Tus colores” – 1000$


Grabación de video/Producción/Promoción de“Lágrimas de Fénix” – 1300$


Cápsula del tiempo – 100$


Esto es lo que necesito para llevar mi proyecto al siguiente nivel. Todos los fondos adicionales serán usados para comprar equipos. Siempre he querido tomar lecciones de piano y necesito un teclado o un controlador MIDI para aprender a tocar y producir música desde el piano. 
Si contribuyes, obtendrás recompensas muy interesantes como descargas del disco y tu nombre enterrado en una cápsula del tiempo bajo un sauce llorón. Puedes ver una lista de las recompensas en la sección “Recompensas” o cuando decidas contribuir.
   El sauce llorón 
Siempre he querido plantar un sauce llorón, pienso que este árbol refleja la naturaleza de este disco. Creanlo o no, planeo plantar un árbol cada vez que haga algo importante en mi vida. En esta oportunidad voy a enterrar una cápsula del tiempo debajo del árbol y voy a grabar todo el proceso en video. Tu nombre puede estar grabado en una placa de metal con los nombres de todas las personas que contribuyeron mayoritariamente a que este álbum se hiciese realidad y esa placa estará dentro de la cápsula del tiempo.
La cápsula, además, contendrá una copia del álbum, letras de las canciones y todas las cosas interesantes que pueda recolectar de los músicos involucrados con el disco. 
Todos los nombres de las personas que contribuyan con esta campaña, serán nombrados en mis redes sociales y puestos en una lista en una sección especial en mi página web www.yalungtang.com


Es una promesa
Prometo seguir el camino de la música, cantar y gritar todo lo que venga de mi alma y mi corazón. Prometo mantenerme produciendo música y amar cada sonrisa en cada evento en el que me presente.
Cuando contribuyas con este proyecto me darás el aliento necesario para mantener la buena energía y compartirla con cada persona que pueda. 
    Riesgos y desafíos  
Pudieras esperar una demora, pero la demora sería corta porque todas las grabaciones y ediciones están listas.He puesto la fecha de lanzamiento para Mayo 2016, lo cual me dá bastante holgura, pero no hay ninguna garantía de que pueda hacer el lanzamiento para esa fecha. De igual forma voy a tratar lo más que pueda con cumplir esta fecha. 
Si no alcanzo mi meta, voy a tener que recortar costos de alguna forma y el lanzamiento pudiera no ser como se espera. La única forma de recortar costos sería imprimir menos discos y reducir costos de publicidad, entre otras cosas que afectarían el éxito del lanzamiento.


Recompensas

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Times New Roman';font-size: 14pt;font-weight: normal;"">
</span>On November 17th, 2015, I sustained a pretty major head injury. Most people - including myself, don't really understand what a concussion is...until of course, you are forced to be in a dark room for almost a month. I could barely think straight, I was in a constant fog, dizzy, 'seeing stars', and I honestly had no idea if I would ever be able to do the things I love again. Recovery time can be anywhere from 6 months to 2 years, to even never. So I was afraid... Actually, I was terrified. I felt strange in my own skin. Noises were too loud, singing was too loud, remembering lyrics that used to come so easy was next to impossible, and trying to play chords? So mentally draining. As the months passed, I finally began to put the pieces of my mind back together again. And, after many ups and downs, I knew exactly what I wanted this album to be called. It felt so right. ""Head Full of Stars"" marks a turning point in my life. A renewal...and most importantly, a second chance.<br/><br/>I am dead set on finally making something that is honestly ‘Ariana Gillis’ – nothing more and nothing less. Sounds simple right? You would think… but I’m telling you, that from a creative standpoint, being yourself might be one of the most difficult challenges you could ever face.<br/><br/>However, we are all crazy excited to finally be recording the new tunes for this album. It's been such a long time coming.  And I am seriously so happy and humbled to be working with the artists, musicians, and people that I have aligned myself with. I am reaching out to all of you now to ask for your support in helping me complete this project. The musicians and producers and engineers are practically helping me for pennies because they believe in the music that I am trying to create. We all want to make something lasting, something truly great – and I hope we can succeed.</p>If you've liked my music in the past, I think you are seriously going to dig what's coming even more.

<h3>Our vision is to provide the tools necessary for understanding disability on a societal level, so that no one feels stigmatized based on something that cannot be controlled. We begin this journey at music festivals. </h3> <p><b>We need at least $25,000 to:  </b></p>
<ul> <li>Cover the additional costs of <b>creating 60 accessible events in 2016</b>.

<li>Achieve our goals of <b>educating the public</b> on the true nature of disability by publishing an annual report that evaluates the current status of accessibility at live music events, and provides detailed analysis of how to increase the standard by efficient and budget-friendly means.

</ul>
<div><b>Here is how it gets broken down:</b></div>
<div>
<p><u>$4000 – Outreach to the Disabled Community</u></p>
<p>One of our missions is to encourage the disabled community to attend our events. We are told all the time that these events are life changing and we want every person with a disability to know that festivals can be accessible and they should attend! We will be bringing this message to a number of Ability Expos throughout the United States this year and need your support to cover our expenses in getting the word out.</p>
<p><u>$3000 – Re-stocking Our Supplies</u></p>
<p>There are many supplies that we need to reorder for our 2016 season. We need new uniforms for our staff and volunteers so that our disabled patrons can quickly identify them. Lighted signage will easily directs our guests towards accessible features such as Accessible Viewing Area that are very difficult to find at night in a crowd. We need road cases to transport our gear across the country to our events. Other supplies include new tools to build and repair our infrastructure on festival sites and captioning software.</p>
<p><u>$6000 – Wheelchair Accessible Golf Cart</u></p>
<p>Do you know that there are less than a dozen wheelchair accessible golf carts for rental in the United States? This shortage has led to us being unable to have accessible golf carts at all of our events. By owning a cart, we’ll be able to transport our guests in wheelchairs anywhere at the events, avoiding terrain that is inaccessible in a wheelchair due to hills and terrain.</p>
<p><u>$3000 – Staff Education</u></p>
<p>We are always trying to keep our staff educated on the newest trends in accessibility and event management. It is our goal to send a number of our staff to the National ADA Symposium in Denver this year so they can learn how to make our events more accessible. Additionally we’ll be paying for all our staff to complete IAAM’s Crowd Management training before the 2016 festival season.</p>
<p><u>$3000 – Report on Accessibility</u></p>
<p>No body really knows the State of the Industry with regards to Accessibility. We hear lots of anecdotes about festivals we aren’t present at but it is our goal to do a comprehensive study that will examine how accessible American festivals really are. Additionally we want to formulate best business practices for the industry so that any event, regardless if we are present or not, has a resource to make their event more accessible.</p>
<p><u>$2000 – Indiegogo</u></p>
<p>They take their cut.</p>

<b>A disability can be traumatizing in and of itself.</b> <b>It can be even more traumatizing when you can't do something that you love because of your disability.</b> It's important that we help to prevent people from feeling as though they are second-class citizens. There is a disability stigma in America and it needs to be addressed. These are our brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, friends and neighbors, and they need to be treated with the same respect as everyone else. </li> <li>

</div></div>","All music is created equal. We are music lovers united to creating Accessible Festivals.  
My name is Austin Whitney and I founded Accessible Festivals, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, to ensure live music events are available to anyone who wants to attend, regardless of their ability. 


12% of Americans experience some form of disability, roughly 40 million Americans.

Six months after my car accident in 2007 that severed my spinal cord and paralyzed me from the waist
 down, I attended my first music 
festival. This was the first time since my injury that I was able to smile and 
genuinely enjoy life. The simple act of enjoying my favorite music with my best friends, did more for me than any physical therapy, any pharmaceutical, or any counselor could ever do. I was so affected, that I decided I wanted to help others with similar challenges have the opportunity to have experiences like mine. 


Through Accessible Festivals, we provide
 the accommodations necessary so that everyone can fully experience the 
beauty of live music. With the right   modifications, any temporary event can be made accessible to anyone, whether it's an ambulatory disability, hearing or vision impairment, a child with cerebral palsy or a veteran amputee. 


What We Do In 2015, we made 40 events accessible, whether they were small or large events, on a grass field or on a mountain. We made it happen. Our goal for 2016 is to increase that number to 60 events, and eventually create a new standard of accessibility that is adopted by any and all live music events. What is this new standard?-  Personal Interaction:  This is the single most important component of a successful Accessibility program. Understanding the true nature of disabilities, and the corresponding needs that arise in a festival environment, is essential for providing the ability to experience live music, regardless of the situation. 

-  ADA Compliance:  Utilizing our legal knowledge, we make sure events are compliant with all federal, state and municipal disability laws, which includes assessments, action plans and implementation strategies. 
-  Infrastructure:  Depending on the event, we design a plan that includes wheelchair viewing areas, shuttle transportation, information areas, accessible parking/camping areas, convenient pathways, assisted listening systems, assisted viewing amenities, emergency services, and much more!
-  Amazing Staff:  Our staff is the heart of Accessible Festivals. Not only are our people passionate and dedicated to the work we do, they are also the best at it. Our staff undergoes the proper training in order to be as helpful to patrons as possible, while also being able to make good judgments and go the extra mile to ensure a positive experience. 





Our vision is to provide the tools necessary for understanding disability on a societal level, so that no one feels stigmatized based on something that cannot be controlled. We begin this journey at music festivals.  We need at least $25,000 to:  
 Cover the additional costs of creating 60 accessible events in 2016.

I'm releasing my 1st Album, with one of my favorite music producers, Srikalogy, who blends together dub, hip hop, reggae, world beats, soundscapes, and sacred mantras. The process of this album has been a transformational journey over the last few years, and it is coming to fruition. One of the songs is a sound healing track in which the music was tuned to two different solfeggio frequencies: Repair DNA (528 Hz) &amp; Return to Spiritual Order (852 Hz.)  Some of the drum beats were sampled from tapping a water bottle. Another track is called, ""Brothers &amp; Sisters of the Revolution"" inspired by the homeless on the city streets, and speaking on racism, inequality, and the ""system.""  My first poem was published at the age of 11, and I grew up playing piano, singing, writing, and studying acting and dance, while being involved in activist work throughout high school and college.

<p>Hi. 
I am Vanessa and I have been an art teacher for 17 years.  I was born and raised in the Portage Lakes, a
town south of Akron, Ohio and when I was 24, I moved to Tampa, Florida.  In the summer of 2015, my grandfather, who
was an entrepreneur and successful Akron businessman, passed away and my
daughter and I flew to Akron to attend the funeral.  We stayed for most of the summer, to be with
family and to grieve my grandfather.  That summer redirected my passion for the arts

<p>In July, my daughter and I flew back to
Tampa, and it was the first time since I had left the Portage Lakes in 1999,

that had been scarce when I was living there.

share ideas over a cup of coffee or a glass of wine.  We need excellent WiFi, good coffee, and
great conversation about art.  </p>

visceral reason that I want to try and fund all this money through this
campaign is so that I can devote all my energy and focus towards hiring
excellent people, creating a unique and inviting space, and making this a
worthwhile venture for the people of the Portage Lakes to enjoy and celebrate
their local artists, writers, and musicians, without the pressure of a bank
loan due date.  Those due dates have a
way of taking attention off what is truly important and it can warp the vision.

Hi. 
I am Vanessa and I have been an art teacher for 17 years.  I was born and raised in the Portage Lakes, a
town south of Akron, Ohio and when I was 24, I moved to Tampa, Florida.  In the summer of 2015, my grandfather, who
was an entrepreneur and successful Akron businessman, passed away and my
daughter and I flew to Akron to attend the funeral.  We stayed for most of the summer, to be with
family and to grieve my grandfather.  That summer redirected my passion for the arts
and made me a woman on a mission.
In July, my daughter and I flew back to
Tampa, and it was the first time since I had left the Portage Lakes in 1999,
that my heart ached for my hometown. 
That summer, I had reconnected with the artists, writers, and musicians
that had been scarce when I was living there. 
The Portage Lakes are full of people who work hard, survive hard
winters, and are the salt of the earth.  As
I discovered this summer, they are also the sculptors, poets, and guitarists
that keep the soul of the Lakes alive.  
And we need a space—to create,
collaborate, and present our work.  We
need an environment that draws the artists, writers, and musicians to come and
share ideas over a cup of coffee or a glass of wine.  We need excellent WiFi, good coffee, and
great conversation about art.  
If you contribute to Gypsy Java, you
will be helping a town get in touch with its local arts community.  You will be helping foster the arts in a

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>We could fail. Being a band is tough. There are thousands of bands forming and breaking up each day, succumbing to the harsh realities of the music industry. To succeed not only do you have to be exceptionally good but you have to hustle hard. You also need a little bit of support from your fans. We think we’re pretty alright and we know we can hustle, we just need your support to take it to the next level.<br/>

</div></div>","""Original Swimming Party are one of the most exciting bands I have heard in years. The melodies and textures within the music together with the visuals set the tone for a musical experience like no other. This is a great example of powerful music coming out of Africa that is unmatched by anything else happening in the world. Unadulterated songwriting serving music at it’s best."" - Gareth Wilson, Goodluck Bar & Oppikoppi FestivalAbout UsWe make left-field electronica with dreamy vocals and synths, mixed with thumping african influenced beats. We also create beautiful visual material that we project onto ourselves during our live shows. It looks & sounds just like this:
We’re passionate about making music and visuals that are beautiful, complex and don’t sacrifice integrity for commercial appeal. Unfortunately that means we don’t receive a lot of support from the mainstream music industry, in spite of how hard we hustle.
That’s Where You Come InWe want you to be a part of the ""Hypergiant Audio Visual Tour"".
We already have  some pretty beautiful visuals but we know we can make them better. We want to film new visual material with a cinematic narrative and cleverly combine it with our existing graphic material. We’ll combine all this to create a compelling live show that we’ll preview in Cape Town before taking it to the world.
RoadblocksBeing a band in the Internet age is tough. Sales are at an all time low yet there are still hard costs to making music, visual content and touring.We already have a concept, locations, cast, director and cinematographer ready to create the visuals but we need to hire top quality film equipment to get the best results possible. We also want to pay the team who will help us, ‘cause no artist should have to work for free.We also want to tour the show because, let’s be honest, our moms are tired of hearing how awesome we think it is. That involves costs like flights, accommodation and if we really want to get lots of people to experience it, visas too. We’ll of course be able to recoup some money from tickets sales at gigs but trying to break through in a new area with people who have no idea who you are can be brutal… It means we need to pay for flyers and online advertising to make sure people hear about the show and that can be pretty expensive too. We already have an amazing management team in the US, sisters Morgan & Meg, who have booked us a number of shows in November, we just need to get there.All that’s missing from our magnificent plan is the budget to pull it all together.

Be The Fuel To Our Rocket
 We need $7,500 to bring this dream to fruition. Here are some of the things we need to pay for.

Visuals Creation


Cameras
Lenses
Lighting
Crew
Art Dept. (Wardrobe, props, etc.)
Editing & Grading

Tour


Airline tickets


Artist's visas (these are SUPER expensive...)

Accommodation
Projector Hire





So Why Should You Be Interested In All Of This?
We want to put this show together for YOU to be a part of something transcendent and beautiful. We want to invite you to be a part of the journey.
If that isn’t enough, we have some pretty cool rewards too.
We want to give you things like:



Limited edition album downloads of our upcoming full-length


Cool OSP t-shirts and graphic prints


Free access to OSP shows for a whole year


Beautiful OSP designed alarm and ringtones for your phone


We’ll even play a show in Antartica


You could even get the chance to feature on one of our songs or collaborate with us to create an original OSP track!


Please see the sidebar for a full list of rewards.







What Will Your Contribution Do?
You will be helping this magnificent show reach it’s full potential. We already know we can do this (come catch us live sometime and you’ll see what we mean) but we’ve reached the pinnacle of what we can achieve without some help. If you’ve ever wanted to experience a truly overwhelming and spectacular live show, now is your chance to make it a reality.

 
   
I’m Broke And Can’t Afford To Donate!
Don’t worry, you can still totally help out! You can:



Share the campaign on social media


Harass your rich (obviously non-artist) friends


Call your mom and tell her to get involved



Risks & Challenges
We could fail. Being a band is tough. There are thousands of bands forming and breaking up each day, succumbing to the harsh realities of the music industry. To succeed not only do you have to be exceptionally good but you have to hustle hard. You also need a little bit of support from your fans.

<h3>SIMON BENEGAS NORTH AMERICAN TOUR</h3>
<p>[EN]Hello there! I'm Simon Benegas, a Singer-Songwriter from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Thank you so much for taking the time to check out this Campaign. Ever since I started writing songs I've been dreaming about sharing them with North America and now the time has come to make it happen!</p>
<p>The main focus of my music is to have a positive impact on the listener, I want you to come down to a show and go home renewed, inspired and uplifted. That's it! That's all I want and all I strive for! And it is made possible with the help of an awesome group of friends that I'm lucky to call my band. I AM ready and extremely exited to bring my music to the US and Canada this Fall!</p>
<p>If you want to get involved check out the perks we offer for each contribution, the band and I will be so amazingly grateful! It's never easy in the beginning and specially when your aspirations are this big! But that has never stopped us and hopefully you can fuel our drive and help us on this one! If you don't have money and still want to contribute in some other way, you can help us a lot by sharing this campaign with your friends and getting the word out! We will really appreciate it!</p>
<p>[SP]Hola a todos! Soy Simon Benegas, cantautor de Buenos Aires, Argentina. Muchas gracias por tomarse el tiempo de entrar en esta Campaña. Desde que empecé a hacer música que sueño con compartirla con Norteamérica y llegó el momento de hacerlo!</p>
<p>El principal foco de mi música es tener un impacto positivo en el oyente. Como he dicho en otras ocasiones, quiero vengas a un concierto y te vuelvas a tu casa renovado, inspirado y en paz. Eso es lo único que quiero, la verdad, y lo que trato de lograr con la ayuda de un gran grupo de amigos a los que tengo la suerte de llamar mi banda. Estoy listo y muy entusiasmado de traer mi música a EEUU y Canadá!</p>
<p>Para involucrarse en el proyecto pueden explorar los ""perks"" a la derecha de la pantalla, cada uno tiene un precio diferente por el que pueden llevarse CDs firmados, remeras de la gira, canciones inéditas, y hasta shows privados para los que estén con Muuchas ganas! Hasta la mas minima ayuda nos aumenta la ""visibilidad"" de la campaña y nos da mas chances de cumplir el objetivo, otra forma de ayudar es invitando a amigos a ver la campaña y compartirla en las redes sociales. Por toda su ayuda les estaremos tremendamente agradecidos! Nunca es fácil al principio y menos con objetivos tan grandes, pero eso nunca nos frenó, y con su ayuda podremos lograr esto y mucho mas! Gracias!</p>
<h3>THE TOUR</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We'll be starting off the tour in New Hope (PA) then heading to Philadelphia, New York City, New Hampshire, Montreal (CA), Ottawa (CA), Toronto (CA) and Chicago! With a total of 15 shows, and plenty more of acoustic sessions planned along the way on the beautiful Cities and landscapes that this wonderful Continent has to offer!</p>
<p>We're going to record and document most of the tour and make some cool videos such as this one:</p>

<h3>WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p>We need an RV (MotorHome) to live in and hit the road with! We obviously can't afford a fancy new RV so we're planning on getting a used ""vintage"" one that looks cool and runs good enough to get us moving! That, and gas, is what most of the money will be used for. It's going to be an adventure, no doubt, but we're ready for it!</p>
<p>We also need to make sure we let everybody know we're coming, and that also takes some money to do (PR &amp; all that good stuff), but first things first, let's get that RV!</p>
<h3>THANK YOU!</h3>
<p>Once again, if you like the project we got going and want to be a part of it, check out how you can contribute and get some cool perks on the right side of the screen. Also, if you don't want to invest money into this, but still want to help out, you can do that by sharing this page, It will mean a lot to me and the rest of the band!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

You deserve much of the credit for the overwhelming response from listeners and reviewers, and the invitations to perform live, which took us to many parts of Europe, China, Turkey and the USA. I literally could not have got there without your generous support. And it's high time we got together to make another one, because I believe that Blake's Songs are a conduit to a space beyond words and music – keys to the inner landscape of our own soul.

</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">In this new collection we have been inspired by William Blake's visionary songs such as The Dream, The Angel (title track) and the ballad of Lyca (The Little Girl Lost), who falls asleep while lost in the forest, but wakes up in Heaven. The musical styles and arrangements are fresh and varied thanks to the involvement of my talented sons Leo and Maxim, and an intimate circle of musician friends. Our first album was recorded in a bit of a rush (you can sometimes hear it!) so we want to do things properly this time; 15 days to record and mix in Italy at </span><a href=""http://www.elfostudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">ELFO RECORDING STUDIO</a><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> and 1 day mastering the album at the historic </span><a href=""https://insideabbeyroad.withgoogle.com/en/welcome"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS </a><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">in London – where you could come along and join us on the day!</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">It has taken my own experience of life to apreciate the timeless truths and emotional inteligence infused in Blake's Songs. The insights are conveyed, as true wisdom always is, not from a height, but from the heart. Every single song has its own colour, tone, rhythm and theme. They tell us of real human dramas from the point of view of the protagonists, that are still being played out by today, be they a chimney sweeper, a little black boy, soldier or youthful harlot. It was in in the early 80s that I started discovering tunes for them on a guitar and that's when they began to reveal their meaning</span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">. Just as Shakespere's plays were written to be physically performed, I am convinced William Blake's Songs were designed be sung or at least read out loud to be fully savoured. </span></p>

</div>","ABOUT THE PROJECT

Blake's Songs are a conduit to a space beyond words and music – the inner landscape of our own soul...



The Angel is the sequel to my first album, “William Blake's Songs of Innocence and of Experience” (2011), which was made thanks to all of you who supported my Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign back then. You deserve much of the credit for the overwhelming response from listeners and reviewers, and the invitations to perform live, which took us to many parts of Europe, China, Turkey and the USA. I literally could not have got there without your generous support. And it's high time we got together to make another one, because I believe that Blake's Songs are a conduit to a space beyond words and music – keys to the inner landscape of our own soul. So we need your help once again to reach even more people with an excellent-quality album, recorded in Italy and mastered in London!
What's new

In this new collection we have been inspired by William Blake's visionary songs such as The Dream, The Angel (title track) and the ballad of Lyca (The Little Girl Lost), who falls asleep while lost in the forest, but wakes up in Heaven. The musical styles and arrangements are fresh and varied thanks to the involvement of my talented sons Leo and Maxim, and an intimate circle of musician friends. Our first album was recorded in a bit of a rush (you can sometimes hear it!) so we want to do things properly this time; 15 days to record and mix in Italy at ELFO RECORDING STUDIO and 1 day mastering the album at the historic ABBEY ROAD STUDIOS in London – where you could come along and join us on the day!
The insights are conveyed, as true wisdom always is, not from a height, but from the heart

It has taken my own experience of life to apreciate the timeless truths and emotional inteligence infused in Blake's Songs. The insights are conveyed, as true wisdom always is, not from a height, but from the heart. Every single song has its own colour, tone, rhythm and theme. They tell us of real human dramas from the point of view of the protagonists, that are still being played out by today, be they a chimney sweeper, a little black boy, soldier or youthful harlot. It was in in the early 80s that I started discovering tunes for them on a guitar and that's when they began to reveal their meaning. Just as Shakespere's plays were written to be physically performed, I am convinced William Blake's Songs were designed be sung or at least read out loud to be fully savoured.

Why support us

William BLAKE WAS CROWDFUNDED! His hand-made books were made possible by a loyal group of subscribers, giving him enough money in advance to enable him to buy the copper plates and paper and survive during the painstaking work of illuminated book making. Similarly, making an album takes focused attention to do well.

Here's what the music press said about the previous album:
“The CD of Blake songs...were beautifully played and sung.” Philip Pulman, Author & President of the Blake Society
“a small masterpiece of musical invention...truly inspired...one of the most interesting records I've heard so far this year.” Massimo Marchini., Rockerilla (Jan 01, 2012)
“Subtle and refined...the poet William Blake apparently used to sing his verses in public. Victor tries to recreate that magic and succeeds” - Andrea Trevaini, Buscadero (Nov 01, 2012) 
“Victor’s voice soars high and penetrates the heart ” - Eleonora Bagarotti, JAM (Jan 02, 2012) “Vertunni comes across as an old musical soul; not so much plucking items from the past and giving them new voice, but speaking and singing from some deep ancestral or universal memory that has never required remaking....William Blake's Songs Of Innocence And Of Experience, is an often seamless marriage between Blake's fluid poetry and Vertunni's arrangements. "" Wildy Haskell, Wildy's World Blog Review (2012)

We played a number of shows around the Seacoast area for about five years, and in that time we recorded our first original jazz album, ""Urban Suite"" as a five-piece band with Sean Berry (tenor sax), Ryan Parker (piano), Ben Zecker (Hammond B3 organ) and Bridget Kearney (upright bass).</p><p>Since then, Sean moved to New York to pursue jazz performance, Ben went on to LA to become a music producer, and Bridget went on to tour with her band, Lake Street Dive.

<h3>Hello fellow brethren of the human experience!</h3>
<p>Thanks for taking a look! My name is <strong>Sarah Schrift</strong>. I’m a New Yorker that hails from the environs of Detroit, MI. I’m a cross-genre singer/songwriter and visual artist. I’m working towards putting out my first solo album and I need your help!</p>
<h3><strong>The nitty gritty:</strong></h3>
<p>I am 90% done with recording an album (with my own $$ so far) that I am really proud of, bursting at the seams about, and I’m sure it’s going to knock your socks off. What I need now is to get this little baby mixed, mastered, printed, and put out there into the big world. That’s where you come in and I want to make sure that you get something good in return for your generosity. I was a bit worried about what I could offer but then I took a look around me and was like, oh yeah….the thing I went to school for…visual art. I have an enormous amount of artwork because I am constantly compelled to make it and then I carry it with me because I am a hoarder of it along with stacks of song lyrics and other fancy things. So I have the physical artwork from the album to offer to you. I have sketches that were originally intended for liner imagery. I have lovely ink paintings on handkerchiefs, an oil painting of Leonard Cohen, and two oil paintings that are the imagery for the front and back covers of this album. I can also play music for you and I can write music for you. My studio is essentially open to you at less than wholesale prices and I want you to walk away with something that you love. By making a contribution you’ll receive quality art and music AND be helping me put out one of the most important and personal pieces of art that I have ever dared to make to this date.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Get it:</h3>
<p><strong>$15 Digital Download</strong>: You will receive a digital copy of the album. (When it's done, y'all...but before everyone else!)</p>
<p><strong>$25 Digital Download, Signed CD and Love</strong>: A Digital Download and a copy of the CD. I’ll sign it and send my love out to you on social media.</p>
<p><strong>$50 Name Game</strong>: All of the above and your name on the inside of the CD jacket.</p>
<p><strong>$100 Original Drawing or Painting on Handkerchief</strong>: (You must specify and this is while supplies last. First come first serve. You can see them via the link.) All of the above and an original drawing or painting on handkerchief. <a href=""http://www.sarahschrift.com/#/ice-cream-for-astronauts-album-fundraiser/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>http://www.sarahschrift.com/#/ice-cream-for-astronauts-album-fundraiser/</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>$200 Rough Love (Caveat: I will maintain the copyright)</strong>: The digital download, the signed CD, love on social media, your name on the inside of the CD jacket and I’ll write a love song for you or someone that you love (I may need details). I’ll compose it and send a rough copy over to you to have forever and ever. This is a big deal because I never write love songs.</p>
<p><strong>$300 Perfect Love and Perfect Trust</strong>: All of the above and I’ll record your song in the studio.</p>
<p><strong>$400 Leonard Cohen: </strong>An original oil painting of Leonard Cohen…..because it’s Leonard Cohen. (There is only one and this is while supplies last. Details via the link.)<strong> <a href=""http://www.sarahschrift.com/#/ice-cream-for-astronauts-album-fundraiser/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sarahschrift.com/#/ice-cream-for-astronauts-album-fundraiser/</a></strong><a href=""http://www.sarahschrift.com/#/ice-cream-for-astronauts-album-fundraiser/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>Plus you’ll get a digital download, the signed CD, love on social media, and your name on the inside of the CD jacket.</p>
<p><strong>$500 Album Art</strong>: Cover art oil painting originals (You must specify and this is while supplies last. First come first serve. Details via the link.)<strong> </strong><strong><a href=""http://www.sarahschrift.com/#/ice-cream-for-astronauts-album-fundraiser/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.sarahschrift.com/#/ice-cream-for-astronauts-album-fundraiser/ </a></strong>Plus you’ll get a digital download, the signed CD, love on social media, and your name on the inside of the CD jacket.</p>
<p><strong>$1000 Wild Card</strong>: I’ll perform the album for you in person. It has to be in the 5 boroughs of NYC or in NJ or I can paint anything you want on a 15” x 15” surface in oil and send it off to you once it is dry. Plus you’ll get a digital download, the signed CD, love on social media, and your name on the inside of the CD jacket.</p>
<h3><strong>Your generosity will help cover:</strong></h3>
<p>One last recording session, mixing, mastering, marketing, graphic design, distribution, CD making, postage for artwork and CDs, and Indiegogo and PayPal fees.<strong> =$5500</strong></p>
<h3><strong>What about the album:</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>This album is one of the most deliberate things I’ve ever done. I’ve made strides vocally when it comes to expression: I let my accent come out, I let my voice crack, and I let the genre be what it needs to be. The flavor of the music is fluid. It’s not totally indie or country or spiritual or folk or rock or progressive. What I want to say is it’s untethered, it’s free. There is a sort of nakedness that comes through via the writing and vocal expression that are at times comforting and at times unnerving. It has playful and fun moments but it also hits on some very serious things and here they are in no particular order: judgement, religion, sobriety, sex, debauchery, possessive coupling, breaking up, and giving up. The album offers up a tumultuous saga but in the end the heroine metaphorically escapes the bad guys and rides off into a blazing sunset at a break neck speed towards a sexy secret rendezvous. My kind of gal.</p>
<h3>Production:</h3>
<p>Ok. I am totally going to brag here. The album is being produced by Gary Atturio from Studio G in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. (Google Studio G, Google Gary….I know! Fancy schmancy, right?) The place is magical and so is Gary. Gary really has a virtuoso ear. His knowledge about orchestration, composition, musical instruments and production through the lens of history is unparalleled. He can sing and play the heck out of so many different instruments too! Every time I’d go into the studio I’d come out with a song that I loved. I carved a sculpture of sorts and Gary made it walk.</p>
<p>The album is being co-produced by my friend Clay Russell. Clay is a musician as well as an actor/comedian. (Google him but maybe don’t do it at work. There is another Clay Russell out there in the porn industry. Go ahead and enjoy both Clays in the privacy of your own home.) Gary has produced many of Clay’s albums and having Clay in the studio made the album more adventurous and lent another informed ear. Clay helped direct the album by giving me instruction and moral support throughout the process. He also played the heck out of many instruments and sang some backing vocals as well.</p>
<p>The album has a few special guests with stellar resumes and I’m not gonna spill the beans about that just yet. Just know that I have been BLESSED.</p>
<h3>It's about time:</h3>
<p>Honestly, I know! My last album with The Sours came out in 2013. We got great reviews: <a href=""http://www.thesoursmusic.com/praise/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thesoursmusic.com/praise/</a></p>
<p>I'm really excited because I feel that Ice Cream For Astronauts is like a different element altogether. If the last album was water then this one is fire. You're going to see how much I've grown and how brave I've become.</p>
<h3>Timing:</h3>
<p>All of the artwork that is sold will be sent to their new homes as soon as the campaign is over. The digital downloads and CDs will go out as soon as they are available to me. I'm hoping for the end of August 2017.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risk:</h3>
<p>Nope. There really isn't one for you. You're going to get a tangible thing for your money. All my years of elbow grease, talent, love, and a twist of heartache went into it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can help:</h3>
<p>I totally get it. You're broke but you want to throw me a solid. Cool! Just share my campaign! I can dig it, you can did it, we can dig it.</p>
<p>You can also like my page on Facebook and follow my DAILY Facebook Live chats. There will be at least one for every single day of this 30 day campaign! (Technology is scary to me. What's also scary is that I consider Facebook Live to be technology....it's going to be interesting!!)</p>
<h3>One last thing:</h3>
<p>Thank you. I mean it. Lots of love! I hope your dreams come true too!</p>

Thanks for taking a look! My name is Sarah Schrift. I’m a New Yorker that hails from the environs of Detroit, MI. I’m a cross-genre singer/songwriter and visual artist. I’m working towards putting out my first solo album and I need your help!
The nitty gritty:
I am 90% done with recording an album (with my own $$ so far) that I am really proud of, bursting at the seams about, and I’m sure it’s going to knock your socks off. What I need now is to get this little baby mixed, mastered, printed, and put out there into the big world. That’s where you come in and I want to make sure that you get something good in return for your generosity. I was a bit worried about what I could offer but then I took a look around me and was like, oh yeah….the thing I went to school for…visual art. I have an enormous amount of artwork because I am constantly compelled to make it and then I carry it with me because I am a hoarder of it along with stacks of song lyrics and other fancy things. So I have the physical artwork from the album to offer to you. I have sketches that were originally intended for liner imagery. I have lovely ink paintings on handkerchiefs, an oil painting of Leonard Cohen, and two oil paintings that are the imagery for the front and back covers of this album. I can also play music for you and I can write music for you. My studio is essentially open to you at less than wholesale prices and I want you to walk away with something that you love. By making a contribution you’ll receive quality art and music AND be helping me put out one of the most important and personal pieces of art that I have ever dared to make to this date.

Get it:
$15 Digital Download: You will receive a digital copy of the album. (When it's done, y'all...but before everyone else!)
$25 Digital Download, Signed CD and Love: A Digital Download and a copy of the CD. I’ll sign it and send my love out to you on social media.
$50 Name Game: All of the above and your name on the inside of the CD jacket.
$100 Original Drawing or Painting on Handkerchief: (You must specify and this is while supplies last. First come first serve. You can see them via the link.) All of the above and an original drawing or painting on handkerchief. http://www.sarahschrift.com/#/ice-cream-for-astronauts-album-fundraiser/
$200 Rough Love (Caveat: I will maintain the copyright): The digital download, the signed CD, love on social media, your name on the inside of the CD jacket and I’ll write a love song for you or someone that you love (I may need details). I’ll compose it and send a rough copy over to you to have forever and ever. This is a big deal because I never write love songs.
$300 Perfect Love and Perfect Trust: All of the above and I’ll record your song in the studio.
$400 Leonard Cohen: An original oil painting of Leonard Cohen…..because it’s Leonard Cohen. (There is only one and this is while supplies last. Details via the link.) http://www.sarahschrift.com/#/ice-cream-for-astronauts-album-fundraiser/ Plus you’ll get a digital download, the signed CD, love on social media, and your name on the inside of the CD jacket.
$500 Album Art: Cover art oil painting originals (You must specify and this is while supplies last. First come first serve. Details via the link.) http://www.sarahschrift.com/#/ice-cream-for-astronauts-album-fundraiser/ Plus you’ll get a digital download, the signed CD, love on social media, and your name on the inside of the CD jacket.
$1000 Wild Card: I’ll perform the album for you in person. It has to be in the 5 boroughs of NYC or in NJ or I can paint anything you want on a 15” x 15” surface in oil and send it off to you once it is dry. Plus you’ll get a digital download, the signed CD, love on social media, and your name on the inside of the CD jacket.
Your generosity will help cover:
One last recording session, mixing, mastering, marketing, graphic design, distribution, CD making, postage for artwork and CDs, and Indiegogo and PayPal fees. =$5500
What about the album:

This album is one of the most deliberate things I’ve ever done. I’ve made strides vocally when it comes to expression: I let my accent come out, I let my voice crack, and I let the genre be what it needs to be. The flavor of the music is fluid. It’s not totally indie or country or spiritual or folk or rock or progressive. What I want to say is it’s untethered, it’s free. There is a sort of nakedness that comes through via the writing and vocal expression that are at times comforting and at times unnerving. It has playful and fun moments but it also hits on some very serious things and here they are in no particular order: judgement, religion, sobriety, sex, debauchery, possessive coupling, breaking up, and giving up. The album offers up a tumultuous saga but in the end the heroine metaphorically escapes the bad guys and rides off into a blazing sunset at a break neck speed towards a sexy secret rendezvous. My kind of gal.
Production:
Ok. I am totally going to brag here. The album is being produced by Gary Atturio from Studio G in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. (Google Studio G, Google Gary….I know! Fancy schmancy, right?) The place is magical and so is Gary. Gary really has a virtuoso ear. His knowledge about orchestration, composition, musical instruments and production through the lens of history is unparalleled. He can sing and play the heck out of so many different instruments too! Every time I’d go into the studio I’d come out with a song that I loved. I carved a sculpture of sorts and Gary made it walk.
The album is being co-produced by my friend Clay Russell. Clay is a musician as well as an actor/comedian. (Google him but maybe don’t do it at work. There is another Clay Russell out there in the porn industry. Go ahead and enjoy both Clays in the privacy of your own home.) Gary has produced many of Clay’s albums and having Clay in the studio made the album more adventurous and lent another informed ear. Clay helped direct the album by giving me instruction and moral support throughout the process. He also played the heck out of many instruments and sang some backing vocals as well.
The album has a few special guests with stellar resumes and I’m not gonna spill the beans about that just yet. Just know that I have been BLESSED.
It's about time:
Honestly, I know! My last album with The Sours came out in 2013. We got great reviews: http://www.thesoursmusic.com/praise/
I'm really excited because I feel that Ice Cream For Astronauts is like a different element altogether. If the last album was water then this one is fire. You're going to see how much I've grown and how brave I've become.
Timing:
All of the artwork that is sold will be sent to their new homes as soon as the campaign is over. The digital downloads and CDs will go out as soon as they are available to me. I'm hoping for the end of August 2017.

Risk:
Nope. There really isn't one for you. You're going to get a tangible thing for your money. All my years of elbow grease, talent, love, and a twist of heartache went into it.

Other ways you can help:
I totally get it. You're broke but you want to throw me a solid. Cool! Just share my campaign! I can dig it, you can did it, we can dig it.
You can also like my page on Facebook and follow my DAILY Facebook Live chats. There will be at least one for every single day of this 30 day campaign! (Technology is scary to me. What's also scary is that I consider Facebook Live to be technology....it's going to be interesting!!)
One last thing:
Thank you. I mean it. Lots of love! I hope your dreams come true too!

<h3>Artist's Summary</h3>
<p>I have been writing songs for a lifetime.  At about 3 years old, I began to rock myself to sleep to original rhythms and melodies echoing in my mind.  Around the age of 13,  I got a guitar and my songwriting reached a new plateau. I started playing in bands at the age of 15, and since I could never master a top 40 tune I only performed my originals. By the time I was 25,  I believed I had written several hits. Unfortunately, I wasn't in a position to professionally record them and my 30 year old cassette demo tapes have faded away.  </p>
<p>I hit a major turning point when I turned 45 and decided I wanted a simpler life. I started to make digital recording of my performances and placed them on YouTube, CD Baby, iTunes, Spotify, and Facebook to name a few.</p>
<p>I thought everything was moving along pretty good until I was diagnosed with colon cancer on Feb 3, 2015.  After several treatments I realized that I better make the album I always dreamed of.  In celebration, I am calling my album Alive @ 55.</p>
<p>You support helps me distribute the album, get airplay, have a CD party, create some swag and a whole lot more.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As with any project we need to raise funds in order to produce the best possible product and derivatives.  No matter how much money is raised, I will be recording the album and producing CDs.  If you received a CD from me at any of the 2016 American Cancer Society's Relay For Life Events you know the value of my self produced CD product.   If we hit our goal of $10,000, I will take the project to the next level.  Anything contributed the project will go towards making the best product possible for the budget at hand, so every dollar counts and every dollar will be used for the project even if we only raise one dollar.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I have been playing live for years and on occasion I have been asked if my music is available.  Unfortunately, I have never had the resources to make my original music available.  </p>
<p>Recently, we scheduled some studio time and planned on working with the raw material, burn CDs and generate CD covers using my home computer.  While this is an option, I want to be able to take this project to the next level and master music files and professionally produce the CDs.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div><p>Everyone who participates will receive an Alive@55 CD and certain levels will receive the additional bonus CD.  The quality of the products depend greatly on the funds raised from the campaign.  With limited funds the CDs will be produced from a home computer.  Our goal is to hit a fund raising level that allows to produce a professional quality product. No matter how much or how little funding we will distribute of Alive@55 CD and out take CD.</p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you are not in position to help us raise funds your support is greatly appreciated.  Please join the Bradley Weinholtz Project on Facebook and subscribe to my YouTube channel.  Plus I always appreciate it when you come a gig. </p>

<h3>The Big Ask!</h3>
<p>I know that it's not really the done thing to crowdfund in our little ol' d&amp;b scene, but without it, this album won't happen.  I'm sure there will be some people that hate the idea, but I'm hoping enough of you like the idea that we can make it happen.</p>
<p>This may come as a suprise to you, but as a business, Spearhead Records is literally only me.  Back in 2005 when I started the label, for the first 18 months I didn't even own a computer, let alone have any idea what I was doing or what I'd started.  I was living in Ibiza and running things from internet cafe's and a USB stick. Here we are 11 years later and if you have ever ordered anything from the shop, it's been picked, packed and taken to the post office by me.  I do everything from a&amp;r to the hoovering and everything in between.</p>
<p>While it may just be me who is employed, I've build some amazing relationships with artists, designers, engineers, promoters, event managers and loads of other people that have totally embraced things and created the wider disfunctional Spearhead family.  People who without their hard work and general amazingness Spearhead wouldn't have made it this far.</p>
<p>So why crowdfund for a new BCee album.  Well, to be honest with you, without your help, I can't afford to do it.</p>
<p>I want to make this one special, I want to be able to concentrate on songwriting, production and pouring my heart and soul into the music.  I have some great vocalists lineup up to write and record with and some other producers ready to collaberate, but regretably it all costs a lot more money than I have. </p>
<p>Just to reassure any loyal fans, if I wanted to be the next Sigma or someone else that you can find on Radio 1, then I'd try and get backing from a major label.  But I don't.  I want to stick to my roots, keep things rolling and just do what I do best, make drum &amp; bass full of depth and emotion that I hope people can continue to connect to.  There are no plans to change what I do, I just want to do it bigger and better than ever before.</p>
<p>Your funding will help me to bring you the biggest and best BCee album yet, and I want as many of you as possible to feel a part of making this one happen.  Even if you can't contribute, then just share it on facebook or twitter or whatever you people much younger than me use that's cool!</p>
<p>The funding will cover the vocalists, mastering, manufacture, session musicians, additional production and all of the costs to kick this project off.</p>
<p>I've tried to offer a load of perks that I think you will like or find useful and perhaps you just can't get me to do otherwise and I'm open to offers on anything else.  Essentially, just pre-ordering the album as a 'perk 'will really help.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your support.</p>

So a few years ago I decided to finally pursue my dream. I wrote some songs by myself and with others and have been lucky enough to be a finalist twice now in the Great American Songwriting Contest, in 2014 and 2016.

<h3>The Thrive East Bay Choir</h3>
<p>The <strong>Thrive East Bay Choir</strong> is a diverse group of musicians, artists, activists, educators, healers, and community organizers based in Oakland, California. Their heartfelt and soul-stirring music is <strong>a fusion of gospel, soul, funk, and folk</strong>. As part of Thrive East Bay - a new purpose-driven community focused on personal and social transformation - the Choir's music <strong>provides people with an emotionally grounded and hopeful response</strong> to the systemic challenges we face in this time.</p>
<p>Along with offering uplifting and expansive music at our Thrive East Bay monthly community events, the Choir is starting to perform at conferences, direct actions, and special events around California. As the Thrive East Bay community grows and as the Choir is invited to perform more widely,<strong> we are ready to purchase our own sound system and to record an EP album</strong> so that the gift of this music can live on in our daily lives and be shared with wider audiences. </p>

<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>A Sound System - $6,895</span></p>
<p>At the most basic level, <strong>we need to be heard</strong>. Currently, the Thrive East Bay Choir has to rent a sound system every time we perform. This is not a sustainable model, and the basic sound system we rent does not capture the fullness of our textured, rich, and complex harmonies. We need to invest in quality speakers, microphones, and monitors so that our audiences can hear us and so we can hear ourselves.</p>
<p> The sound system we plan to purchase includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Mixer - A Behringer X32 Compact Mixer ($1799)</li>
<li>Microphones - 14 Shure Beta 58a mics with stands &amp; cables ($2366)</li>
<li>PA Speakers - Mackie Thump15 Package w/ stands &amp; cables ($850)</li>
<li>Monitor Speakers - Two JBL EON612 Packages w/ bags ($1800)</li>

<h3>Recording an EP Album - $5,000</h3>
<p>The Choir already has a growing number of original songs it performs along with soulful classics that open hearts and bring people alive. We are planning to record a 3-track EP album featuring some of our most beloved songs so that our music can infuse the daily lives of our community and wider audiences can also experience the gifts we are bringing into the world.</p>

The Thrive East Bay Choir is a diverse group of musicians, artists, activists, educators, healers, and community organizers based in Oakland, California. Their heartfelt and soul-stirring music is a fusion of gospel, soul, funk, and folk. As part of Thrive East Bay - a new purpose-driven community focused on personal and social transformation - the Choir's music provides people with an emotionally grounded and hopeful response to the systemic challenges we face in this time.
Along with offering uplifting and expansive music at our Thrive East Bay monthly community events, the Choir is starting to perform at conferences, direct actions, and special events around California. As the Thrive East Bay community grows and as the Choir is invited to perform more widely, we are ready to purchase our own sound system and to record an EP album so that the gift of this music can live on in our daily lives and be shared with wider audiences.

<p>Living in trust and faith!</p>
<p>This album of songs is all about letting go of my inhibitions and living life more fully! And I have been given an opportunity to do that. And that is because through these songs I am being led out of my comfort zone. And I am being led because I cannot imagine anything other than recording and singing them!</p>
<p>I could get someone much more experienced to sing them. But why? I want to sing them!</p>
<p>With this endeavor I am allowing myself to live a more adventurous life. I know there have been inhibitions I've had which have kept me back from living my life fully as a musician and I am beginning to refuse to let that continue to happen. I have not been extremely inhibited but I think, like some of us out there, there are some things in life to which I've given way too much importance and head space. And it was not good things. So now, all good things!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My Backstory</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’ve been playing the piano since I was 9 years old.</p>
<p>But the truth is I always really wanted to play the guitar. When I was very young, my two older sisters had guitar lessons. And I thought that when I was old enough, I would have them too. But just when I thought I was going to start, the guitar teacher moved away. So instead, I started taking piano lessons with another teacher, Mr. Charles, on the third floor of Charles Music Studio in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So I continued to play the piano. I studied music at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, because I could not think of anything else I wanted to do. I got a degree in Music Theory and Composition and I’m a pretty good composer. I even won our senior year composition contest, and I was pretty happy about that. Eventually, I produced 3 solo piano CDs generating good reviews. I wanted to release others, but between my job (I worked at a record company in Universal City), forgetfulness and living life I just never got around to making any more.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Currently . . .</p>
<p>Fast forward to now – I’m playing the guitar! And singing!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a musician with a new and different vision for myself! My goal is to record at least 10 of the songs I have written over the past few years. The difference is these are singer/songwriter tunes, and singing them is: Me! This will be the first time that I will release an album with me as a singer. I am both exhilarated and tingly, knowing that this desire is possible for me. And so far 6 of them are in various forms of preparedness!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Making Herstory  </p>
<p>So, I’ve organized this crowdfunding campaign to generate income to record and mix these singer/songwriter tracks and I’m asking you to help me fund the project by purchasing my older CDs and the new album as a download.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I’m going for the gusto!</p>
<p>I’m really excited about this and positive because it feels right. And I know it will all turn out great – and with your help and support, I will succeed even sooner. Won’t you please add your Yes to my Yes!</p>
<p>Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart!</p>

<p>Who I am..</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we haven’t met, hello! My name is Troy Petty. An indie/alternative/pop artist from Chicago, IL USA currently residing in Columbus, Ohio. Music has been the foundation for most of my life yet, until recently, too far in the background. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>About 3 years ago I crossed that wobbly bridge into a full time music career. The risk continues to pay off: I feel the rewards from the very first note I play or sing, until my music is finally inside your ears, mind and hopefully, your soul. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is why I am here. My purpose. My job. To reach you. To reach out to you and share what makes us so similar and the mysteries that bring us closer. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since the independent release of my “Departure” EP in 2015, I’ve earned several momentum-building opportunities; from solid reviews, taking first place in a local songwriter competition, networking with the international music community in Cannes, France to 30 day tour in Germany!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And with over 200 shows and thousands of miles traveled in 2015-16, I can proudly announce my partnership with a wonderful record label and promotions company in Bremen, Germany, Songs &amp; Whispers along side the well known publisher Budde Music! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What I am doing..</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After signing to an independent label and a publisher in October, my timeline for opportunity is set and the bar has been raised! With the plan to release “Departure” in an extended special edition entitled “DepartureS” in July, my window to record the full length follow up “Director’s Cut” is narrow.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Welcome to the modern age of the music industry, where many artists and labels are creating closer and more personal relationships with their audience.

<p> </p>
<p>With just a few months until scheduled recording sessions begin, I am inviting you to be the reason and the way this album, my proudest to date, is made and released into the world! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Everything is ready to go except for our budget! This invitation is as much about asking you to share in the success of this album, as it is encouraging you to join us as we journey into the next 6 to 12 months and beyond. </p>

<p>Every penny that is received will help fund all things associated with this new album: from the recording, production to the thousands of dollars in travel expenses for the Summer 2017 tour in the US and Europe. Trust me, the money will be used to get me to you!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings from Colorado!</p>
<p>     First, we wanted to thank you for taking the time to check out our Indiegogo campaign! It means the world to us! Danielle and I are very excited about this project! It's a project that we've had on our hearts and minds for some time now. We believe that with today's technology and the amazing idea of crowdfunding, that there couldn't be a better time to<i> </i>start than now!</p>
<p>     For those who don't know, Danielle is an amazing singer/song writer, with an incredible gift of taking songs and arranging them in a new and fresh way! For me (Kali'i) my background is more behind the scenes in recording and mixing (with a little dabbling as a drummer).  Together with the help of some amazingly talented musicians, singers, and all of you, we want to bring to life a music album that we hope will bless all those who listen to it!  </p>
<p>     </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>     So what do we need? Though we have a lot of our own equipment to record and mix it, making an album still takes time, energy and money. We would use the funds for a few equipment upgrades that would allow us to speed up the process to get the album completed quicker as well as bring an even higher quality to the sound of the album. We would also be able to hire a few musicians and vocalists (for a couple of surprise collaborations on a few of the songs!) as well as pay for the licensing for the cover songs that will be on the album.</p>
<p>     The great thing about crowdfunding, and really one of the main reasons we are going this route, is because it is a win/win partnership. As you are supporting us in making this album we offer rewards, a way of saying thank you for partnering with us! We really love that this is something we can all do together!</p>
<p>When you give at least:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$3 -</strong> you will get your name listed on our physical CD, and a free download of one of Danielle's original songs ""You Reign"".</li>
<li>
<strong>$5</strong> <strong>-</strong> You will get all of the $3 rewards, plus granted access to a private Facebook group that will be posting picture and video updates.<strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>$10 - </strong>All of the above, plus your choice of either the physical copy or digital copy of the finished album!</li>
<li>
<strong>$15 - </strong>All of the above, plus you will get an <strong>EARLY SIGNED</strong> copy of the CD. (before it goes out to the public).</li>
<li>
<strong>$25 - </strong>All of the above, plus if you fancy yourself a singer, you will get additional karaoke tracks to each song. (sing to it around the house or in an epic Karaoke battle with friends, the uses are endless!)</li>
<li>
<strong>$50 - </strong>All of the above, PLUS you will be a part of an exclusive group that will help us decide which songs to use.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Greetings from Colorado!
     First, we wanted to thank you for taking the time to check out our Indiegogo campaign! It means the world to us! Danielle and I are very excited about this project! It's a project that we've had on our hearts and minds for some time now. We believe that with today's technology and the amazing idea of crowdfunding, that there couldn't be a better time to start than now!
     For those who don't know, Danielle is an amazing singer/song writer, with an incredible gift of taking songs and arranging them in a new and fresh way! For me (Kali'i) my background is more behind the scenes in recording and mixing (with a little dabbling as a drummer).  Together with the help of some amazingly talented musicians, singers, and all of you, we want to bring to life a music album that we hope will bless all those who listen to it!  
     

What We Need & What You Get
     So what do we need? Though we have a lot of our own equipment to record and mix it, making an album still takes time, energy and money. We would use the funds for a few equipment upgrades that would allow us to speed up the process to get the album completed quicker as well as bring an even higher quality to the sound of the album. We would also be able to hire a few musicians and vocalists (for a couple of surprise collaborations on a few of the songs!) as well as pay for the licensing for the cover songs that will be on the album.
     The great thing about crowdfunding, and really one of the main reasons we are going this route, is because it is a win/win partnership. As you are supporting us in making this album we offer rewards, a way of saying thank you for partnering with us! We really love that this is something we can all do together!
When you give at least:


$3 - you will get your name listed on our physical CD, and a free download of one of Danielle's original songs ""You Reign"".

$5 - You will get all of the $3 rewards, plus granted access to a private Facebook group that will be posting picture and video updates. 


$10 - All of the above, plus your choice of either the physical copy or digital copy of the finished album!

$15 - All of the above, plus you will get an EARLY SIGNED copy of the CD. (before it goes out to the public).

$25 - All of the above, plus if you fancy yourself a singer, you will get additional karaoke tracks to each song. (sing to it around the house or in an epic Karaoke battle with friends, the uses are endless!)

$50 - All of the above, PLUS you will be a part of an exclusive group that will help us decide which songs to use. (Danielle and I will have it narrowed down to about 20 or so, but you will help us decide which ones stay and which ones get cut) PLUS we will also have your name in a special Thank You section of the physical CD, as well as your name in the scrolling ""Thank You"" credits of our promotional/thank you video that we will release when the album is done.

$125 - All of the above, plus you'll get to be a part of the creative process! We will send you audio files of our rough mixes to get your feedback on each song. PLUS you will receive digital copies of the behind the scene videos we will be making!

<h3>Music is life.  Mine is informed by a deep spiritual practice, by the beauty of nature, by the wilderness both inside and out.  ""Begin"" is my second album.  It will take you on a full spectrum, emotional journey.  It's the work of my heart and soul, and it's time has come.

<p>The late, great Kenny Edwards' musical genius is woven throughout the album.  Kenny was one of the founding members of the Stone Pony's with Linda Ronstadt, and toured for several decades with Karla Bonoff.  He generously mentored and added his brilliance to many musicians works throughout California and beyond.  I'm ever grateful to him.  He co-produced the album along with one of Santa Barbara's most well-respected recording engineers, Robinson Eikenberry, and myself.   I owe it to the world to finally share this amazing body of work.   I owe it to Kenny, and to all of the fantastic musicians who helped to bring this album to it's fullness.   I owe it to the one who gave me these precious gifts.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  Your contribution will help to launch a project that will shine a light of love and brillance into the world, at a time when we need it most.</p>
<p>I am passionate about promoting this thing of beauty once it's finished.  The songs are more relevant than ever, and timeless in theme.   My hope is that this music enriches and touches many, many lives.</p>

We just need the final funds to cast the statues in bronze and ship them worldwide.Support from Lemmy HimselfLuckily, the long-standing support for the project and Whyte's involvement allowed the sculptor to meet with Lemmy for a series of live portrait sittings.  These sessions are the only one the rock god participated in prior to his passing.  The ability to sculpt his likeness from life, will help assure the monument's authenticity and speaks to Lemmy's support of the project and the artistic team.Various Motorhead’s fan clubs across the world have shown tremendous support and have requested multiple casts of the statue themselves.The sculpture is well underway already once funds have been raised we will be able to bring Lemmy home to Stoke-on-Trent and deliver other castings to his fans around the world.Every little bit helps, please joins us in this exciting project or share our story with others who might be able to assist. Donors beginning at the $5 level will have their names entered into a time capsule that will be placed inside the monument earning a place in rock n'roll history.Lemmy's fans were among the most loyal and passionate in the world.  We know that they can make this tribute happen.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Echoic: Coöccur</h3>
<p>My name is Otto Nuoranne, and I'm a musician from Helsinki, Finland. I've run Echoic since 2013, when I released the first album ""Springbook"". Echoic has been almost quiet for five years, but now nine new songs have grown too big for any nest and they're about to be released into the wild.</p>
<p>I'm asking for your support in the long process that has been and is making this album. The songs were written between 2011 and 2016, recorded between 2017 and 2018, and polished during this spring. With your support, I'll be able to pay the super-skilled and big-hearted musicians that helped me through this with no guaranteed income for themselves, and maybe water the Echoic plant for the future growth that it deserves.</p>
<p>""Bloom"", featured here with a little video, is the first track out, and I hope it feeds your appetite just enough to hold it until July, when the rest bursts out. ""Bloom"" was written and produced by myself, and I sang and played everything except drums, which were provided by Niklas Romo. It was recorded and engineered by Ilari Heinilä, mixed by Ilmari Apajalahti, and mastered by Jonas Verwijnen at Kaiku Studios. The video was produced by Eliel Kilkki and Joel Grandell at Superreel.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Money</h3>
<p>I'm hoping to raise 4,000€ for the project. This is far from what a label-funded album would cost, but I've had an awesome privilege of getting help from some very professional friends, who have generously helped me get this far. This is roughly where the money from this campaign would go:</p>
<p>1,500€ to production help &amp; featured musicians<br/>1,000€ to mixing &amp; mastering<br/>500€ to printing the CDs<br/>1,000€ to printing the vinyls (if we get there)*</p>
<p>Any extra will go to the musicians who helped make this happen and Echoic's future in the form of gear, merchandise, maybe even a tour budget at some point. If I don't reach the overall goal, the album will still be released on time and all the perks will be realised (except probably the vinyl one), and I'll fund the project myself.</p>
<p>And if you don't feel like supporting Echoic with money, it also means the world to us if you share the word about the campaign and the music, in the real world as well as online. During the campaign, you can point people towards the ""Bloom"" video, and that should give them an idea of what this is all about.</p>
<p><i>*About the vinyls:</i></p>
<p>It's any modern-day indie musician's dream to print vinyls, but it's also expensive. It's only realistic if at least 30 people or so want it, so any perk that includes the vinyl is conditional. If you pledge for the vinyl record, but it doesn't get made, you have the following options:</p>
<p>1. Get the rewards from a different perk of the same value<br/>2. Upgrade or downgrade to another perk by paying a bit more or getting a partial refund<br/>3. Keep the pledge as future ""vinyl credit"" - I will get vinyls printed sooner or later, either once Echoic finds a more stable group of followers or once I've robbed a bank<br/>4. Get a full refund and withdraw your support from the project completely (This would be sad.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>The Album</h3>
<p>Whatever happens with the money, in July you'll be able to hear ""Coöccur"", Echoic's new album. It's about 45 minutes and nine songs about coincidences, and the overwhelming idea that while so much is going on in our own head, a different but similar rich mess is wreaking havoc in everyone else's head. Sometimes lines cross, sometimes paths cross, sometimes two things happen at the same time.</p>
<p>It's a patchwork of organic and electronic elements. There's a lot of cello, acoustic guitar, and piano, but also some club beats, synth arpeggios, and my beatboxing into a broken microphone as heard through a cheap loop pedal. It'll eventually be up on all the major places where people get music these days.</p>
<p>I made it with all my &lt;3 and I really hope you'll like it.</p>

He wrote, <i>'I—in common with some 300 million Chinese and perhaps as many foreigners— was totally unaware of the existence of the Choni [Jone].'</i> A more recent source explains, <i>'the people of this ancient tribe have their own way of life. Due to their complex tribal structure, their lifestyle, customs, housing and costumes are visibly different from those of most of the local nation, making them a unique branch. As the tribe's women sport a hair-do with three thick plaits, locals call them Sangemao 三格毛 in the local dialect, literally meaning ""three bundles of hair"".'</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Bone grew up, as many of his peers in the modern generation, without much concern for the preservation of his ancestors' culture. Instead he looked to city life as a way of fulfilling his dreams of a new livelihood and a career in music. It wasn't until his mid twenties, his soul longing for authenticity, did he discover the truth of his root culture. Returning to his homeland, he spent many nights talking with his Grandmother and discovered a unique language she spoke in her youth but now is quickly being forgotten.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>As only the elder generation speak this language... time is running out. </strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545111491/r7rttrllrlevrtpzbchu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1536495173/bvejp5hcnuxpsu7kdnjn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545005216/bsvdimvycp9k5ydaxrem.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">ABOUT BONE</h2><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Bone grew up in the Gannan highland of Northwest China between Tibet, Mongolia and the Huangtu high ground. He was raised by his grandmother in a rural community and although his family had limited resources and opportunities, his passion for music filled his mind with possibilities and his heart with dreams. He began singing at a young age and at thirteen was afforded the rare opportunity to play guitar when he was gifted an old hand-me-down by a relative. He spent the rest of his teenage years experimenting with music on his own and with the help of his step-father. </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">At eighteen, Bone left his home in Gansu and moved to Shanghai with two of his hometown brothers. They shared a small space in the loft of an old lane house and began working in an electronics factory. Despite the hardships of his new life,  Bone’s vision remained set on his greater purpose for music. Later, he and one of his brothers found work in a Turkish restaurant and encountered foreigners for the first time. Bone began to learn English and changed jobs, next working as a bartender at live music bars and eventually as a salesman in music shops on Jinling Road. He started to perform and mingle with Shanghai's best foreign musicians. Recognizing his unique voice and powerful charisma, they instantly became his friends and mentors and continue to encourage him to this day. Bone’s music has evolved from performing Western cover songs to turning back to his roots, seeking an authentic sound and message that is healing for himself and anyone lucky enough to listen, while simultaneously preserving a dying cultural treasure passed to him from his earliest days in Gansu. Bone has been performing internationally since 2014 and his live music performances have become increasingly popular in Yoga Studios in Shanghai, China and now in California, in the San Francsisco Bay Area. </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><a href=""https://www.bonelhamokyapmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.bonelhamokyapmusic.com</a></strong></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>""Bone is one of those artists who can immediately transport you to a different place.... who can pull you into the world his songs are painting.

I come from the highland mountainous area of Northwest China, Gansu Province. I was raised by my Grandma. Her ancestors are an ancient ethnic tribe, called Sangemao, who live in the south of Gansu, Jone area. The spirit of the land and the soul of those people inspire me deeply, with the spirit of Mother Earth and the illumination of the Divine.  I choose to sing in that ancient tribe's language as it will be soon become extinct. Music is what I can give.It is the language that communicates deeply to all souls in life.""  ABOUT THE JONE（CHONI）SANGEMAO NATION In 1928 the explorer Joseph Rock discovered the Jone. He wrote, 'I—in common with some 300 million Chinese and perhaps as many foreigners— was totally unaware of the existence of the Choni [Jone].' A more recent source explains, 'the people of this ancient tribe have their own way of life. Due to their complex tribal structure, their lifestyle, customs, housing and costumes are visibly different from those of most of the local nation, making them a unique branch. As the tribe's women sport a hair-do with three thick plaits, locals call them Sangemao 三格毛 in the local dialect, literally meaning ""three bundles of hair"".'Bone grew up, as many of his peers in the modern generation, without much concern for the preservation of his ancestors' culture. Instead he looked to city life as a way of fulfilling his dreams of a new livelihood and a career in music. It wasn't until his mid twenties, his soul longing for authenticity, did he discover the truth of his root culture. Returning to his homeland, he spent many nights talking with his Grandmother and discovered a unique language she spoke in her youth but now is quickly being forgotten.As only the elder generation speak this language... time is running out.   ABOUT BONE Bone grew up in the Gannan highland of Northwest China between Tibet, Mongolia and the Huangtu high ground. He was raised by his grandmother in a rural community and although his family had limited resources and opportunities, his passion for music filled his mind with possibilities and his heart with dreams. He began singing at a young age and at thirteen was afforded the rare opportunity to play guitar when he was gifted an old hand-me-down by a relative. He spent the rest of his teenage years experimenting with music on his own and with the help of his step-father. At eighteen, Bone left his home in Gansu and moved to Shanghai with two of his hometown brothers. They shared a small space in the loft of an old lane house and began working in an electronics factory. Despite the hardships of his new life,  Bone’s vision remained set on his greater purpose for music. Later, he and one of his brothers found work in a Turkish restaurant and encountered foreigners for the first time. Bone began to learn English and changed jobs, next working as a bartender at live music bars and eventually as a salesman in music shops on Jinling Road. He started to perform and mingle with Shanghai's best foreign musicians. Recognizing his unique voice and powerful charisma, they instantly became his friends and mentors and continue to encourage him to this day. Bone’s music has evolved from performing Western cover songs to turning back to his roots, seeking an authentic sound and message that is healing for himself and anyone lucky enough to listen, while simultaneously preserving a dying cultural treasure passed to him from his earliest days in Gansu. Bone has been performing internationally since 2014 and his live music performances have become increasingly popular in Yoga Studios in Shanghai, China and now in California, in the San Francsisco Bay Area.  https://www.bonelhamokyapmusic.com ""Bone is one of those artists who can immediately transport you to a different place.... who can pull you into the world his songs are painting. It's an amazing experience to work in the studio with him because there is this unspoken message and guidance that is being channelled through his songs which directs our every decision. It's much more than the notes played or the words sung....it cannot be explained with words. Bone has a gift.""- STARITA  THE PROJECT This Indiegogo Campaign is the next step in Bone’s musical progression, launched with the goal of raising enough funds to record and produce a complete LP,  ""When Mother Earth Cries,"" consisting of twelve tracks that will capture Bone's potent message and pure intention of preservation and connection.  This project is much more than the recording and production itself - it is music in motion. This fundraising campaign kickstarts 90 days of performances and yoga with live music events to fully convey the power that drives the music through direct and intimate communication. Though the recordings are vital, in order to ultimately reach a greater world audience, Bone will be starting his outreach and engagement in the San Francisco Bay area. He is collaborating with his wife Laura and other talented and dedicated yoga instructors and yoga studios across the region.  THE SONGS In 2016, Bone visited the the US for the first time with his wife Laura. They combined forces with Grammy record winning producer Michael Starita to record and produce two incredible songs that not only will appear on the final album, but also sparked the passion among all of the parties to continue to work together to create a complete album that fully captures all the facets of Bone’s voice and message. Listen to the tracks:  
Mother Earth is Crying is sung in Chinese Mandarin so that Bone's message can be understood by his Chinese audience. Having experienced first hand China's rapid urban development, his lyrics lament the dire situation our society faces today:   ""You obtained too much, what‘s left?... Her pain is becoming more and more, she is becoming less and less...Oh, mama...Last night I dreamed she will leave us soon...""  
This Pitiful Life sung in his hometown dialect tells of Bone's first experience arriving in Shanghai as an ethnic minority with limited income. The melodies and lyrics of this song are inspired by the traditional 花儿 ""Hu'aer"" * songs of his homeland. Bone contemplates his ""Pitiful Life"" in Shanghai, homesick for his traditional food and grandmother's love, yet his message extends beyond... to embrace the humility of all who experience the cruelness of reality.

<h2>Songbelly: The Concept</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>Meet Heather Blush (Hazlett): </h3>
<p>I am a singer/songwriter who has been recording and performing music for over 20 years.  I began my career as a music therapist and later launched a business as a music educator, teaching music to young children in daycares throughout the Calgary area, and hiring other music teachers to help as my business grew too big for me to handle by myself. This led naturally to forming a children's music duo, along with my husband and long-time musical collaborator Steve Hazlett, called Rattle and Strum (we have also performed together with Heather Blush and The Uppercuts for 16 years).  Over the years I have taught many songwriting workshops for children and adults, beginners to professionals, and I have written songs with and for people in therapy sessions, as education, and just for fun or personal growth.  And - I'm a mom to three kids.</p>
<p>I want to use my ability to express myself and help others express themselves through song <i><strong>and be able to provide that music in a physical format that is cherished</strong></i>  in this time where music is streamed rather than owned....</p>
<h3>So What is Songbelly?</h3>
<p>Songbelly is: <i><strong>personalized songs in adorable, handmade stuffed animals.  </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>Personalized songs:</strong></i> high-quality recorded songs with a personal message for the recipient that includes their name. Choose between three songs (so far) with inspiring messages and your chosen name inserted OR opt for the Deluxe or Ultimate package and receive a truly unique song with more personalized details.</p>
<p><i><strong>Handmade stuffed animals</strong></i>: ADORABLE handmade <strong>in Canada</strong> plush animals. Choose from different animal options (teddy bear, penguin, etc.) and receive a one-of-a-kind stuffy to love! </p>
<h3>Why This is Important to Me:</h3>
<p><i>As a mom</i>, I value time and experiences over ""stuff"". I aspire toward fewer quality items that will be treasured for years in our household rather than large quantities of throw-away items.  So I want to offer a cherished keepsake rather than a toy that will be discarded after a few days of play.</p>
<p><i>As a musician</i>, I value high-quality sound and music.  I want to offer music that will be enjoyed by all who experience it, adults and children alike, a song that you will want to hear over and over. </p>
<p><i>As a music therapist and educator,</i> I know the power that music has.  I want to use my expertise to offer impactful, inspiring messages of love and acceptance. </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h2>
<p>We are aiming to raise $12,000 in this month-long campaign.  This will allow us to complete research on the final touches, build up a supply of the materials needed, upgrade recording equipment, and invest in some marketing to build up a following.</p>
<p>You get: Songbelly Buddies! The first batch of up to 200 will be sent out by June of 2021.  We've included more fun options on the perks list, including printed frameable lyrics, a handwritten message from Heather, and even a personal Zoom concert for our biggest supporters! </p>
<p>We also want your input! As this idea is still in the development stage, we want to update you on progress along the way and incorporate your feedback into the design.  </p>
<p>​<i><strong>What happens if the $12,000 goal is not reached?</strong></i>  We will still aim to send out your Songbelly Buddies by June of 2021.  We will adjust by waiting to invest in marketing and renting equipment instead of more long-term investment in recording supplies.  The business will grow more slowly, but we are still committed to making it happen. </p>
<p><strong><span><i>​What happens if you exceed the $12,000 goal? </i></span></strong><span> This will help us grow more quickly, market to a larger audience, and maybe even start looking at expanding the product line - lots more ideas cooking up... </span></p>
<h2>The Impact: </h2>
<p>If you choose to invest in this start-up business you will be helping to:</p>
<p>Provide positive messages and high-quality music to our future generation.</p>
<p>Continue to develop this product and be able to ensure the highest quality sound. </p>
<p>Support independent Canadian business. </p>
<p>Support an artist in this challenging time when sales of music recordings are being replaced by streaming (with little to no money being directed back to the artists), and live performances have been put largely on hold due to the current Covid-19 crisis.</p>
<h2>Aspirations and Challenges</h2>
<p>This product is still in development, which means there are some challenges ahead, AND there is still room for some input to find out what you want.  </p>
<p>Some of the things that are in development: researching and sourcing the best speaker option to ensure a high-quality product; re-recording the original 3 song options and tweaking the process for personalization; ironing out the details of the stuffed animals: which types of animals to offer, final design features, etc. And of course, all along, ensuring that we meet or exceed safety standards.  </p>
<p>Some of the things we are aspiring towards in the future: sharing the love by being able to donate some of our products to children in need; offering more songs to choose from; expanding to include more products (got some fun ideas!); building up a compelling marketing campaign. </p>
<p>I am happy to be working with a team of a few trusted people to conquer these challenges, meet our goals, and continue to progress.  And I wanted to introduce Songbelly here on Indiegogo while still in development in order to get YOUR input and keep you posted as it all develops. The most important goal is to make sure we provide what you want. </p>
<h2>Other Ways to Help:</h2>
<p>There are lots of important ways to help out without investing money.  Your help in getting the word out is greatly appreciated! If you like what you see, please share with any and all you think may be interested:</p>

<h2><u><strong>About Me​</strong></u></h2>
<p>Hey everyone! I’m Mark Ellis aka Fair Weather Son, a singer songwriter based in London. Through the years I have been a part of many bands, most notably Hamfatter who found fame on Dragons Den in 2008 and more recently Elma who have performed with the likes of Roy Wood, The Beta Band, and The Bible. Now comes the time to make something for myself and I need your help! The EP is called Dude Got Feelings and it’s exactly that, just a dude chewing the fat playing his guitar and letting it all out. The good news is it’s all recorded and digitally ready to go, so no matter what you pledge you will at least receive a digital copy of this EP. My hope is that with your help I can pay to get this musical piece of me promoted properly and when it’s safe get on the road to see you all, also VINYL! It’s a bucket list thing for me to have vinyl made so fingers crossed you can help me achieve that dream!</p>
<h2><u><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Alright then down to the nitty gritty! To fund this project and give the EP the chance I feel it deserves I'm hoping to raise £6800, here's the breakdown : </span></p>
<p><font><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">That oh so </span>beautiful</strong><strong style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> vinyl</strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> : £1300. This gets me 300 units </span>of 10"" vinyl, perfect for my 6 track EP and a life long dream achieved! </font></p>
<p><font><strong>PR</strong> : £2500. Working with PR companies is still absolutely vital for getting your music heard and I'm hoping this budget will help me make a big impact on the alternative scene! My friend James Parish runs Prescription PR and their latest claim to fame was helping the rise of IDLES and has always said the moment I need him to do represent me he'll be there.  </font></p>
<p><font><strong>Tour Management </strong>: £2000. Tour management is the vital next step once people start reading about and listening to the EP it's vital I take a band and play some shows.  I have someone specific in mind who runs a company called Blue House Music, I've known James the head of the company for a long time and he's someone I trust deeply! </font></p>
<p><strong><font>Video Recoup </font></strong><font>: £1000. It is absolutely true that Jonnie animated a music video for me just because he loved my song ""This Thing Is Better"" <i>that much, </i>but I wouldn't be a very good human if I didn't try and pay back that kindness and I'd love for Jonnie to create another two videos and create a story through them and through the EP as a result. </font></p>
<p><font>Perks for you depending on your contribution could include signed vinyl, signed digital artwork from Jonnie, live Zoom shows, Q&amp;A with myself and Jonnie, a concert at your house, or a full access all areas and have dinner with the band experience. Pretty much whatever you want... I'll do it! </font></p>
<p><font>If I don't manage to raise the full budget there are of course other options regarding the PR and Tour management, I am shooting for the stars here but you've got to dream right?</font></p>
<p><font><strong>Vinyl</strong> : There's not much wiggle room here, making vinyl is an expensive thing and when I asked for quotes they all say minimum order is 300! </font></p>
<p><font><strong>PR</strong> : I have had success with Piranha PR on past projects, they helped Elma achieve radio play on BBC 6 and I know they would give their all again but I feel that Prescription is a better fit for this music which is why I've chosen them. </font></p>
<p><font><strong>Tour management</strong> : The worst case scenario I could of course book the shows myself and I'm certainly not work shy. However, having someone represent you can get you into better venues and even opening up for bigger acts which would provide huge exposure and a great opportunity to sell merch and keep this dream alive! </font></p>
<p><font><strong>Jonnies video</strong> : Jonnie and the video aren't going anywhere and it's developed a beautiful friendship. I can always buy him coffee for the rest of our lives as a thank you, I just feel that his work should be valued and hopefully you can all help me do that ! </font></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This for me is about more than just the EP, it's part of my journey as a musician and as a person. As I mentioned in my video I've had success in the past with Hamfatter and Elma and I've written and toured with other musicians all throughout the UK and Europe but now it's time for me to be me. During 2020 I had to lean on myself, focus on my writing and find a way to survive. This EP is a result of all that writing and development and I can't wait to have the chance to put myself out there and grow in confidence in myself and my music. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course the music industry is an incredibly hard place to carve out a living and I'm no stranger to what happens when things go wrong. That said through my 20 years of performing and building relationships all over the UK by hook or by crook I know that for me where there's a will there's a way. I'm very lucky with connections that I've made and I intend to use them fully! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you really like what you've heard either musically or through me rambling but can't afford to contribute then please don't worry. I would however <i>love </i>if you could share this campaign on your socials and help me reach as many people as possible! </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you've made it this far down and read every word then thank you so much, just for your time in investigating my plans and my story I'm incredibly grateful! </p>
<p>All the best, </p>

Hey everyone! I’m Mark Ellis aka Fair Weather Son, a singer songwriter based in London. Through the years I have been a part of many bands, most notably Hamfatter who found fame on Dragons Den in 2008 and more recently Elma who have performed with the likes of Roy Wood, The Beta Band, and The Bible.

<p><strong>cAbiners</strong></p>
<p>We are a folk duo from Northern Ontario. We've been performing together since 2017, from festivals, bars, weddings, bonfires to special events and private functions. We released our first album in 2018 and is available on all digital platforms. ""wAiting for you"" was an album with a mix of covers and originals. It was recorded fairly quickly and served us well, but we are now ready and excited to work on our second album!</p>
<p>We need your help to make this happen! Obviously, things have changed a lot for everyone, and it's been even more difficult now for the entertainment industry, so your help is even more important than ever! </p>
<p>We've been writing tons of songs that we're super excited about, and this next album will help us reach a new level in our musical career. We'll be working with a team of industry professionals on this one so it's really important that we have all the support possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We're hoping to raise 5000$. This will help pay studio costs, mixing, mastering, CD design and printing! It's a big amount and that's why we need your help! We're turning to you friends and supporters to help us achieve this goal of ours and get us to the next level!</p>
<p>We've put together some really fun perks (like signed CD's, sneak peaks, swag bags, virtual concerts and live performances), so check them out and choose what excites you the most! Please donate if it's financially possible for you, and know that every contribution regardless of size is a huge help and so greatly appreciated! </p>
<p>If we don't reach the full amount, we will still record this album, we're way too excited about these songs and we're really passionate about this project. It will affect our timeline and we may have to make some compromises on things, so the closer we get to the goal the better for sure!</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>It's because of all of you that we got to do our first album, and so we are asking your help to do it again! This would mean so much to us and would be a huge step in a new direction. It's also been really tough not playing live shows because of this pandemic, so this will give us something to work towards and to keep us motivated and driven.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Recording and releasing an album takes a lot of work, coordination, time and energy. That's a challenge in itself, but add to that this pandemic which makes everything even more complicated! So we expect additional and unexpected challenges but we are up to the task, and with your help and support, it'll give us the strength to make this all happen. With all these challenges, it's hard to give an exact date for when the album will be finished, so we're using the date of Jan 2021 for the perks, but we'll have to update it as we go.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>If it's not possible for you to contribute financially at this time, please help us by sharing this campaign. Please also share it if you can contribute as well! Our community is pretty amazing and we feel so lucky to have you guys. We already have so many great supporters and sharers, but without being able to play live, it's difficult to gain new ones. So any help in sharing this campaign will be huge.</p>

<p>Hey! Just for taking the time to check out this campaign, I want to share with you the first single on my EP before it’s released on all platforms. Think of it as a little music hug from me to you. Feel free to access and <a href=""http://bit.ly/wounds_single_download"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">download 'Wounds' here.</a></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Samuel, U.S. born and raised, and I've been writing songs and singing ever since my parents got me an acoustic guitar for Christmas when I was 9 years old. I grew up in Wisconsin for most of my life, but a few years ago, I moved to Amsterdam, where my journey has truly begun as an independent musician. Music is everything to me, it heals me and keeps me balanced in life, and it's served as a beautiful tool that teaches me more about myself every single day. Everything that I write, I write with the purpose of allowing myself and others to reflect on their own lives and hope that in turn we all find ourselves on the path to continued learning and healing. Each and every one of you deserves to live happy and healthy lives, and I feel blessed to be able to share my music with the world.</span></p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">EP 'Oxytocin'</span></h3>
<p>While writing and recording the songs for EP 'Oxytocin', it was a time in my life when I was reflecting a lot on my past relationships. I wanted to channel those feelings of nostalgia, regret, and longing into something that not only many of us can relate to, but also something that can help other people on their journeys of relationship healing and self-love.</p>
<p>You see, our love life is constantly evolving. Through the ups and downs, I realized we all crave that warm and fuzzy feeling when your crush makes you laugh. Or that feeling of comfort when you fall asleep in the arms of someone you love. Those “too good to be true” feelings are all thanks to a little hormone called oxytocin. Some even refer to it as the ‘love hormone.’ Regardless of your relationship status, we all need a healthy dose of it. Especially after a year of continuous isolation for many people.</p>
<p><br/>Together with my producer, we wanted to create an EP that is healing, and that truly makes you feel comforted when you listen to it. Kind of like getting your daily dose of oxytocin.</p>
<p>This will be my 3rd EP released to date, consisting of 6 songs that were recorded over the course of 2 months, in a studio in the Canary Islands where my producer and I were temporarily living.</p>
<p>Fun fact: With so much more time at home this past year, we thought it would be fun to record and incorporate actual sounds in each song using home supplies like cutting boards, knives, pots, pans, water bottles, + some sounds from the island itself. Can you pick them out?</p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Your Support</span></h3>
<p>Even by donating a few euro to the campaign, you'll be helping me so much to finalize the overall creation of the EP. That way, it can be released on all platforms at the end of spring. If the end goal of €2,809 is not reached, we may not be able to release the EP in its entirety. Below you can find all costs broken down in further detail:</p>
<p><i><font>-Production of 6 songs: €1,300 (approx. €230 per song)</font></i></p>
<p><i><font>-Mixing &amp; Mastering of 6 songs: €1200</font></i> <i>(approx. €200 per song)</i></p>
<p><i><font>-EP album artwork + 2 singles artwork: €309</font></i></p>

<p>The only challenge at the moment would be to raise enough funds to finalize the production, mixing, and mastering of each song.</p>

<h3>Welcome to our IndieGoGo Campaign!</h3>
<p>Our band, Outer Park, is looking for your involvement in completing our second album.</p>
<p>In our pitch video above, we tell you a lot about ourselves and our project, explain why we're seeking sponsors, and even let you hear some sneak-peek snippets of our new music.</p>
<p>Here's the short version:</p>
<ul>
<li>On our first record, “1968 (slight return),” we captured the vibrant collision of styles and genres that was Underground Radio...</li>
<li>... and took it even further, mashing them up and overlapping them and updating them, drawing on musical and life experiences from the past 50 years.</li>
<li>Now we're back, to take it to the next level on ""Whole Lotta Orange.""</li>
<li>The work is nearly complete, but in order to get it done well, and dancing around in as many people's heads as possible, we need you!</li>
</ul>
<p>Please read on for more details - and more things you can do to help.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604435099/qyy2cp8o0irx57fkzau8.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>About this Campaign</h3>
<p>Why are we asking for money?</p>
<p>First, we want to engage as many listeners as possible, even inviting you into the virtual sound-booth before we press DONE. We do this for the love of the music, and for the love of sharing our sounds with others.</p>
<p>And second, we want to keep doing this. Even in the age of home studios and digital distribution, quality comes at a cost.  For example, some of the things that still require real money include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A studio and engineer to record most of the music</li>
<li>An engineer to mix and master the final results</li>
<li>Session fees for the professional musicians in our midst</li>
<li>Travel expenses to gather our far-flung band members in New Orleans</li>
<li>Licensing fees to use other people’s music (to the songwriters and their publishers, e.g. Joni Mitchell, Patty Griffin, Imogen Heap, and Buffy Saint-Marie)</li>
<li>Fees to get distribution on all the streaming and digital download sites</li>
<li>Fees for web site design, hosting, and social media advertising</li>
<li>Costs of promoting the final product, to get more listeners around the world</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we are hoping to find ways to continue our collaborations, pandemic or no, for years to come. And for that, we need to make these projects both financially sustainable and artistically satisfying. Sustainability is about covering costs, not making a living. Satisfaction is about making great quality recordings AND getting them heard by others who will love them.</p>
<p>With your funds, we can cover our costs and continue to make new good records every year. It's as simple as that!</p>

<h3>About Outer Park</h3>
<p>Outer Park consists of lead vocalist Chelsea Austin, guitarist Patrick S. Noonan, keyboardist &amp; guitarist Charles Tobermann, and bass player James Singleton. We've had the great privilege of Jason Marsalis providing the drums on both our albums, plus some equally wonderful guest artists.

Welcome to our IndieGoGo Campaign!
Our band, Outer Park, is looking for your involvement in completing our second album.
In our pitch video above, we tell you a lot about ourselves and our project, explain why we're seeking sponsors, and even let you hear some sneak-peek snippets of our new music.
Here's the short version:

On our first record, “1968 (slight return),” we captured the vibrant collision of styles and genres that was Underground Radio...
... and took it even further, mashing them up and overlapping them and updating them, drawing on musical and life experiences from the past 50 years.
Now we're back, to take it to the next level on ""Whole Lotta Orange.""
The work is nearly complete, but in order to get it done well, and dancing around in as many people's heads as possible, we need you!

Please read on for more details - and more things you can do to help.

About this Campaign
Why are we asking for money?
First, we want to engage as many listeners as possible, even inviting you into the virtual sound-booth before we press DONE. We do this for the love of the music, and for the love of sharing our sounds with others.
And second, we want to keep doing this. Even in the age of home studios and digital distribution, quality comes at a cost.  For example, some of the things that still require real money include:

A studio and engineer to record most of the music
An engineer to mix and master the final results
Session fees for the professional musicians in our midst
Travel expenses to gather our far-flung band members in New Orleans
Licensing fees to use other people’s music (to the songwriters and their publishers, e.g. Joni Mitchell, Patty Griffin, Imogen Heap, and Buffy Saint-Marie)
Fees to get distribution on all the streaming and digital download sites
Fees for web site design, hosting, and social media advertising
Costs of promoting the final product, to get more listeners around the world

In addition, we are hoping to find ways to continue our collaborations, pandemic or no, for years to come. And for that, we need to make these projects both financially sustainable and artistically satisfying. Sustainability is about covering costs, not making a living. Satisfaction is about making great quality recordings AND getting them heard by others who will love them.
With your funds, we can cover our costs and continue to make new good records every year. It's as simple as that!


About Outer Park
Outer Park consists of lead vocalist Chelsea Austin, guitarist Patrick S. Noonan, keyboardist & guitarist Charles Tobermann, and bass player James Singleton. We've had the great privilege of Jason Marsalis providing the drums on both our albums, plus some equally wonderful guest artists. Patrick, James and Charles go way back - they played their first gig together as pre-teens in 1968, in fact - and the band's culture is a multi-generational mashup and remix of underground radio and new sounds.
Our band has always been somewhat virtual - Chelsea and Patrick live in Atlanta, James and Jason are deeply rooted in New Orleans, and Charles lives in *old* Orleans, that is, in France. But we discovered that by gathering in NOLA's beautiful Esplanade Studio for a few days each year, we could bottle an energy and immediacy and spontaneity that could light up a city.
In our October 2019 sessions back at Esplanade, we bottled a lot of new magic. Since then, we've been using our isolation time in our own studios, adding and tweaking and experimenting with the possibilities.

Being an Outer Park Sponsor
We're offering you all sorts of perks: copies of our new record, ""Whole Lotta Orange,"" in whatever form you prefer, exclusive previews, and other exclusive experiences (including virtual club shows and even private event performances). Be sure to look for more ""add on"" options at checkout!
However, we are hoping you consider this a sponsorship of our musical journey, and the way of spreading some musical joy out into the world.

 Other Ways You Can Help
Of course we'd love for you to contribute something during this campaign, so you get be among the first to hear the next record (and get other perks). But even if you can't, there are some things you can do to help support Outer Park (as well as learn about performances, music releases, new videos, etc.)

<h3>Hi lovers,</h3>
<p>Heidi Anne here, singer-songwriter. I've been doing this about 11 years now and after spending time abroad - I have decided to work on a brand new album.</p>
<p>This will be my first proper album as a solo artist, therefore it's very important to me, I dedicated my time wisely during lockdown to songwriting and arranging, recording and collaborating with producers - and you'll be pleased to know 6 songs are already recorded :)</p>
<p>Will you join me? I am overwhelmed with the support I receive from my fans therefore I just want to keep making more and more music for you to enjoy.</p>
<p>This is not something I am randomly doing, but something I want to be proud to look back on when old and grey and saying 'look, i did that!' (or we did).</p>
<p>Some of you may know, I am also a fulltime healthcare worker, giving to the community is important to me, but following my dreams is too.</p>
<p>Partner with me on this campaign - rewards will be issued for your kindness too ;)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>As you probably know, my niche is Soulful R&amp;B infused Pop Music - so this album aims to reflect this perfectly. Emotion in singing and writing is my main goal.</li>
<li>I've calculated I will need at least £10,000 to pay for recording services, music production services, mixing, mastering, artwork, merch, videos, marketing, and really try to do things properly as an independent artist.</li>
<li>Exclusive T-Shirts, Pre-orders, CD's, Posters, Exclusive material, shout-outs and more, will be available to all of you.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>My music style and vocal is a unique niche, and if you follow me, you hopefully want more. We each have a calling, and this is mine so please help me change the world for the better. When music literally moves people so much that they have tears in their eyes, that's what we want - overwhelming emotion &amp; passion.</li>
<li>This will be the first independent step I've taken, but with your help more will follow.</li>
<li>If I don't reach my entire goal with contributions, I will continue with my efforts but it will take me longer.</li>

<p><strong>Hey, Matt Brooker here!</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know me, I am a classically trained musician that has recently set my sights on becoming a professional jazz singer. Relatively new to Atlanta, GA, I have lived here somewhere around 4 years. In 2017 I was introduced to the Piano Bar at Campagnolo (campagnoloatl.com) and began my adventures singing publicly on a regular basis and really finding my voice. Soon after, in 2018, I performed in shows at a local venue, TEN Atlanta, with Robert Ray (the Piano Bar player) and then started my own gig at Olive Bistro, singing every Sunday. </p>
<p>Fast forward to March of 2020.  The pandemic seemed to take all of that momentum from me overnight. I couldn't really find my voice singing on livestream and, of course, I couldn't sing anywhere publicly, which affected me in ways I wasn’t ready for. I took it in stride, remembering that over the past year each and every person on earth has been affected by the global outbreak... and that just blows my mind. I know that this has had a personal impact on every single one of my friends, and especially the relationships between them.</p>
<p>As the world is coming out of lockdown, I have decided that now is the time to write my first album. I have learned so much about myself and my relationships with friends and family, and I know there are even more stories that will inspire my music. I need to reconnect with my circle of people and really find out what they went through and what their perspective is. </p>
<p>I have asked friends and family to share their stories with me through a video diary, and I want people to find strength in sharing their truths. Some of these stories will be a part of a series called Pandemic Perspectives. I will then create new music and curate an album that includes the inspiration I find resonating in their stories.</p>
<p><strong>People Being People. </strong></p>
<p>The reason I created this Indiegogo Campaign is simple: recording an album is expensive. Now, I have been able to make a down payment to get the ball rolling, but I have quite a ways to go. I am only asking for donations from those who feel comfortable doing so, knowing that everyone in my circle has been affected in different ways.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I need to raise $12,000 to complete the funding for the album. This will cover the cost of the following:</p>
<p>• Professional music charts to accompany the songs I will write for this album</p>
<p>• The musicians, piano, bass, drums, as well as a few colorful moments with sax, strings and backup vocals. This includes recording time and rehearsal time!</p>
<p>• Three days at an award winning recording studio (800east.com)</p>
<p>• Our amazing Producer for this project (Dunlop Productions)</p>
<p>• Sound Engineers </p>
<p>• Professionally video taped portions of the recording process</p>
<p>• Album Cover Photography</p>
<p>• CDs to be made for distribution </p>
<p><strong>Donation Gift Levels:</strong></p>

<h3>""Slow down hotshot, tell me about yourself first.""</h3>
<p>You got it! My name is Spence Hood and I'm a singer-songwriter here in Seattle, WA.  6 months ago I made the heart-pounding decision to move to this good-looking, pine-smelling city with a guitar, a piano, and a pipe dream - to become one of the world's most beloved musical performers.  My style's been described as acoustic pop with flares of jazz and R&amp;B (think Jason Mraz, John Mayer, a little Nat King Cole when I'm feeling dirty) and things have been rockin' here so far!  Between opening for a myriad of acts coming through Seattle and downing bowls of rice &amp; beans (we're on a budget here people) I'm happy to say that my stage reputation is building up, slowly but surely.  I released my debut EP back in February which was a holler and half to make, and have spent every week since then reading through feedback from my fans and finessing the pieces for this next project.  Fast forward to today, and the songs are ready, the producer is on board, the Spence is caffeinated: go time.    </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>""Alright kid, gimme the numbers.""</h3>
<p>You may be thinking, ""why such a fat price tag for just 4 songs?""  Great question - that's because I've got the honor of working with the esteemed Robert L. Smith this time around.  Give him a quick Google and you'll see that he's a past Emmy nominee, has worked on several Billboard charting songs, and (most importantly) treats the craft of music production with the utmost respect and patience.</p>
<p>For those of you who are curious, the song-making process looks a little something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spence makes demos for each of the 4 songs (basically a proof of concept to give the producer an idea of the grand vision)</li>
<li>The producer helps Spence record the vocals and base instrumentals for each song, then (quite literally) <i>produces</i> all of the background instruments, sound effects, and other shiny things that really bring the songs to life.</li>
<li>Each song is then mixed and mastered, which is essentially a process of fine-tuning the volume and arrangement of ever layer of the song so that they all play nicely together, turning the piece into a nicely packaged, fan-ready product.</li>
<li>Spence releases the EP worldwide on all of the major streaming services (Spotify, iTunes, Amazon, YouTube, and the like).</li>
<li>Spence opens for Ed Sheeran, forms lifelong friendship, Nobel Peace Prize somewhere along the way probably, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>100% of the total $12k I'm aiming for will go to Robert's studio for his work on the songs ($3,000 per song x 4 songs), and any additional funds will be used to help market the finished EP, as well as helping me fulfill all your rewards!</p>

<h3>""Enough jib-jab, what's in it for me?""</h3>
<p>So glad you asked - I freaking love giving rewards, and I've got some cool ones for you.  I'm talking stickers, posters, customized video covers, behind-the-scenes footage, surprises in the mail, early demos of my songs, even live performances.  I don't ask for handouts lightly, and when I do, I'm gonna hand you back something radical.</p>

<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>

<p>Hi, my name is Tynan Davis and my rap name is Rollercoaster Man. For more than a decade I have been writing and performing positive and family friendly hip hop. In 2012, I made a song and video called ""I'm In Oakland and I'm Riding My Bike,"" and the video was played at Portland's Filmed By Bike film festival.</p>
<p>I believe that rap music doesn't have to be about flashing money and disrespecting people, it can be about positive and life affirming things.</p>
<p>I value authentic artistic expression, and I aim to continue to inspire people with my music. I have been recording in my garage and doing my best to mix and master the tracks, but it is time to turn over the technical stuff to the professionals. I also need to purchase the full quality original music from the producers, because I have been downloading their tracks for free at a lower quality.  I've done a few other music videos but without quality mixed audio, they have fell short of their potential.</p>
<p>I hope that someday, families will be blasting Rollercoaster Man in their cars and at parties. At the same time I hope to give people hope for rap music.</p>
<p>Some of the kid appropriate song titles are ""Silly in the Bounce House"", ""Jumper and his friends: A rabbit story"", and ""Oh my B'gosh.""</p>
<p>The goal breakdown is as follows...</p>
<p>$650 for 10 hours of studio time with a sound engineer.</p>
<p>$450 to purchase rights for original music tracks.</p>
<p>$100 for distribution to Spotify and other digital music stores.</p>
<p>Any contributions over the goal will go towards a marketing campaign.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

</div></div>","Hi, my name is Tynan Davis and my rap name is Rollercoaster Man. For more than a decade I have been writing and performing positive and family friendly hip hop. In 2012, I made a song and video called ""I'm In Oakland and I'm Riding My Bike,"" and the video was played at Portland's Filmed By Bike film festival.
I believe that rap music doesn't have to be about flashing money and disrespecting people, it can be about positive and life affirming things.
I value authentic artistic expression, and I aim to continue to inspire people with my music. I have been recording in my garage and doing my best to mix and master the tracks, but it is time to turn over the technical stuff to the professionals. I also need to purchase the full quality original music from the producers, because I have been downloading their tracks for free at a lower quality.  I've done a few other music videos but without quality mixed audio, they have fell short of their potential.
I hope that someday, families will be blasting Rollercoaster Man in their cars and at parties. At the same time I hope to give people hope for rap music.
Some of the kid appropriate song titles are ""Silly in the Bounce House"", ""Jumper and his friends: A rabbit story"", and ""Oh my B'gosh.""
The goal breakdown is as follows...
$650 for 10 hours of studio time with a sound engineer.
$450 to purchase rights for original music tracks.
$100 for distribution to Spotify and other digital music stores.
Any contributions over the goal will go towards a marketing campaign.
Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Help bring this new album baby CRYSTAL CALM VOL II into the world to create more Light, Love and Peace!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm thrilled to launch the birth of this new music during this 2020 Holiday season and to fill the coming year with more peace, calm, faith and light!</p>
<p>Join the team, and partner with me, Theda Phoenix to help launch the new Crystal Singing Bowl meditation music album, ""Crystal Calm Vol ll"" into the world.</p>
<p>This will be my 5th solo album. And the sequel to Crystal Calm, a deeply immersive, meditative, relaxing sound experience, combining water sounds from the BC Coast, Crystal singing bowls and Theda's ethereal vocals, released in 2010!</p>
<p>I, Theda have been singing intuitively for 20 years, songwriting and recording music as well as performing live sound healing journeys since 2007.  My life is devoted to creating healing and transformational music to empower all beings to connect with the innate healing intelligence within.</p>
<p>2 years ago I envisioned a follow up/sequel to Crystal Calm. Sam Ryan and I got back in the studio and started recording, editing, mixing and mastering. The Project has taken alot more studio time than I expected and I am reaching out to you now to help with the costs of production and manufacturing of this project!</p>
<p>Once again we recorded on binaural microphones, which creates an immersive 3 dimensional sound experience and the album is blessed with the natural sounds of flowing streams and waters of the Mama Ganges River near Rishikesh India, recorded and produced by Sam Ryan - <a href=""http://www.sosmusic.biz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sosmusic.biz</a><br/>Photography was captured by the magic and precision of the talented Jonathan Hanley, hanleymade.com<br/>And the mystical Graphic Design for the CD art was created by Kristall Onee - Unite.love</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you have enjoyed Crystal Calm, I know you will love this one too. It is in a similar style, perfect to journey, relax, drift, float, meditate, fall asleep to or use in your healing and massage sessions.</p>
<p>I feel it is especially important to share this music during these stressful times of uncertainty, when we most need to stay grounded and connected to our center and our sense of spiritual source, peace and balance. This music can help regulate the nervous system by entering deep states of relaxation, helping us maintain well-being and calm in times of stress.   </p>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you are both receiving and contributing the benefits of more peace in our often overwhelming world!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As an independent recording artist, I am responsible for all the costs of recording, producing and manufacturing the music, and the costs really do add up!</p>
<p>Breakdown of costs on this project are:</p>
<p>Production              $4843.75 </p>
<p>Manufacturing (500)  $849.17</p>
<p>Indigogo Fees .05%     $284     extra fee  $25</p>
<p>TOTAL Expenses: $6001.92.  Rounding to a final Goal of $6000 for this campaign!</p>
<p>In the case that we raise additional funds, it will go towards Marketing and Promotional Costs to share the album with more listeners!</p>
<p>I deeply thank you for your continued support of my music and for taking the time to contribute, share this campaign and also enjoy the healing benefits of this music.</p>
<p>I look forward to sharing this album with you!</p>

<p>Songwriting has been part of my musical life growing up
and with the ability of presenting my music through my singing, production
and music arrangement, I have written a large number of songs particularly for my first debut album “My World”. Currently residing in<b> </b>Brooklyn, New York, I have been performing in various venues in
Boston and NYC area for the past 3 years after moving to the United States in
Fall 2011.<br/></p>
<p>Graduated from Berklee College of Music with a
dual major in Contemporary Writing and Production and Music Performance, I have produced an Extended Play (EP) consists of 5 songs in Fall 2012. My biggest achievement so far would be the tours that I had in Malaysia and Singapore in Summer 2013 promoting my EP and also the European Tour that includes my participation in the Close Encounters Festival 2014 in Finland and St. Petersburg, Russia. I also spread my wing to the West Coast of American and did a short tour in California.</p>
<p><span>My music translates my experiences in life, love and music journey. My goal is to bring back the soul in music that we’ve lost in today’s music such as the music by the great Stevie Wonder, Donny Hathaway, Anita Baker and many more and to fuse it with today’s music technology and not forgetting my Malaysian roots. All those elements won’t only be heard through my music but the interpretation of my singing and the development of the music production itself. Being a music student who has a large knowledge in writing and also music technology gives me more headroom to expand my sound in terms of creating a new sound that can be accepted in the mainstream and yet is still different. My view in life changes as I was brought up in a smaller village not knowing English language and had the opportunity to move to the city to further my studies and what more after moving to the United States and to one of the largest and fast moving city in the world, New York City. Those huge steps that I took has taught me so much in being independent, a hustler, and appreciating every single opportunity that has been given to me. Touching people’s heart and soul is one of my biggest aspiration. Through the years of being a musician, I have been inspired by a lot of musicians, artist, writers, and individuals and I'm looking forward for the opportunity for me to inspire people through my music and share my life journey.</span></p> </span>

<h3>The ALBUM ""My World""</h3>
<br/>A couple of years back, I started this crazy idea of putting together my album ON MY OWN without any help of any record labels. I wrote over 70 songs for the making of this album and finally it has been down listed to a full length album (12 songs). It's basically a combination of my old and new sound, which was carried through each experiences I've had from moving from one country to another and by going through life changes.<br/><br/>In this album, it will feature both organic and electronic sounds of music. As a huge fan of classic R&amp;B music, I've infused some of the elements with some modern music and also not to forget my Malaysian root. This album represents my journey in life as a person, musician and a lover. It can be seen through each songs that I wrote. Each melody and lyrics mean more than just putting words into a song. Life has been a roller coaster for me but I know that it will always get better each time I fall. This album is about bringing people together, letting them know that they're not alone and if they're scared to speak their emotions, they have a song to add to their playlist to represent exactly how they feel. This album is about standing up stronger and believing in yourself, myself, ourselves. </div><div>As for the progress of the album, the first phase of having all 12 songs rearranged has been done. We will proceed with the recording sessions as soon as this project is funded. <br/><br/>For the single, it is currently in the mixing process. I'll start shooting the music video in early February and it will be out as soon as the music video is ready. Currently it is ""on hold"" as I'm still looking for sponsors to sponsor the making of the music video<br/> </div><div>

The TOUR


The 2 weeks tour will cover the ""East Coast"" of the United States in April 2015 that includes:I will be joined by three more amazing songwriters Aleksandra Denda, SA and Shubh Saran.



   What The Album Needs & What You'll Get 


The ""FUND""
I am always scared when it comes to asking funds from others but this dream of mine is definitely worth fighting my fear and hopefully it'll be worth your time and financial support. With this fund I raise, it will be channeled to 

Recording Studio Sessions - $2500
Session Musicians - $2000
Mixing Session - $3000
Mastering Session - $1500
Album Printing - $3000
Marketing & Promotions - $2000

East Coast Tour (Per Diem) - $7000

As you can see, the total amount of each production procedure costs way more than what i'm raising as I'm putting together my own savings into this project, but it is not enough to support this whole process of making an album.
The recording sessions, mixing sessions and mastering sessions will take up to $9k as I'm looking to record and get a professional mixing and mastering engineer to get the best quality I can get. The recording sessions will be held in both New York and Boston, which will be in Eidolon Studio (Boston) and Riro Muzik (New York City)

The cost for album printing, marketing and promotions can go up to $2k for me to be able to get my album and single out on the websites, iTunes, Spotify, Music Stores, Radios and most probably Televisions.As for the tour, I will be getting outside sponsors to cut as much cost as possible and the balance of the remaining fund will go to both the tour and the music video.


You'll get..

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I’m about a month away from completing my next CD. Don't rush this, I keep telling myself - so we're adding new parts as we mix. Making it better, I think. But it's not far off.</span><br/></p>
<p>I think the music feels lovely, and the songs feel honest and good. I’ve been lucky enough to enlist the help of some fantastic musical friends, including Hannah Sanders, Matt Kelly, Lizzie J Taylor, Nick Blishen, Greg Camburn, Lucinda Fudge and Brian Harvey. </p>
<p>But now we need to master it and design it and press it. That’s the costly bit and I’m appealing for help from anyone who thinks they might be interested in the album, in the form of a pre-order pledge.</p>
<p>Many have donated already but there’s still a way to go. The deadline for the campaign is March 7th and by then I hope to have raised £1200. Or thereabouts: that’s the top target, but every pledge will count. If we don't hit the target by then the campaign will remain open - mainly because I want to do a good job and a little extra time never hurt. Just so long as it's not too long...</p>
<p>You can pledge through Indiegogo with a credit card or Paypal (the credit card route is preferable), or you can just hand me some cash when you see me and I’ll make sure you’re added to the list. </p>
<p>When it's complete, the album will sell for £10. So a £10 pledge gets you a guaranteed copy, in the snail mail or at a lovely launch event, just as soon as the finished discs arrive at Clunk and Rattle Records. </p>
<p>Of course a little extra always helps. So if you can stretch to £13 or more you’ll also have booked a copy of a limited edition three-track EP, scheduled for completion shortly after the main album is done. To date I'm not entirely sure what will be on the EP, so that'll be a wee surprise for all concerned. </p>
<p>Just so you know, the album will be called <b>Deck</b>, and the EP will be called <b>Alt</b>. </p>
<p>I do hope all that makes sense. Please please please please email me at <a href=""mailto:markgsongs@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">markgsongs@gmail.com</a> if you’ve got a question!</p><div>

You can pledge through Indiegogo with a credit card or Paypal (the credit card route is preferable), or you can just hand me some cash when you see me and I’ll make sure you’re added to the list. 
When it's complete, the album will sell for £10. So a £10 pledge gets you a guaranteed copy, in the snail mail or at a lovely launch event, just as soon as the finished discs arrive at Clunk and Rattle Records. 
Of course a little extra always helps. So if you can stretch to £13 or more you’ll also have booked a copy of a limited edition three-track EP, scheduled for completion shortly after the main album is done. To date I'm not entirely sure what will be on the EP, so that'll be a wee surprise for all concerned. 
Just so you know, the album will be called Deck, and the EP will be called Alt. 
I do hope all that makes sense. Please please please please email me at markgsongs@gmail.com if you’ve got a question!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

For example, we will be able to support more work in India – before Refreshment
went in 2014, no UK-based charity had been to the part of India we were in.

children who were made to feel special.</p>

the UK, by having an increased team, we will be able to accommodate more in our

refreshing. </p>

that finding the right team members will not be easy as demand will be high and
we need people who are self-motivated. We are running a good mentoring scheme

in mentoring and has worked alongside mentees for nearly a decade.</p>
<p>We also
know that as a charity, funding is not always there – but part of the team

<h1>We are The Blank Canvas</h1>
<p>We are a rock band from Jacksonville, Florida.  We go to Douglas Anderson School of the Arts.  Carson Hall is on lead vocals and guitar, Taylor Neal on lead guitar, Andre Delellis on bass, and Brian Lester on drums.  We love music and get inspired from artists like Manchester Orchestra, Title Fight, and Balance and Composure. </p>
<p> Music is more than a love, it is who we are at our core.   With this album you will hear a new fresh sound from a band out to impact our community.  We have a pure rock sound, not robotically corrected to where it is ""perfect"", but to where the music is real. Real music, real lyrics, and real people for our real fans. </p>
<div>
<p></p>
<h1>Making the album</h1>
<p>For our debut album we want to do something different.  Something that is uncommon in today's music. We want to make an album the way bands made records pre-2000's.  Modern records are typically performed one instrument at a time and one section of a song at a time.  Then in a computer, they are cut and pasted together to make the song.  Parts are clinically perfected.  Everything is ""auto tuned"" and quantized.  Simply put, the life is sucked out of the music!  </p>
<p><b><i>We want to put the life back into music.</i></b></p>
<p><b><strike></strike></b>Our album <i></i>will be made without the aid of computers.  We will all be in the room performing together as a band.  The same energy and groove that we have live will be on the album.  What you hear on the record will be exactly how it was performed, by us. </p>
<p><b>Why are we doing this?</b> </p>
<p>Because you deserve to hear music the way music was meant to be heard, and because we can!  We want our fans to experience what it feels like to have the hair stand up on the back of their necks because the groove feels so good.  We hope to be part of a music revival bringing a return of amazing and authentic music.  </p>
<h1>Be a part of the recording process</h1>
<p>All this is great, but we need your help to make it happen.  We need $3000 to make this record at the quality that our fans deserve and we need you to help us raise the money.  </p>
<p><b>What can you do to help?</b></p>
<p>First, choose a reward on this page and buy it.  It's that simple.  Only have $10?  Pre-order the album! Are you a super fan and want us to do a private house party for you and your friends?  You can purchase that reward (which would be AWESOME).   Contribute as much or as little as you'd like, but please contribute.  Everything helps.  </p>
<p>Second, be our promotional team.  Share our Indiegogo campaign with everyone you know.  Ask them to share it with everyone they know.  Convince them to contribute.  Get your friends together and contribute.  Plan a friend's night out and get a reward with tickets to the album launch concert!  </p>
<p>Last, stay connected.  Subscribe to our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/blankcanvasband"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a> or <a href=""http://instagram.com/theblankcanvas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> We will be making regular updates throughout the campaign to let you guys know how it's going.  </p>
<p>The $3000 goal is to cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 Day of tracking (recording)</li>
<li>1 Day of Mixing</li>
<li>An assistant for 2 days in the studio</li>
