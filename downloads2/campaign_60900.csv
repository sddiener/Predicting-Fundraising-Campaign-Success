<p><strong>Uganda, East Africa August 2012</strong></p>
<p>H2O 4 ALL is traveling to Uganda, East Africa to install a clean water system at Kawolo Hospital. The Kawolo Hospital Water Project will be implemented through the partnership of Save the Mothers (Uganda, East Africa) and H2O 4 ALL (Canada).</p>
<p><br/><strong>Project Description</strong></p>
<p>H2O 4 ALL will build a Clean Water System on the grounds of the maternity ward of the Kawolo Hospital just outside of Kampala, Uganda in August 2012. The project involves the creation of 25,000 litre tanks with solar pumps, PVC piping from the tanks into the Hospital and installation of H2O 4 ALL disinfection system. The project will provide on average approximately 5,000 L of water per month for cleaning, washing and all needs of the maternity ward.</p>
<p>This clean water project is in partnership with Save the Mothers’ Mother-Friendly Health Initiative at Kawolo Hospital. The more dignity and care given to a woman, the more likely the mother will deliver her baby in a hospital or health centre. Presently in Uganda, a country with the same population as Canada, 16 women die every day from pregnancy or childbirth complications. In Canada, less than 16 women die each year from similar complications.</p>
<p><strong>The Kawolo Hospital</strong></p>
<p>The Kawolo Hospital facilities have hospital beds, mattresses, theatre operating table and delivery beds which are all broken down and now medical workers just improvise to be able to offer services. The Kawolo Hospital was built in 1968 and handles 350 outpatient cases every day and serves Buikwe, Mukono, Kayunga and Buvuma districts of Uganda. The hospital faces inadequate staff with only six doctors serving a population of more than 600,000 people.</p>
<p><strong>Impact of Kawolo Hospital Clean Water System</strong></p>
<p>Nearly every minute a mother dies from preventable pregnancy and childbirth complications! Those deaths result in a growing number of orphans, whose lives are also at risk. We believe that by saving a mother from preventable death, we are saving the person most likely to ensure the care, education and health of the next generation. Women, especially in Africa, are also major contributors to the local economy.</p>
<p>The high number of maternal deaths in some areas of the world reflects inequities in access to health services, and highlights the gap between rich and poor. Almost all maternal deaths (99%) occur in developing countries. More than half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and one third occur in South Asia.</p>
<p>H2O 4 ALL’s clean water project will reduce the likelihood of water-borne illnesses at the hospital, including dysentery, improve cleanliness and hygiene at the maternity ward, and increase the overall community health by reducing incidences of dysentery and other ailments transmitted through unclean water. The Kawolo hospital services 600,000  people.</p>

In October 2011 we had a little baby girl born 7 weeks premature. Luckily we had a good insurance and the NICU hospital bill was covered in full. Our baby weighs now 7kg and we are a happy family. This morning I read in the local newspaper about a little baby boy who was born 13 weeks premature  weighing 1,1 kg on June 17 here in Dubai. Unfortunately the parents don't have insurance and the neonatal intensive care hospital bill is already at $ 55,000. Little Yaroslav is still needing oxygen and they do not know when they will be allowed to take him home. Eventhough medical care is really good in Dubai it is really expensive as well and many people do not have an insurance. The additional problem here in Dubai is that you might end up in jail if you are not able to pay your debts . I am very thankful that I had insurance and thanks to the fantastic NICU team at a private hospital here in Dubai, UAE. I have a very healthy baby girl...the sunshine of our live.

<p>Safe and affordable clean water is the biggest challenge facing the developing world. Using an innovative technology that uses inexpensive nanomagnets, we have developed a water treatment technology that is affordable for small rural villages in regions of the developing world. </p>
<p><strong>Our Solution:</strong></p>
<p>Using the latest innovations in Physics, Chemistry, and Material Science we have created nanomaterials that can scavenge, bind, and extract contaminants from water without the use of electricity, complicated machinery, or expensive membranes. This is the first-of-its kind water treatment technology that can be effective and affordable to be used in rural areas in the developing world for removing various harmful contaminants such as industrial waste, heavy metals, and biological substances that cause waterborne illnesses.</p>

<p><strong><strong><strong>Our Vision: </strong></strong></strong></p>
<p>More than 200 million people are affected by harmful Arsenic heavy metal contamination in developing areas such as Bangladesh and parts of India. As an initial area of focus, we are modifying our water treatment technology platform to treat and remove Arsenic from drinking well water. In cooperation with the World Health Organization and other organizations, we will install ADS Arsenic water treatment systems for well water applications in rural villages at the size of ~40 families or more. For as little as $5,000, a community of 40 families in areas of Bangladesh and India can have clean water for the next 20 years, and additional operational expenses will be paid annually by the local community for less than $1 per family/per year. This is an affordable and revolutionary technology and will have the ability to provide safe and affordable clean water for millions of people. Our vision is safe water free of heavy metal contamination for millions across effected areas of Bangladesh and India.</p>

<p><strong>Why indiegogo? </strong></p>
<p>Long waiting time associated with collaborating institutions worldwide have hindered our ability to implement our technology and help people in the developing world effected by Arsenic contamination in well water such as Bangladesh and India. We are therefore hoping to use the global community to help provide rural areas of Bangladesh and India with safe affordable water. Every dollar helps! Since we plan to crowd-source funding for our water treatment technology for a number of rural communities, we are asking the indiegogo community to help us gain the necessary capital funding to save as many lives as possible. We have the resources and technology and with your help we can take this technology out of the developing stage and make this project a reality to save countless lives. </p>
<p><strong>Timeline: </strong></p>
<p>We have successfully designed and tested the ADS Arsenic removal water treatment technology and will begin building multiple systems and implementing the systems in rural villages in India and Bangladesh after the successful completion of the indiegogo project crowd-funding. We expect to deliver and install water treatment systems that can treat 3-5 gallons or more per minute (gpm), to be operational by November 2012 and we will keep our indiegogo community contributors in the loop with a quarterly email newsletter. We are expecting a 2-3 month development and implementation timeline from the closing date of the indiegogo pledge. In as little as 3 months your name could be on the long list of those actively pursuing change for the developing world. </p>
<p><strong>Our Commitment?</strong></p>
<p>With every dollar pledged, we will use every penny for direct cost of development and implementation of water systems for Arsenic removal, these systems will be developed and installed at cost. As we are a for-profit company, we pledge to provide all in-kind-support and administration support for this project and will not receive any profit above the cost of production and implementation. With ongoing collaborations we have with non-profit and for-profit institutions globally, we have water well sites already pre-screened and evaluated for proper implementation in rural villages of Bangladesh and India. We are hoping to implement at least 10 water treatment systems for at least 10 communities and with more pledge money we will implement more water treatment systems across the developing world. We have hundreds of sites where our technology can help small rural villages across multiple regions plagued by Arsenic water contamination, we therefore hope to have a positive impact to as many people as possible. </p>

with type 1 diabetes.  I was 9 years old.</p>
<p>It was a very scary time for me and my entire family.  I was freaked out at the beginning, but after all of the doctors visits/training seminars for the management of my blood glucose levels, I began to live my new life.  </p>
<p>
I definitely did not want to be treated differently because of my diabetes.  l'd have to carry all of my supplies with me all the time and I thought I would
stand out from my friends and be different. 
</p>
<p>The worst part was the bag that I was given at the hospital to carry my supplies looked like a girls purse. 
I was always leaving the bag behind. 
At home, school, and restaurants. 
I wasn't trying to leave it behind, it just happened and this was dangerous as my levels would get low and I did not have my supplies with me.</p>
<p>I searched all over to find some sort of bag that would work to carry my stuff and be cool and not make me stand out. 
I searched and searched with no luck.  In February of 2011,with a little help from my Dad, I decided to draw up my own bag.</p>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION: 
Elinates is a simple to follow, at-home workout system for beginners. Elinates combines Pilates, low - impact aerobics, Yoga, and physical therapy to help you get in shape without causing strain on your joints. VIDEO WITH A LONGER DESCRIPTION OF ELINATES: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8o4OwtuztcY&sns=fb2. LONG DESCRIPTIONElinates will be created so that absolutely everyone will have an opportunity to get a strong, lean, flexible and pain free body regardless of situation and physical challenges he or she faces. From common complaints like lack of time, exercise boredom, or too-hard-to-follow workout routines, to specifically addressing serious injuries, such as bulging disks, neck and shoulder pain, etc. which limit a person's ability to do high impact workouts, Elinates is able to combat a wide variety of issues that people face when it comes to being fit for life.Elinates is a completely low-impact, at home workout system. Low-impact workouts are defined as“Any type of aerobic exercise which promotes physical fitness but does not stress the musculoskeletal tissues and joints.” What this means, for the average person, is that Elinates has no jumping, running, squats or push – ups. While Elinates will work for everyone, those who will see the most drastic results would be people new to working out or anyone who is looking to get a strong, lean, flexible and pain free body without too much strain on their joints. IT WILL BE OFFERED IN 2 OPTIONS: Option 1: -Working out five days per week (workout schedule, nutrition guide and a separate guide with tips on how to stay on track with a diet and workout regime will be included). You will get a workout schedule with instructions on which workout to do which day. It will come with 4 mandatory workouts which you have to accomplish every week (to ensure the results) and an extra optional 5th workout which will consist of dynamic stretches (stretches done in motion) for your entire body. -Option 1 is a great choice for beginners or people who are short on time. It is designed to ease you into ElinatesOption 2: -Working out 6 days per week for 30 days. -The system will include 12 different workouts, a workout schedule, nutrition guide and a separate guide with tips on how to stay on track with a diet and workout regime. -It will include an extra 55 minutes workout which will include exercises to strengthen (tone) the core (abs, lower back, glutes & hamstrings) and extra aerobics exercises to help burn more calories. -Option 2 is a great option for people who are looking for a better challenge, want extra core work, or have a bit more time. 
BENEFITS OF ELINATES: 
1. It is completely low-impact. People with injuries or other health limitations are able to benefit from the system.2. It will help you lose weight without causing strain or impact on the joints. 3. It integrates a wide variety of exercises from physical therapy, Pilates, yoga & dancing. 4. There is no equipment required. 5.

It will teach you the basics of working out & healthy eating.8. Each exercise comes with detailed instructions and modifications so everyone can do it. 9. It comes with two different options to ensure that everyone's needs are metWhat I need your help with and production plan: In order to make Elinates happen, I need to raise funds to pay a crew to shoot the workouts, edit them and make DVD's ready for purchase. I also will need to pay for making and printing of both of the guides and workout schedules. A small amount of the funds will be used to develop a marketing plan, which will include having a professional website made and printing promotional materials.PRODUCTION PLAN: 1. All the workouts will be made and tested by July 25, 2014.2. The first drafts of all the guides (nutrition guide & the guide with tips on how to stay committed to clean eating and program) will be made by July 25, 20143. I have already found a crew to shoot and edit the videos; the DVDs will be made by September 25, 2014. 4. By November 1, 2014, the DVD's and the guides will be ready for sale (the guides will be printed and properly formatted; DVDs burned and packaged) and basic marketing will be done (the website made, YouTube channel set up, and all promotional materials printed). FINAL THOUGHTS: While I will be making Elinates, I will constantly post live updates on social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. I will also will be replying daily to all the comments and any questions you might have. Elinates is my primary focus and priority, and I will see it through to completion. Elinates has been my very long-term dream. I've spent years collecting and trying out exercises and workout techniques on myself, personal training clients, and students. All of them, including myself, have seen amazing results, ranging from weight-loss, gaining strength, to a decrease in aches and pains.Any kind of help and support will be greatly appreciated.

<p>Sixty days ago, when my sister and I were asked to create this fund on her behalf, we didn't have a clue what the crowd-funding world entailed. Not to say that our knowledge is profound now, but we now know a little bit more. We did all the right things to meet out set goal, aside from dole out a great deal of $$$ to ""share"" the word of her fund.</p>
<p>Two days before my mother's 68th birthday her site went live. We set a goal that was less than one-fourth of her medical bills at that time. It was a slow start, but the first contribution was receive less than 24 hours after it went live. Amazing!</p>
<p>You all were there to see her fight and her smile. Some of you were actually able to hear her laughter, which was the best and brings tears to my eyes every time I hear it now. Her birthday/radical mastectomy was successful, and she was operated on by the best, but ductal carcinoma being the oh-so-aggressive cancer that it is was just a little more successful. A few days past a month from her surgery, she was gone, which brings us to today – the last day of her fund. </p>
<p>Through every phase and title of her fund you all have been so very supportive. For this, my dad Carey, my sister Chelsi and I thank you from the bottom of our hearts. My mother who was beside herself when her fund hit a mere 1% funded was so appreciative and is applauding you all for contributing $4135 thus far.</p>
<p>This money covers a little over 15% of her funeral expenses, and we are extremely thankful for your kindness. </p>

<div>We are asking for $1 donation. If you can afford more and wish to give more, please feel free to do so. </div>
<div>We are here to help our dear friend Michael P recover from his crazy fall of 60ft! </div>
<div>Hiking in Utah with a small group fell and tumbled down 60ft over rocks, debris, and landscape. He endured hours of pain while a member of the group ran up the trail to call 911 - thank goodness someone did! 3-hours later, and in horrible pain, a helicopter came and took Michael to the closest hospital which was in Colorado. A few days later the only doctor who could treat broken pelvises felt that the damage was too extensive and had Michael transferred and flown to Salt Lake City, Utah. </div>
<div>
<p>After 5-hours of surgery to repair his pelvis it was explained that he had shattered <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">the right side, including the hip socket and major fractures on the ""wing"" of his pelvis. A lot of hardware </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">was placed to pull it all back together again, including four ""plates"" and a lot of screws.</span></p>
<p>After 2 weeks of post-op rehab he was moved to a skilled <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">nursing facility in. He was there for 4 weeks; however, Insurance decided on Friday </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">afternoon to discontinue his rehab treatments. So now his insurance is not covering a lot of the financial obligations.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>Michael is now at home after 4-months since the fall, recovering slowly, but continues to have symptoms of post concussive syndrome, including short term memory loss, trouble <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">with word finding, and processing issues. He is also mentally fatigued very easily, some of these are becoming easier, but there is still a long way to go.</span></p>
<p></p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Michael is working hard to recover and start to operate normally, however his finances are in trouble. </div>
<div>We are asking for $1. If you can afford and want to donate more, please feel free to do so, but we are asking for $1 and to share this to one other person.</div>
<div>Michael is an archaeologist. Because of the fall he has not been able to work and bills have been stacking high for 4-months. He needs to pay for food, rent, payback 4-months of bills, and medical bills that insurance is not covering.<br/>
</div> <p>All funds go to Michael's medical needs first and then to his other needs.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Michael is a huge part of our community in Grand Junction, Colorado. He has and is heavily involved in our community radio, inspiring others in health and nature, discovering our past and history, bring joy to those around him, and is a wonderful father and grandfather. </p>
<p>To help Michael is not just to help a man recover, but to help a community gain a friend's health back. Many of us are working together locally, and online, to bring Michael back on his feet with strength and energy: local fundraisers, radio shows to bring awareness to Michael's needs, and reaching out to hearts like yours to improve a man to help his community.</p>

We are asking for $1 donation. If you can afford more and wish to give more, please feel free to do so. 
We are here to help our dear friend Michael P recover from his crazy fall of 60ft! 
Hiking in Utah with a small group fell and tumbled down 60ft over rocks, debris, and landscape. He endured hours of pain while a member of the group ran up the trail to call 911 - thank goodness someone did! 3-hours later, and in horrible pain, a helicopter came and took Michael to the closest hospital which was in Colorado. A few days later the only doctor who could treat broken pelvises felt that the damage was too extensive and had Michael transferred and flown to Salt Lake City, Utah. 

After 5-hours of surgery to repair his pelvis it was explained that he had shattered the right side, including the hip socket and major fractures on the ""wing"" of his pelvis. A lot of hardware was placed to pull it all back together again, including four ""plates"" and a lot of screws.
After 2 weeks of post-op rehab he was moved to a skilled nursing facility in. He was there for 4 weeks; however, Insurance decided on Friday afternoon to discontinue his rehab treatments. So now his insurance is not covering a lot of the financial obligations.

Michael is now at home after 4-months since the fall, recovering slowly, but continues to have symptoms of post concussive syndrome, including short term memory loss, trouble with word finding, and processing issues. He is also mentally fatigued very easily, some of these are becoming easier, but there is still a long way to go.

   What We Need & What You Get
Michael is working hard to recover and start to operate normally, however his finances are in trouble. 
We are asking for $1. If you can afford and want to donate more, please feel free to do so, but we are asking for $1 and to share this to one other person.
Michael is an archaeologist. Because of the fall he has not been able to work and bills have been stacking high for 4-months. He needs to pay for food, rent, payback 4-months of bills, and medical bills that insurance is not covering.
 All funds go to Michael's medical needs first and then to his other needs.

  The Impact Michael is a huge part of our community in Grand Junction, Colorado. He has and is heavily involved in our community radio, inspiring others in health and nature, discovering our past and history, bring joy to those around him, and is a wonderful father and grandfather. 
To help Michael is not just to help a man recover, but to help a community gain a friend's health back. Many of us are working together locally, and online, to bring Michael back on his feet with strength and energy: local fundraisers, radio shows to bring awareness to Michael's needs, and reaching out to hearts like yours to improve a man to help his community.
It may seem like a small cause to you, but to Grand Junction, Colorado Michael means a whole lot more.
  Risks & Challenges No risks that we can think of and all the challenges are in Michael's path in recovery. You can help that path become easier.
Other Ways You Can Help

<li>
<b>The Italian Lady</b>.  In November of 2012 a retired woman from Italy came into our clinic.  She spoke broken English but indicated she had abnormal pain in her stomach.  She had been to the local emergency room and had visited another private practice provider.  The Italian lady, standing around 4 ft 3 inches, could afford no more and had no income stream to pay for further medical care.  Our doctors secured tests for her through our network and the tests indicated she had cancer.  She was treated locally and because of our referrals, care, prayer, and medical experts she is alive today.  Frequently, we receive letters or have return visits of people like the Italian lady who simply want to thank us for loving enough to provide the necessary care by listening and advocating for them.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Shot in the Gut Lady</b>.  Recently a women volunteering for us was prescribed a medicine for her condition that was simply too expensive for her.  She was distraught when she asked for prayer for this critical medicine.  With IBS she was home bound and life had become difficult.  After praying about it, and on the next day, we searched our pharmaceutical fridge.  It happened that the day before, someone, a Catholic believer from Ohio, had sent us three months of this medicine for free!  We hadn't unwrapped the package yet, but God knew.  Because this person met the criteria for our clinic, we gave the medicine to her giving her some of her old way of life back.  She now has insurance and can get the medicine more affordably.  Samaritan's Clinic was there to get her through a difficult time in her life.</li>
<li>
<b>The Insulin Lady</b>.  A muslim woman from Bangladesh came in to our clinic in desperate need of insulin.  She had become insulin resistant and was now using such an amount of insulin she could not afford to pay for even part of her prescription.  We asked if we could pray with her to receive the insulin as we didn't have what she needed and it was't very unlikely we would find the amount she needed.  The very next day a person called our clinic and said a local hospital was ending a study and wondered if we would like some insulin since we have a refrigerator.  The type and amount was EXACTLY what the insulin lady needed.  We were able to provide what she needed over the weekend.  Later our staff assisted in connecting her with a drug distribution program to help her get her required insulin for free.  She is now free of concern for her health because of our caring clinic staff.</li> <li>

Risks and Challenges

The greatest risk in our business is becoming callous.  Life can be messy and especially working with the most vulnerable and needy in society.  We are working day in and day out with people on the fringe and on the outskirts of life.  People who are working and trying to make it, who just need a boost or a stop gap measure, these are the people we want to help.  In the mix can be individuals who don't care about others or expect ongoing handouts.  We want to serve all people without judging.  We want to love without borders.

 To overcome callousness, we need to be a place of grace and love.  We need to be mentally solid, encouraging others to be better, more caring and equally sacrificial.  In group, we can serve better.  Prayer is also a priority in our clinic.  We want to offer hope by seeing bodies healed.  We also want to offer ongoing, unquenching hope, that is the hope for a better tomorrow.  This hope comes in pieces.  The providers, nurses, check-in and check-out folks need to be all over hope.  We want to provide free or low cost essentials from shampoo, soap, and toothbrushes to diapers, blankets, and wipes.  We want to pray for and encourage those hurting and sick.  We will overcome callousness because we have the hope in us.  By partnering with us you bring hope too!

What is TrueCare24?



That can be a lot to digest, so let's break it down below!

Why Are We Building TrueCare24?







We envision a world where everyone can have access to affordable and high quality care, whenever and wherever!

Doctors aren't always available right away


1/3 of people have difficulties arranging a prompt appointment with a doctor. In fact, the average wait time to see a physician in 2014 was 18.5 days.
You would never book an urgent care appointment days in advance.

Traveling to a doctor's office may be difficult


We've all been through it. Some days you can be so sick that you may not be able to travel or maybe you have some pain that restricts your commute. 
Many of us have kids, and we can't simply leave them at home alone!
What about our parents and grandparents? Many elders aren't able to travel to doctors' offices.

Emergency Rooms can be inefficient in terms of time and costs


Imagine waiting for 6 hours in an ER and realizing you didn't need an ER check up, Then you get stuck with a bill for hundreds or even thousands of dollars!
2/3rd of visits happen during non-working hours and only 13% lead to hospitalization.


What Types of Care Can TrueCare24 Provide?







Urgent Care


Our caregivers can treat injuries, illnesses, and minor skin conditions that disrupt your day.
We treat all sorts of conditions including cold & flu, allergies, sore throat, and many more! (NOTE: Some conditions are only treatable through house calls, while others can be treated both in-person as well as over our phone/video/chat support.


Primary Care
Whether it's for school, camp, or employment, our caregivers can provide vaccinations, physicals, and medical screenings.

Pediatrics
That's right, we treat adults AND children! No more sitting in a waiting room when your child is sick.

Lab Tests & Medications

Our caregivers travel with a mobile lab that provides lab results, an EKG machine, IV supplies, suture kits and splinting materials
Everything you need to get better is brought to you, including commonly prescribed medications. No more waiting in line at the pharmacy when you're sick or in pain!

<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">What is lacking to solve the cancer problem</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div class=""WordSection1"">
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">One of the most serious problems facing medicine is late detection of cancer. Experimental data from several official sources agree that the earlier cancer is detected, the <strong>greater the <a href=""http://www.crosettofoundation.org/uploads/233.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">survival</a></strong> rate (in most cases 90% to 98%). <strong>What is lacking</strong> is a cancer <strong>screening method</strong> that is effective for <strong>early cancer detection.</strong> It needs to be rapid, sensitive, inexpensive, safe and effective in early detection of all types of cancer in all organs of the body. An effective screening method should use a device that is efficient in <strong>detecting</strong>, at a low cost, reliable <strong>signals</strong> showing the <strong>start of a mutation</strong> from normal cells into cancerous cells.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">A breakthrough technology for solving the problem of cancer</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">Three-Dimensional Complete Body Screening (3D-CBS) technology makes it possible to build a medical imaging device that fits the above requirements. It is rapid, sensitive, inexpensive, safe and can <strong><a href=""http://www.unitedtoendcancer.org/doc/310.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">effectively</a></strong> detect cancer and other diseases in all organs of the body at an early, curable stage; requires a safe dose of radiation, permitting annual usage; results in improving image quality; and reduces cost to patients and their insurance company. The invention can change the clinical character of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) into a preventive one, for use in early detection of cancer and other common diseases.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">The new system is not merely an incremental improvement in the current detector as a consequence of advances in technology but a qualitative breakthrough resulting in over 400 times the efficiency of the current PET device. This advance represents a major advancement in the technology for screening for cancer and other common diseases, such as brain disorder and coronary diseases. Since cancer is the leading cause of death in people aged 45-64, this advance deserves to be funded and implemented.<br/></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri; text-decoration: underline;"">The invention</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">Crosetto's basic <strong><a href=""http://www.crosettofoundation.org/uploads/291.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">invention</a> accurately captures as many signals as possible from radiation at the lowest cost per valid signal captured </strong>and therefore permits the detection of the majority of subatomic particles from radiation. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">This invention when <a href=""http://www.crosettofoundation.org/uploads/254.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">applied</a> to the field of medicine (when radiation is combined with tumor markers) offers a new weapon (the 3D-CBS) in the fight against cancer.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">The 3D-CBS uses technology designed to accurately detect small anomalies in biological processes in all organs of the human body, at low examination cost, long before anatomical changes occur. Unlike mammograms that screen only for breast cancer by detecting an anatomical anomaly, this new technology can detect much smaller anomalies in the biological processes through use of a low-radiation complete body screening. This video summarizes the 3D-CBS technology:  <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMnHRuWo4o"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMnHRuWo4o</a></span></span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">Why the 3D-CBS is superior to other technologies</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-family: Calibri;"">It catches cancer cells at the very earliest stage when most curable.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">Compared to current 5,000 PET devices the 3D-CBS technology is over 400 times more efficient, requires only 1/30 the radiation dosage, takes only 4 minutes to examine the entire body and is 1/10 the cost.</span></strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">Dario Crosetto invented a <a href=""http://www.crosettofoundation.org/uploads/420.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">technology</a> that has been <a href=""http://www.unitedtoendcancer.org/doc/300.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">recognized</a> by top scientists and experts from FERMIlab (U.S.), CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, Universities and industry in a formal, major, public scientific review held at FERMIlab that makes possible the discovery of new subatomic particles by thoroughly analyzing over 600 million events per second (Recognition of his basic invention from world experts: <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><a href=""http://www.UnitedToEndCancer.org/doc/300.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.UnitedToEndCancer.org/doc/300.pdf</a></span>).</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">The 3D-CBS technology won the international Leonardo da Vinci <a href=""http://www.unitedtoendcancer.org/doc/61.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Competition</a> after five hours of public scrutiny (worldwide via internet) from the University of Pavia in Italy, comparing the 3D-CBS technology with projects from leading world research laboratories, cancer centers and individuals. It was also recognized valuable for early cancer detection by three international public (also webcasted) scientific reviews in <a href=""http://www.crosettofoundation.org/uploads/101.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2003</a>, <a href=""http://www.crosettofoundation.org/uploads/181.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2008</a>, <a href=""http://www.crosettofoundation.org/uploads/413.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2010</a>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri; text-decoration: underline;"">A frequent comment from the public</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;""><strong>Comments:</strong> “It is clear at this point that a greater survival rate can be obtained by detecting more accurately more signals from the tumor markers, but why is it better than detecting another signal showing a change in odor, temperature, fluorescence, conductivity, or tissue density using X-ray, CT scan, MRI, Ultrasound, etc.?”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;""><strong>Answer: </strong> “There are thousands of articles reporting experimental data that cancer grows faster than normal cells and because it grows faster it needs more nutrient, up to 70 times more than normal cells. Abnormal metabolism is an important signal related to the start of the mutation from normal cells into cancerous cells. Capturing more accurately more signals from tumor markers showing abnormal consumption of nutrient from body cells can only provide advantages in early cancer detection. There are no similar advantages from other signals.”</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 18px; font-family: Calibri;"">Edmund Burke stated:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px; font-family: Calibri;"">“<em>The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px; font-family: Calibri;"">“<em>Nobody made a greater mistake than he who did nothing because he could do only little.</em>”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;""><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px; font-family: Calibri;""><strong>II - A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;""><strong>1. The technology:</strong> Although the 3D-CBS technology relies on the same nuclear reaction as current PET (Positron Emission Tomography), unlike the 5,000 existing PET devices where most of the data from the radiation is lost because they scan only a portion of the body and can only measure the dimensions of already-formed tumors, the 3D-CBS technology is based upon a cost-effective Complete Body Screening exam measuring minimum abnormal consumption of nutrient by body cells or by detecting other anomalies,<strong> making it possible to achieve an effective early cancer detection</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">In scientific articles published in 2010, scientis recognized that my study was the ""<em><strong>First proposal for a truly 'total-body' PET system</strong>.</em>"" Before my invention manufectures of the 5,000 PET did not know a cost-effective way to accurately capture the majority of signals from tumor markers that will lower the radiation at a <strong>dose acceptable for screening (1 mSv)</strong> and that could justify the cost of covering a larger portion of the body. This has been overocme with my basic invention in particle physics combined with other inventions specifically targeted to the 3D-CBS technology that i invented after the year 2000. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">Because it captures the majority of valid signals (tumor markers) from the whole body at once, <strong>new features that before could not be envisioned are now possible.</strong> It improves by 400 times the efficiency of current PETdevices not just for the glucose tracer FDG but allows minimum abnormalities in biological processes to be seen <strong>using any of the current tumor markers</strong> (FDG, Oxygen-15, Rubidium-82, Ammonia-13, Carbon-11, Choline, more specific for prostate, etc.) and <strong>future tracers to other compounds</strong> such as protein that before could not be considered because of the inefficiency of current PET in capturing only one out of 10,000 signals emitted by the tracer.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;""><strong>This makes it effective for screening at the cellular level</strong> and elevates the accuracy (less 'false positive' and 'false negatives') of this technique above all techniques including density measuring devices such as mammograms, CT scans, etc. that can only detect tumors when hundreds of millions or billions of cells have had a morphological change.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">In addition to screening the whole body to detect cancer,<strong> the 3D-CBS can be used during the treatment phase</strong> with greater advantages than current PET which is only capable of measuring an increase or decrease in the size of a tumor, the 3D-CBS's higher efficiency can detect the smallest restart of cancerous activity. Its lower radiation permits safe frequent examinations resulting in better monitoring of treatment so that better decisions for further treatment can be made, thus increasing the chance of long term survival.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">To use the PET technology annually as a screening device, the required radioactive dose must be kept to a very small percentage of the average radiation per person from all sources in a year. In the United States the average radiation per person per year is about 3.6 mSv. Current PET requires from 10 to 16 mSv radiation dose to the patient, too high for a yearly scan. <strong>The 3D-CBS technology is designed to give good results with a safe dose of only about 0.35 mSv,</strong> the radiation received during two intercontinental flights. </span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;""><strong>2. The inventor, Dario Crosetto: </strong>I worked as a research scientist on physics experiments at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, for 17 years before joining in 1991 the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) project in Texas where I currently live. I lectured at CERN School of Computing, have published six books and 100+ articles. I received grants from the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy for approximately $1 million to pursue research in pattern recognition that breaks the speed barrier in real-time applications. In the course of my research, I realized that this technology could be used to detect a different type of matter: cancer cells. I developed and patented the 3-D Complete Body screening technology as the first step toward creating these effective early cancer-detection devices.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">I hold seven patents for the 3-D complete Body Screening technology. My goal is to make this technology a reality and seek to develop devices to help stop cancer through early detection. I have committed to donating the majority of the income from licensing my patents to provide free screening with an effective 3D-CBS device to low-income patients.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;""><strong>3. Why support the 3D-CBS breakthrough technology rather than another project?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">Because none of the millions of “cancer breakthroughs” you find using a Google search have all the following:</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;""><a name=""3D-CBS"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><strong>7.1      </strong><strong>We should ask decision makers i</strong>f they agree with the following: “<strong><em>Everyone</em></strong><em> raising or spending money to fight cancer, whether it be for a vaccine, drug, screening device, or a program to educate at risk individuals to change their lifestyle, <strong>should estimate and then provide a plan to measure the results on a sample population; </strong>for example: 10,000 people in the age group 55 to 74 taken from a location where, in the previous 20 years, the mortality rate was constant (e.g. 0.5%). <strong>A difference or no difference in the mortality rate will quantify the success or failure of the proposed solution</strong></em>.” Dario Crosetto.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;""><strong>7.2      </strong><strong>We should fund the 3D-CBS</strong> innovative technology which has provided a plan supported by scientific arguments based on an invention recognized by top scientists and experts in the field. No one can refute the superiority in cost and efficiency of the 3D-CBS technology with respect to current PET technology.  Its ability to capture hundreds of times more valid signals at a much lower cost per valid signal captured has the potential to save millions of lives by identifying the formation of the very first cancer cells <strong>for most<sup>2</sup> types of cancer, over the entire body</strong>, with a <strong>much more sensitive, low-cost exam, safe for the patient </strong>(requiring less than 1 mSv radiation dose) <strong>taking only 4 minutes</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-family: Calibri;"">If decision makers agree with the question in point 1 above, donors and taxpayers would have the comparative data necessary to make smarter choices by funding only the most valuable breakthroughs among the millions of Google citations.  This is why donors and taxpayers should demand accountability from decision makers of not only on how their money is spent but <strong>HOW they expect to achieve a reduction in cancer death and cost</strong>. The resistance of some cancer organizations to provide such a concrete plan is understandable because <strong>if the cancer problem is resolved </strong>(as I propose with a concrete intervention in Table I, Table II and Table III) <strong>their existence could end</strong>.  (<a href=""http://www.unitedtoendcancer.org/doc/411.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Read more</a> ...)</span></p>

I - SUMMARY

Would you like to reduce your risk of dying from cancer and be part of a process to save millions of lives by supporting an invention, recognized valuable by top scientists and world experts? One person dies every 5 seconds from cancer somewhere in the world.  And it is indiscriminant when choosing its victims: it strikes just as easily the powerful and the famous, the rich and the poor, the young and the old.
We launch this project to raise funds to make available the 3D-CBS breakthrough life-saving technology, an invention by research scientist Dario Crosetto, described below.
Be part of this unique solution that will prevent cancer from getting a grip on your loved ones.
Act now! support this exceptional project that will revolutionize the medical field.
What is lacking to solve the cancer problem


One of the most serious problems facing medicine is late detection of cancer. Experimental data from several official sources agree that the earlier cancer is detected, the greater the survival rate (in most cases 90% to 98%). What is lacking is a cancer screening method that is effective for early cancer detection. It needs to be rapid, sensitive, inexpensive, safe and effective in early detection of all types of cancer in all organs of the body. An effective screening method should use a device that is efficient in detecting, at a low cost, reliable signals showing the start of a mutation from normal cells into cancerous cells.
A breakthrough technology for solving the problem of cancer
Three-Dimensional Complete Body Screening (3D-CBS) technology makes it possible to build a medical imaging device that fits the above requirements. It is rapid, sensitive, inexpensive, safe and can effectively detect cancer and other diseases in all organs of the body at an early, curable stage; requires a safe dose of radiation, permitting annual usage; results in improving image quality; and reduces cost to patients and their insurance company. The invention can change the clinical character of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) into a preventive one, for use in early detection of cancer and other common diseases.
The new system is not merely an incremental improvement in the current detector as a consequence of advances in technology but a qualitative breakthrough resulting in over 400 times the efficiency of the current PET device. This advance represents a major advancement in the technology for screening for cancer and other common diseases, such as brain disorder and coronary diseases. Since cancer is the leading cause of death in people aged 45-64, this advance deserves to be funded and implemented.
 
The invention
Crosetto's basic invention accurately captures as many signals as possible from radiation at the lowest cost per valid signal captured and therefore permits the detection of the majority of subatomic particles from radiation. 
This invention when applied to the field of medicine (when radiation is combined with tumor markers) offers a new weapon (the 3D-CBS) in the fight against cancer.
The 3D-CBS uses technology designed to accurately detect small anomalies in biological processes in all organs of the human body, at low examination cost, long before anatomical changes occur. Unlike mammograms that screen only for breast cancer by detecting an anatomical anomaly, this new technology can detect much smaller anomalies in the biological processes through use of a low-radiation complete body screening. This video summarizes the 3D-CBS technology:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwMnHRuWo4o
 
Why the 3D-CBS is superior to other technologies
It catches cancer cells at the very earliest stage when most curable.
Compared to current 5,000 PET devices the 3D-CBS technology is over 400 times more efficient, requires only 1/30 the radiation dosage, takes only 4 minutes to examine the entire body and is 1/10 the cost.
The inventor
Dario Crosetto invented a technology that has been recognized by top scientists and experts from FERMIlab (U.S.), CERN, Geneva, Switzerland, Universities and industry in a formal, major, public scientific review held at FERMIlab that makes possible the discovery of new subatomic particles by thoroughly analyzing over 600 million events per second (Recognition of his basic invention from world experts: www.UnitedToEndCancer.org/doc/300.pdf).
 
Recognition of the invention
The 3D-CBS technology won the international Leonardo da Vinci Competition after five hours of public scrutiny (worldwide via internet) from the University of Pavia in Italy, comparing the 3D-CBS technology with projects from leading world research laboratories, cancer centers and individuals. It was also recognized valuable for early cancer detection by three international public (also webcasted) scientific reviews in 2003, 2008, 2010.
A frequent comment from the public
Comments: “It is clear at this point that a greater survival rate can be obtained by detecting more accurately more signals from the tumor markers, but why is it better than detecting another signal showing a change in odor, temperature, fluorescence, conductivity, or tissue density using X-ray, CT scan, MRI, Ultrasound, etc.?”
Answer:  “There are thousands of articles reporting experimental data that cancer grows faster than normal cells and because it grows faster it needs more nutrient, up to 70 times more than normal cells. Abnormal metabolism is an important signal related to the start of the mutation from normal cells into cancerous cells. Capturing more accurately more signals from tumor markers showing abnormal consumption of nutrient from body cells can only provide advantages in early cancer detection. There are no similar advantages from other signals.”
Follow up comment: “I understand, it makes sense! I want to have an exam like this and if a low cost screening of the entire body for all types of cancer in patients without symptoms but at high risk can be done effectively with the 3D-CBS technology (capturing the majority of signals from any tumor markers combined with a radioisotope) with a low level of radiation dose, comparable to a mammogram then
 cancer would be defeated once and for all!

 

Potential number of people saved by your support
You can help play a part in defeating cancer. Support this life saving, low cost, low radiation technology that is hundreds of times more efficient than current technology, that can even be used safely on asymptomatic patients so that cancer can be detected at its onset when it is most curable.
The study available at this link shows a very conservative, realistic, feasible plan on HOW with the 3D-CBS technological innovation you could greatly reduce your risk to suffer from cancer and save the life of 20,000 to 30,000 people in 10 years, 1 million to 2.3 million in 20 years, 6.2 million to 13.3 million in 30 years (estimating 50% reduction in cancer death for those screened), while reducing your burden on cancer cost (See  Table I, Table II and Table III). See Note1 at the end of this document.

II - A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION
1. The technology: Although the 3D-CBS technology relies on the same nuclear reaction as current PET (Positron Emission Tomography), unlike the 5,000 existing PET devices where most of the data from the radiation is lost because they scan only a portion of the body and can only measure the dimensions of already-formed tumors, the 3D-CBS technology is based upon a cost-effective Complete Body Screening exam measuring minimum abnormal consumption of nutrient by body cells or by detecting other anomalies, making it possible to achieve an effective early cancer detection. 
In scientific articles published in 2010, scientis recognized that my study was the ""First proposal for a truly 'total-body' PET system."" Before my invention manufectures of the 5,000 PET did not know a cost-effective way to accurately capture the majority of signals from tumor markers that will lower the radiation at a dose acceptable for screening (1 mSv) and that could justify the cost of covering a larger portion of the body. This has been overocme with my basic invention in particle physics combined with other inventions specifically targeted to the 3D-CBS technology that i invented after the year 2000. 
Because it captures the majority of valid signals (tumor markers) from the whole body at once, new features that before could not be envisioned are now possible. It improves by 400 times the efficiency of current PETdevices not just for the glucose tracer FDG but allows minimum abnormalities in biological processes to be seen using any of the current tumor markers (FDG, Oxygen-15, Rubidium-82, Ammonia-13, Carbon-11, Choline, more specific for prostate, etc.) and future tracers to other compounds such as protein that before could not be considered because of the inefficiency of current PET in capturing only one out of 10,000 signals emitted by the tracer.
This makes it effective for screening at the cellular level and elevates the accuracy (less 'false positive' and 'false negatives') of this technique above all techniques including density measuring devices such as mammograms, CT scans, etc. that can only detect tumors when hundreds of millions or billions of cells have had a morphological change.
In addition to screening the whole body to detect cancer, the 3D-CBS can be used during the treatment phase with greater advantages than current PET which is only capable of measuring an increase or decrease in the size of a tumor, the 3D-CBS's higher efficiency can detect the smallest restart of cancerous activity. Its lower radiation permits safe frequent examinations resulting in better monitoring of treatment so that better decisions for further treatment can be made, thus increasing the chance of long term survival.
To use the PET technology annually as a screening device, the required radioactive dose must be kept to a very small percentage of the average radiation per person from all sources in a year. In the United States the average radiation per person per year is about 3.6 mSv. Current PET requires from 10 to 16 mSv radiation dose to the patient, too high for a yearly scan. The 3D-CBS technology is designed to give good results with a safe dose of only about 0.35 mSv, the radiation received during two intercontinental flights. 
At the following links you can find the history and the key features of the basic invention, a simple description of the 3D-CBS technology and a bibliography of Crosetto's most relevant publications on this subject.

2. The inventor, Dario Crosetto: I worked as a research scientist on physics experiments at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, for 17 years before joining in 1991 the Superconducting Super Collider (SSC) project in Texas where I currently live. I lectured at CERN School of Computing, have published six books and 100+ articles. I received grants from the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy for approximately $1 million to pursue research in pattern recognition that breaks the speed barrier in real-time applications. In the course of my research, I realized that this technology could be used to detect a different type of matter: cancer cells. I developed and patented the 3-D Complete Body screening technology as the first step toward creating these effective early cancer-detection devices.
I hold seven patents for the 3-D complete Body Screening technology. My goal is to make this technology a reality and seek to develop devices to help stop cancer through early detection. I have committed to donating the majority of the income from licensing my patents to provide free screening with an effective 3D-CBS device to low-income patients.
3. Why support the 3D-CBS breakthrough technology rather than another project?
Because none of the millions of “cancer breakthroughs” you find using a Google search have all the following:
3.1   A well known invention recognized as valuable in a one-of-a-kind international public scientific reviews by top scientists and experts from FERMIlab, CERN, Universities and industries. 

There has been no similar case in history where the Director of one of the most prestigious world research laboratories requested and gathered top scientists and experts from all over the world to determine whether an invention could be a turning point in the discovery of new particles.  Afterwards its value was officially recognized as “a unique concept” having the potential for “clever uses not now possible.”
A conspicuous record documenting the discussions between inventor and top leaders in the field (from academia, industry and cancer organizations) that shows the superiority and advantages of this invention compared to other approaches.
The undeniable evidence of the advantages of my invention whose concept can be explained in simple terms understandable to high school students. (See how they solve the problem of analyzing in 30 seconds data from envelopes arriving every 6 seconds without missing any envelopes. Watch the video1 at minute 7:55 and video 2)
3.2  A high technological innovation. The key parts have been built in functional modular hardware that can easily migrate to future technologies.
3.3  A revolution  in the medical field. (Read more…)
3.4  A life-saving project. If the market for mammograms, CT scans, current PET, etc. was created with the intention and the justification that they would save lives, one can expect that the 3D-CBS which is hundreds of times more efficient than all the above listed devices would save more lives. (Read more…)
(Read additional questions/answers. Find out more why this project has all that is necessary to be successful)
 
4. THE IMPACT: What you and the public will get in return. (Read more...)
5. What is the inventor’s (Dario Crosetto) track record? 
On several occasions I have had discussions with leaders in particle physics and in medical applications who were first skeptical of my claims, but who later had to recant when their own results proved my statements correct. (Read more...)
6. Why is the cancer problem still not solved? (Read more...)
6.1. What people in the cancer business do not want you to know (Read more...)
6.2. Difficulty deciding to trust one person over another among thousands of people promoting different cancer causes (Read more...)
7. What can we do to stop this failing trend of postponing cancer death reduction? 
7.1      We should ask decision makers if they agree with the following: “Everyone raising or spending money to fight cancer, whether it be for a vaccine, drug, screening device, or a program to educate at risk individuals to change their lifestyle, should estimate and then provide a plan to measure the results on a sample population; for example: 10,000 people in the age group 55 to 74 taken from a location where, in the previous 20 years, the mortality rate was constant (e.g. 0.5%). A difference or no difference in the mortality rate will quantify the success or failure of the proposed solution.” Dario Crosetto.
7.2      We should fund the 3D-CBS innovative technology which has provided a plan supported by scientific arguments based on an invention recognized by top scientists and experts in the field. No one can refute the superiority in cost and efficiency of the 3D-CBS technology with respect to current PET technology.  Its ability to capture hundreds of times more valid signals at a much lower cost per valid signal captured has the potential to save millions of lives by identifying the formation of the very first cancer cells for most2 types of cancer, over the entire body, with a much more sensitive, low-cost exam, safe for the patient (requiring less than 1 mSv radiation dose) taking only 4 minutes.
If decision makers agree with the question in point 1 above, donors and taxpayers would have the comparative data necessary to make smarter choices by funding only the most valuable breakthroughs among the millions of Google citations.  This is why donors and taxpayers should demand accountability from decision makers of not only on how their money is spent but HOW they expect to achieve a reduction in cancer death and cost. The resistance of some cancer organizations to provide such a concrete plan is understandable because if the cancer problem is resolved (as I propose with a concrete intervention in Table I, Table II and Table III) their existence could end.  (Read more ...)
8. How can we work together to make THE difference and save many lives?
8.1. What am I bringing to the table and what I am asking you to bring to the table to defeat cancer? (Read more...)
8.1.1. I am bringing to the table the following to solve the cancer problem:

My documentation showing that I have been serving for over 20 years the scientific truth to the benefit of mankind. 
My commitment to continue to serve you in submitting pertinent and legitimate technical questions to decision makers that are in your interest and prod them into fulfilling their responsibilities of the mandate that they received from you. (Read more...)
The Benefits from my inventions which I have already described in this document.
The proof that I put you before any personal gain for myself. (Read more...)
Eighty per cent from the income from licensing the patents of my invention to benefit humanity. I will donate those funds to programs that will reduce cancer deaths and costs and provide free 3D-CBS examinations for low-income patients.
8.1.2. I am asking you to bring to the table to solve the cancer problem:

Your interest and responsibility in reading what may affect your health and your pocket with a cancer burden of $850 per person per year in an industrialized country. (Note2).
Your contribution (Read more...)
Your sharing this information. (Read more...)
 8.2. What has been done so far, what remains to be done?
The breakthrough technology recognized valuable from top world scientists and experts in the field has been proven to be feasible and functional in hardware. When compared publicly in scientific reviews has shown superiority in efficiency and lower cost to all other technologies and approaches. This can provide a high impact in reducing cancer death and cost. Over 8,000 people have signed a petition and with this support, I have been your advocate engaging in a dialogue with the decision makers in advancing a) the rule of law, b) the laws of nature (science) and c) the ""golden rule"". What remains to be done is your support to this dialogue (extending it from 8,000 to 8 million or more through social networks) that would analyze the answers received from decision makers so that the three areas (a, b, c) mentioned above can prevail in order to advance the progress and support the construction of 3D-CBS prototypes and start saving lives.
I remember the email that I received from the Associate Director of Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), General Chairman of the 2003 Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference, who stated: “you should not be discouraged nor feel despair. Your persistence will win,[…]. Failure will only result if you quit, and you were right after all.” (Read more…)

Note1 - DISCLAMER: No initial prototype has been built for this device. The crowd-funding effort seeks to begin the process of creating the necessary working prototypes. FDA approval will be necessary to utilize this device to detect cancer. FDA approval can only be sought after construction and testing of the prototypes. The projections regarding lives that could be saved are based upon the study, results from simulation of different parts of the system, predictive modeling and the scientific and technological assumptions which lead to the above estimated figures. The next step is to build three prototypes to confirm this study and these estimates with measurements as described in Section 7.1.
Note2 - DThe $850 annual average cancer cost per person for people in an industrialized country has been calculated by dividing the United States cancer cost in 2010 of $263.8 billion (http://www.cancer.org/acs/groups/content/@epide...) by its population of 308 million.

Her pain is now so bad that she can no longer work, can’t walk more than half a block at a time, and is on pain medications around the clock. 
 

 
 
Lisa is normally a very active person. She is way too young to be relegated to a life of pain.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lisa can have the operation done in Costa Rica for $28,000 plus expenses, which is much cheaper than in the U.S. while still offering quality surgeons who can give her a high chance of a successful surgery. Lisa has managed to pull together only half the amount she needs, and now she desperately needs your help to get the rest as soon as possible.  








 

 
 
 
With your help, we're going to get Lisa back into the swing!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We miss her laughter. Please help our wonderful friend Lisa get her life back! 

 
What is osteoarthritis?
Osteoarthritis of the hip is a disease that wears away the cartilage between the femoral head and the acetabulum, eventually causing the two bones to scrape against each other, raw bone on raw bone. When this happens, the joint becomes pitted, eroded and uneven. The result is pain, stiffness and instability, and in some cases, motion of the leg may be greatly restricted.
 

Patients with osteoarthritis often develop large bone spurs, or osteophytes, around the joint, further limiting motion.
Osteoarthritis is a common, degenerative disease, and although it most often occurs in patients over the age of 50, it can occur at any age, especially if the joint is in some way damaged.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Oral fungal infections are common in AIDS and Cancer patients. The symptoms include painful ulcerations, redness and swelling in the mouth which is often hidden by an overgrowth of Candida.

<p>In Canada and the USA, an estimated 400,000 patients suffer from oral mucositis associated with cancer treatment (75%-100% of patients receiving higher doses of chemotherapy).

<p>The extent of complications of oral mucositis is much greater in Africa and other developing countries where HIV-AIDS is epidemic.  There are over 30,000,0000 infected patients in Africa alone.  The poorer sanitary conditions results in a greater incidence of the disease.</p>
<p>Many products are available which have relatively poor results. These products consist of many anti fungal products and oral solutions. These antifungal agents are very expensive to both the patients and hospital budgets.  Acquisition, preparation and administration costs are high. The results are limited and must be repeated often.  In most cases these antifungal, both topical and systemic have very poor activity against Krucera, a major Candida strain. Our new patented mouth wash has been shown to be the most effective.  Laboratory studies have shown that the solution not only stops but lyses (kills) this strain.

He had to have major brain surgery on the right side of the brain to remove a large clot around the size of 9 cm. The doctor who operated on him is one of the best brain surgeons in India. He definitely was taken good care of in the surgery but that still doesn't mean things turn out perfectly. He has now been in a coma for 7 days so far. He is in the intensive care unit ( ICU) at the Galaxy Hospital in Goa, India. There was a moment where we thought he wouldn't make it through the night but he did..because he is a very strong healthy young man and I'm sure he is fighting as hard as he can to come back to all of us. He is breathing with the help of a ventilator at the moment. We still see no response from the brain in the way of his pupils reacting or any of his motor functions. We are all hoping that time will heal this. As we know hospital bills add up and after a brain surgery as complicated as his the expenses are going to be large. We all need to see his smile again. He has one of the most contagious smiles and genuine charismatic characters. It's impossible to not love him. His parents, his brother, his girlfriend of 5 years, and all his friends are going through the hardest moments of their lives. We all wish we could do more to help him but we all feel quite helpless. All we can do is be patient, positive and don't lose hope.This money that will hopefully be raised will go towards the surgery, also for all the hospital charges that are increasing day by day, and for his rehabilitation process. Also being in the ICU for so many days on end is quite an expense as well. Any amount of money will be greatly appreciated. Thank you all for your love and support towards this cause.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are on a mission to bring novel solutions to people who wish to be active and pursue their sports and activities with greater comfort and stability.PigaONE is the first minimalist footwrap for barefoot activities that snugly support your arch, improve your posture and overall performance.We invite you to learn more about this new category of footwear and contribute what you can to make it happen. Informed and committed, we are all in this together!We did it. We invented the first non-skid sole footwrap that’s infused with our gentle yet effective arch-support patent-pending technology — that truly supports you to build stronger, healthier feet – for improved sports performance and well-being. We did it because too many people need to feel safely grounded, balanced or even relieved from sore feet while engaging in barefoot sports and activities.But we need your help to bring PigaONE into the market and on your feet. Grip socks and other non-skid sole barefoot footwear were until now the go-to option for your favorite barefoot sport or activity. PigaONE is a natural solution to help you stay in control and maintain your balance while engaging in barre, Pilates, yoga, dance, SUP, martial arts, as well as a tool for post-activity recovery, help you stay comfortably on your feet all day; whether at the studio, the gym, on land and even on the water.Our feet are the most used, and probably the least taken care of part of the body. If the muscles of the feet aren’t working properly to hold the bones of the feet, then nothing stacked above is aligned correctly either. A lot is going on when people train barefoot: improperly balanced and supported feet affect the whole body - not to mention heavy legs, sweaty feet and other injuries that may hamper your trainings, and make your sports suffer. We took care of all of that when designing PigaONE. There are greener pastures with PigaONE, a breakthrough in barefoot footwear that supports your active lifestyle (and of course your feet). Created with the foot in mind, from the heels and toes right down to the muscles and tendons, PigaONEs aren’t meant to just protect and keep you securely grounded. It stays busy by also stabilizing and supporting your feet while providing light compression that stays put while you move, take care of your sweaty feet and even foot injuries that may sometimes hamper your trainings.PigaONE integrates the dual action PostureForce© System combining the foot-strengthening arch-support technology + adjustable heel foot positioning attachment.Infused with this gentle yet effective arch-support patent-pending technology, PigaONE provides perfect stability and control that builds from the inside-out. It’s surprisingly easy to improve your foot strength while wearing PigaONE and to amplify the benefits of your favorite barefoot activity. Now you can effortlessly let PigaONE do the work while you train and perform to your full potential.It's like a slip-on teacher that educates your feet to work properly, and the best part is that you get to keep the gains you've made once you take them off.It’s barefoot, but better.At PIGA, we are on a mission to create smart footwear that shapes to your foot and feels barefoot at the same time!   We wanted to create a fully supportive and adjustable footwrap that would surpass what’s on the market today. We were fully determined to offer you a new option with our unprecedented barefoot footwrap that would truly bring your barefoot sports to another level. Your body does the work, thanks to the built-in PostureForce technology of PigaONE that improves its innate ability to engage postural reflexes during barefoot activities thru neuromuscular activation.  The neuromuscular foot activation power of PigaONE works by stimulating the plantar arch of the foot thru proprioception. Nerve endings in this part of the foot are responsible for transmitting stimuli to the brain. The stimulation provided by PigaONE triggers the body’s intrinsic balance system, modifying the center of gravity to its optimal position. PIGA is a new category of product introducing flexible arch support that work quite the contrary to traditional arch supports that are frequently prescribed to reduce foot pain. By pushing deeply into the arch of the foot, these prevent the muscles and ligaments from being stretched (and moving freely) and thus do reduce the pain but they can weaken the muscles and ligaments in the feet.  On the contrary, the supportive design and non-intrusive flexible and adjustable arch support gently stimulates the arch of your feet to build the internal muscles from within, and the best part is that you get to keep the gain you've made even when you take them off.At first, PigaONE was designed with Yoga and Pilates practitioners in mind. The team started by putting all the substitute footwear and socks on the table and improved on all the important aspects of what people would want to find in a barefoot sports footgear: support, compression, grippyness, comfort, washability, versatility.We started to develop the outer shell of PigaONE first, as it had to be able to perfectly be designed not only to integrate the extra features but to also the novel patent-pending flexible and adjustable arch-support system.The PigaONE team spent the last 2 years carefully engineering and validating the flexible arch-support patent-pending technology that powers it. Together with it's unique design, it enables you to dynamically adjust your feet position and gently anchor them on the ground. The result is better balance and stability, for a practice that's well grounded and in control. We did a clinical trial which demonstrated that 90% of participants had improved balance while wearing PigaONE. Improving weight bearing points positioning of the feet on the ground meant better floor anchoring and reduced oscillation of the center of gravity. The upper body result is less energy loss and compensation while maintaining balance that leads to better movement availability and amplitude as well as enhanced global posture.Below are videos demonstrating the contact surface area of the feet on the ground while walking – the first one barefoot and the second one while wearing PigaONE (this analysis used Win-Track, a gate-analysis plate).You will notice that video 2 shows an improvement of weight-bearing are of the feet while wearing PigaONE, which means improved contact-surface with the ground (low contact look blue, while higher contact-surface look red).Video 1 - BarefootVideo 2 - Wearing PigaONE

 
This entrepreneurial women-made story started with Sandra, PigaONE’s founder, and dedicated ambassador. Sandra tried just about every barefoot footwear to stay safely grounded, balanced and relieve her sore feet to improve her Pilates practice. But with sweaty feet, heavy legs, and plantar fasciitis, she couldn’t find any footwear that truly felt barefoot - so she invented it.Sandra started in 2015 and spent the next 2 years developing PigaONE. She and her team created 18 prototypes before they found the perfect design. Along the way, Sandra met Julie the podiatrist, and soon to be close friend. Together, Sandra and Julie developed the arch-support technology behind PigaONE. The product has undergone rigorous product validation with yoga and pilates practitioners.Once the product was finished, Julie ran a clinical trial in 2016 with a small group of women to confirm the efficacy of PigaONE. With the overwhelming success of the clinical trial helping 90% of participants, Julie and Sandra are now releasing PigaONE to everyone!Although we have reached our initial financial goal, our mission is far from over. Every extra penny will be used to accelerate the development of other supportive barefoot footwear and carry out further testing of the efficiency and application of our flexible and adjustable arch-support patent-pending technology.PigaONE is the first of a series of revolutionary barefoot balance activation systems to be created by Sandra and Julie. They are on a mission to offer smart footwear that shapes to your foot and feels barefoot at the same time. They are currently actively developing two other products for barefoot athletes. PigaONE is available in 5 sizes ranging from women’s 5 – 11.5 and men’s 7 – 12.5 (US sizes).We recommend to go a size up if you have wide feet, and to go size down if you have narrow feet. Here are 2 examples:1) Mary wears a size US 6 and has wide feet, so she chooses size US 7 (M - medium)2) Bob wears a size US 12 and has narrow feet, so he chooses size US 11 (XXL - xxlarge)",37.0,2,"1 Campaign

ORMUS is a special product, there is no other product like it. And it needs to be protected. Miron glass is the only glass in the world that blocks the entire spectrum of light frequency. This protection is so important because the ORMUS is a solution of monatomic minerals in their high-spin state. But over time direct contact to light can put them back into their regular-spin state.

Double blind means that there will be a control group and an experimental group in this study. The control group will receive the ORMUS and the experimental group will receive a placebo so that we can be 100% sure that the healing benefits received from the ormus are completely proven and legitimate.

However, before enough ORMUS can be collected to be used as a dietary supplement it needs to be concentrated from these sources. </p><p>*It takes 12 gallons of ocean water just to collect 1 tablespoon of pure ORMUS!</p><h4><b><br/></b></h4><h4><b>HOW DO WE MAKE ORMUS?  </b></h4><p><b></b></p><p></p><p></p><p><b>Step 1:</b> We combine pure Dead Sea salt with naturally occurring spring water. <br/></p><ul><li>The Dead Sea is the most well known source for something called activated silica, which is what contains the ORMUS. This makes the Dead Sea the best source for collecting pure ORMUS. It takes 30 gallons of Dead Sea salt water to collect just 1 liter of pure ORMUS!<br/>
</li></ul><p><b>Step 2:</b> We increase the pH naturally using what in alchemy is known as ""The wet method"". <br/></p><ul><li>By increasing the pH in an all natural way using a food grade compound of hydrogen and oxygen, we separate the ORMUS from the activated silica in the Dead Sea salt water solution. The ORMUS naturally settles at the bottom of the water, allowing us to concentrate it.<br/>
</li></ul><p></p><p><b>Step 3: </b>We remove the left over sodium and water. <br/></p><ul><li>By washing ultra-filtered water through the ORMUS we are able to remove any sodium that is left over from the Dead Sea salt water. This purifies the ORMUS, concentrating it even further. This process is extremely important and takes an entire month!</li></ul><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><h4><b>A LITTLE ABOUT PRESCOTT LOVE:</b></h4><p>I grew up in Rochester, New York. At 18 I joined the Air Force because I wanted to take part in protecting our nation and those nations that we can help. I then Attended the University of Arizona where I studied Chemistry and Psychology, graduating with a Bachelor of Science. Initially I wanted to be a Psychiatrist, I really just wanted to help bring balance into people's lives and thought prescription drugs were the best way to do it, but I had gained information by my senior year of college that made me no longer comfortable prescribing prescription drugs on such a large scale. I started to understand that for the majority of people a more natural and holistic approach would not only be more beneficial, but also safer. I switched my focus to therapy and began counseling at a residential treatment center for adults with addictions and eating disorders, and had been studying natural ways of medicinal therapy such as Ayurveda, and Chinese medicine. I was finding that so many things that grow naturally contain exactly what people need to help them find the balance and harmony they were seeking in a healthy, non-dependance inducing way. </p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>ABOUT ORMUS:</b></p><p>During this time I came across something known as ORMUS. I found that millions of dollars had gone into studying ORMUS and that it's list of benefits are virtually endless. Some of these benefits include: </p><p></p><ol>
<li>Balancing the left and right hemispheres of the brain</li>
<li>Increasing brain capacity</li>
<li>Repairing DNA</li>
<li>Third eye opening</li>
</ol>If you think about just these four benefits, you see that ORMUS can help with so many disorders, like ADD &amp; ADHD, depression, anxiety, addictions, OCD, PTSD, eating disorders, and more. ORMUS can help with any disorder that involves an unbalance in one's thinking and ways of behavior.  ORMUS can also help with skin and hair growth and repair, which I have seen personally. It also increases brain activity, helping to alleviate blindsides in our own consciousness. You might say it helps to wake us up. I started having colorful, lucid dreams after just a couple of weeks using it. I also started to see my actions an non-actions so much more clearly, as well as where my actions/hesitations were coming from. This allowed me to have an even greater ability to shape my own character. Anybody with a desire to live fully will benefit from this. In this way, it helps people create the higher version of themselves, helps with manifesting, and connecting with our own inner truths as well as with the people around us. It is like taking the subconscious and moving it into consciousness. It shows us how much power we really have over our own thought, which we start to see, is our power. This can help people in the clinical psychology setting by showing them how much power over their own reality they actually have, because our subconscious plays a huge role in the world that has shaped around us. ORMUS helps to show people that we live in the present, not in the past. When we start to understand this we see that we can move on from tough or traumatic experiences without allowing them to continually haunt us. And if we don't have tough or traumatic experiences to move on from, imagine the leap forward that a healthy happy individual can take with this new heightened awareness. ORMUS helps us manifest an even greater, more positive lifestyle than we are already living. It can bring us even closer to enjoying the moment, and give us an even greater understanding of happiness and fulfillment. Which is why it is not necessary one use ORMUS for the rest of their life, once we have a deep understanding of this fulfillment, it does not leave us, but only momentarily, and the greater our understanding is the shorter and more far between these moments are. I have experienced all of these benefits myself, and that is why I am so passionate about sharing this with the world. My hearing was degenerated from my time in the Air Force, and after a couple of months with ORMUS I suddenly realized that my hearing had gotten a lot better. I gave the ormus to my mother and she told me she could see more clearly without her glasses on. She has been using glasses since I was born. And no, the ormus has not given her 20x20 vision, but it had definitely helped. ORMUS also helps with deep, restful sleep. Just after a week of using ormus I started to get very colorful lucid dreams. This is because ORMUS helps to decalcify the Pineal gland. The Pineal gland is one of the most important parts of our body, but also one of the least understood by the general public. It is responsible for DMT, melatonin, and serotonin production and regulation. This is HUGE because DMT is responsible for our dream state, which is not only active while we are asleep it is also active while we are awake and largely responsible for our ability to manifest, because before we can manifest anything, we have to see it clearly in our mind. Serotonin is responsible for mood patterns and melatonin is responsible for sleep patterns. All of these also work together to create energy and deep rest. So as you can imagine, having a healthy and fully functional Pineal gland is pinnacle to living a healthy, happy, balanced life. But chemicals and ""junk"", such as processed foods, cause a calcification of material around the pineal gland which renders it less functional in our bodies. This is making people less aware, in a sense one could say that calcification of the Pineal gland dumbs us down. Fluoride is extremely detrimental to the Pineal gland because of how it forms a crust around it, reducing its ability to make and excrete DMT, serotonin, and melatonin. But doctors don't tell us this, they just give us prescription drugs. Fluoride is found abundantly in tap water, and even bottled water. Brita filters do not remove Fluoride. In fact, it is only the activated alumina filters that remove Fluoride, which is the type of filter I use when making ORMUS. Sure reverse osmosis filters remove Fluoride, but they also remove every mineral in the water, making the water highly reactive and causing it to demineralize our bones when we drink it. This is why I do not drink Reverse Osmosis water, but let's just stick to ORMUS for now. So, as we can see, the benefits of ORMUS are broad, encompassing almost everything a person could use help with. Some of my customers are A-list actors who have told me they find the ORMUS helps them tap into character right away rather than after 2 or 3 takes. I also have beauty pageant winners who have taken it before presenting themselves to the judges because of the way it brings them into the present moment, and allows them to open up to, and connect with others. I have also had very busy office workers tell me about how it has allowed them to remain calm and focused amongst and increasing flow of work load, helping them to be way more efficient in the office. For the most part, everybody who has used my ORMUS has noticed an amazing increase in synchronistic experiences and divine timing.  <p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p><b>WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?:</b></p><p>The goal of Prescott &amp; Love Alchemy is to help people towards physical, psychological and spiritual excellence. We want to bring you balance and satisfaction with life in an all natural way that will not be dependance inducing and will last you the rest of your life. </p><p>*Here's the problem...</p><p>We now have <b>1</b> in ever <b>4</b> women ages 50 to 64 found on antidepressants, <b>13% </b>Americans<b> </b>are also on antidepressants, <b>17%</b> are being prescribed antibiotics, and <b>13%</b> are on painkilling opioids. That is nearly <b>70%</b> of the population on prescription drugs! Psychiatric medication is up nearly <b>400%</b> in the last ten years!!!  This is not the way towards balance and happiness, but the problem is that pharmaceutical companies aren't concerned with our happiness, they are concerned with the well-being of their MASSIVE corporation! They have thousands of employees to pay and billions just to cover in bills... Which means they need customers... And unfortunately, their customers are YOU! Did you know that pharmaceutical companies are funding healthcare and paying the hospitals? This is really, really bad for us. This means that it is the pharmaceutical companies actually PAYING hospitals to keep people on their prescription drugs! The statistics I mentioned early are not decreasing, they are increasing. And with the current scheme continuing nearly <b>90%</b> of all Americans will be put on harmful prescription drugs in the next 10 years, and many of these drugs are not only dependance inducing, but will also drain the body so much that they will only weaken the immune system causing us to keep coming back to the pharmaceutical companies for more drugs. Are you aware that the percentage of children between the age of 6-12 are placed on prescription drugs for a disorder that has been invented by the pharmaceutical companies known as ADD &amp; ADHD? At age 6 I was one of those children... I no longer use prescription medication and spent years fighting dependance it had given me as a child! Currently <b>5.1%</b> of children in America between the age of 6-12 are put on Ritalin or Adderall for ADD &amp; ADHD. Ritalin and Adderall are virtually the same thing, they just have different names, the pharmaceutical companies do this with nearly all of their drugs to keep the public interested and to keep sales high. Here is the scary thing about putting these young children on Ritalin and Adderall, these drugs have the same active compound as <b>METHAMPHETAMINE</b>! These drugs were invented by the Japense millitary in World War II for use in their fighter pilots. Their pilots would not sleep for days on these drugs and continued to reload their plains with ammunition and go right back up to blowing people out of the sky... Now the Government is allowing these drugs to be prescribed to children who are naturally ""hyper-active"", with the claim that it effects them in the ""opposite"" way it would effect a ""normal"" child. This is very sad, and very dangerous. The pharmaceutical companies having such power over health care are the cause of hundreds of disorders being invented just so hospitals can put people on their drugs. </p><p>Prescott &amp; Love Alchemy says ""NO"". We say it is not drugs that you need, but balance. Drugs will only knock a person even further out of balance, but ORMUS brings us deeper into balance. Prescott &amp; Love Alchemy wants to put the word out, and to truly heal people, for true longevity and vitality; for true, permanent happiness and health. To remind people who have lost that sense of their inner self what it feels like to be truly whole, and happy again, as they once were. Not just keep them coming back like is seen with pharmaceutical companies. </p><h4>HOW YOU CAN HELP US!</h4><p>Currently there are many tonic bars, juice bars, spas and health food markets, such as Wholefoods and Erewhon who want to start providing people with our ormus. But we do not have the funds to match this demand. We need your help. Please donate and help us share the gift of balance and heightened consciousness. Please help us educate the public on ORMUS and natural ways to achieve and maintain balance for true happiness and longevity. And please share our campaign with as many people as possible! ORMUS can help people with depression, anxiety, ADD &amp; ADHD, and so many other ""disorders"" that the pharmaceutical companies have invented! It can help rebalance the left and right brain hemispheres. I can help anyone who has a demanding job or lifestyle step up their game!

<p></p></div>","WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT!*Millions of dollars have gone into researching this long kept secret*Proven to reduce stress & anxiety*Proven to increase focus & awareness*Naturally balances mood and sleep patterns*Absolutely NO crash *Repairs your skin, hair, nails, and even helps with hearing eye sight *Helps to bring colorful and lucid dreams*Safe and effective with NO side effects *Can be used everyday as often as you like  Help us bring ORMUS to you!We need $21,000 USD to get the secret of ORMUS out into the public and over to you. ORMUS has helped a ton of people who not only come back for more, but end up buying bottles for friends and family. But currently it is only sold through our website, and we need your support to get ORMUS into the public and out to you! Here is the first three phases where the money will go...PHASE 1: Packaging. This includes miron glass bottles and professionally designed labels. Why Miron glass? ORMUS is a special product, there is no other product like it. And it needs to be protected. Miron glass is the only glass in the world that blocks the entire spectrum of light frequency. This protection is so important because the ORMUS is a solution of monatomic minerals in their high-spin state. But over time direct contact to light can put them back into their regular-spin state. Miron glass maintains the integrety of the ORMUS over extended periods of time!                                                               BEFORE                                                                                                                                                                            AFTER                     
Price: $6KPHASE 2: Sampling & product demonstrations. Once we have passed phase 1 we can begin phase 2 which includes sampling and product demonstrations at farmers markets! In phase 2 we will use the money received to purchase half ounce, disposable sample packs for ORMUS. This will help us bring the ORMUS to you and share it with the world.
Price: $4.5KPHASE 3: Lab testing. In phase 3 we will use all of the money received to get our ORMUS tested in the laboratory so that we can put the exact concentration of elements and minerals on the label! We have also made arrangements with the Cleveland Clinic, one of the top clinics in the world, for testing our ORMUS on dermatology patients in a double blind clinic study! Double blind means that there will be a control group and an experimental group in this study. The control group will receive the ORMUS and the experimental group will receive a placebo so that we can be 100% sure that the healing benefits received from the ormus are completely proven and legitimate. This study will be documented in ORMUS history by the head of dermatology at the Cleveland clinic! Price: $6.5KPHASE 4: Branding & Marketing. Our final phase is about the overall package and educating materials for ORMUS. We need your help to put together a professional, attractive and educational website, trademarking our logo and company name, and build a very simple but very educational documentary on the history or ORMUS, how it was discovered, and its incredible ability to relieve anxiety & stress, while simultaneously increasing alertness and focus.Price: $4K WHO IS ORMUS FOR?ORMUS is for everyone interested in living a rich, full, inspired, self-aware, balanced and happy lifestyle! *Actors - Star actor Jeremy Piven buying his first bottle of ORMUS! Jeremy gave us GREAT feedback!                               *Athletes - Head trainers and Crossfit champions at BRICK Crossfit discovering the magic of ORMUS!                              *Employees - Whole Foods employee Tyler buying his first bottle of ORMUS!

This photo was taken at Erewhon Natural Health Foods Market in Los Angeles. With your help the Erewhon Market will have ORMUS too!                              *Everyone - We had so much fun with an ORMUS bar at our event held in congress woman Marianne Williamson's honor(to my left). At the ORMUS bar we had Rose ORMUS, Blue Lotus ORMUS, and sugar free, all natural, delicious, healthy Smores ORMUS made with organic cinnamon bark extract, organic marshmallow root, and Organic Cacao powder. Everyone felt amazing!                                                                                                                                     WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO TAKE ORMUS?ORMUS is great for important meetings, meditations, dates or hangouts with friends and family, exercise, yoga, work, exams, or anything that involves focus, alertness, and energy! WHERE DOES ORMUS COME FROM? There are trace amounts of ORMUS in raw living things, such as vegetables. But these things have such a small amount that they can not be considered a reliable source. ORMUS is also found in volcanic ash, sea water, naturally occurring spring waters, and the soils surrounding them. However, before enough ORMUS can be collected to be used as a dietary supplement it needs to be concentrated from these sources. *It takes 12 gallons of ocean water just to collect 1 tablespoon of pure ORMUS!HOW DO WE MAKE ORMUS?  Step 1: We combine pure Dead Sea salt with naturally occurring spring water. The Dead Sea is the most well known source for something called activated silica, which is what contains the ORMUS. This makes the Dead Sea the best source for collecting pure ORMUS. It takes 30 gallons of Dead Sea salt water to collect just 1 liter of pure ORMUS!
Step 2: We increase the pH naturally using what in alchemy is known as ""The wet method"". By increasing the pH in an all natural way using a food grade compound of hydrogen and oxygen, we separate the ORMUS from the activated silica in the Dead Sea salt water solution. The ORMUS naturally settles at the bottom of the water, allowing us to concentrate it.
Step 3: We remove the left over sodium and water. By washing ultra-filtered water through the ORMUS we are able to remove any sodium that is left over from the Dead Sea salt water. This purifies the ORMUS, concentrating it even further. This process is extremely important and takes an entire month!A LITTLE ABOUT PRESCOTT LOVE:I grew up in Rochester, New York. At 18 I joined the Air Force because I wanted to take part in protecting our nation and those nations that we can help. I then Attended the University of Arizona where I studied Chemistry and Psychology, graduating with a Bachelor of Science. Initially I wanted to be a Psychiatrist, I really just wanted to help bring balance into people's lives and thought prescription drugs were the best way to do it, but I had gained information by my senior year of college that made me no longer comfortable prescribing prescription drugs on such a large scale. I started to understand that for the majority of people a more natural and holistic approach would not only be more beneficial, but also safer. I switched my focus to therapy and began counseling at a residential treatment center for adults with addictions and eating disorders, and had been studying natural ways of medicinal therapy such as Ayurveda, and Chinese medicine. I was finding that so many things that grow naturally contain exactly what people need to help them find the balance and harmony they were seeking in a healthy, non-dependance inducing way. ABOUT ORMUS:During this time I came across something known as ORMUS. I found that millions of dollars had gone into studying ORMUS and that it's list of benefits are virtually endless. Some of these benefits include: 
Balancing the left and right hemispheres of the brain
Increasing brain capacity
Repairing DNA
Third eye opening
If you think about just these four benefits, you see that ORMUS can help with so many disorders, like ADD & ADHD, depression, anxiety, addictions, OCD, PTSD, eating disorders, and more. ORMUS can help with any disorder that involves an unbalance in one's thinking and ways of behavior.  ORMUS can also help with skin and hair growth and repair, which I have seen personally. It also increases brain activity, helping to alleviate blindsides in our own consciousness. You might say it helps to wake us up. I started having colorful, lucid dreams after just a couple of weeks using it. I also started to see my actions an non-actions so much more clearly, as well as where my actions/hesitations were coming from. This allowed me to have an even greater ability to shape my own character. Anybody with a desire to live fully will benefit from this. In this way, it helps people create the higher version of themselves, helps with manifesting, and connecting with our own inner truths as well as with the people around us. It is like taking the subconscious and moving it into consciousness. It shows us how much power we really have over our own thought, which we start to see, is our power. This can help people in the clinical psychology setting by showing them how much power over their own reality they actually have, because our subconscious plays a huge role in the world that has shaped around us. ORMUS helps to show people that we live in the present, not in the past. When we start to understand this we see that we can move on from tough or traumatic experiences without allowing them to continually haunt us. And if we don't have tough or traumatic experiences to move on from, imagine the leap forward that a healthy happy individual can take with this new heightened awareness. ORMUS helps us manifest an even greater, more positive lifestyle than we are already living. It can bring us even closer to enjoying the moment, and give us an even greater understanding of happiness and fulfillment. Which is why it is not necessary one use ORMUS for the rest of their life, once we have a deep understanding of this fulfillment, it does not leave us, but only momentarily, and the greater our understanding is the shorter and more far between these moments are. I have experienced all of these benefits myself, and that is why I am so passionate about sharing this with the world. My hearing was degenerated from my time in the Air Force, and after a couple of months with ORMUS I suddenly realized that my hearing had gotten a lot better. I gave the ormus to my mother and she told me she could see more clearly without her glasses on. She has been using glasses since I was born. And no, the ormus has not given her 20x20 vision, but it had definitely helped. ORMUS also helps with deep, restful sleep. Just after a week of using ormus I started to get very colorful lucid dreams. This is because ORMUS helps to decalcify the Pineal gland. The Pineal gland is one of the most important parts of our body, but also one of the least understood by the general public. It is responsible for DMT, melatonin, and serotonin production and regulation. This is HUGE because DMT is responsible for our dream state, which is not only active while we are asleep it is also active while we are awake and largely responsible for our ability to manifest, because before we can manifest anything, we have to see it clearly in our mind. Serotonin is responsible for mood patterns and melatonin is responsible for sleep patterns. All of these also work together to create energy and deep rest. So as you can imagine, having a healthy and fully functional Pineal gland is pinnacle to living a healthy, happy, balanced life. But chemicals and ""junk"", such as processed foods, cause a calcification of material around the pineal gland which renders it less functional in our bodies. This is making people less aware, in a sense one could say that calcification of the Pineal gland dumbs us down. Fluoride is extremely detrimental to the Pineal gland because of how it forms a crust around it, reducing its ability to make and excrete DMT, serotonin, and melatonin. But doctors don't tell us this, they just give us prescription drugs. Fluoride is found abundantly in tap water, and even bottled water. Brita filters do not remove Fluoride. In fact, it is only the activated alumina filters that remove Fluoride, which is the type of filter I use when making ORMUS. Sure reverse osmosis filters remove Fluoride, but they also remove every mineral in the water, making the water highly reactive and causing it to demineralize our bones when we drink it. This is why I do not drink Reverse Osmosis water, but let's just stick to ORMUS for now. So, as we can see, the benefits of ORMUS are broad, encompassing almost everything a person could use help with. Some of my customers are A-list actors who have told me they find the ORMUS helps them tap into character right away rather than after 2 or 3 takes. I also have beauty pageant winners who have taken it before presenting themselves to the judges because of the way it brings them into the present moment, and allows them to open up to, and connect with others. I have also had very busy office workers tell me about how it has allowed them to remain calm and focused amongst and increasing flow of work load, helping them to be way more efficient in the office. For the most part, everybody who has used my ORMUS has noticed an amazing increase in synchronistic experiences and divine timing.  WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?:The goal of Prescott & Love Alchemy is to help people towards physical, psychological and spiritual excellence. We want to bring you balance and satisfaction with life in an all natural way that will not be dependance inducing and will last you the rest of your life. *Here's the problem...We now have 1 in ever 4 women ages 50 to 64 found on antidepressants, 13% Americans are also on antidepressants, 17% are being prescribed antibiotics, and 13% are on painkilling opioids. That is nearly 70% of the population on prescription drugs! Psychiatric medication is up nearly 400% in the last ten years!!!  This is not the way towards balance and happiness, but the problem is that pharmaceutical companies aren't concerned with our happiness, they are concerned with the well-being of their MASSIVE corporation! They have thousands of employees to pay and billions just to cover in bills... Which means they need customers... And unfortunately, their customers are YOU! Did you know that pharmaceutical companies are funding healthcare and paying the hospitals? This is really, really bad for us. This means that it is the pharmaceutical companies actually PAYING hospitals to keep people on their prescription drugs! The statistics I mentioned early are not decreasing, they are increasing. And with the current scheme continuing nearly 90% of all Americans will be put on harmful prescription drugs in the next 10 years, and many of these drugs are not only dependance inducing, but will also drain the body so much that they will only weaken the immune system causing us to keep coming back to the pharmaceutical companies for more drugs. Are you aware that the percentage of children between the age of 6-12 are placed on prescription drugs for a disorder that has been invented by the pharmaceutical companies known as ADD & ADHD? At age 6 I was one of those children... I no longer use prescription medication and spent years fighting dependance it had given me as a child! Currently 5.1% of children in America between the age of 6-12 are put on Ritalin or Adderall for ADD & ADHD. Ritalin and Adderall are virtually the same thing, they just have different names, the pharmaceutical companies do this with nearly all of their drugs to keep the public interested and to keep sales high. Here is the scary thing about putting these young children on Ritalin and Adderall, these drugs have the same active compound as METHAMPHETAMINE! These drugs were invented by the Japense millitary in World War II for use in their fighter pilots. Their pilots would not sleep for days on these drugs and continued to reload their plains with ammunition and go right back up to blowing people out of the sky... Now the Government is allowing these drugs to be prescribed to children who are naturally ""hyper-active"", with the claim that it effects them in the ""opposite"" way it would effect a ""normal"" child. This is very sad, and very dangerous. The pharmaceutical companies having such power over health care are the cause of hundreds of disorders being invented just so hospitals can put people on their drugs. Prescott & Love Alchemy says ""NO"". We say it is not drugs that you need, but balance. Drugs will only knock a person even further out of balance, but ORMUS brings us deeper into balance. Prescott & Love Alchemy wants to put the word out, and to truly heal people, for true longevity and vitality; for true, permanent happiness and health. To remind people who have lost that sense of their inner self what it feels like to be truly whole, and happy again, as they once were. Not just keep them coming back like is seen with pharmaceutical companies. HOW YOU CAN HELP US!Currently there are many tonic bars, juice bars, spas and health food markets, such as Wholefoods and Erewhon who want to start providing people with our ormus. But we do not have the funds to match this demand. We need your help. Please donate and help us share the gift of balance and heightened consciousness. Please help us educate the public on ORMUS and natural ways to achieve and maintain balance for true happiness and longevity. And please share our campaign with as many people as possible! ORMUS can help people with depression, anxiety, ADD & ADHD, and so many other ""disorders"" that the pharmaceutical companies have invented! It can help rebalance the left and right brain hemispheres. I can help anyone who has a demanding job or lifestyle step up their game! We need to put the word out, and we need your support. With love and gratitude,Prescott Love",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p>Hello my name is Wale, I am 11 years old and I am a 5<sup>th</sup>
Grader at the Montclair Elementary School in Virginia. My one true passion in
life is tennis. I started playing the game when I was 8 years old with my mom
and her friend. It was the first time we ever held rackets and it was exciting!
This casual encounter started my passion for tennis. Early last year, I started
taking lessons at the Montclair Tennis Club. My mom has been very supportive of
my desire to play tennis, and perhaps even as a professional someday, but she
has limited means as a single mom. The tennis club has also been very
supportive – they have been kind enough to subsidize my lessons. My
education is also very important to me. My mom’s only condition for her support
has been that I keep up my good grades or stop playing tennis. I have managed
to maintain Honor Roll grades and I have been competitively selected for a Middle
School International Baccalaureate program.</p>
<p>I am writing to you today to ask for your support because I
still have so much to learn about the game. I won my first club tournament game
a few weeks ago. Even though I played well and my coach was very impressed by
my points, I feel that I have to be better prepared for tougher opponents. This
summer, I would like to go to the Evert Tennis Academy in Florida for a 4-week intensive
training and sports conditioning summer program. I did my research and my mom
called and spoke to the Director of the camp. The total cost of the trip will
be $7,500 including travel expenses. My mom will contribute $500 and pay her airfare to take me there.</p>
<p>I work really hard on my tennis and I devote most of my
spare time to this sport that I love. In addition to tennis, I am a Church
volunteer at the Hilda Barg Homeless Shelter in Woodbridge Virginia and I also volunteer
at the food pantry for ACTS (Action in Community Through Service). You will
make me the happiest 11-year old in the world if you support me – no amount is
too small. I promise not to disappoint you all and I promise to work even
harder at school and at tennis. If I raise more than $7,000, I will donate all
extra funds to the Hilda Barg Homeless Shelter and will continue to give my
time to the shelter and other volunteer opportunities. Thank you for investing in my future.</p>

<li>
<strong>VOC or volatile organic compounds</strong> are a class of substances that evaporate at room temperature. Being different substances may be responsible for a broad category of disorders, including respiratory problems, allergic or weakening immunity in children. Some VOC ‘s are responsible for the formation of smog, irritation of eyes, nose and throat, headaches and concentration problems. In extreme circumstances, more severe complications can occur, such as damage to liver, kidney and central nervous system or cancer.

<li><p><strong>Particulate matter PM2.5</strong> refers to small particles with a diameter of up to 2.5 microns. These particles can penetrate deep into the lungs , causing allergies, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . The A3 detects them with a high quality laser scattering sensor. More details on health effects <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/health-and-environmental-effects-particulate-matter-pm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p></li>
<li>
<strong>Ionizing radiation</strong> is harmful to living organisms because it can cause damage to cells that can result in multiple disorders, the most common of which is cancer. Ionizing radiation is naturally occurring from cosmic and terrestrial sources, but  there are also artificial generators related to nuclear activities or x-ray devices . More on this <a href=""https://www.epa.gov/radiation/radiation-health-effects"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Formaldehyde</strong> is a toxic colorless gas with a pungent smell, that results from the burning of carbon based materials. It can be found in forest fires, in automobile exhaust and cigarette smoke. It is an allergenic and a known carcinogenic compound that can cause serious health effects, depending on concentration and exposure. Even in tiny quantities just it can irritate the eyes and nose, and can worsen asthma symptoms. <a href=""http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=219&amp;tid=39"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">More info</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Carbon dioxide</strong> is a gas heavier than air. In small quantities of up to 5000ppm (0.5% ) can cause headaches, lethargy, slowing of intellectual ability, irritability, sleep disturbance. In larger quantities can cause dizziness, loss of sight, hearing or knowledge.

These places have better regulations on environmental protection. Except industry and traffic there’s an (economically) sustained effort to limit dangers to human health.

I  am grateful for all the community support the project received so far: this includes the first successfully funded indieGogo campaign and all the uRADMonitor adopters that helped to create a global uRADMonitor network 800 units in size. Last but not least, visionary people involved in responsible corporations, helped this effort even further.Our first IndieGogo campaign was a successPersonally I am committed to building something that matters, that has an impact on the lives of many.  Air Quality has a direct impact on the health and the environment, and the first step in solving the pollution problem is to understand it. Here is where uRADMonitor steps in.The uRADMonitor A3The project evolved not only in size, but also in number of products developed. The uRADMonitor A3 is probably the best uRADMonitor product developed so far, proving excellent reliability during exploitation. It is packed with an impressive number of high quality sensors that were selected after intensive research and testing:A3 internals and one finished unitEach A3 measures 8 air parameters with a significant effect on our health and the environment: temperature, pressure, humidity, volatile organic compounds, formaldehyde, carbon dioxide, particulate matter PM2.5 and ionising radiation. See complete specs in the technical datasheet.Powerful dashboard allows easy data visualisationThe devices come in four variants, with the same sensors but with four different connectivity options to make installation and deployment easier in homes, offices or cities. These four connectivity variants include Ethernet, Wifi, GSM and LoRaWAN:Four distinct A3 variants with multiple connectivity optionsFor this campaign I am offering the A3 with Ethernet and the A3 with Wifi, you can choose any.Orange Romania supported the direction contoured by uRADMonitor and facilitated the deployment of almost 100x A3 units in five Romanian cities. The devices were installed in public transportation, in smart busses equipped with mobile Internet connectivity, so large city areas could be mapped easily. This resulted in valuable air quality data, with an impact on more than 3 million people living there.Live Air Quality data from Alba Iulia using 15 uRADMonitor A3 units Health impactThe sensors in the A3 were picked to cover an extended list of dangerous pollutants, that appear both indoors and outdoors:

VOC or volatile organic compounds are a class of substances that evaporate at room temperature. Being different substances may be responsible for a broad category of disorders, including respiratory problems, allergic or weakening immunity in children. Some VOC ‘s are responsible for the formation of smog, irritation of eyes, nose and throat, headaches and concentration problems. In extreme circumstances, more severe complications can occur, such as damage to liver, kidney and central nervous system or cancer. Read more.
Particulate matter PM2.5 refers to small particles with a diameter of up to 2.5 microns. These particles can penetrate deep into the lungs , causing allergies, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases . The A3 detects them with a high quality laser scattering sensor. More details on health effects here.

Ionizing radiation is harmful to living organisms because it can cause damage to cells that can result in multiple disorders, the most common of which is cancer. Ionizing radiation is naturally occurring from cosmic and terrestrial sources, but  there are also artificial generators related to nuclear activities or x-ray devices . More on this here.

Formaldehyde is a toxic colorless gas with a pungent smell, that results from the burning of carbon based materials. It can be found in forest fires, in automobile exhaust and cigarette smoke. It is an allergenic and a known carcinogenic compound that can cause serious health effects, depending on concentration and exposure. Even in tiny quantities just it can irritate the eyes and nose, and can worsen asthma symptoms. More info.

Carbon dioxide is a gas heavier than air. In small quantities of up to 5000ppm (0.5% ) can cause headaches, lethargy, slowing of intellectual ability, irritability, sleep disturbance. In larger quantities can cause dizziness, loss of sight, hearing or knowledge. Read more.
 Poverty, pollution and many health issuesApparently things are on an ascending trend, however there’s an issue: The network distribution is not uniform, with a predominant presence in more developed countries. These places have better regulations on environmental protection. Except industry and traffic there’s an (economically) sustained effort to limit dangers to human health. On the other hand, less developed areas are lacking proper regulations and pollution control. The uRADMonitor network is practically inexistent here due reasons unrelated to awareness and will, but rather to costs.Crop stubble being burnt in India.

In 2007, after a long ride with his MTB he experienced wrists and back pain. During his job, he noticed that many cyclists complained about the same issue after their training sessions, also noticing that many of them changed very often their hand's positions on the handlebars. From this intuition the idea of creating a new concept of handles bar that really helps cyclists in a more ergonomics and innovative way.

Lighter, stronger and stiffer as never before!   This position has a huge impact on the cyclist's comfort by reducing joint and muscle pain.    No matter if you are a pro or an amateur, if you climb mountains or just bike to work: SPIRGRIPS® + are easy to install on a wide range of bikes and you can benefit from them also biking just for few kilometers.  
 Numerous prototypes have been tested using the latest 3D printing technologies to validate the ergonomics of the new handle and ensuring its perfect integration on the handlebars available on the market.SPIRGRIPS® + are the result of more than 10 years of research. These small bar grips are developed, tested, and scientifically validated in Switzerland in collaboration with professional cyclists. VALIDATED BY SCIENCE REDUCES VIBRATION IN ORDER TO PREVENT JOINT PAINNATURALLY ALIGN THE WRIST WITH THE ARM   We really care about ergonomics of course, but we never forget your safety. That's why we implemented the o-shape in order to prevent you from slipping, maintaining access to the brake every time.   During the past years we had the chance to study the best materials for SPIRGRIPS® +, we have done several tests in order to reach these results and we are very excited to present you the new era of SPIRGRIPS® +.   The shape - patented in Europe, the US and in China - is designed to correct the position of the hands, naturally aligning the joints of the forearms. Hand position has a huge impact on the cyclist's comfort and it's key in preventing joint and muscle pain.   SPIRGRIPS® + is easy to mount. You just need a hex key. And your bike, of course.Fits: handlebars of racing bike, MTB, city bike with a diameter range between 22.2mm (0.87"") and 31.8mm (1.25"").Weight: the estimated weight is below 70 gr for the composite version and approx 50gr for the carbon one.   The pad is the novelty of the new model, its purpose is to give greater ergonomics and adapt more into the cyclist's hand. That’s why we realized this part with a low Shore material, very soft to the touch it will really turns every bike ride into true comfort.The pad can also be removed for saving more weight and increase the performances.   We have developed an improved plastic blend with glass fiber. This special type of glass fiber translates into better mechanical properties especially in terms of elasticity and tensile strength.The product will be matte black.The carbon model is 40% lighter, it is stronger and stiffer while maintaining the same mechanical properties. It's made with a special blend with carbon fiber, making it the best choice for anyone seeking higher performances.Lobke Nijhoff - Pro cyclist""The feeling I have when using SPIRGRIPS is relaxed. It takes the tension off the muscles in my arms. Because I like to travel long distances, I get less tired!""Maxime Saonit — Pro MTB cyclist""SPIRGRIPS, an object that has become essential for me on the World Marathon Series Events.""Gaia Ravaioli - 24H Solo Wembo World Champion 2017""Since I've started using SPIRGRIPS my wrists thank you!"" Frans Claes - Belgian Champion 2015 & 2016 ""SPIRGRIPS helps me in my performance at races and gives my hands a more relaxing position while riding my bike."" Christian Jupillat - UCI Masters Cyclo-Cross Senior World Champion""I had the chance to test most of the innovations related to mountain biking. SPIRGRIPS impressed me with their comfort and thanks to them I've improved my performance every year. Having them on my bike is just essential, they are always with me. SPIRGRIPS + will be undoubtedly an innovation in lightness and comfort, I can't wait to try them.""Life is colorful and so it could be your new SPIRGRIPS +!So, what's your favorite color?Pascal Badolett is a physiotherapist, he lives and works in Geneva, Switzerland, and he is very passionate about sports, especially cycling. In 2007, after a long ride with his MTB he experienced wrists and back pain. During his job, he noticed that many cyclists complained about the same issue after their training sessions, also noticing that many of them changed very often their hand's positions on the handlebars. From this intuition the idea of creating a new concept of handles bar that really helps cyclists in a more ergonomics and innovative way. Our mission is to correct your position ensuring the best ergonomics and safety in a way never experienced before. Join the SPIRGRIPS revolution, change the way you bike for good.

I am currently inspired and excited by my acceptance and upcoming participation in this 6 Week Natural Building Apprenticeship by EcoNest, an organization that focuses on constructing and teaching a building method that is green, environmentally-friendly, healthy, and non-toxic. The building method is focused on using earth, straw, timber frames, and the principles of Bau-Biologie (building biology). I am very honored to have been accepted to be an apprentice this year under Robert LaPorte, the founder of the EcoNest Building Company. Only 4 apprentices are accepted each year so this is a very unique opportunity for me to have.
This apprenticeship experience will take my building and craftsmanship to the next level so that I can continue to educate people on how to build healthy homes for longer, healthier, happier lives. I was introduced to many natural building techniques while studying and building in Oregon this past summer. I discovered the EcoNest apprentice program while I was there and I knew that it was the next step that I needed to take in my journey of becoming a well respected craftsman of natural, healthy homes.Over the past 2 years, I have educated thousands of people on the practices and principles of Natural Building, with a focus on cob/earthen buildings. I created a website to further this educational cause and to help make this knowledge mainstream. My website is: www.thiscobhouse.com. I have also held several presentations and workshops to educate on Natural Building.Now I need your help! I want to keep teaching people how they can construct healthier homes for themselves. It is a continual learning process. Help me get the learning that I need so that I can pass it on to my ever-growing network of builders and home-owners. This apprenticeship training at EcoNest is indispensable in my quest for building healthy homes. Apart from the hands-on building experience, the program will teach about the dangers of conventional building materials from indoor air pollution, toxic building materials and limited testing of building products. It will cover: why standard building processes are not healthful, what to do differently, and how to obtain alternative materials. More and more people are suffering a wide range of health problems today due to the toxic buildings that they live and work in.Help to make a healthy change throughout the world in the way we build our homes!What I Need & What You GetI need to raise $4,000 toward my participation in the Apprenticeship. All money will go towards tuition fees, tools, lodging, and transportation costs. The tuition for the program is $3,000. I also have to purchase several tools, and then pay my way from Tennessee to Oregon and get a place to stay. Would you be willing to help support my journey into this empowering movement by making a contribution? Any amount, from modest to eye-popping, is welcome and very appreciated!And in appreciation of your support, I am giving away some great rewards!Donate $25 or moreFor donations of $25 or more, you will receive an online photo album recording and documenting my whole 6-week apprenticeship program.

</div><div>
<h3>Why This is Important</h3> <p>When we started Hope for Kibera in the summer of 2007, it was because of statistics like these: </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p>“Approximately <b>2.5 million slum dwellers</b> [live in Nairobi’s informal settlements],
representing 60% of the capital’s population, but occupying only <b>6%</b> of the land.”</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>Kibera has <b>no
sewage infrastructure</b>. 1 pit latrine may be shared by 50 households, and most
are emptied into the river, causing typhoid and cholera.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p><b>Unwanted
pregnancies</b> are rampant, exacerbated by rape and forced prostitution. Affecting
up to 50% of young women (ages 16 to 25) at any given time, these pregnancies
too often result in abortion, ostracization, or a lifetime of poverty for
mother and child.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p><b>Unemployment</b>
<b>affecting over 50% of residents</b>, despite the
fact that most families moved to Kibera in search of jobs.</p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p>A resulting <b>life
expectancy of 30 years</b> for Kibera residents, compared to 50 years in the
rest of Kenya, and nearly 80 years in the U.S. </p></li></ul>

<h3>Risks, Challenges &amp; Impact</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.hopeforkibera.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hope for Kibera</a> (H4K) was created in 2007 and established as a Community-Based
Organization in Nairobi in 2011. Our six active mentors are all<b> local youth
leaders</b> from Kibera/Nairobi with experience in community health, education,
outreach/communications, research, project management, and community mobilization.
Our three US-based advisors provide expertise in organizational management,
health, social entrepreneurship and information technology, along with connection
to resources less available in Kibera.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over the
past seven years, Hope for Kibera has worked with schools and students in
Kibera in numerous capacities, including through several large events. The
upcoming Conference, which we have been planning since early this year, will be
the largest event we have undertaken to date. To prepare, we have been thinking
through all logistics including setting the agenda, emcees, sound systems,
seating, guest speakers and judges, refreshments as well as outreach/marketing
and the message of empowerment for systemic change that we aim to deliver.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/815158/files/20140827005936-contest-proposals2.jpg?1409126376"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A
significant but exciting challenge will be <b>selecting one winning team </b>out of
the innovative proposals that are advancing to the Conference. The ideas range
from a multi-level environmental and food security program, through which
poultry farming and gardening will combat <b>malnutrition </b>among Kibera's children, to
an artists’ workspace empowering students economically—and enabling them to
remain in school—to a range of <b>environmental initiatives </b>applying creative approaches
like recycling, water piping systems and community mobilization to alleviate
the horrible problems of waste and communicable disease in Kibera. Although
difficult to choose between, we know that these teams will bring forth an
inspiring debate about the many possible ways to create <b>positive change</b> in Kibera.</p>
<p>In order to
ensure equal footing in the contest and transparency in the selection process,
we circulated comprehensive guidelines (the “fine print”) reviewed by the teams
prior to entering the contest, and we are enlisting a panel of independent
judges to help determine the 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>
place winners. This will ameliorate any risk of perceived favoritism, as H4K
has worked more closely with some teams than with others, while also helping to
spur conversation about health and social justice in Kibera.</p>
<p>The students
have been preparing as well, spending the past three months brainstorming,
researching and refining their project ideas with feedback from H4K mentors.
During the presentation phase, the contestants will field questions about their
team’s <b>capacity</b><i>, </i>their <b>implementation plan,</b> and their project’s<i> </i>potential
<b>sustainability</b>, among others. Over the next year, H4K will continue working
with the winning team, connecting them with additional resources and expertise
to ensure that they are set up for success. </p>

<p></p>
<p>In all, we
will continue to concentrate our efforts so that the 1<sup>st</sup> Annual
Empowerment for Health Conference not only concludes a successful day filled
with <b>community-building</b>, information-sharing and the cross-fertilization of ideas,
but that it launches a project that, led by the youth with support from a
growing network of advocates and collaborators, will effect sustainable change for
better health in Kibera.</p>
<p>In truth,
the challenges we face are deeply entrenched—symptomatic of a history of
colonization and global inequity—and will require systemic change far
greater than what any of us can do alone, or in the scope of one year. Rather
than turning away at this incredible obstacle, we aim to ignite a <b>movement of
hope.</b> It is our own hope that whether their team is funded or not, all participants will come
away from this summit with the belief that their voices matter, that health
should not be a privilege of the rich, that strength comes in many forms and <b>we
all have something to contribute. </b></p>
<p>Thus, with your help, we will create a ripple of empowerment
in the hearts of the youth and plant a seed of belief that we all can and we
all must engage in these tough conversations and difficult work—so that in time
the ripple will become a crashing wave, and the seed a towering tree, to topple
those barriers and nourish a more equitable world.</p>

and the chance to
bring their big idea to life!


Join us in empowering
the youth of Kibera as ambassadors of health and champions of hope! This fall, Hope for Kibera will host the 1st Annual Empowerment for Health Conference, challenging students
to design and present their own unique ideas to affect positive
change in Kibera, Africa’s largest “informal settlement.” Through broad, creative discussion and mentorship
to strengthen project concepts, Hope for Kibera (H4K) will engage and
empower youth to address the issues that impact their health and
their lives. Your support will provide seed funding for the big idea that
emerges from this exchange of ideas, and the capacity to empower Kibera's next
generation of leaders.




Why This is Important When we started Hope for Kibera in the summer of 2007, it was because of statistics like these: 

“Approximately 2.5 million slum dwellers [live in Nairobi’s informal settlements],
representing 60% of the capital’s population, but occupying only 6% of the land.”
Kibera has no
sewage infrastructure. 1 pit latrine may be shared by 50 households, and most
are emptied into the river, causing typhoid and cholera.
Unwanted
pregnancies are rampant, exacerbated by rape and forced prostitution. Affecting
up to 50% of young women (ages 16 to 25) at any given time, these pregnancies
too often result in abortion, ostracization, or a lifetime of poverty for
mother and child.
Unemployment
affecting over 50% of residents, despite the
fact that most families moved to Kibera in search of jobs.
A resulting life
expectancy of 30 years for Kibera residents, compared to 50 years in the
rest of Kenya, and nearly 80 years in the U.S. 
(Sources:
http://kiberalawcentre.org/facts/ ; http://www.kibera.org.uk/Facts.html)
What we realized – from the amazing generosity we were shown; from the
pervasive optimism, and frequent laughter, despite facing harsh realities; from
the friendships we cherish to this day – was the amazing potential that exists
here in Kibera, in its entrepreneurs and community health workers, in its
creative, artistic children and parents with such stories of life, who all hold
real solutions. We learned that what this vibrant community needs most is
access to opportunity.
Here's How You Can Help:

$900 will fully fund the 1st Place
team’s start-up project for one year.
$500 will partially fund the 2nd and
3rd place projects, will provide meaningful, capacity-building
support to team members like training in community mobilization, social
entrepreneurship or project management, or will help to cover their school fees
so they can continue their education.*
$200 will cover the cost of the venue and
supplies, including healthy refreshments for participants at the 1st
Annual Empowerment for Health Conference.

We have already raised $250, which will support the local entrepreneurs
who will provide your perks and go back to Indiegogo for fees, supporting other
awesome crowdfunding projects. Any funds raised
above and beyond our goal would enable us to fund two top projects, or to scale
up the winning project.
*The winning teams will be selected by an independent panel of judges,
including community leaders and experts in health and sustainable development.
Runners-up prizes will be determined based on a survey of participants and the
size of the selected teams.

What You'll Get in Return
Along with our sincere thanks for helping out an important cause, we've chosen -- and created -- a handful of ""perks"" to express our gratitude: 
jewelry and artwork by Kenyan artists


a first-edition bumper sticker

or


and a limited-edition t-shirt to show off your support for Kibera!

<b>About Us</b><br/>I have worked on applications development for one of the first automated DNA sequencing systems the Pharmacia ALF, and on the final design team for the MegaBACE at Molecular Dynamics. There we developed hardware, software and applications for the first high throughput DNA sequencing/genotyping system for the Human Genome Project.<br/>When I worked at the Columbia University Genome Center I held the post of Central Coordinator of DNA Sequencing and Chemical Biology.  I worked on the genomic sequencing of the causative agent of Legionaires disease Legionella pnuemophila, antibiotic resistance in bacteria, human genetic screening including BRCAI, and investigated the genes involved in cholesterol metabolism. Collaborating with the Nobel Laureate Eric Kandel, we worked on elucidating the genes involved in short term memory. I have published in the scientific journals Cell, Protein Chemistry, and Science and I can bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to the company.<br/><br/><b>Why We're Valuable</b><br/>Having been in science for more than 20 years I have seen a lot of important research information not being utilized in genetic testing. I have been personally affected from family and friends that were afflicted with cancer and heart disease and only limited genetic testing was available addressing only 1 or 2 genes. There is the ability to test for multiple genes and our tests look at as many genes as possible thought to be involved in the disease state. <br/>By testing for more genes we can more accurately identify the disease state and possible differences within the disease to tailor treatment for the patient, providing better treatment and a better outcome and quality of life.<br/>In the near future we will also provide whole genome sequencing, the sequencing of all of the genes in your body, and will be able to store your genome and re-test at later dates  when more information about genetic information become available. Molecular medicine is coming of age and the more information we can utilize the better we can address disease states and improve your quality of life. We will be at the forefront of molecular medicine with your help.<br/>Please visit our website at moleculartroubleshooting.com for more information.<br/><br/><b>What we need</b><br/>Molecular Troubleshooting requires to setup the testing laboratory such as renting the laboratory space, purchasing the DNA sequencing system, other laboratory equipment and reagents. the rental space has been identified and the rent is  $1.300 per month. The equipment is the major cost. The DNA sequencing system that will be used is the Illumina MiSeq system which is the preferred system for clinical applications and was selected by the FDA for the identification of food borne pathogens. The MiSeq system will be leased to minimize cost.<br/>We need $250,000 to setup the laboratory and purchase the laboratory equipment, place a down payment for the MiSeq system, rental space deposit and rent, reagents,  salaries, and the first year's operating costs. The company should be producing enough revenue to be self sufficient after the first year.<br/><b><br/>What you get</b><br/>Our perks will be structured so that all contributors from $5 and up will have their name appear on the Founders page on our company website. Contributors rewards are tiered as follows:$50 dollars and above will receive a custom designed Molecular Troubleshooting pen with the company logo, contributions of $100 and up will receive a sporty Molecular Troubleshooting T-shirt bearing the company logo, contributions of $500 and above will receive a 25% discount on one of our available genetic tests and contributions of $1,000 and above will receive a 50% discount on one of our available genetic tests. You will also receive two reports from your genetic test, a technical report for your physician and a report in layman's terms for you. Everyone receives the satisfaction of helping to set up a new genetic testing company with a powerful new multi-gene testing approach to provide more information for better patient treatment and care and quality of life.<br/><b><br/>Successful track record</b><br/>In the past I have worked on many projects and brought them to fruition. I worked on building the next generation capillary electrophoresis high throughput sequencing instrument the MegaBACE, used in the bulk of the sequencing for the Human Genome Project. During this project I was on the final design team, helped develop applications, performed the beta testing and helped place and install the first 100 units. I have also worked on many other projects before and after that such as: the ALF slab gel DNA sequencing system for Pharmacia one of the first automated DNA sequencers, the Qiagen BioRobot one of the first robotic systems for high throughput DNA sample preparation, the EST sequencing of Aplysia to help elucidate the basis for short term memory, investigated antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and the full genomic sequence of the causative agent for Legionaires disease to name a few. Hard work, persistence and creative problem solving have helped me complete the projects that I have undertaken.<br/>I know how to bring a project to completion and look forward to that with Molecular Troubleshooting to provide multi-gene genetic testing to bear on some of the worst afflictions of our time.  <br/><b><br/>How you can help </b><br/>We would greatly appreciate if you would contribute to our campaign and no amount is too small. If you can not contribute you can help in other ways by spreading the word about Molecular Troubleshooting and our Indiegogo crowd funding campaign and contact others who may be able to contribute. Any efforts that you can provide are greatly appreciated.<br/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><p>

I have published in the scientific journals Cell, Protein Chemistry, and Science and I can bring a wealth of experience and knowledge to the company.Why We're ValuableHaving been in science for more than 20 years I have seen a lot of important research information not being utilized in genetic testing. I have been personally affected from family and friends that were afflicted with cancer and heart disease and only limited genetic testing was available addressing only 1 or 2 genes. There is the ability to test for multiple genes and our tests look at as many genes as possible thought to be involved in the disease state. By testing for more genes we can more accurately identify the disease state and possible differences within the disease to tailor treatment for the patient, providing better treatment and a better outcome and quality of life.In the near future we will also provide whole genome sequencing, the sequencing of all of the genes in your body, and will be able to store your genome and re-test at later dates  when more information about genetic information become available. Molecular medicine is coming of age and the more information we can utilize the better we can address disease states and improve your quality of life. We will be at the forefront of molecular medicine with your help.Please visit our website at moleculartroubleshooting.com for more information.What we needMolecular Troubleshooting requires to setup the testing laboratory such as renting the laboratory space, purchasing the DNA sequencing system, other laboratory equipment and reagents. the rental space has been identified and the rent is  $1.300 per month. The equipment is the major cost. The DNA sequencing system that will be used is the Illumina MiSeq system which is the preferred system for clinical applications and was selected by the FDA for the identification of food borne pathogens. The MiSeq system will be leased to minimize cost.We need $250,000 to setup the laboratory and purchase the laboratory equipment, place a down payment for the MiSeq system, rental space deposit and rent, reagents,  salaries, and the first year's operating costs. The company should be producing enough revenue to be self sufficient after the first year.What you getOur perks will be structured so that all contributors from $5 and up will have their name appear on the Founders page on our company website. Contributors rewards are tiered as follows:$50 dollars and above will receive a custom designed Molecular Troubleshooting pen with the company logo, contributions of $100 and up will receive a sporty Molecular Troubleshooting T-shirt bearing the company logo, contributions of $500 and above will receive a 25% discount on one of our available genetic tests and contributions of $1,000 and above will receive a 50% discount on one of our available genetic tests. You will also receive two reports from your genetic test, a technical report for your physician and a report in layman's terms for you. Everyone receives the satisfaction of helping to set up a new genetic testing company with a powerful new multi-gene testing approach to provide more information for better patient treatment and care and quality of life.Successful track recordIn the past I have worked on many projects and brought them to fruition. I worked on building the next generation capillary electrophoresis high throughput sequencing instrument the MegaBACE, used in the bulk of the sequencing for the Human Genome Project. During this project I was on the final design team, helped develop applications, performed the beta testing and helped place and install the first 100 units. I have also worked on many other projects before and after that such as: the ALF slab gel DNA sequencing system for Pharmacia one of the first automated DNA sequencers, the Qiagen BioRobot one of the first robotic systems for high throughput DNA sample preparation, the EST sequencing of Aplysia to help elucidate the basis for short term memory, investigated antibiotic resistance in bacteria, and the full genomic sequence of the causative agent for Legionaires disease to name a few. Hard work, persistence and creative problem solving have helped me complete the projects that I have undertaken.I know how to bring a project to completion and look forward to that with Molecular Troubleshooting to provide multi-gene genetic testing to bear on some of the worst afflictions of our time.  How you can help We would greatly appreciate if you would contribute to our campaign and no amount is too small. If you can not contribute you can help in other ways by spreading the word about Molecular Troubleshooting and our Indiegogo crowd funding campaign and contact others who may be able to contribute. Any efforts that you can provide are greatly appreciated.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>Strengthening Family Ties</strong></h2>
<p>Notes From When™ software will use patented technology to help people write email notes that help kids understand how the world has changed since their parents (or their grandparents) were their age. For instance, the software will automatically draft a note from a parent to a child containing examples of what the world was like back when the child's grandparents were the child's age. The examples will be automatically selected by the software from topics the child is interested in.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>You can see <span class=""userContent"">example notes in the Gallery and in the videos, showing what the software could automatically create by using the historic facts it provides, with the information about relationships, family events, and interests the user will provide.</span></p>
<h2>Update: Prototype Underway</h2>
<p>Exciting news - our web-based prototype design is near completion, and we are vetting programmers to implement it. We hope to have it up and running soon. The prototype will generate notes with three topics: Science, Music, and Sports. Stay tuned for updates - we look forward to your feedback on the prototype!</p>
<h2><strong>Project Progress and Plan</strong></h2>
<p align=""LEFT"">User experience specifications, examples of notes the software will generate, and underlying technology for the software are described in US Patent 8224817 and pending patent applications, and also in a detailed storyboard. Funding for this project will support implementation of the design in software by programmers under the direction of the project lead. Implementation will begin with the Apple iPad® platform, and progress from there to Apple iPhone® and Android® phone platforms as funding permits. Any additional funding will be used to spread the word about the software.</p>
<p align=""LEFT"">Software sometimes takes longer than expected to implement. But the Notes From When™ design is well documented, the underlying technology is well understood, and capable programmers are available to be hired and work under John's direction.

<p>We are celebrating tremendous success and want to build on the momentum. Over the past few months we located several people young and old alike who were born with craniofacial deformities in rural and poverty stricken villages of India and provided them with FREE surgeries and holistic care. Now we have the opportunity to do more ... LOTS MORE ... A WHOLE LOT MORE!!!</p>
<p>In the month of February alone, we will be in South India (Karnataka) doing 4 medical camps to help several more folks born with cleft lip, cleft palate, and other facial deformities. Through the year we expect to do at least <strong>250 surgeries</strong> and we need to <strong>raise $150,000 to help get this project completed successfully</strong>. The more we raise the more people we can help. Would you join us?</p>

<p>Let me explain! All over the world, children are born with severe craniofacial deformities--deformities of the bones in the skull or face. In fact, as many as one in 700 births result in cleft lip and/or palate. <strong>In India alone there are 35,000 babies born with a cleft each year.</strong> Most are born in poor rural villages. These folks cannot afford the cost of surgeries and hence live a life of misery - where others consider them cursed. </p>

</div></div>","We are CREATING new SMILES!!!



Hey folks ... WE ARE SUPER EXCITED to run this campaign!!! 
We are celebrating tremendous success and want to build on the momentum. Over the past few months we located several people young and old alike who were born with craniofacial deformities in rural and poverty stricken villages of India and provided them with FREE surgeries and holistic care. Now we have the opportunity to do more ... LOTS MORE ... A WHOLE LOT MORE!!!
In the month of February alone, we will be in South India (Karnataka) doing 4 medical camps to help several more folks born with cleft lip, cleft palate, and other facial deformities. Through the year we expect to do at least 250 surgeries and we need to raise $150,000 to help get this project completed successfully. The more we raise the more people we can help. Would you join us?
The video above is a feature about Philip Mathews who was born with a condition called as Goldenhar Syndrome. He has overcome all odds to be where he is today. He is our hero and the inspiration for the birth of  Love Without Reason. Read all about Philip and his story at http://lovewithoutreason.org/index.php/philips-testimony/ Philip has inspired us to reach out and find children like him and give them HOPE. Would you contribute to this cause and give HOPE to those who are hurting? Join with us and celebrate our successes with each surgery!




Gopika, a baby with a cleft lip. LWR was able to perform her surgery in November 2012.

There are many more ""CURSED and TORTURED"" children like Gopika (left) who would have lived a life of rejection and isolation like Swamy (below) if LWR would not have intervened. We found Gopika as a newborn and helped repair her lip. She is now an even more beautiful baby with an amazing smile. Click here to see her updated picture
Swamy (pictured below) is a 21 year old man who needed a cleft palate surgery. A man that lived a life of rejection and sorrow because of his deformity. His eyes reflect the haunting reality of a person born with craniofacial deformities. When we met Swamy, he refused to look at us because he felt ashamed and had an extremely low self-esteem. Swamy cannot make himself heard because of his open palate. Click here to see his open palate




WHAT IS THE DEAL???
Let me explain! All over the world, children are born with severe craniofacial deformities--deformities of the bones in the skull or face. In fact, as many as one in 700 births result in cleft lip and/or palate. In India alone there are 35,000 babies born with a cleft each year. Most are born in poor rural villages. These folks cannot afford the cost of surgeries and hence live a life of misery - where others consider them cursed. 
Many of these children suffer complex health issues in addition to facing social rejection, neglect, and physical or emotional abuse; some are even killed upon birth. Most have no hope for a better future.

Swamy, a 21 year old with cleft palate. LWR was able to perform his surgery in November 2012. Swamy wants to get married, but could not find anyone because of his deformity. We pray that he is able to find his life partner soon



What we are doing the month of February?
Our founder, Santhosh Mathews, will be going to India from Feb 5th to Feb 25th and will be posting weekly updates on the 4 medical camps. This is the plan

Week 1: An update from Kamathipura, the redlight district of Mumbai, India. LWR joins with other organizations to fight sex trafficking. Of the 200,000 sex slaves in this one city, many are minor children. Pray for the rescue and restoration of the victims!
Weeks 2-4: Updates from Karnataka to give you highlights of the patients and some details about the first and second medical camps held in rural villages.





Can we count on you to SUPER CHARGE this campaign?
JUMP! Jump on this incredible opportunity to join the army of SMILE CREATORS. A grassroots group of volunteers who have one goal ... Help Create Smiles! Your donations will go a long way in helping change the lives of many patients in this area. We are looking to raise 15,000 in one month. If we are able to raise more, then we can help more. Can you join us? Can you spread the word? Get the momentum rolling?
Go ahead call your friends ... call your neighbors, send out emails, send out invites ... Let us make some NOISE!!! 
""Go tell it on the mountain ... on the rooftops."" This is an urgent call to action. Let us join hand-in-hand and get this ball rolling.




What do you get in return?
A BIG HUGE HUG from our Smile Creator army!!! ;-) OK just kidding ...
We are offering some amazing perks ... Take a look at the right of this column.

The situation:
CaptDistraction was denied warranty from Ford for a new replacement motor after a trip in the desert where the engine let go (consuming a valve and a seperate piston cracking through). Instead of CaptDistraction selling all of his personal belongings or spending a long time without his primary transportation,  We're hoping to raise enough money for him to get his motor replaced from Ford and get back on his feet.

Why help?
25% of the received funds will be donated to the ARC (see below for more detail). The remaining funds up to the project total cost will go towards repairing this 2011 Mustang GT. Additionally Any overage will go 100% to charity donation to the ARC. What an enthusiast will get back from their donation outside the charitable contribution is the continued development and exposure of this car through youtube videos, how-to videos, product testing and development; Providing the community with insight, entertainment, and help wherever possible.
 
Because Racecar.

Think OpenTable or Hotels.com, but for patients and facilities/therapies. </p><p></p><p><span style=""line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">Our Story</span><br/></p><p>Utilize Health Founder and Chief Executive Officer, <b>Jessica Harthcock</b>, was <b>paralyzed at age 17</b> while practicing gymnastics. Doctors said she would never regain function. Jessica and her family spent several years traveling in search of highly specialized rehabilitation treatments. Through years of hard work and determination, Jessica <b>learned to walk again</b>. </p><p>After experiencing difficulties finding resources and therapies, Jessica vowed to create a tool that could help other patients find the resources they needed without wasting <b>time</b>, <b>energy</b> and <b>financial resources</b>. Thus, Utilize Health was born. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/609988/files/20140528121517-Pic_1_Jessica_After_Injury.jpg?1401304517"" src="""" style=""width: 277.72px; height: 208px;""/><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>    </span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/609987/files/20140528121445-Pic_3_Lokomat_Walking.jpg?1401304485"" src="""" style=""width: 283px; height: 208px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""/><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>   </span></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>
<span><br/></span>Milestones - 100 Patients </h3><p></p><p>Utilize Health recently matched more than <b>100 patients</b> to therapies and facilities across the country. The Utilize Health team completed this process manually (essentially by looking at spreadsheets and other paper databases). Utilize Health currently has a backlog of patients and families waiting to be matched. Automating the matching process through our web application will allow Utilize Health to match thousands of patients! <b>This is why we need YOUR help!!</b> </p><p>The funds you give will go directly to the <b>development and creation of the web application</b>. Additional funds are needed to operate the website and hire Patient Advocates for the first six months.   </p><p>Here's what some of the 100 patients and their families have said about Utilize Health since the process began:</p><blockquote><i>“I had no clue these therapies existed. Thank you so much for my recommendations (matches)....For the first time in a long time, I am excited to see what the future holds for me.”<br/><br/>""I wanted to update you on my son's progress. Since Jeffrey started therapy at his new treatment center, he has progressed leaps and bounds. He STOOD for the first time all by himself...I am so thankful we found you.""<br/><br/>""I had given up on recovery years ago, but you've inspired me to try again, and for that I will forever be grateful."" </i></blockquote><p></p><p></p><h3>Problem Utilize Health Solves </h3><p></p><p>Patients lack knowledge of potentially life changing treatments because some therapies are considered new, and they are not well publicized. Utilize Health solves this problem by creating <b>smart matching technology</b> that helps patients: </p><p></p><ol>
<li>
<b>Learn</b> about treatments </li>
<li>
<b>Locate</b> facilities with those treatments </li>
<li>
<b>Engage</b> with that facility by scheduling an appointment through the Utilize Health platform </li>
</ol><p></p><p></p><h3>6 Conditions </h3>Utilize Health currently helps patients with <b>6 neurological conditions</b>: stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. These 6 different conditions encompass more than <p><b>11 million</b> people in the United States.</p><p>As Utilize Health grows, we hope to expand our services to other patient populations in the future.</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________</p><p></p><h3>How Will the Funds be Used?</h3><p><b>Our initial goal is $60K</b>. The funds will be used for <b>web application development</b>. The biggest drivers behind the cost of the website are:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>A proprietary algorithm, using several data sets to match patient conditions to therapy options and the qualified facilities, taking into account financial and geographic constraints.</li>
<li>A specialized user interface which is both ADA compliant and specifically designed for users with various neurological disabilities.</li>
<li>HIPAA compliance for security and privacy of personal health information.</li>
</ul><p>All of these compound the complexity of the development and take what might appear on the surface as a less expensive app and make it more expensive to develop.</p><p><b>Our first stretch goal is $100K</b>. We need the additional funds for maintenance and operational expenses (i.e., hiring Patient Advocates for the first 6 months). </p><p><b>Web Development</b>: We have contracted with a firm in Nashville, TN. They are ready to start building the web application and matching algorithms as soon as we give them the green light. Some of the funding will also be used towards hiring a User Experience (UX) Developer. As you can imagine, many Utilize Health users will have limited upper extremity mobility. We want to ensure an easy and seamless user experience for anyone who uses Utilize Health's website.</p><p>If we do not reach our entire goal, we will have to <i>critically limit</i> the scope of our web application. Certain features, like scheduling an appointment directly through the Utilize Health platform, may not be available. The more funds we raise, the more intuitive the web application will be. In addition, Utilize Health will be able to offer more features for our users. Below are some mocks ups of the website: (Note: This is subject to change based on the amount of funding we receive.) </p>_________________________________________________________________________<br/><p></p><p></p><h3>How Does it Work?</h3><p>Utilize Health is incredibly easy to use!

The types of conditions that Utilize Health helps are life-altering. </p><p>As you read above, Utilize Health has already matched more than 100 patients to therapies and facilities across the United States. Here's some more of what patients and their family members have said:</p><p></p><blockquote><i>“You have given me something that no one has been able to give me - hope. After my son suffered a closed head traumatic brain injury, the doctors said he would remain in a vegetative state. My wife and I have been searching for treatment options since his accident. When we were referred to Utilize Health, our Patient Advocate helped us learn about what options were out there. Thank you and to all of the Utilize Health Team.”</i></blockquote><blockquote><i><i>""It's been 21 years since I have participated in PT and OT. I look forward to starting a new kind of physical therapy."" </i><br/></i></blockquote><p></p><p>When you back our Indiegogo campaign, the impact for patients with neurological conditions is <b>life-changing</b>. When patients are aware of what resources are available, they can make informed decisions about their healthcare. Utilize Health takes its philosophy a step further. Not only do we help patients <b>learn</b> about resources, we help patients and their families <b>locate</b> and <b>engage</b> with those facilities and therapies. </p><p></p><p><span></span></p><h3></h3><p>_________________________________________________________________________</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p><span>If you can’t contribute financially, there's several other meaningful ways you can help us:</span></p><ul>

<p></p></div>","Utilize Health UPDATE:Utilize Health is LIVE and ready for patient use!!! Click here or visit utilizehealth.co (not .com) to sign up today!! What is Utilize Health?Utilize Health is a platform that matches patients with neurological disabilities to the therapies and facilities they need to maximize their potential for recovery. Think OpenTable or Hotels.com, but for patients and facilities/therapies. Our StoryUtilize Health Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Jessica Harthcock, was paralyzed at age 17 while practicing gymnastics. Doctors said she would never regain function. Jessica and her family spent several years traveling in search of highly specialized rehabilitation treatments. Through years of hard work and determination, Jessica learned to walk again. After experiencing difficulties finding resources and therapies, Jessica vowed to create a tool that could help other patients find the resources they needed without wasting time, energy and financial resources. Thus, Utilize Health was born.         
Milestones - 100 Patients Utilize Health recently matched more than 100 patients to therapies and facilities across the country. The Utilize Health team completed this process manually (essentially by looking at spreadsheets and other paper databases). Utilize Health currently has a backlog of patients and families waiting to be matched. Automating the matching process through our web application will allow Utilize Health to match thousands of patients! This is why we need YOUR help!! The funds you give will go directly to the development and creation of the web application. Additional funds are needed to operate the website and hire Patient Advocates for the first six months.   Here's what some of the 100 patients and their families have said about Utilize Health since the process began:“I had no clue these therapies existed. Thank you so much for my recommendations (matches)....For the first time in a long time, I am excited to see what the future holds for me.”""I wanted to update you on my son's progress. Since Jeffrey started therapy at his new treatment center, he has progressed leaps and bounds. He STOOD for the first time all by himself...I am so thankful we found you.""""I had given up on recovery years ago, but you've inspired me to try again, and for that I will forever be grateful."" Problem Utilize Health Solves Patients lack knowledge of potentially life changing treatments because some therapies are considered new, and they are not well publicized. Utilize Health solves this problem by creating smart matching technology that helps patients: 

Learn about treatments 

Locate facilities with those treatments 

Engage with that facility by scheduling an appointment through the Utilize Health platform 
6 Conditions Utilize Health currently helps patients with 6 neurological conditions: stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, muscular dystrophy, cerebral palsy, and multiple sclerosis. These 6 different conditions encompass more than 11 million people in the United States.As Utilize Health grows, we hope to expand our services to other patient populations in the future._________________________________________________________________________How Will the Funds be Used?Our initial goal is $60K. The funds will be used for web application development. The biggest drivers behind the cost of the website are:
A proprietary algorithm, using several data sets to match patient conditions to therapy options and the qualified facilities, taking into account financial and geographic constraints.
A specialized user interface which is both ADA compliant and specifically designed for users with various neurological disabilities.
HIPAA compliance for security and privacy of personal health information.
All of these compound the complexity of the development and take what might appear on the surface as a less expensive app and make it more expensive to develop.Our first stretch goal is $100K. We need the additional funds for maintenance and operational expenses (i.e., hiring Patient Advocates for the first 6 months). Web Development: We have contracted with a firm in Nashville, TN. They are ready to start building the web application and matching algorithms as soon as we give them the green light. Some of the funding will also be used towards hiring a User Experience (UX) Developer. As you can imagine, many Utilize Health users will have limited upper extremity mobility. We want to ensure an easy and seamless user experience for anyone who uses Utilize Health's website.If we do not reach our entire goal, we will have to critically limit the scope of our web application. Certain features, like scheduling an appointment directly through the Utilize Health platform, may not be available. The more funds we raise, the more intuitive the web application will be. In addition, Utilize Health will be able to offer more features for our users. Below are some mocks ups of the website: (Note: This is subject to change based on the amount of funding we receive.) _________________________________________________________________________How Does it Work?Utilize Health is incredibly easy to use! After signing up, a user will be prompted to go through the following steps:1. Create a User Profile: A user will be prompted to fill out a personal profile. You'll provide us with easy information like name, date of birth, and zip code.   2. Fill Out a Health Questionnaire: A user will be prompted to fill out a health questionnaire. You'll be asked questions about your injury/prognosis, date of onset, etc. You set the guidelines for us. Are you willing to travel? If so, how far? We will use all this information to best help you. The more information you provide us with, the better we can assist you in finding the best therapies and facilities for you!3. Browse Your Matches: Based on the information you provided us, we match you with the best possible facilities and therapies. Click on each match to read about the types of therapies and treatments the facility offers.4. Schedule a Visit: Choose the facility that you want to visit. Every facility is different. Every patient is different. After reading through your matches, you choose the facility that best suits your needs.
What is a Patient Advocate Subscription?Utilize Health offers a baseline matching service FREE to all of its members. This is the core of what we do. We also understand that some patients need more than that. In addition to our free service, Utilize Health offers a paid upgrade subscription service for members. Think of this service as more of a concierge-like service for patients. Patient Advocates can assist patients with obtaining scripts from their physicians, providing additional research on a particular type of therapy, and/or discuss patient matches more in depth. Having a Patient Advocate Subscription allows a patient or family member to schedule a call anytime they want with one of Utilize Health's Patient Advocates. Our Patient Advocates will also send periodic emails to check in to make sure things are going well. _________________________________________________________________________Perks and Prizes 
See below for a complete offering of all our prizes and perks. What is a Hatch Print? It's really cool...trust us. It's a poster that is designed and printed in a unique way. Go to www.hatchshowprint.com for more info. *Note: Prizes are subject to change in regards to font, color, and design used on all promotional items. The Hatch Print is on backorder. Estimated time of delivery is September 2014. _________________________________________________________________________The Impact11 million people in the United States have a physical disability due to a neurological condition such as a stroke or a spinal cord injury. The types of conditions that Utilize Health helps are life-altering. As you read above, Utilize Health has already matched more than 100 patients to therapies and facilities across the United States. Here's some more of what patients and their family members have said:“You have given me something that no one has been able to give me - hope. After my son suffered a closed head traumatic brain injury, the doctors said he would remain in a vegetative state. My wife and I have been searching for treatment options since his accident. When we were referred to Utilize Health, our Patient Advocate helped us learn about what options were out there. Thank you and to all of the Utilize Health Team.”""It's been 21 years since I have participated in PT and OT. I look forward to starting a new kind of physical therapy."" When you back our Indiegogo campaign, the impact for patients with neurological conditions is life-changing. When patients are aware of what resources are available, they can make informed decisions about their healthcare. Utilize Health takes its philosophy a step further. Not only do we help patients learn about resources, we help patients and their families locate and engage with those facilities and therapies. _________________________________________________________________________Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can’t contribute financially, there's several other meaningful ways you can help us:

Share Utilize Health's Indiegogo Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. Don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools at the bottom of this page :) It makes it quick and easy!

Email friends and family to request their support. We'll even give you a template to use. Just ask us, and we'll email it to you. 
Let's make some noise!! Together, we can help patients with neurological disabilities and their families find the resources that they need to maximize their potential for recovery. Join us, and together we can make a real difference in people's lives! _________________________________________________________________________

<h3>My name is Cynthia. When my fiance and I learned of our pregnancy we were elated! Just absolutely overjoyed and excited. At 15 weeks we decided to move to SWFL to share this pregnancy with my parents being that it would be their first grandchild. They too were overjoyed. The transfer from our original restaurant location to the SWFL restaurant location was NOT done properly by our manager which means that we didn't have a job to pick up where we left off in saving up for this wonderful gift God had blessed us with. After fighting for our jobs and persuing the correction of someone else's mistake out of our control we finally got a schedule with our new location. That was enough stress to croak a horse and it took six and half weeks to do. The weekend before we are to start at this new location my Godmother is hit by a car which took off after leaving her to die in the street. This new locaiton couldn't assign a comparible position of what we were in the original restaurant; not even close. My fiance was a head line chef and is now bussing tables for $5 an hour and the tips alone are barely enough to cover gas for the time between shifts. The $5/hr. doesn't even cover the amount of insurance deductible that weekly comes out of his paychecks. Every week we are more and more behind because the hours to wage ratio isn't enough to cover the arears that have accrued from the transfer not being done properly or in a timely manner. What has added up over those weeks that we didn't work is being taken in full, taking every cent of his paycheck every week forcing us to live on his bussing tips which is no where near the amount servers make. It's calculated at just barely 1% of what the house makes while he's on the floor.</h3>
<h3><strong>We started at this transferred location a the weekend after my Godmother gets hit by a car and dies on the scene. Her memorial service is held the following weekend. I go into labor that night at her reception dinner. I gave birth to Kilee three and a half months early in my opinion due to the stress that the past 3 months had brought on. The neonatal doctors that were on scene when I told them that she is coming whether anyone likes it or not informed us that the chances of her survival depended on whether or not they were going to be able to fit the smallest tube they had available down her tiny little throat so that they could stabilze her. Luckily enough she was just barely big enough for the smallest equipment they had available. The percentage of Kilee being considered a normal functioning member of society because of her brain bleed status is less than 2%. We literally prayed to God throughout the entire birth. Kilee is now 1 month and 2 days old and fighting hard to stay alive. The brain bleed she was born with is still in critical condition and has only retracted a very small amount. Every day she makes it through is a blessing and at any moment she could be called up into God's kingdom to become one of his angels. We have prayer chains that have formed all across the country. Sadly enough though prayer doesn't pay our bills that have accumulated throughout this whole process. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The following is the breakdown of the funds that we are looking for to help us keep a roof over our head and to have a home for when or if Kilee is released from the hospital. They are also going to help us keep our only form of transportation and maintain decent progressive payments torwards all the medical bills and appointment fees that have accumulated so far... I have no idea how much this event will come to once she is released which is estimated to be February of 2013 if everything goes the best way. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>5 months of Car Payments: $1500</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Gas/wear &amp; tear: $1400 (if she isn't transferred to a hospital further away)</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Utilities/Rent: $3000</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Baby Gear: $1500 (we weren't prepared for her arrival to be this early we hadn't even started putting together a list of the necessities)</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The rest will literally go to medical bills and appointment fees for the first couple of months of Kilee's life if and or when she is released from the hospital.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The contributions that are provided will be deeply appreciated and we as a family will forever be thankful. I don't have a materialistic or monetary ""perk"" to give in return only our gratitude and the gift of God's blessing to all who are helpful to others. I wish we could do more to express how grateful we would be to even get one helping hand from this site. I believe there are still truly genuine souls still out there that care for their fellow man and know that God wouldn't hand us these kinds of things if we couldn't handle them. </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>If you can't contribute anything financially that is completely understandable, but I do ask to help us get this story out publicly, spread the word that one of God's tiniest angels is in dire straights and needs help. I know he will return the gratitude to those who believe in him and bless those who have faith. If anyone has suggestions or comments please feel free to share those as well. </strong></h3>

However, the pain point for every user is the same – there is no way to measure them!

Circuband comes with a range of attachments that can be used with any resistance band less than 38mm wide (Most Elastic Bands)</p><p>2. The length of the bands can be changed making each exercise harder or easier. This is important when maintaining good form or when there's not much room.  </p><p>3. The band can either be used in a closed or open configuration meaning that you get ""All in One"" functionality.</p><p> </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/179967517?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471994720/prgipjdzcfo6puib6jyi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>This unique design allowed us to incorporate StretchSense's world class sensors..</strong></p><p>1. The sensors are built into a separate and non-adjustable component meaning that they work irrespective of what length or resistance the adjoining bands are.</p><p>2. The sensors are designed and built by a separate company, StretchSense, and are some of the most accurate sensors in the world at monitoring stretch of an object.  </p><p>3. They are charged through micro-USB and operate via a 10 channel Bluetooth Sensor meaning that both the user, specialist or clinician have ultimate connectivity between devices and the app.</p><div>

<p> </p>
</div><p>The potential of Circuband is huge. The sensor can transmit data on all kinds of resisted movement and will now only record what you are lifting but also tell you how well you are lifting. This is tremendously important for anybody who is serious about training or rehabilitating athletes using elastic bands. Not only will results and progress be easily obtained, but the research will paint a much clearer picture of what is working and what is not when it comes time to formulate best practice.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472349703/yftylkfpoum7oezpt7wa.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Who can use our Products?</strong></p><p>Our Products are used by a huge variety of people including those from professional sports teams.

They are dedicating a team of designers and engineers to help make this all happen and they will provide half the funding necessary to make this happen. The catch is that we need to fund the other half. The reason that they are backing us is that these sensors will allow physiotherapy and strength training to be measured more closely than ever before. This will reduce the cost of physical therapy long term and also allow people lead healthier lives.

However, the pain point for every user is the same – there is no way to measure them! That's why we designed Circuband - The Ultimate Resistance Band. From next year Circuband will include an Advanced Stretch Sensor to Monitor All Forms of Resistance Training  Even without the sensor, Circuband has some significant points of difference...1. Circuband comes with a range of attachments that can be used with any resistance band less than 38mm wide (Most Elastic Bands)2. The length of the bands can be changed making each exercise harder or easier. This is important when maintaining good form or when there's not much room.  3. The band can either be used in a closed or open configuration meaning that you get ""All in One"" functionality.  This unique design allowed us to incorporate StretchSense's world class sensors..1. The sensors are built into a separate and non-adjustable component meaning that they work irrespective of what length or resistance the adjoining bands are.2. The sensors are designed and built by a separate company, StretchSense, and are some of the most accurate sensors in the world at monitoring stretch of an object.  3. They are charged through micro-USB and operate via a 10 channel Bluetooth Sensor meaning that both the user, specialist or clinician have ultimate connectivity between devices and the app.

 
The potential of Circuband is huge. The sensor can transmit data on all kinds of resisted movement and will now only record what you are lifting but also tell you how well you are lifting. This is tremendously important for anybody who is serious about training or rehabilitating athletes using elastic bands. Not only will results and progress be easily obtained, but the research will paint a much clearer picture of what is working and what is not when it comes time to formulate best practice.Who can use our Products?Our Products are used by a huge variety of people including those from professional sports teams. However, anybody can use them because of the way they are designed. Even though the maximum resistance can be made to 120lbs, that come come right down to 5-10lbs if required by simply adjusting the length of the band. We have plenty of videos showing you how to use Circuband and you can request one for use in certain environments if you need some inspiration.Our Success to DateAfter 2 years our customers comprise of some of the best sports teams, athletes and organisations in the world including the All Blacks, The Australian Cricket Team, The New Zealand Army, Olympic Athletes and about 1000 members of the New Zealand public. As a result of this success we were nominated for the Deloitte Rising Star and NZ Innovation Awards and received a project grant from the NZ government who decided to step up and help incorporate the latest Sensors into our patented design. They are dedicating a team of designers and engineers to help make this all happen and they will provide half the funding necessary to make this happen. The catch is that we need to fund the other half. The reason that they are backing us is that these sensors will allow physiotherapy and strength training to be measured more closely than ever before. This will reduce the cost of physical therapy long term and also allow people lead healthier lives. However, it's not just the New Zealand Government taking notice. We have also had interest from NFL teams, Under Armour, Apple and many other High Profile Specialists who know a tonne about fitness.However, none of this means much unless we receive your help and there is a very easy way for you to do just that!What You Can Expect From UsA Circuband customer is a happy one because we appreciate that people are investing their hard earned money in exchange for our products. We have always seen business through the eyes of the consumer. This philosophy not only allows us to design effective and practical products that actually work, but it also ensures that the customer gets all the support they need from day one. After all, the only reason we have succeeded to date is word of mouth and a solid product! What Can You Expect From Us In The Years to Come?In the years to come we’ll see Virtual Reality Integration to enhance the user experience once again and increase people’s motivation to work out even more. This will be done through VR programmes that allow people to complete every exercise more confidently and with the feeling that they are wherever they want to be in the world at any given time.So how is the government investing in Circuband?Callaghan Innovation is a government agency that helps businesses succeed through Research &Development.

<p>I sell a vest full of ice that's designed to burn calories.</p>
<p>I'm a NASA scientist and a professor. What you're about to read is going to sound like science fiction, but it's not. Scientists have spent decades studying how mild cold exposure can enhance calorie burn. Quietly, and without fuss, the evidence for cold exposure induced calorie burn has been accumulating. It's time to bring the science to the public. That's what I'm here to do: to explain to you what is probably the most novel, evidence-based calorie-burning idea that's come out of the scientific community in many years, and to tell you how you can take advantage of it without pain, without discomfort, and without taking more than 2 minutes of time out of your busy day. With IndieGogo's help, we'll be able to bring this vest to the masses at a reasonable price.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>Let's be blunt: there is no magic pill for weight loss, and The Cold Shoulder PRO Calorie Burning Vest is no exception to that rule. The cold, hard truth is that the foundation of weight control is your diet. In order to maintain a healthy weight, do what grandma told you: eat your veggies, cut the fat off your steak, and avoid junk food, especially sweets. If you continue to eat junk, then no amount of exercise, cold exposure, or weirdly named supplements or powders will help you lose weight. The vest can burn up to 500 calories per day if used as directed, but you can easily nullify the effect by eating an extra 500 extra calories. So don't expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight. You can't. But if you are already eating well and getting moderate exercise and want to accelerate your calorie-burning efforts by burning excess calories while at rest, there's no simpler, easier, or more time-efficient way than wearing our vest.<div>

<p>Whether you're an athlete, an actor/model, or a couch potato, almost everybody today could benefit from burning a few more calories without expending time or effort. <b>Note that T<i>he Cold Shoulder PRO Calorie Burning Vest</i> cannot claim to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease, illness or condition.</b></p>
<br/><p></p>
<h1>The problem - Exercise is not the only way to burn calories</h1>
<p>The first thing I always hear when I say I’m touting a “cold vest” is, “I don’t like being cold.” But think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat. Starving themselves? Eating zero-calorie clay just to feel full, which carries a risk of arsenic poising? Exhausting themselves in the gym? Ingesting questionable supplements that, if they work at all, have side effects like insomnia or over‐stimulation? How about wearing a corset just to appear thinner? Drug injections? Liposuction? Freezing fat cells? Gastro‐intestinal surgery? Considering these options, wearing a cool, calorie-burning vest is pretty tame in comparison. <i>The Cold Shoulder</i> has no known side effects. Users who start skeptical end up wearing it routinely, and even find they look forward to putting it on at the end of a long day.</p>
<p>There is an aspect of the calorie equation that has been largely neglected for too long. There is a huge hole in our collective knowledge. Although exercise is definitely good, most people think that exercise is the only way to burn excess calories. <b><i>But it's not.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<h1>The Solution - Burn excess calories using mild cold exposure</h1>
<p>In addition to exercise, there’s another, much less well known but scientifically well-established way to burn calories. It’s called mild cold exposure. Basically, if you extract heat from your body, even if you’re sitting on your couch in front of the T.V., your body will need to burn calories to stay warm. This is a scientific fact – and I should know, since I work at NASA with a group of scientists that study ice. The trick is to figure out how to harness mild cold exposure without being uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The idea of using mild cold exposure to burn calories has slowly started to percolate into the popular media. Articles on the subject have appeared in many places, including the venues mentioned at the top of this page. The problem is that they often recommend painful or impractical methods of cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths. Very few people have the courage to try that.</p>
<p>I was studying the science of how cold exposure burns calories, when I had a light-bulb moment. I thought, ""If cold exposure burns calories, there’s got to be a way I can harness its power to help ordinary people increase their calorie burn."" That’s when I began the work that eventually led me to develop <i>The Cold Shoulder</i>. It's a vest that drapes ice over the shoulder and back, and extracts calories while you wear it. </p>
<p>There are two versions of the vest; our <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/969324769/the-cold-shoulder-calorie-burning-vest/description"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">previous KickStarter campaign</a> introduced the first <i>Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest</i>, which we now call <i>The Classic. </i>It's a finely tailored garment, suitable to wear in public, even with a suit and tie or in a formal setting.  In fact, some of our supporters who own the <i>Classic</i> wear it to work, one woman even wears it when she's playing her instrument in an orchestra under the hot stage lights!</p>
<p>For those who don't need a fancy, formal vest, we've designed the <i>PRO, </i>which is less expensive, one-size-fits-all, and simpler:</p>

<p><i><b>The Science Behind Cold-exposure Based Calorie Burn</b></i></p>
<p>You don't need to be a scientist to understand that<i> too much</i> cold exposure – such as, say, floating in the North Atlantic after the Titanic sank – can extract so many calories so quickly that it can kill you. On the other hand, <i>mild </i>cold exposure is perfectly healthy, and has been studied by scientists for decades as a way to burn calories.</p>
<p>For example, Olympic swimmers burn many more calories per day than other Olympic athletes, and it has nothing to do with the exercise. <i><b>It’s the water.</b></i> They spend their day in water that’s 20 degrees (F) below their body temperature, and this temperature difference makes them burn <b><i>way </i></b>more calories than the exercise alone.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Due to the temperature difference between the body and the water, heat flows from the body to the water, burning many more calories than the exercise alone."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/004/909/861/2b4ea5adfeb2e91a4f429d071e489f94_original.jpeg?v=1447478458&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=4604831cbc669f7e7a25ebc7a822981f"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Due to the temperature difference between the body and the water, heat flows from the body to the water, burning many more calories than the exercise alone.</figcaption></figure><p></p>
<p>Any mild cold exposure causes your body to burn extra calories, whether it’s a cold day outside, air conditioning set too high, or your skin being in contact with a cold object. Scientists have been studying the effects of mild cold exposure for decades, and it’s a well documented fact that mild cold exposure induces calorie burn.</p>
<p>Our vest, The Cold Shoulder, has ice draped over the shoulder and across the back:</p>

<p></p>
<h1>Comfort</h1>
<p>The ice locations on <i>The Cold Shoulder</i> are the most comfortable places to put the ice because that's where your body has the fewest nerve endings. It's also the most scientifically valid place to put the ice because, just under the skin of the shoulders and back, there's a type of tissue called<i> Brown Adipose Tissue </i>(<b>BAT</b>). BAT burns calories when you encounter mild cold. Our clinical trials show that wearing our vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to <b>500 calories more per day</b> than you'd burn without it.</p>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>How to maximize effectiveness of <i>The Cold Shoulder</i>
</h1>
<p>We'd like to emphasize exactly under what conditions <i>The Cold Shoulder</i> can induce the burning of excess calories. Basically, you need to be in an environment where you are otherwise at a comfortable temperature, and you are not exercising. If you are sitting down at rest in a room (or your car, or whatever) that is at a comfortable temperature, then wearing The Cold Shoulder directly from the freezer, and with a shirt underneath, will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm.</p>
<p>If you are in a hot environment, the The Cold Shoulder will help you stay cool, but it won't burn excess calories, because you're not cold. If you are working out in the gym, then The Cold Shoulder can help you stay cool, and can even help you cool down after a workout, but will not enhance your calorie burn, because you're not cold in that environment. If the vest is not cold, or if the ice has all melted, it will not induce excess calorie burn. Remember that the goal of The Cold Shoulder is to force you to burn calories at a time when you otherwise would not: sitting down, at rest, in a comfortable environment at room temperature.</p>
<p>So, to burn excess calories, wear The Cold Shoulder sitting on the couch watching the game, or in front of your computer, or in your car during your commute. Any time you'd normally just be sitting around comfortable---that's the time to don The Cold Shoulder PRO Calorie Burning Vest and enhance your calorie burn.</p>

<h1>Why we need you!</h1>
<p>Although we have the designs and prototypes finished and our manufacturer stands ready to produce the vests, the cost of production is high unless we fulfill minimum order quantities. In order to cover the costs of fabric and production at this level, we need to commit to this minimum order quantity to secure the best deal, which can then be passed onto you, with special rewards exclusively offered here on IndieGogo!</p>
<h1>Will it fit me?</h1>
<p>We have tried <i>The Cold Shoulder PRO</i> vest on people with chest sizes ranging from 36 inches up to 60 inches, and it fits no problem. It's a one-size-fits-all vest with elastic straps and buckles, both of which can be adjusted to fit bodies with a huge range of sizes and shapes.</p>
<h1>Production plan</h1>
<p>We have a large, responsive manufacturer standing ready to fulfill as many as 8,000 vests within a 3-month time frame. To ensure quality construction, we’re overseeing manufacturing of our vests and will provide regular updates to our IndieGogo supporters. The <i>CryoMAX </i>ice is made in the USA. <i>CryoMAX</i> sells about $100M worth of their gel ice each year, and will have no problem producing large volumes of ice for us on short notice.  Once the vests are made, we’ll prepare them for shipment (at most 1-2 weeks), and then ship them to your door (2-3 days Domestic US, or 2-4 weeks International).</p>
<p>Note that the PRO has about 9 lbs (4 kg) worth of <i>CryoMAX</i> gel, which is why shy shipping is so expensive due to the heavy weight.</p>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>Our Guarantee</h1>
<p>We are confident that you will be happy with your vests and the results it will produce, but if for any reason you’re not completely satisfied, just send it back (you pay shipping, and please give us a “heads up” first), and we'll repair or replace your vest and ship it back to you free of charge.</p>
<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!</h1>
<p>Please take a look at the rewards - we hope you'll take advantage of our special early bird offer, but any contribution big or small helps lots! We'd also be so grateful if you would help us share this campaign via email, FB, and twitter!</p>

The vest is very comfortable."" -- Shawn""One of the best cold vests out there and the guy behind them knows what he is talking about."" -- David Choy.Why you’ll love The Cold Shoulder1. Backed by 50 years of science. Scientists have studied how mild cold exposure can burn calories since the 1960s.2. Burns calories without exercise. Whether you’re a gym rat or a couch potato, our ice vest will burn excess calories for you – the equivalent of up to 500 calories a day. This can more than double the calorie deficit you'd get from dieting alone.3. Saves time. It takes about 30s to get the vest out of the freezer and put it on, and then continue with your day. Compare that to the hours out of your day it takes to visit the gym once you include travel, change, and shower time.4. It’s comfortable. No shivering! After trying it a few times, you’ll hardly notice you’re wearing it.5. It gets more effective the more you use it. Your body adapts to the idea of turning on your internal furnace to burn calories, making the vest more effective the more you use it.6. Has other benefits such as improving sleep, helping alleviate aches and pains, helping to ""cure"" people who always feel cold, among others.7. Sold direct at wholesale prices. Expect to pay significantly more once this is available in retail stores. There’s no middleman on IndieGogo. We’ll manufacture your vest and ship it directly to you.
The Cold Shoulder featured in:Our story
I sell a vest full of ice that's designed to burn calories.
I'm a NASA scientist and a professor. What you're about to read is going to sound like science fiction, but it's not. Scientists have spent decades studying how mild cold exposure can enhance calorie burn. Quietly, and without fuss, the evidence for cold exposure induced calorie burn has been accumulating. It's time to bring the science to the public. That's what I'm here to do: to explain to you what is probably the most novel, evidence-based calorie-burning idea that's come out of the scientific community in many years, and to tell you how you can take advantage of it without pain, without discomfort, and without taking more than 2 minutes of time out of your busy day. With IndieGogo's help, we'll be able to bring this vest to the masses at a reasonable price.
Let's be blunt: there is no magic pill for weight loss, and The Cold Shoulder PRO Calorie Burning Vest is no exception to that rule. The cold, hard truth is that the foundation of weight control is your diet. In order to maintain a healthy weight, do what grandma told you: eat your veggies, cut the fat off your steak, and avoid junk food, especially sweets. If you continue to eat junk, then no amount of exercise, cold exposure, or weirdly named supplements or powders will help you lose weight. The vest can burn up to 500 calories per day if used as directed, but you can easily nullify the effect by eating an extra 500 extra calories. So don't expect that you can continue to eat junk food, wear the vest, and lose weight. You can't. But if you are already eating well and getting moderate exercise and want to accelerate your calorie-burning efforts by burning excess calories while at rest, there's no simpler, easier, or more time-efficient way than wearing our vest.

Whether you're an athlete, an actor/model, or a couch potato, almost everybody today could benefit from burning a few more calories without expending time or effort. Note that The Cold Shoulder PRO Calorie Burning Vest cannot claim to diagnose, treat, prevent, or cure any disease, illness or condition.

The problem - Exercise is not the only way to burn calories
The first thing I always hear when I say I’m touting a “cold vest” is, “I don’t like being cold.” But think of all the other crazy things people do in order to try to lose excess fat. Starving themselves? Eating zero-calorie clay just to feel full, which carries a risk of arsenic poising? Exhausting themselves in the gym? Ingesting questionable supplements that, if they work at all, have side effects like insomnia or over‐stimulation? How about wearing a corset just to appear thinner? Drug injections? Liposuction? Freezing fat cells? Gastro‐intestinal surgery? Considering these options, wearing a cool, calorie-burning vest is pretty tame in comparison. The Cold Shoulder has no known side effects. Users who start skeptical end up wearing it routinely, and even find they look forward to putting it on at the end of a long day.
There is an aspect of the calorie equation that has been largely neglected for too long. There is a huge hole in our collective knowledge. Although exercise is definitely good, most people think that exercise is the only way to burn excess calories. But it's not.

The Solution - Burn excess calories using mild cold exposure
In addition to exercise, there’s another, much less well known but scientifically well-established way to burn calories. It’s called mild cold exposure. Basically, if you extract heat from your body, even if you’re sitting on your couch in front of the T.V., your body will need to burn calories to stay warm. This is a scientific fact – and I should know, since I work at NASA with a group of scientists that study ice. The trick is to figure out how to harness mild cold exposure without being uncomfortable.
The idea of using mild cold exposure to burn calories has slowly started to percolate into the popular media. Articles on the subject have appeared in many places, including the venues mentioned at the top of this page. The problem is that they often recommend painful or impractical methods of cold exposure, like cold showers or ice baths. Very few people have the courage to try that.
I was studying the science of how cold exposure burns calories, when I had a light-bulb moment. I thought, ""If cold exposure burns calories, there’s got to be a way I can harness its power to help ordinary people increase their calorie burn."" That’s when I began the work that eventually led me to develop The Cold Shoulder. It's a vest that drapes ice over the shoulder and back, and extracts calories while you wear it. 
There are two versions of the vest; our previous KickStarter campaign introduced the first Cold Shoulder Calorie Burning Vest, which we now call The Classic. It's a finely tailored garment, suitable to wear in public, even with a suit and tie or in a formal setting.  In fact, some of our supporters who own the Classic wear it to work, one woman even wears it when she's playing her instrument in an orchestra under the hot stage lights!
For those who don't need a fancy, formal vest, we've designed the PRO, which is less expensive, one-size-fits-all, and simpler:

The Cold Shoulder PRO Calorie Burning Vest

Now powered with CryoMAX long-lasting gel!

We are proud to announce that The Cold Shoulder has entered into an exclusive partnership with CryoMAX in the calorie burning vest market. CryoMAX gel is a patented, food-grade glycerin (which basically means it's so safe you could drink it without any ill-effects).  CryoMAXgel is flexible even when frozen and can stay cold up to 8 hours, as their own scientific tests have shown:

Does The Cold Shoulder work?
I have put it to the scientific test and proved this vest's efficacy in controlled trials. Here are a few before-and-after shots after just 3 weeks of using The Cold Shoulder Classic:

Considering all the crazy things that people do to burn excess fat, from starvation diets to liposuction, a vest that burns calories while you continue about your day seems pretty tame, don't you think?




How does it work?
The Science Behind Cold-exposure Based Calorie Burn
You don't need to be a scientist to understand that too much cold exposure – such as, say, floating in the North Atlantic after the Titanic sank – can extract so many calories so quickly that it can kill you. On the other hand, mild cold exposure is perfectly healthy, and has been studied by scientists for decades as a way to burn calories.
For example, Olympic swimmers burn many more calories per day than other Olympic athletes, and it has nothing to do with the exercise. It’s the water. They spend their day in water that’s 20 degrees (F) below their body temperature, and this temperature difference makes them burn way more calories than the exercise alone.

Due to the temperature difference between the body and the water, heat flows from the body to the water, burning many more calories than the exercise alone.
Any mild cold exposure causes your body to burn extra calories, whether it’s a cold day outside, air conditioning set too high, or your skin being in contact with a cold object. Scientists have been studying the effects of mild cold exposure for decades, and it’s a well documented fact that mild cold exposure induces calorie burn.
Our vest, The Cold Shoulder, has ice draped over the shoulder and across the back:

Due to the temperature difference between the body and the ice vest, heat flows from the body to the vest, causing your body to burn calories.

Comfort
The ice locations on The Cold Shoulder are the most comfortable places to put the ice because that's where your body has the fewest nerve endings. It's also the most scientifically valid place to put the ice because, just under the skin of the shoulders and back, there's a type of tissue called Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT). BAT burns calories when you encounter mild cold. Our clinical trials show that wearing our vest twice a day for about an hour burns up to 500 calories more per day than you'd burn without it.

How to maximize effectiveness of The Cold Shoulder

We'd like to emphasize exactly under what conditions The Cold Shoulder can induce the burning of excess calories. Basically, you need to be in an environment where you are otherwise at a comfortable temperature, and you are not exercising. If you are sitting down at rest in a room (or your car, or whatever) that is at a comfortable temperature, then wearing The Cold Shoulder directly from the freezer, and with a shirt underneath, will extract heat from your body and cause you to burn extra calories in order to stay warm.
If you are in a hot environment, the The Cold Shoulder will help you stay cool, but it won't burn excess calories, because you're not cold. If you are working out in the gym, then The Cold Shoulder can help you stay cool, and can even help you cool down after a workout, but will not enhance your calorie burn, because you're not cold in that environment. If the vest is not cold, or if the ice has all melted, it will not induce excess calorie burn. Remember that the goal of The Cold Shoulder is to force you to burn calories at a time when you otherwise would not: sitting down, at rest, in a comfortable environment at room temperature.
So, to burn excess calories, wear The Cold Shoulder sitting on the couch watching the game, or in front of your computer, or in your car during your commute. Any time you'd normally just be sitting around comfortable---that's the time to don The Cold Shoulder PRO Calorie Burning Vest and enhance your calorie burn.

Example trial result - Nick Hamilton


Below is a graph of the body fat of Nick Hamilton over a 16-week period. Nick was one of our early testers of The Cold Shoulder. He was on a 16 week, tightly controlled diet and exercise regimen. The only change Nick made in the last 2 weeks was to start using The Cold Shoulder ice vest. You can see how much it accelerated his fat loss.

Nick Hamilton greatly accelerated his fat loss just by wearing The Cold Shoulder for an hour each morning and evening, for the last 2 weeks of his 16-week diet + exercise regimen.

Evidence from independent scientists


For more info on cold exposure and calorie burn, see this page. Note that some of it is rather technical---definitely not light reading. But if you want some of the cold, hard scientific facts from independent researchers, this is the place to start. Most of the research was done even before I conceived of The Cold Shoulder, so you know it's independent and objective.
The PRO Vest Shots













Our Mission
We want to bring the most functional, comfortable, and stylish clothing-based calorie-burning aid to the global market. We want to spread the word that burning calories doesn’t have to require time-consuming gym visits, sweaty exercise, crazy calorie-restricted diet fads, or taking untested, questionable supplements with unknown side effects. Instead, we advocate that a healthy lifestyle must contain not only a healthy diet and moderate exercise, but also a regular dose of mild cold exposure.




Why we need you!
Although we have the designs and prototypes finished and our manufacturer stands ready to produce the vests, the cost of production is high unless we fulfill minimum order quantities. In order to cover the costs of fabric and production at this level, we need to commit to this minimum order quantity to secure the best deal, which can then be passed onto you, with special rewards exclusively offered here on IndieGogo!
Will it fit me?
We have tried The Cold Shoulder PRO vest on people with chest sizes ranging from 36 inches up to 60 inches, and it fits no problem. It's a one-size-fits-all vest with elastic straps and buckles, both of which can be adjusted to fit bodies with a huge range of sizes and shapes.
Production plan
We have a large, responsive manufacturer standing ready to fulfill as many as 8,000 vests within a 3-month time frame. To ensure quality construction, we’re overseeing manufacturing of our vests and will provide regular updates to our IndieGogo supporters. The CryoMAX ice is made in the USA. CryoMAX sells about $100M worth of their gel ice each year, and will have no problem producing large volumes of ice for us on short notice.  Once the vests are made, we’ll prepare them for shipment (at most 1-2 weeks), and then ship them to your door (2-3 days Domestic US, or 2-4 weeks International).
Note that the PRO has about 9 lbs (4 kg) worth of CryoMAX gel, which is why shy shipping is so expensive due to the heavy weight.

Our Guarantee
We are confident that you will be happy with your vests and the results it will produce, but if for any reason you’re not completely satisfied, just send it back (you pay shipping, and please give us a “heads up” first), and we'll repair or replace your vest and ship it back to you free of charge.

THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT!
Please take a look at the rewards - we hope you'll take advantage of our special early bird offer, but any contribution big or small helps lots! We'd also be so grateful if you would help us share this campaign via email, FB, and twitter!

<p>YOGA IS FOR EVERYONE - regardless of  body type, flexibility, or age.   As an inflexible yogi who has often been shamed for being “too skinny”, I want to be a role model of BODY POSITIVITY and healthy, holistic living for my students.  I've gained a lot of mental and physical strength through my Yoga practice,  after enduring many years of bad relationships with men and my body.  What I feel very strongly about NOW, is my potential to help eradicate BODY SHAMING, encourage FITNESS OVER FLATTERY, and empower others to truly understand that everyBODY - every life - is worth CELEBRATING.</p>

<p><b>Basal Body Temperature</b>, also known as waking body temperature, is your lowest body temperature of the day. To get an accurate reading, you must take your temperature orally when you first wake up in the morning, before you even sit up in bed. And you'll need to use a<b> Femometer (Basal Thermometer), which is sensitive enough to measure tiny changes in body temperature. </b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447575646/zbny4hlpwm1n6u5t3p1f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Before ovulation, your BBT probably ranges from <b>97.2 to about 97.8 degrees</b> Fahrenheit. But two or three days after you ovulate, hormonal changes cause a rise of 0.4 to 1.0 degree in your BBT, which lasts at least until your next period. If you become pregnant, your temperature will stay elevated throughout your pregnancy.</p>
<p>By <b>charting your BBT</b> for a few months, you'll be able to see whether there's a pattern to your cycle, which helps predict ovulation the next time around – as well as the best days to have sex. BBT charts can also <b>help your doctor pinpoint the cause of any infertility issues</b>. If certain phases of your cycle are short, you may have a hormonal imbalance, for example.</p>

<p><b>Cervical Fluid</b>, also known as vaginal discharge, is completely normal and healthy. Its thickness indicates when your estrogen levels rise ahead of ovulation. When it reaches a clear, egg-white consistency, then this is an<b> indicator of ovulation</b>. After ovulation, progesterone takes over and your cervical fluid becomes dry or sticky.</p>

Femometer is an intelligent Basal Body Temperature (BBT) thermometer that syncs to your phone, tracks and predicts your cycle, and alerts you to important natural changes in your body. Compatible with Android and iOS smart devices.


Femometer is for every woman, whether you’re tracking your period, timing your cycle to prevent pregnancy, or getting ready to start a family.











Whether you think you might be pregnant, or your’re simply trying to not ruin your favorite pair of underwear, Femometer can tell you when and why your period is coming.

Use the power of Basal Body Temperature to calculate your 6-day fertility window for pregnancy.

Know the days that you’re at high risk for getting pregnant.
Used in conjunction with other contraception methods, the Fertility Awareness Method decreases risk of pregnancy.



The first trimester is an important period for collecting your data to share with your doctor. Your temperature should stay elevated during pregnancy, and you should report any significant changes to your doctor as soon as possible.



With Femometer and the power of the smartphone she already uses every day, she can better understand what’s going on inside and make smart, safe decisions - making Femometer the perfect gift for anyone!




Phase I Hospital Trials are being conducted with women and doctors in three hospitals: Huzhou Maternity & Child Care Hospital,  Hunan Provincial Maternity & Child Care Hospital, Zhongshan Maternity & Child Care Hospital.









Basal Body Temperature, also known as waking body temperature, is your lowest body temperature of the day. To get an accurate reading, you must take your temperature orally when you first wake up in the morning, before you even sit up in bed. And you'll need to use a Femometer (Basal Thermometer), which is sensitive enough to measure tiny changes in body temperature. 

Before ovulation, your BBT probably ranges from 97.2 to about 97.8 degrees Fahrenheit. But two or three days after you ovulate, hormonal changes cause a rise of 0.4 to 1.0 degree in your BBT, which lasts at least until your next period. If you become pregnant, your temperature will stay elevated throughout your pregnancy.
By charting your BBT for a few months, you'll be able to see whether there's a pattern to your cycle, which helps predict ovulation the next time around – as well as the best days to have sex. BBT charts can also help your doctor pinpoint the cause of any infertility issues. If certain phases of your cycle are short, you may have a hormonal imbalance, for example.




Cervical Fluid, also known as vaginal discharge, is completely normal and healthy. Its thickness indicates when your estrogen levels rise ahead of ovulation. When it reaches a clear, egg-white consistency, then this is an indicator of ovulation. After ovulation, progesterone takes over and your cervical fluid becomes dry or sticky.











WHY ORDER NOW?
We will process shipments in the order that we receive them. Those who pre-order first through this campaign will receive their Femometer from the very first production batches after they are fully tested and ready for mass production.
WHEN WILL WE START SHIPPING?
We plan to ship Femometer in the first quarter-2016 timeframe. The Femometer team will keep you up to date on progress and on the expected delivery date of your order.
WHERE WILL WE SHIP?
We are able to ship worldwide. Shipping costs are already included for USA. There is a change of $6 for shipping to the rest of the world. For multi-packs (Femometer 2 packs, 10 packs or more), shipping charges decrease per unit. Please see perk details for the shipping cost that applies to you.

<li>Space to move in! We need a lot of floor space and a bit of height. We'll need to give our landlord a deposit and show them that we can pay a few months rent up front.</li>
<li>Improvements to that space! Because of our physical requirements, we're looking at industrial spaces. It might be pretty raw when we move in.

<li>Toys! We will need various styles of yoga mats, crash pads, heavy bags, speed bags, instruments, free weights...

<li>Amazing teachers! We'd love to believe that our doors will be beaten down on day one by all of New York's excited up and coming elite athletes! But let's be real; it takes time for a business to grow. We know the first few months will be tight, and we want to be ready for it. Our biggest operational expense will be our teachers' pay.

<br/><p></p></div>","Since 2006,  Njoli Brown and his team of all-star instructors have been offering classes in capoeira, Filipino martial arts, yoga, Afro-Brazilian Dance and general fitness/development programs in parks, schools and wellness venues throughout the city, across the country and internationally! MSMB was started in 2015 by Njoli Brown as a way to offer all of these elements under one roof.  Adults and youths can access all of the benefits of elite martial arts, fitness and wellness training. In addition to offering a playful, fun, and skill-oriented route to fitness, MSMB will act as a community hub, hosting social events and building lasting friendships.

Now we want to give our dream a place to hang its hat!

After long discussions with instructors, students and community members, we realized how many people were traveling all over the city to fill the holes left in their training and in their search for holistic wellness. We also found ourselves running from place to place in order to bring the best services to the communities we felt it important to serve.  Teaming up with some of the best martial arts, movement arts, fitness and wellness instructors from the region, the decision was made to open MSMB in New York City.

Here is where you come in. Starting a business takes a lot of money. We are not wealthy entrepreneurs, but we are skilled teachers, experienced business people, and passionate movement enthusiasts. We want to provide a space for movers of all kinds to come together, learn new things, make new friends, grow, and thrive. But we need your help to make this happen.




Here is what we need to make this real

Our goal is to raise $30,000 to make this the most epic of projects happen.
Here is what we need:



Space to move in! We need a lot of floor space and a bit of height. We'll need to give our landlord a deposit and show them that we can pay a few months rent up front.
Improvements to that space! Because of our physical requirements, we're looking at industrial spaces. It might be pretty raw when we move in. We expect we'll need to put in some flooring, install and rig some equipment, paint a bit, maybe build some walls, improve the bathrooms... anything that needs to be done to the space itself to make it a place you want to come and play in.







Toys! We will need various styles of yoga mats, crash pads, heavy bags, speed bags, instruments, free weights... Some of these things are very cheap (boxing & mma gloves!), but some of them are not at all (bags and weights...) and all together it adds up very quickly. The more we can raise, the more toys you all get to play with and the more gear to support your growth!
Amazing teachers! We'd love to believe that our doors will be beaten down on day one by all of New York's excited up and coming elite athletes! But let's be real; it takes time for a business to grow. We know the first few months will be tight, and we want to be ready for it. Our biggest operational expense will be our teachers' pay. They are the reason you will want to keep coming back here. They make us who we are and they are Worth. Every. Penny. Help us keep them teaching during our first few months of growth.




We feel the best way to reward you for contributing to our campaign is to get you to come and play with us, so we're offering access perks- free classes, memberships, private lessons. If you would like to support us from afar and you feel it is unlikely you will make it to New York to use your perk, please consider ""paying it forward."" For every contributor who chooses to Pay It Forward, the value of your perk with be added to our scholarship fund to provide access to low-income individuals and families.



**If you want to pay your perk forward, please send us a message to let us know. Thank you!



This isn't just another place to work out. It's not just a gym, or a business, or a way to lose weight. Something unique, invaluable, and extraordinary happens at the MSMB. Why believe us? We asked our members to fill you in...


""What I like most about my experience training with MSMB is simply the learning process; the progression of skills, how they're connected and how they're used. Each time I show up for a session I'm always learning something new or a new way to look at something old, as though, in rereading a favorite book, you find unfamiliar, unexplored pages.""~Kyle C, Bronx NY~
 ""...focused classes on addressing students' areas for improvement, building on existing capacities and sharing new and relevant information.""
~Jay B, Manila PH~
""Solid, methodical instruction with great attention to helpful details. A great mix of theory and application.The environment is one that gently removes egos and replaces them with the opportunity to really forge yourself. You leave with much more than you came in with.""
~Mike W, Brooklyn NY~
""... great use of founts of experiential learning and of oral traditions.  These are the alternative universities that are available only to the student who has the courage and resourcefulness to seek beyond what is pro-scripted and familiar...""
~Dagan B, Brooklyn NY~

</h3> <p>Periods can be the worst. From puberty to menopause, women experience all of the unglamorous, painful, and downright ickiness that being a women can entail. Many of us experience this with the help of sanitary feminine products and pain killers. However, what about the women who don’t have access to these items? </p>
<p>I was stunned when I realized that homeless women did not have ready access to feminine products during their periods. I mean, it makes sense, but I had never thought about it. For the past few weeks I couldn't stop thinking about how it should not be a luxury to have access to pads and tampons. It should be a right, especially when having a period is a fact of biology, not a conscious decision. So I decided to do something about it by starting Dignity For All. </p>
<p>Dignity For All is a non-profit project that aims to provide feminine hygiene products to women who could not otherwise afford them. We believe that dignity is not a luxury, and that all women should have access to safe, comfortable, and clean periods. We work with homeless outreach programs throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area to provide small kits of these products to women who need them.<br/></p>
<p>Each kit consists of enough tampons and sanitary napkins to last one full menstrual cycle. We also enclose small packets of ibuprofen, cleansing wipes, and some chocolate. They are packaged in a discreet and portable bag and taken to shelters in the area to be dispersed.<br/></p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I am a mother who wants the best for my child. My daughter had eczema. After concerns grew over the steroid skin creams that my daughter was being prescribed, I set out to find a better alternative. That was the genesis of Flowers N Flames personal care products.</p>
<p>I discovered how many of the things we use everyday, and consider necessities, have been manufactured to do us bodily harm. In finding a way to do better for my family and I, I want to offer something to the community, as well.  We have been deceived by mass marketing. Now, I can share something that is beneficial and useful for health and be informative too.  After healing my daughter's eczema with a moisturizing scrub, and body butter, I created other personal care products that we use everyday.</p>

<h3>Where does the backing go and what do contributors get?</h3>
<p>Once I created a few prototypes for my family and me, I also gave samples to my friends to test out. The feedback that I received was beyond what I was expecting. I decided to organize my creative endeavors into a legal entity.  My partner and I named it Flowers N Flames. Up to this point,  the company has been self - funded. However, I need a little bit of help.</p>
<p><u><strong>This is what the $2,600 will go towards:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>25 percent of all proceeds will go into a contingency fund for the future. This is to ensure that we can provide better service and correct any issues or frumbles that may occur with things like shipping, etc.</li>
<li>$500 will go towards a few festivals and bazaars. Festival season presents many opportunities and vending space comes with a fee</li>
<li>$500 goes towards marketing budget</li>
<li>$300 goes towards an official website development and maintenance </li>
<li> Proceeds will also cover printing costs for the labels. We plan to outsource another small business for our printing needs here in the Atlanta area.</li>
<li>A portion of the proceeds will go towards placement of Flowers N Flames products in a few local coops in the Atlanta area. </li>
<li>Packaging and more supplies are also needed</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Perks and the role of contributors</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Every backer than contributes a minimum of $15 will receive product. A ""Thank You"" is free and impersonal. I want my contributors to actually experience what I am creating.   </li>
<li>I want the feedback of my supporters: Do you like it? How can my products be improved? What are some flavor and scents you would like to see produced? What is your Flowers N Flames experience?</li>
</ul>
<p>If I do not reach my goal of $2,600, I will still remain encouraged and continue to create in order to fully fund the 2,600 that I am seeking to launch my line. The top priorities will be addressed first regardless if the total goal is met.</p>

<h3>The impact of your contribution</h3>
<p>By supporting this campaign, you are helping  a newly established small business make it through the first operational year. You will also be given a healthier alternative to try for yourself. Our products are valuable because there is a demand for personal care products that do not contain harmful chemicals.  The contribution is deeper than just monetary support. I want your feedback on what we have developed and future products that we plan to offer.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges that  I face is: This is a new business. There is always a risk  of failure when starting something new. I have already established Flowers N Flames and registered it legally with both the IRS and the state.  I have already purchased approximately 80 percent of the supplies that  I need outside of the packaging. I have a small but strong support system. People are excited to try these products. With that being said,I have narrowed down the major risks to these two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not only is this a new venture, but this is my first time attempting a venture like this one.  Not all of my customers will be located in Atlanta, Georgia. Outside of consignment, I am already planning to ship the majority of our products to people. With that being said, something could go wrong with shipping such as delays and damages. Other fees and charges could arise as well. That is why 25% of all proceeds are designated to start a contingency fund that will keep growing. 25% of the funds from this campaign is only the seed money to start that fund.</li>
<li>The deodorant isn't ideal for everyone. I designed this deodorant to neutralize odors and provide a mild scent. The goal was to avoid a heavy fragrance, commercial-like deodorant. This is not an anti-antiperspirant either. Perspiration is natural. That is how we eliminate toxins from our body. In addition to that, this deodorant is designed to: detox the armpits/glands, and balance the PH. This is a great product but not for everyone. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Can you help?</h3>
<p>The point of this campaign is to raise awareness to what I am doing and reach my financial goal so that  I can smoothly operate this company and create more personal care products.Whether you can or cannot contribute financially, I could still use your help. Sharing this campaign will do so much. Indiegogo has a host of sharing tools for all of your social media. This campaign is only for 30 days. I need all of the eyes and support I can get on this campaign.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>You can mix and match your order. for instance. If you actually want to contribute $50 But would like to try the deodorant and tattoo salve only instead of the body butter and scrub, that option is available. Just simply message me and let me know.  Lip Balms automatically come with every order of $15 or more.</strong></p>

If I do not reach my goal of $2,600, I will still remain encouraged and continue to create in order to fully fund the 2,600 that I am seeking to launch my line. The top priorities will be addressed first regardless if the total goal is met.


The impact of your contribution
By supporting this campaign, you are helping  a newly established small business make it through the first operational year. You will also be given a healthier alternative to try for yourself. Our products are valuable because there is a demand for personal care products that do not contain harmful chemicals.  The contribution is deeper than just monetary support. I want your feedback on what we have developed and future products that we plan to offer.


Risks & Challenges
One of the biggest challenges that  I face is: This is a new business. There is always a risk  of failure when starting something new. I have already established Flowers N Flames and registered it legally with both the IRS and the state.  I have already purchased approximately 80 percent of the supplies that  I need outside of the packaging. I have a small but strong support system. People are excited to try these products. With that being said,I have narrowed down the major risks to these two things:

Not only is this a new venture, but this is my first time attempting a venture like this one.  Not all of my customers will be located in Atlanta, Georgia. Outside of consignment, I am already planning to ship the majority of our products to people. With that being said, something could go wrong with shipping such as delays and damages. Other fees and charges could arise as well. That is why 25% of all proceeds are designated to start a contingency fund that will keep growing. 25% of the funds from this campaign is only the seed money to start that fund.
The deodorant isn't ideal for everyone. I designed this deodorant to neutralize odors and provide a mild scent. The goal was to avoid a heavy fragrance, commercial-like deodorant. This is not an anti-antiperspirant either. Perspiration is natural. That is how we eliminate toxins from our body. In addition to that, this deodorant is designed to: detox the armpits/glands, and balance the PH. This is a great product but not for everyone. 


Can you help?
The point of this campaign is to raise awareness to what I am doing and reach my financial goal so that  I can smoothly operate this company and create more personal care products.Whether you can or cannot contribute financially, I could still use your help. Sharing this campaign will do so much. Indiegogo has a host of sharing tools for all of your social media. This campaign is only for 30 days. I need all of the eyes and support I can get on this campaign.
You can mix and match your order. for instance. If you actually want to contribute $50 But would like to try the deodorant and tattoo salve only instead of the body butter and scrub, that option is available. Just simply message me and let me know.  Lip Balms automatically come with every order of $15 or more.

<h2><b>It all starts with a good night's sleep...</b></h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We spend about one third of our life sleeping. Many of us try to shorten this time and fill it with ""more productive"" activities. However, this eventually works against us as sleep deprivation has negative effects on our productivity, mood and health </p>

<p>Technology is trying to aid this sleep deprivation epidemic
in the modern world. But our research found that most sleep aid devices on

true sleep solution. This is what drove us to develop the Somnus system.</p>

<h3>Power Nap</h3>
<p>Somnus's <b>Power Nap program </b>helps you doze off for 10~30 minutes, and recharge your body and mind, whenever you feel like it. Napping has been scientifically proven to improve your overall health and mood, while encouraging creativity. See what <b>Winston Churchill </b>had to say about napping:</p>
<blockquote>Nature has not intended mankind to work from eight in the morning until midnight without that refreshment of blessed oblivion which, even if it only lasts twenty minutes, is sufficient to renew all the vital forces.</blockquote>

</h3>
<p>Generates millions of negative ions and disperses them into the air. Negative ions bind with particulates in the air - such as floating fungi, dust and pollen - causing them to descend to the floor, helping to prevent allergies. Most importantly, the negative ions also act like airborne vitamins, helping to refresh your lungs and rejuvenate your brain and body.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>
<b>Vitaroma Diffuser</b> </h3>
<p>Diffuses essential oils into the air to create a pleasing and relaxing atmosphere. Your room will smell like a spring meadow full of flowers, trees, plants, and refresh air! Take a deep breath and experience the beauty of nature! </p>
<p>According to the National Sleep Foundation:</p>
<blockquote>In order to get a better sleep, you should surround yourself with scents you like. For example, lavender may decrease your heart rate and blood pressure. Soothing scents can improve your mood and help you prepare to sleep.</blockquote>
<p>Vitaroma Diffuser Technology is <i>patent pending</i>.</p>

<h2><b>Saturn Tracker - track your sleep and more</b></h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Somnus comes with a tracking device called Saturn tracker. It is a 32-bit MCU with precise 3D accelerometer, capable of sensing your movements throughout the day and night. Come nightfall, it tracks how long you slept, light sleep, sound sleep and awake and a result of sleep score will show you in your mobile app the next day. It comes with a clip and a wristband.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>

<h2><b>What's Inside?</b></h2>
<p>We
have integrated all of the electronic parts on printed circuit boards. There is
no signal interference. The speaker, blower fan, ionizer, LEDs,
and sensors have been integrated in an innovative way to fit into a relatively
small case. The result is a masterpiece of engineering on the inside and a
masterpiece of design on the outside.</p>

<h3><b>Is Somnus for you?</b></h3>

<br/><h2><b>How We Got Here</b></h2>
<p>For
the past 10 months we have worked, in cooperation with Sleep Center of Medical
University in Taiwan, to come up with the most comprehensive and
technologically advanced sleep aid. We've studied a variety of medical
information, including from The US National Sleep Foundation and Harvard
Medical School, in order to develop a revolutionary sleep-aid system. We choose
the best possible combination of sleep aid devices and then put all our efforts
into designing, coding, prototyping, testing, simulating, modifying and
refining them into a single, revolutionary sleep product.</p>

<div><br/></div>Below pictures show the measurement of brain wave during exercise and sleep. From the experiments we found that the theta wave not only display in sleep but also appear after certain amount of exercise. We assume the exercise may also helps the brain to do detoxication like University of Rochester Medical Center research team found - the <a href=""https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/labs/nedergaard-lab/projects/glymphatic_system"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">glymphatic system</a> helps to clean the harmful wastes of brain during sleep.</div><div>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Also, from our lighting experiments the <b>dimming</b> <i>red light and sound or music</i> will trigger your drowsiness if together with the <i>negative ions and essential oil aroma </i>you will fall asleep quickly. First of all, fall asleep easily and sleep soundly are the keys of good quality of sleep and Smart wake up become an icing on the cake!</p>

</div></div>","It all starts with a good night's sleep...

We spend about one third of our life sleeping. Many of us try to shorten this time and fill it with ""more productive"" activities. However, this eventually works against us as sleep deprivation has negative effects on our productivity, mood and health 
30% of people in the USA suffer from occasionally sleep disorder or insomnia (The Harvard Medical School Guide)

Technology is trying to aid this sleep deprivation epidemic
in the modern world. But our research found that most sleep aid devices on
the market are only slightly more advanced alarm clocks, that don't provide a
true sleep solution. This is what drove us to develop the Somnus system.


Somnus system for perfect sleep


Somnus System
The Somnus system consists of 3 elements:


Somnus 
Saturn tracker

Somnus mobile app 





Somnus - fall asleep easily, sleep better and wake up refreshed 

Somnus has 3  sleep programs and 3 supplementary programs to help you fall asleep quickly, sleep deep, and wake up energized! The programs are very easy to use  and manage with Somnus mobile app as explain as below:


I. Pre-Sleep Phase





The best way to fall asleep smoothly and sleep soundly is to relax.
The Somnus Easy sleep program is designed to simulate natural sleep environment our bodies got used to throughout human evolution, way before civilization with its artificial lighting and numerous distractions.  



Sunset simulation prepares your body to fall asleep by
gradually decreasing light.


Sound or music  will help you neutralize other distracting noises. 


Negative ions and essential oil aroma will make your body and mind feel as if you were outdoors.






II. Sleep Phase



During your sleep, Somnus will continue to monitor your bedroom environmental data, tracking your sleep quality and recording the light and noise that disturb your sleep. Also, with the continuing of the soft music, negative ions or white noise and essential oil aroma helping you switch from light sleep to deep sleep smoothly.

III. Pre-Wake Up/Wake Up Phase


Somnus’s Smart Wake Up program detects when you have entered your light sleep cycle and uses a combination of sound and negative ions to wake you up at your highest possible energy level. Once you are fully awake, Somnus will say ""Good Morning, Master!"" to wake you up warmly. 




Power Nap
Somnus's Power Nap program helps you doze off for 10~30 minutes, and recharge your body and mind, whenever you feel like it. Napping has been scientifically proven to improve your overall health and mood, while encouraging creativity. See what Winston Churchill had to say about napping:
Nature has not intended mankind to work from eight in the morning until midnight without that refreshment of blessed oblivion which, even if it only lasts twenty minutes, is sufficient to renew all the vital forces.
Supplementary Programs



Negative Ionizer 

Generates millions of negative ions and disperses them into the air. Negative ions bind with particulates in the air - such as floating fungi, dust and pollen - causing them to descend to the floor, helping to prevent allergies. Most importantly, the negative ions also act like airborne vitamins, helping to refresh your lungs and rejuvenate your brain and body.


Vitaroma Diffuser 
Diffuses essential oils into the air to create a pleasing and relaxing atmosphere. Your room will smell like a spring meadow full of flowers, trees, plants, and refresh air! Take a deep breath and experience the beauty of nature! 
According to the National Sleep Foundation:
In order to get a better sleep, you should surround yourself with scents you like. For example, lavender may decrease your heart rate and blood pressure. Soothing scents can improve your mood and help you prepare to sleep.
Vitaroma Diffuser Technology is patent pending.





Relaxation Lights 
Choose program with different color lights you preferred to display together with the Vitaroma program and music you like to create the wonderful relaxing environment.

 
Sound and Music 
Somnus has an ambient sound conditioner feature. You can choose from selections such as white noise, pink noise or calming rain to improve your sleep. It also has prerecorded soft music to help you get to sleep and the smart alarm features music to wake you up at the right point in your sleep cycle. You can also upload the MP3 music you like to Somnus for playing back.

Gesture Operation
Somnus also has a user-friendly gesture operations design for your convenient to use. The video is shown below.





 

Saturn Tracker - track your sleep and more

Somnus comes with a tracking device called Saturn tracker. It is a 32-bit MCU with precise 3D accelerometer, capable of sensing your movements throughout the day and night. Come nightfall, it tracks how long you slept, light sleep, sound sleep and awake and a result of sleep score will show you in your mobile app the next day. It comes with a clip and a wristband.



The data stored in the Saturn tracker is all then synced seamlessly via Bluetooth Low Energy to your mobile phone. No worrying about pairing or syncing, it just works!





The Saturn tracker battery lasts for up to a month, depending on usage, so there is no need to charge it every day. It is also water-resistant.
If you have a partner they can wear the second Saturn tracker. The Saturn trackers are capable of recording each of your sleep activities separately, and Somnus can determine if your partner's snoring or movement is disturbing your sleep.

Smart Silent Alarm

Saturn is also designed to have a Smart Silent Alarm function, you only need to clip it to your pajamas or wear it on your wrist. Once it detects your correct wake up time near to the alarm you set, it will then gently vibrate to wake you up, without disturbing your partner.









Somnus Mobile app
The Somnus
mobile app integrates all of the above features together into easy to use
iPhone and Android apps.
The app will
display your sleep result of previous night. 
First, it will show you the amount
of time you spend in light sleep, sound sleep, awake, what time you woke up,
what time you fell asleep, time spent in bed and give you a Sleep Score based on this information. 




Second,
it will display the time stamped record of interruptions to your sleep from
external conditions or disturbances. Allowing you to play them back later and determine the specific causes, such as
loud noises or intruding lights.
The app also have prepare some tips and solutions for you to improve your sleep as well. It supports the cloud service for remote access to your bedroom environmental data.

HWtrek - Somnus systems comes to the rescue for those sleepless nights



Specifications




Design
Somnus
takes its inspiration from a pebble rounded to perfection by the flow of a
river. It delivers the sound of the river, the light from the sun and the fresh
air from the woods. Its stylish design fits into your room and the precise
sensors and software work perfectly together to help you get the best sleep of
your life.




Somnus
is available in two simple colors: 


Pebble white 

Pebble black. 


The Saturn
tracker is currently only available in black.



What's Inside?
We
have integrated all of the electronic parts on printed circuit boards. There is
no signal interference. The speaker, blower fan, ionizer, LEDs,
and sensors have been integrated in an innovative way to fit into a relatively
small case. The result is a masterpiece of engineering on the inside and a
masterpiece of design on the outside.


Is Somnus for you?
If you are reading this - probably yes. Sleep deprivation is a modern epidemic. Somnus
is for everyone who cares about their sleep. If you want to be healthy and want
to have a better sleep then Somnus is for you!


How We Got Here
For
the past 10 months we have worked, in cooperation with Sleep Center of Medical
University in Taiwan, to come up with the most comprehensive and
technologically advanced sleep aid. We've studied a variety of medical
information, including from The US National Sleep Foundation and Harvard
Medical School, in order to develop a revolutionary sleep-aid system. We choose
the best possible combination of sleep aid devices and then put all our efforts
into designing, coding, prototyping, testing, simulating, modifying and
refining them into a single, revolutionary sleep product.



Our Chung Shan Medical School Research Team

Below pictures show the measurement of brain wave during exercise and sleep. From the experiments we found that the theta wave not only display in sleep but also appear after certain amount of exercise. We assume the exercise may also helps the brain to do detoxication like University of Rochester Medical Center research team found - the glymphatic system helps to clean the harmful wastes of brain during sleep.



Also, from our lighting experiments the dimming red light and sound or music will trigger your drowsiness if together with the negative ions and essential oil aroma you will fall asleep quickly. First of all, fall asleep easily and sleep soundly are the keys of good quality of sleep and Smart wake up become an icing on the cake!

Where We Are Now
We
have completed our second EVT build (engineering validation testing) to
incorporate a number of changes and improvements we discovered in first EVT,
which involved mechanical, electronic, manufacturing, assembling and testing
the functionality of all the sensors involved in Somnus and the communication
with the Mercury.
We
are now moving into DVT (design verification testing) and will complete by 6/30
where we will test everything: from the mechanical and electronic, to firmware
and software to make sure everything works as designed.










Next Steps

The
final stage is PVT (production verification testing), which is designed to make
sure the production quality is 100% after assembly, testing and final
inspection on the production line. Our manufacturing partners have over 20
years of manufacturing experience and have built and shipped millions of
devices. They can guarantee that a quality product will be shipped to our
backers and customers.







Building with Somnus
You can access your data anytime
through our convenient app. You can also upload the data to your PC. It's your
data, you can do whatever you want with it.
We are constantly on the lookout for
products which can synergize with Somnus, and are seeking new partners for
product integration.
We want to know from you, the user,
what you think of Somnus. We believe that a healthy dialogue with our customers
can help make our product even better! 

Our team
We are a team of IT designers, engineers, operation staff and consultants who work in the sleep center of a medical university based in Taiwan. Collectively, we have over 100 years of experience in building products and services for international customers around the world.




Why we need your help

Our mission is to create the technology necessary to improve the health and life of our customers. We have completed the design and prototyping of our first product, Somnus, but we need your help to get it into production. With your help, we can make Somnus a reality, and carry on further sleep brainwave research for improving Somnus to help you get the best sleep of your life! 



Why Indiegogo?
A quality sleep is important to everyone. We chose Indiegogo because we believe that the public needs our product. We thrive on the feedback and support of our backers and believe that they can ultimately help us to make a better product for everyone.

<p>Bright Halo is a small group of technologist with 60 years of combined experience. We are dedicated and passionate about building technologies to reduce injury or death to elderly and disabled persons. Your help will enable us to build and deploy Overwatch, a technology which will increase the likelihood that a disabled or elderly person will be evacuated safely during a large disaster.</p>
<p>Our initial goal is to perfect Overwatch and make it widely available to every organization or person that wants it. But, we also want to use the success of this campaign to convince states, companies, and schools that more should and can be done. While we have prototype software and a passionate team, there are lots to do before we reach the end.</p>
<p><strong>Elderly &amp; Disabled persons are likely to be killed as a result of Mass Disasters</strong></p>
<p>The problem is that emergency notification systems are not very useful to at-risk persons. Unfortunately, today’s systems are not designed with disabled and elderly communities in mind. Elderly and disable persons living alone can’t always respond to emergency broadcasts effectively. Worst yet, because of sensory impairment, they may not be able to even receive an alert.</p>
<p>40% of the people who died in Katrina were elderly. Today, 1 of 5 persons has a legal disability. By 2016, there will be 74 million elderly persons will be living in the US.</p>
<p>Why should you care? Chances are that someone you know and love is elderly, living alone, has limited mobility, or has some other impairment that can endanger their lives. Whether it’s a grandparent, neighbor or friend, they can’t always have someone nearby to assist when they need it the most.</p>
<p><strong>We are Responding Overwatch</strong></p>
<p>Overwatch uses existing mobile technology to link vulnerable people to a central location. It provides situational awareness for both users and central monitoring locations.</p>
<p>Overwatch solves two key problems. First, it ensures that users get broadcasts in way that’s meaningful and understandable to them. Second, it helps them get out of a dangerous situation by working with emergency responders. These simple steps can make all the difference in the world for someone you care about.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is raise $60K USD so that we can complete development of Overwatch Enterprise software and also complete Overwatch development for iPhone and Android. Your contributions will also help us hire talented people to help promote, test, deploy and provide training to third parties.</p>
<p>$100K will let us make Overwatch available to big communities (500 or more people). You, our backers will vote to choose a town that will be the first to use Overwatch software. With the cooperation of the selected town/city, we will work to deploy and launch Overwatch for their vulnerable communities.</p>
<p>$200K USD will allow us to develop Overwatch for other types of phones. Android and iPhone is an important first step, but not everyone has these phones. This means that overwatch will become more accessible available.</p>
<p>$250K USD allows us to help any size organizations instead of just small ones.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>You have the chance to be part of a unique solution that may help someone during the next disaster.</p>
<p>Your voice and support are just as important as money. Please join our facebook page and follow us on Twitter. Let your school, city and company know that Bright Halo exists and that we exist to help them through this issue.</p>
<p>Please join us in this fight… Let our neighbors, friends and family know that you care. Contribute to be part of something that’s never been done before. Contribute to be a part of something that may one day save a life.</p></div>","Lifelines for Everyone

Your help will enable us to build and deploy Overwatch, a technology which will increase the likelihood that a disabled or elderly person will be evacuated safely during a large disaster.
Our initial goal is to perfect Overwatch and make it widely available to every organization or person that wants it. But, we also want to use the success of this campaign to convince states, companies, and schools that more should and can be done. While we have prototype software and a passionate team, there are lots to do before we reach the end.
Elderly & Disabled persons are likely to be killed as a result of Mass Disasters
The problem is that emergency notification systems are not very useful to at-risk persons. Unfortunately, today’s systems are not designed with disabled and elderly communities in mind. Elderly and disable persons living alone can’t always respond to emergency broadcasts effectively. Worst yet, because of sensory impairment, they may not be able to even receive an alert.
40% of the people who died in Katrina were elderly. Today, 1 of 5 persons has a legal disability. By 2016, there will be 74 million elderly persons will be living in the US.
Why should you care? Chances are that someone you know and love is elderly, living alone, has limited mobility, or has some other impairment that can endanger their lives. Whether it’s a grandparent, neighbor or friend, they can’t always have someone nearby to assist when they need it the most.
We are Responding Overwatch
Overwatch uses existing mobile technology to link vulnerable people to a central location. It provides situational awareness for both users and central monitoring locations.
Overwatch solves two key problems. First, it ensures that users get broadcasts in way that’s meaningful and understandable to them. Second, it helps them get out of a dangerous situation by working with emergency responders. These simple steps can make all the difference in the world for someone you care about.
What We Need & What You Get
The goal of this campaign is raise $60K USD so that we can complete development of Overwatch Enterprise software and also complete Overwatch development for iPhone and Android. Your contributions will also help us hire talented people to help promote, test, deploy and provide training to third parties.
$100K will let us make Overwatch available to big communities (500 or more people). You, our backers will vote to choose a town that will be the first to use Overwatch software. With the cooperation of the selected town/city, we will work to deploy and launch Overwatch for their vulnerable communities.
$200K USD will allow us to develop Overwatch for other types of phones. Android and iPhone is an important first step, but not everyone has these phones. This means that overwatch will become more accessible available.
$250K USD allows us to help any size organizations instead of just small ones.
Other Ways You Can Help
You have the chance to be part of a unique solution that may help someone during the next disaster.
Your voice and support are just as important as money. Please join our facebook page and follow us on Twitter. Let your school, city and company know that Bright Halo exists and that we exist to help them through this issue.
Please join us in this fight… Let our neighbors, friends and family know that you care. Contribute to be part of something that’s never been done before. Contribute to be a part of something that may one day save a life.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>And at the end of our online campaign, we have all raised enough funds to protect about 75 families or 300 people, that's truly amazing! To each and every individual who went out of their way to donate and to spread the word about this campaign, both myself and the LifeNets Foundation team thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We will continue to raise funds up until our mission date.. let's see just how much of a difference we can make! <br/></p>
<p>(Perks will be rewarded within a week or so, stay tuned!) <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>UPDATE 8/14:</h3>
<p>You guys have been wonderful in all your support and contributions toward our campaign! With only 12 days remaining in our IGG Fundraiser, let's kick it into high-gear and make the final push to raise as much support as we can for families in Malawi. So far, we've raised an equivalent of about 42 nets, which could potentially save <i>168 lives.</i> That's amazing, but let's not be complacent with that.. we can do MORE! Share this page with your friends/family and let's all work together to fight Malaria. Thank you!! <br/></p>

<h3>UPDATE 8/1:</h3>
<p>Thank you so much to everybody who has donated and shared this campaign so far! An important update we have is that our CEO has made an executive decision to postpone this trip to November. However, we will keep fundraising for the next 3 weeks! The only difference will be that the funds will be utilized in November instead of August; funders who have chosen perks will still receive them at the end of the campaign. Thank you all for your support and let's keep going strong to make this incredible difference!</p>

<h3>Malaria</h3>
Every year, roughly 219 million people are infected with Malaria and about 660,000 people die from it, most of them are African children.<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Malaria is caused by <em>Plasmodium</em> parasites, which enter human bloodstreams through infected <em>Anopheles</em> mosquitoes. As a consequence, these mosquito vectors have played a critical role in the spread of Malaria.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Perhaps the most tragic aspect is that, unlike many other diseases, Malaria is both <em>curable and preventable</em>. Yet this very disease is the cause of numerous deaths, sicknesses, miscarriages, and even economic losses. Poor or high-burdened regions, such as Central Africa, are particularly at risk, as they lack both the means and the resources to fight this ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Our Mission - Join Us!</h3>
<p>LifeNets Foundation is a progressive nonprofit organization fighting Malaria, one small yet incredibly significant step at a time. <strong>We truly believe that by tackling the deeper issues of malaria, we hold in our hands the ability to eradicate malaria from Malawi and even all of Africa within our lifetime.</strong></p>
<p>As part of our short-term strategy, we have focused on implementing and distributing the insecticide-treated mosquito net. These nets, which can be set up to cover a small sleeping area for the night, play an astoundingly powerful role in preventing mosquito bites and thus, preventing further spread of Malaria. The nets that we distribute are not simply coated with insecticide, but are safely and effectively woven with the insecticide. This provides more safety for the user, as well as longer usage and increased effectiveness.</p>
<p>However, our mission does not simply end with the distribution of these mosquito nets. We ensure that the communities we visit are properly educated on how to most effectively use these nets, so that they may provide maximum protection and last as long as possible. Furthermore, we conduct several follow-up examinations and distributions.. just to be sure the nets are working well!</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>We Need Your Help...</h3>
After a long year of preparations and plans, we are almost ready to embark on our annual mission to Lilongwe, Malawi. In order to provide as many resources and as much help as we can offer, we are aiming to raise an additional $3,780 USD (an equivalent of 315 nets).<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our 2013 trip will happen in late November, but we are fundraising ahead of time in order to have plenty of time to reach our goal to help the people of Malawi!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>It costs only $12 USD per net, </strong>so whether you can contribute $1 or $100, please consider making a donation; <strong>every dollar counts in the fight against Malaria. </strong></p>

<h2>Running a marathon...am I crazy? </h2>
<p>I have never run a marathon, or even a half marathon, but i have taken up this challenge to run the Brighton Marathon on Sunday 14 April 2013 for a gorgeous little boy who can't run or walk... </p>
</div>
<h2>What am I raising funds for? </h2>
<p>I'm raising money for 21 month old Evander to travel from his home in Sydney Australia to The Frazier Rehabilitation Institute in Kentucky (USA) for 3 months of intensive physiotherapy to help him walk. </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.evanderconroyfoundation.org.au/f.ashx?v=21538"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<h2>Who is Evander</h2>
<p>Evander was born with a neuroblastoma tumour which has left him with a permanent spinal cord injury. The doctors prognosis is that he will be left paraplegic from the tumour. At 21 months old, Evander can not move his legs and can not stand or walk.</p>
<p>Evander is the son of my good friends Clare + Roger Conroy. Clare + I have been friends for almost 20 years. After studying at University together we went on all sorts of fun travelling adventures around the world.</p>
<p><img alt=""Clare and Jen  "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.evanderconroyfoundation.org.au/f.ashx?v=82437"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Above:Me and Clare </p>
<h2>Where do your dollars go?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The money raised will be used for Evander and Clare (his mother) to travel to Louisville Kentucky(USA) to participate in 3 months of intensive ‘Activity Based Therapy’ program at the Frazier Rehabilitation Institute. (Frazier Rehab is the lead centre in the <strong>Christopher &amp; Dana Reeve Foundation</strong>'s NeuroRecovery Network.) </p>
</li>
<li>Other paraplegic children who have worked with the same team at the Fraizer institute have made amazing progress... even standing and eventually walking.</li>
<li>The rehab specialists at Frazier are the world experts in 'Locomotor Training' and have spent years focusing on helping children with spinal cord injury to walk.</li>
<li>The Evander Conroy Foundation is trying to raise $30,000 Australian dollars for their 80-day intensive therapy program in the States. I am just helping starting them off, anything you can contribute will help.</li>

<h2> My Progress </h2>
<p>Since Dec 2012 I've been following a Beginner's Marathon Schedule which so far has taken me from a starting point of 5km through to my first half marathon. Each Sunday the distance i've run has steadily increased. During the week I do cross training which involves: cycling, shorter runs, circut training, body balance, yoga and pilates.</p>
<p><strong>HALF MARATHON </strong><strong>Sunday 3 March 2013: </strong>13.1 Miles </p>
<p>Just home after finishing the Eastbourne half marathon! Loved the crowds and drummers cheering us on in the cold (didn't love the big hill up to beachy head!!) 6 weeks till the Brighton marathon!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.evanderconroyfoundation.org.au/f.ashx?v=82454"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Monday 11 March 2013: </strong>15 Miles</p>
<p>Just back from a FROSTY 15 mile training run in blizzard conditions. Brighton was hit with driving snow + 35km winds which bought the temperature of -1 down to feel like -7 degrees. It turns out today is the coldest March day on record for 27 years. After this run i feel like i can handle anything! 5 weeks to go</p>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Sunday 17 March 2013: </strong>17 Miles</div>
<div>This was the hardest run i've ever done. Heavy rain and strong winds made it a tough day out on the road and i'm totally exhausted. Thanks so much for your support. It really means a lot. 4 weeks to go.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong> </strong></div>
<div>
<strong>Sunday 25 March: </strong>20 Miles</div>
<div>The weather here in the UK is still like mid-winter with temperatures hovering around zero and snow on the way again! Today's run was especially tough not only as it was the longest run i've ever done in my life but also because my body is really starting to feel the pain :(</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The supportive exchange of a simple nod, wave, smile with others out pounding the pavement to train for the marathon helps, but your support for this cause is why I keep running, so a big heartfelt THANKS for your contributions. 3 weeks to go!! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Wednesday 27th March: </strong>Physio</div>
<div>After Sunday's 20 mile run my right knee was giving me a lot of pain so I went to see a physio where i was told I have a suspected tear to my knee cartilage which, if it is, will require key hole surgery to remove which means my marathon hopes are in doubt :(</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks so much for your support to get me to this point, I really still hope to make it to the marathon. After all this training i'll be so upset if it doesn't happen. I will let you know how things progress</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Sunday 31st March:</strong> 8 Miles </div>
<div>Today's run was a test for my knee. It still hurts but I managed to run 8 miles even if very slowly! I've now had some Nurofen and it's helped a lot! Luckily I have done all the long runs i had planned to do for my training and now i'm in the tapering phase. Rest and recovery are in order to try and help my knee. 2 weeks to go.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<strong>Sunday 7th April:</strong> 8 Miles</div>
<div>What a difference a week makes. I've had a break from training and my knee feels stronger. Today's run was much happier than last weeks and it helped that the sun came out to say hello :) So despite my dodgy knee I've decided to get stuck in and give it my best shot!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your support, which will help to give Evander a chance to walk, is really appreciated and has genuinely helped keep me focused and motivated. Thankyou.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For anyone wanting to follow my progress on the day, via the Brighton Marathon app,  my race number is 13465. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Brighton Marathon 2013 on Sunday 14th April starts at 9am.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>6 days to go.</div>

<div>
<strong>Sunday 14th April 2013:</strong> 26.2 Miles/42.2km</div>
<div>Mission Accomplished!! What a day, what an event and what amazing crowds! It was so physically and mentally tough but i made it!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The day started with drizzly rain which soon cleared up to a sunny/cloudy 12 degrees. I started off well and felt good but by mile 20 I was in pieces and thinking i'd have to walk the rest of the way. I gave myself a good talking to and managed to get running again to the finish. What a brilliant feeling it was to cross the line. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thankyou so much to everyone who supported and sponsored my efforts, I honestly couldn't and wouldn't have made it without you.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Today I feel happy, proud, exhausted and humbled by the incredible support you've all shown. Thankyou.</div>
<div> </div>

Evander was born with a neuroblastoma tumour which has left him with a permanent spinal cord injury. The doctors prognosis is that he will be left paraplegic from the tumour. At 21 months old, Evander can not move his legs and can not stand or walk.
Evander is the son of my good friends Clare + Roger Conroy. Clare + I have been friends for almost 20 years. After studying at University together we went on all sorts of fun travelling adventures around the world.

Above:Me and Clare 
Where do your dollars go?


The money raised will be used for Evander and Clare (his mother) to travel to Louisville Kentucky(USA) to participate in 3 months of intensive ‘Activity Based Therapy’ program at the Frazier Rehabilitation Institute. (Frazier Rehab is the lead centre in the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation's NeuroRecovery Network.) 

Other paraplegic children who have worked with the same team at the Fraizer institute have made amazing progress... even standing and eventually walking.
The rehab specialists at Frazier are the world experts in 'Locomotor Training' and have spent years focusing on helping children with spinal cord injury to walk.
The Evander Conroy Foundation is trying to raise $30,000 Australian dollars for their 80-day intensive therapy program in the States. I am just helping starting them off, anything you can contribute will help.

 My Progress 
Since Dec 2012 I've been following a Beginner's Marathon Schedule which so far has taken me from a starting point of 5km through to my first half marathon. Each Sunday the distance i've run has steadily increased. During the week I do cross training which involves: cycling, shorter runs, circut training, body balance, yoga and pilates.
HALF MARATHON Sunday 3 March 2013: 13.1 Miles 
Just home after finishing the Eastbourne half marathon! Loved the crowds and drummers cheering us on in the cold (didn't love the big hill up to beachy head!!) 6 weeks till the Brighton marathon!
 

 
Monday 11 March 2013: 15 Miles
Just back from a FROSTY 15 mile training run in blizzard conditions. Brighton was hit with driving snow + 35km winds which bought the temperature of -1 down to feel like -7 degrees. It turns out today is the coldest March day on record for 27 years. After this run i feel like i can handle anything! 5 weeks to go
 

Sunday 17 March 2013: 17 Miles
This was the hardest run i've ever done. Heavy rain and strong winds made it a tough day out on the road and i'm totally exhausted. Thanks so much for your support. It really means a lot. 4 weeks to go.
 
 

Sunday 25 March: 20 Miles
The weather here in the UK is still like mid-winter with temperatures hovering around zero and snow on the way again! Today's run was especially tough not only as it was the longest run i've ever done in my life but also because my body is really starting to feel the pain :(
 
The supportive exchange of a simple nod, wave, smile with others out pounding the pavement to train for the marathon helps, but your support for this cause is why I keep running, so a big heartfelt THANKS for your contributions. 3 weeks to go!! 
 

Wednesday 27th March: Physio
After Sunday's 20 mile run my right knee was giving me a lot of pain so I went to see a physio where i was told I have a suspected tear to my knee cartilage which, if it is, will require key hole surgery to remove which means my marathon hopes are in doubt :(
 
Thanks so much for your support to get me to this point, I really still hope to make it to the marathon. After all this training i'll be so upset if it doesn't happen. I will let you know how things progress
 

Sunday 31st March: 8 Miles 
Today's run was a test for my knee. It still hurts but I managed to run 8 miles even if very slowly! I've now had some Nurofen and it's helped a lot! Luckily I have done all the long runs i had planned to do for my training and now i'm in the tapering phase. Rest and recovery are in order to try and help my knee. 2 weeks to go.
 

Sunday 7th April: 8 Miles
What a difference a week makes. I've had a break from training and my knee feels stronger. Today's run was much happier than last weeks and it helped that the sun came out to say hello :) So despite my dodgy knee I've decided to get stuck in and give it my best shot!  
 
Your support, which will help to give Evander a chance to walk, is really appreciated and has genuinely helped keep me focused and motivated. Thankyou.
 
For anyone wanting to follow my progress on the day, via the Brighton Marathon app,  my race number is 13465. 
 
Brighton Marathon 2013 on Sunday 14th April starts at 9am.
 
6 days to go.
 
Jen.x
 
 

Sunday 14th April 2013: 26.2 Miles/42.2km
Mission Accomplished!! What a day, what an event and what amazing crowds! It was so physically and mentally tough but i made it!  
 
The day started with drizzly rain which soon cleared up to a sunny/cloudy 12 degrees. I started off well and felt good but by mile 20 I was in pieces and thinking i'd have to walk the rest of the way. I gave myself a good talking to and managed to get running again to the finish. What a brilliant feeling it was to cross the line. 
 
Thankyou so much to everyone who supported and sponsored my efforts, I honestly couldn't and wouldn't have made it without you.
 
Today I feel happy, proud, exhausted and humbled by the incredible support you've all shown. Thankyou.
 
Evander - I wish you every succes for America. To keep a track of Evander's progress you can follow him via the Evander Conroy Foundation website:

<h2>Maní+: Fighting Malnutrition and Supporting Farmers</h2>
<p><span>Guatemala is a country rich in natural resources and great ethnic and cultural diversity.  It is a country with great potential.</span></p>
<p>Yet, Guatemala suffers from the highest index of chronic malnutrition in Latin America and the third highest in the world. Almost half of all Guatemalan children under five will be stunted for life due to lack of an adequate diet.  Among the rural Maya population, those figures are even higher.</p>
<p>We are a group of diverse professions and backgrounds based in Guatemala City dedicated to solving this problem and giving Guatemalan children a chance for a better future.</p>
<p>We were tired of reading reports year after year about malnutrition with no improvement, so we developed an efficient and effective solution to prevent malnutrition in infants and children <em>now!</em> </p>
<h3><strong><em>What does Maní+ do?</em></strong></h3>
<p>Maní+ offers an innovative and holistic approach to combating malnutrition in Guatemala while providing economic development opportunities for rural farmers in communities affected by malnutrition. </p>
<p>We have developed a tasty paste, known as an RUSF, made from local ingredients and enriched with a custom mixture of vitamins and minerals that precisely targets the needs of Guatemalan kids. It is accompanied by an education program for mothers delivered in their native languages.</p>
<p>Our model is based on financial sustainability through sales at affordable prices, with surplus revenues invested in expansion and new product development.</p>
<h3><strong><em>What are we raising funds for?</em></strong></h3>
<p>We are about to launch our pilot project to evaluate and improve our product and educational model. This is a key step to producing the RUSF on a large scale and effectively reducing the index of malnutrition. The pilot project consists of distributing the RUSF to the mothers of children who are at risk of chronic malnutrition, providing a culturally-specific participant-learning model, follow-up, and support. The goal of the pilot is to evaluate use and acceptability of the RUSF so we can make the appropriate changes before we produce on a large scale. All of the children involved will receive full treatment free of cost.</p>
<p>This is an essential step to becoming the first social enterprise that is producing RUSFs locally, identifying effective distribution channels and improving our model before large-scale production. Looking at effective social enterprises such as Ecofiltro and Grameen-Danone as models, we believe that producing RUSFs using a social enterprise model is the most efficient, effective and sustainable way to prevent and treat malnutrition in Guatemala, today!</p>

<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>It's pretty simple really:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to locally donate (Raleigh/Durham, NC) to those in need for the upcoming 2012 holiday season.</li>
<li>We're going to grow ridiculous (magnificent?) beards for at least a month to entice our co-workers (and maybe others!) to fork over cash in exchange for smiling faces.</li>
<li>Weekly photo updates will be posted on Monday afternoons, along with total donation amounts for each bearded warrior (for those that can endure the challenge, at least)</li>
<li>Prior pictures will be added to the gallery, so that participants can go back to see how un-manly they once looked.</li>
<li>Our journey ends on October 30th, 2012, and we're proud to say that all proceeds will go to <a href=""http://www.interactofwake.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">InterAct of Wake County</a>.</li>
<li>You can pledge your support for as little as $1 per vote, and are welcome to make multiple donations thoughout the duration of the campaign.</li>

</div></div>","Our Goal
It's pretty simple really:

We want to locally donate (Raleigh/Durham, NC) to those in need for the upcoming 2012 holiday season.
We're going to grow ridiculous (magnificent?) beards for at least a month to entice our co-workers (and maybe others!) to fork over cash in exchange for smiling faces.
Weekly photo updates will be posted on Monday afternoons, along with total donation amounts for each bearded warrior (for those that can endure the challenge, at least)
Prior pictures will be added to the gallery, so that participants can go back to see how un-manly they once looked.
Our journey ends on October 30th, 2012, and we're proud to say that all proceeds will go to InterAct of Wake County.
You can pledge your support for as little as $1 per vote, and are welcome to make multiple donations thoughout the duration of the campaign.

</div></div>","THE STORY
The beginning:

Shamanic
practitioner Gale Conroy was first diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer
in 2008.  After recovering from
breast cancer the second time, Gale and her husband Craig sold their house, put
their backpacks on and went half way round the world on a trip to heal and help
people in need.  They travelled to
Africa, Australia, South America, Hawaii and Thailand, broadening their
shamanic skills with the aim to come home and work with people in the UK. 
 
On
their trip from Australia to Thailand, Gale was finding it difficult to walk
and when her condition worsened, doctors in Thailand told her to go home and
seek medical attention for an infection in her hip.  Within two hours of returning to the UK her hip joint broke
and she was rushed to hospital. Gale was given a hip replacement and a few
weeks later she received the earth shattering news that her breast cancer
spread to her bone, skull and lung.

The Hospital Cancer Treatment:
 
After
researching into Gale’s type of cancer to see what options were available for treatment,
Craig was delighted to discover a fantastic private hospital in Germany, Fachklinik Dr. Herzog.  The hospital combines the
latest and most successful treatment that science has to offer along with the
best of holistic cancer treatment as well.
 
Gale is undergoing Whole Body Hyperthermia and chemotherapy in Germany to
help her fight against the cancer in her body. Due to her weak health condition
and receiving treatment in Germany money is in short supply and medical bills
are already beginning to mount.
 
Everyone
who has met Gale is devastated by the news of her illness and we all want to
help her FIGHT against this terrible disease.  Gale is constantly helping others, so now is the time to
give her a little help as well. 
Gale’s Fighting Fund has been set up to help her continue to receive the
medical treatment that she needs and deserves.

GALE
As
a massage therapist and healer, Gale brightens the lives of adults and children
on a day-to-day basis. She is a mother, wife, teacher and friend and is known
to many as fellow glamper, festival diva, hippy chick and fashionista.   
 
She
is a ray of sunshine and lights up the room everywhere she goes, including the hospital
where she is meant to be recovering! She has inspired many people around the
world with her shamanic approach and homeopathic therapy.
 
Craig
and Gale’s ultimate goal is to open their own healing sanctuary to help people
in the UK.  Gale loves her work and
no matter what the situation, she never runs out of time for others. Every day she
uses her strength and determination to battle this disease and her bravery is
truly inspirational.
 


WHAT WE NEED
Gale is currently receiving
treatment in a Cancer Clinic in Germany, which specialises in her type of
condition. We do
not have an estimated recovery period at this time, but we hope she can keep
receiving her treatment for as long as possible.  Our projected costs for her treatment, travel and recovery
period is at least £100,000, but in all likelihood, considerably
more. Friends and family are planning to raise money through fundraising
events, private gigs, sponsored runs, swims, cycling and much more.  Through “Gale’s Fighting Fund” we are
hoping to raise as much money as possible and our target is to raise at least £15,000.



HOW ELSE YOU CAN HELP
 
Over the next few months we will
be running, swimming and holding a range of events to raise money for Gale’s
Fighting Fund.
 
Please let us know if you are
fundraising on our Facebook page or simply spread the word.

This is good science, done completely outside the influence of food manufacturers.</p><h2>For researchers and those familiar with RS</h2><h3>Resistant starch type 2 (RS2) contents of food-grade starches.</h3><p>High Amylose Maize Starch (Hi-Maize), raw potato starch (RPS), and green banana flour (GBF) are universally accepted as excellent sources of RS2. Supplement manufacturers now put these three starches into consumer products and label them as resistant starch. Many doctors recommend supplementing with these starches to increase prebiotic fiber in the diet. However, manufacturers are not required to test and label these products with their RS content, and only Hi-Maize is produced with RS in mind. Manufacturing processes could destroy the RS2 if heat is applied during extraction. This represents a huge problem and could explain the variable individual responses seen in many RS2 studies. My goal is to categorize the amount of RS2 found in off-the-shelf food-grade starches from around the world and explore the RS2 content of other food-grade starches known to be high in RS2 (ie. tapioca, arrowroot, sweet potato, kuzu, mung bean, and sago). When complete, we will have a complete picture of the RS2 content in the most commonly used RS2 sources and possibly discover some others. If enough money is generated, and enough tests can be completed, the results of this project will be written up for publication to aid future researchers, supplement manufacturers, and health practitioners.</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Despite 30 years of research into RS health benefits, there are no supplements available that have been tested and labeled with their RS content. Though food manufacturers have developed several types of RS to act as a functional ingredient in processed foods (RS4 and RS5), it's type two RS (RS2) that is used in most studies, clinical trials, and as supplements. RS2 is a natural, unmodified ingredient that resonates well with people wishing to use an all-natural fiber supplement. The nature of RS2 can change drastically with the addition of heat, and many starches are extracted with processes that require heat. For instance, potatoes are blasted with hot water or steam to remove the peels, and green bananas may be cooked to enable easier peeling. HAMS, sold as Hi-Maize, is a very stable product, yet it also is not labeled with its RS content when sold as a cooking item or consumer supplement. The RS2 in potatoes and green bananas is different among cultivars and ripeness, further complicating matters. Consumers and researchers wishing to use these three RS2 sources rely on faith that their particular batch is a good source of RS2. Hi-Maize is the only RS2 source specifically manufactured to contain a significant amount of RS2.</p><p><strong>Health Claims</strong></p><p>With the <a href=""http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/news_home/Supplier-Innovations/2016/12/FDA_grants_a_diabetes_claim_fo.aspx?ID=%7B5E648B0A-0688-48BF-A1A0-8A18957A2F65%7D&amp;cck=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FDA's 2016 allowance of RS health claims</a> on food labels, more emphasis will be placed on sources of RS in the diet. My intent is to create a resource that can be used by nutritionists, researchers, supplement manufacturers, and people wishing to increase their RS intake. At present, the FDA's claim is only applicable to foods containing Hi-Maize. If this ruling is to be extended to other natural sources of RS2, there needs to be an examination of the various starches available. </p><p><strong>Test Methods</strong></p><p>Resistant Starch Type 2 (RS2) found in raw starches is measured by a method developed by Megazyme, inc., and approved as a worldwide standard in 2002 by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOAC_International"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Association of Official Agricultural Chemists (AOAC)</a>.

A 2017 review of 30 years of RS research indicates that researchers around the world see these same results, and blame the inconsistencies on personal differences of the gut biome. I believe that differences in RS sources might also be to blame.Background on RSResistant starch is a type of starch that ""resists"" digestion. It passes through the stomach and small intestine undigested and enters the large intestine where it serves as a food source for gut bacteria. This is also the definition of a ""prebiotic."" Please watch this short video:

 
Getting RS from whole foods is difficult. Resistant starch is found abundantly in in potatoes, beans, and green bananas, but most of the RS is destroyed in the cooking process, so these foods need to be consumed raw. Research indicates that we need 10-40 grams of RS daily to reap the benefits...equivalent to the RS found in 2 green bananas or a small, raw potato.Dietary sources of RS, ie. cooked potatoes and  beans, supply only 3-5 grams of RS at best. However, raw starches as found in the cooking aisle of any supermarket may be used as an RS supplement. One tablespoon of potato starch contains about 7 grams of RS. Green Banana Flour contains about 5 grams. The problem with using these starches as a dietary supplement is that they have not been tested for RS contents and different starch extraction processes may destroy the RS. Besides potatoes and bananas, a plethora of common starches are available that may also contain RS. Arrowroot, green banana, tapioca, sweet potato, mung bean, kuzu root, and sago palm are all also shown to be high in RS.Types of Resistant StarchRS has been classified into five general types named RS1–RS5, but this project is only concerned with type 2 (RS2). This is the RS found in raw starches and suitable for use as a dietary supplement.Under a microscope, RS2 looks like this:RS2 is in raw starch granules, sometimes called “native starch.” These starch granules are protected from digestion by the structure and composition of the starch granule itself. The structure of the starch granules have an impact on the resistance of the starch. Their compact nature prevents digestive enzymes and stomach acids from attacking the starch allowing it to reach the large intestine whole.  RS2 is found in potatoes, green bananas, plantains, taro, cassava, and in most cereal grains. Not all raw starch is resistant starch. Corn, wheat, and rice starch, for instance are readily digestible for the most part.Boring stuff, right?  Well, read on!Effects of RSHundreds of studies have been conducted over the last 30 years on the effects of RS to:
Improve bowel health
Correct the pH of the Intestines
Increase the thickness of the bowel wall (a good thing!)
Kill cancer cells
Lower postprandial glycemia
Increase insulin sensitivity
Reduce body weight and prevent weight regain
Decrease inflammation in the intestines and entire body
Reduce risk of breast cancer and colorectal cancer
Reduce cholesterol/triglycerides
Increase production of brain neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin
Remove certain pathogens from small intestine
Preserve Vitamin D in the body
Increase mineral and vitamin production and uptake
Remove toxins and heavy metals from the bloodstream
Increase satiety and regulate hunger hormones
Reduce fat storage after meals

Improve the gut microbiome (synergy, prebiotic, symbiotic)

There are currently about 40 clinical trials registered with ClinicalTrials.gov examining the effects of resistant starch, most using RS2. Nearly all researchers use potato starch or Hi-Maize corn starch, simply because they are unaware of other suitable sources.The Need for AnalysisWith all of these studied health benefits, the only people able to supply us with RS are food manufacturers who can put RS into our biscuits, spaghetti, and bread. There are a few RS supplements being sold as dietary aids, but they do not list the RS content of the product, only the source. I have spoken directly with the makers of most products sold as RS supplements, and most have indicated that they do not test their products. This analysis will be of great help to the manufacturers of RS products to more accurately label and recommend a dosage. It will also steer them away from starches that contain low amounts of RS. What I'm Looking For...I'm hoping to develop a database of the RS2 contents in various starches. At the present time, no one has any idea what the true RS value of a random raw starch is, and few are willing to spend $200 to test. If we discover that most starches tested are nowhere near their hypothetical values in RS, then we can say that using raw starches is not appropriate for supplementation.  Perhaps we will find differences between manufacturers.  If this is the case, then we will be aware that more testing is required to ensure batch consistency.However, we may also find that all samples of certain starches are high in RS and have no issues with safety and quality. In this case, consumers and researchers will have confidence in choosing off-the-shelf raw starches for their supplementation and experimental needs.ConclusionThis project is the first ever to test multiple batches and various types of food-grade starch thought to be high in resistant starch. I will make the most of every dollar to ensure we get the most complete and useful tests.Thank you for backing my project. This is good science, done completely outside the influence of food manufacturers.For researchers and those familiar with RSResistant starch type 2 (RS2) contents of food-grade starches.High Amylose Maize Starch (Hi-Maize), raw potato starch (RPS), and green banana flour (GBF) are universally accepted as excellent sources of RS2. Supplement manufacturers now put these three starches into consumer products and label them as resistant starch. Many doctors recommend supplementing with these starches to increase prebiotic fiber in the diet. However, manufacturers are not required to test and label these products with their RS content, and only Hi-Maize is produced with RS in mind. Manufacturing processes could destroy the RS2 if heat is applied during extraction. This represents a huge problem and could explain the variable individual responses seen in many RS2 studies. My goal is to categorize the amount of RS2 found in off-the-shelf food-grade starches from around the world and explore the RS2 content of other food-grade starches known to be high in RS2 (ie. tapioca, arrowroot, sweet potato, kuzu, mung bean, and sago). When complete, we will have a complete picture of the RS2 content in the most commonly used RS2 sources and possibly discover some others. If enough money is generated, and enough tests can be completed, the results of this project will be written up for publication to aid future researchers, supplement manufacturers, and health practitioners.BackgroundDespite 30 years of research into RS health benefits, there are no supplements available that have been tested and labeled with their RS content. Though food manufacturers have developed several types of RS to act as a functional ingredient in processed foods (RS4 and RS5), it's type two RS (RS2) that is used in most studies, clinical trials, and as supplements. RS2 is a natural, unmodified ingredient that resonates well with people wishing to use an all-natural fiber supplement. The nature of RS2 can change drastically with the addition of heat, and many starches are extracted with processes that require heat. For instance, potatoes are blasted with hot water or steam to remove the peels, and green bananas may be cooked to enable easier peeling. HAMS, sold as Hi-Maize, is a very stable product, yet it also is not labeled with its RS content when sold as a cooking item or consumer supplement. The RS2 in potatoes and green bananas is different among cultivars and ripeness, further complicating matters. Consumers and researchers wishing to use these three RS2 sources rely on faith that their particular batch is a good source of RS2. Hi-Maize is the only RS2 source specifically manufactured to contain a significant amount of RS2.Health ClaimsWith the FDA's 2016 allowance of RS health claims on food labels, more emphasis will be placed on sources of RS in the diet. My intent is to create a resource that can be used by nutritionists, researchers, supplement manufacturers, and people wishing to increase their RS intake. At present, the FDA's claim is only applicable to foods containing Hi-Maize. If this ruling is to be extended to other natural sources of RS2, there needs to be an examination of the various starches available. Test MethodsResistant Starch Type 2 (RS2) found in raw starches is measured by a method developed by Megazyme, inc., and approved as a worldwide standard in 2002 by the Association of Official Agricultural Chemists (AOAC). The method to test for RS2 is called AOAC 2002.02.AOAC 2002.02 is performed by numerous US food testing labs. It involves treating the sample with digestive enzymes then freeze-drying and further treating the sample until a final value can be determined. Under AOAC 2002.02, the expected values for several starches are shown below:
Raw Potato Starch - 63.39%
Hi-Maize Corn Starch - 46.29%
Green Banana Flour - 43.56%
Corn Flake Cereal - 2.2%
There is not a comprehensive listing of other starches of interest, though a review of journal articles uncover high RS properties of tapioca, arrowroot, sweet potato, kuzu, mung bean, and sago starches.In some cases, it may be possible to get a ""spec sheet"" that's supplied by the manufacturer of the starch. These spec sheets list sulfur dioxide, iron, heavy metals, and microbes.  See a sample spec sheet here: Potato Starch Spec Sheet.FundingMy goal is to raise $20,000 so that I can run triplicate tests on HAMS, RPS, GBF and select tests on tapioca, arrowroot, sweet potato, kuzu, mung bean, and sago starches. I have turned to crowd-funding to avoid any influence by industry. All funds raised will go towards testing, ""perks,"" and fees. If less than the full amount is raised, I will perform single tests on fewer starches.Each test costs roughly $200, including purchasing, shipping, testing, perks, and Indiegogo's 5% commission. The full funding amount will allow over 100 individual tests. If I raise less than the full amount, I will use it to test what I can. For instance, if I raise just $200, my only test will be raw potato starch. If I raise $2000, I will be able to order 10 tests, etc.About meI am the author of The Potato Hack: Weight Loss Simplified and host of the Vegetable Pharm and Potato Hack Chronicle blogs. I have a master's degree in biotechnology and work in the healthcare industry as an electrical supervisor.My interest in resistant starch began in 2011 after exploring the health benefits of an all-potato diet. I surmised that most of the health effects were due to the RS found in potatoes. I began supplementing with RPS and saw immediate health improvements. I took this idea viral with the help of blogger Richard Nikoley at his Free the Animal blog.  Our discussions on RS led to a worldwide awareness of the importance of RS supplementation.Please donate!

<h2>The mission of this fundraiser page.</h2>
<p>I have been living with End-Stage Renal (kidney) Failure for about a year and a half now, having dialysis (blood filtering) treatments three days a week, and am now going through the process of receivng a kidney transplant. I am being partially assisted with the mountain of medical and care-related bills by Medicare, but what medicare doesn't cover is still an enormous financial hurdle. And with the prospect of the actual transplant now looming, the out-of-pocket costs are going to mushroom even further.... As an example, just one of the post-transplant medications that I will have to take, which is NOT covered at all, will cost about $5000 (for a three-month supply). Since this all started, I've been very blessed (and quite humbled), as many friends and aquaintences have asked what they can do to help me with the financial burdens of this. I didn't want to resort to a fundraiser/benefit, unless and until I knew for sure that I needed it.... Well, now that it's crunch-time, and the numbers are becoming much clearer, I most definitely DO need it.</p>
<p>I've put this page together, with a modest goal, to (hopefully) help chip away at the current and empendings expenses of this transplant surgery.... A literal ""life saver"". I can't tell you how much ANY and EVERY contribution, no matter how big or small, will mean to me. I'm so incredibly grateful for the support, prayers and positive thoughts of so many friends,and even total strangers. And this fundraiser will help to propell me through the final, and most crucial stage of this unexpected adventure.</p>

<p>My name is Jerry Clayworth. I'm a 46-year-old native Texan, born and raised in the home of the Alamo, San Antonio, Texas. I've had many interests and occupations in my lifetime, but the one constant has always been music.... I grew up watching shows like Hee-Haw and The Grand ole Opry, and listening to my grandparents' classic country records. In junior high and high school, I discovered a love for rock and roll as well. I started going to live shows at 16 (when I got my first car), and after taking pictures at several, I approached a local music paper, and my music ""career"" began! I learned (and loved) every aspect of the music biz, and subsequently tried my hand at booking/promoting shows. I soon learned how many different bases there were to cover, to properly and successfully put together these events, which spurred me to explore the world(s) of graphic design, media relations, networking, etc.... Now, some 30  years later, I still have my passion for music, and am still doing all I can to, both, bring my fellow music lovers opportunities to see and hear great music and artists, as well as coordinate events that assist musicians and others who might be in need.</p>

<p>Of course, like most people, I never thought about myself being the one in a position of need, which, even after my initial diagnosis, I had not considered. But, from the very beginning of this personal health ordeal, I've had so many friends and acquaintences, who have asked what they can do to assist me, and many others who have said ""If/when you need me/us, just say the word"".....

<h3><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">About my kidney failure.</span></strong></h3>
<p>I was diagnosed with End-Stage Renal Failure in October 2011, and have been on hemo-dialysis now for about a year and a half. Once kidney function has failed to the degree that mine has, there is generally zero chance of the kidneys ""bouncing back"" to a more functional state. I am now forced to have dialysis treatments three days a week, for 5 hours per treatment, in order to survive. This is a process in which two 14-guage needles are inserted into an artery that has been surgically reformed to allow for greater bloodflow, and as one of those lines is drawing out the blood, and filtering the toxins and excess fluids out of it (via a machine and a dialyser -- basically an artificial kidney), the other line is pumping the clean blood back into my system.</p>
<p>I'm very fortunate to have this option available to me, and I'm blessed with an incredible staff at the University Health System dialysis clinic where I go for treatment, however, hemo-dialysis, for all the good it does, is very hard on the body, and especially on the heart, lungs, etc. Because of the toll that it takes on the body, the typical survival rate after one year on hemo-dialysis is about 85%. After that, it drops exponentially (The 5-year survival rate is about 60%, and so forth).</p>
<p>The only option for a healthier life, free of dialysis and it's side-effects, is a kidney transplant.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where I stand in the transplant process.</h3>
<p>Over the last couple of months, I have gone through the barrage of testing that it takes to be approved for a transplant. I have done a psychological evaluation, physical &amp; stress tests, heart scans, full blood workups, and most recently, a bone marrow biopsy. After passing all of these tests, I am now ""listed"" in the Texas state transplant database, and approved for the transplant!</p>
<p>In a lot of cases, people in-need of a kidney transplant don't have any choice, but to wait for a deceased donor match to come up as they move up the list, which often entails a 6-8 year wait. And even then, it's a matter of surviving those years on dialysis, and then maintaining a level of health that will qualify them, physically, for the transplant surgery.</p>
<p>Having a living donor will, both, trim years off of the wait time, and greatly increase the recipient's lifespan (assuming that they follow a healthy lifestyle, and take their anti-rejection medications as perscribed).... I am very fortunate, that I have (a) living donor/donors who are in the testing process now, and it appears that, through either a direct match, or a paired donor, I will likely be scheduled for transplant in July or August!</p>

<p>As those who know me can attest, I will certainly continue working in the music world, and take every opportunity to assist other in-need, via this wonderful vehicle. But now, I have another set of ambitions, too....</p>
<p>Having learned (first-hand) so much about kidney disease and kidney failure over this last year and a half, knowing and getting-to-know so many amazing people who are in-need of, or have had kidney transplants, I want to do what I can to help and support others in their journey to regain health, as well as to educate more people about kidney transplantation, and becoming living donors. I've now said many times, that if I had ever been asked if I would donate one of my kidneys BEFORE going through this terrible ordeal, my first thought would have been ""Whoa! I don't know if I can do THAT"".... But, if I had known what I know now, and hadn't faced the actual kidney failure myself, I would donate in a heartbeat!</p>
<p>Post-transplant, I hope to advocate for those going through kidney failure, as well as help to better educate the public on the need for, and process of, becoming a living donor. I've also spoken with my transplant coordinator about putting together guide to assist people in going to the public, via social networking, with their need/search for a kidney donor, and fundraising, to help alleviate the financial burdens, where necessary.</p>

As those who know me can attest, I will certainly continue working in the music world, and take every opportunity to assist other in-need, via this wonderful vehicle. But now, I have another set of ambitions, too....
Having learned (first-hand) so much about kidney disease and kidney failure over this last year and a half, knowing and getting-to-know so many amazing people who are in-need of, or have had kidney transplants, I want to do what I can to help and support others in their journey to regain health, as well as to educate more people about kidney transplantation, and becoming living donors. I've now said many times, that if I had ever been asked if I would donate one of my kidneys BEFORE going through this terrible ordeal, my first thought would have been ""Whoa! I don't know if I can do THAT"".... But, if I had known what I know now, and hadn't faced the actual kidney failure myself, I would donate in a heartbeat!
Post-transplant, I hope to advocate for those going through kidney failure, as well as help to better educate the public on the need for, and process of, becoming a living donor. I've also spoken with my transplant coordinator about putting together guide to assist people in going to the public, via social networking, with their need/search for a kidney donor, and fundraising, to help alleviate the financial burdens, where necessary.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Having spent a little while training though, we are now both very grateful for our fitness and health. So we thought while we're pedaling along the FDR, we wanted to do a little something for those affected by lung cancer that, almost certainly, would not be able to enjoy such an event. </p><p>As this is a fun ride that a lot of people are doing for charity, and as lung cancer has affected many people in our lives, we have decided to use this opportunity to help, even if it's a little. We will be donating all money raised through the campaign to UNITING AGAINST LUNG CANCER, an organization dedicated to the researching treatments and cures for this incredibly misunderstood cancer. </p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Event</h3><p></p><p>The largest cycling event in the U.S. is coming to Brooklyn this Sunday.

Having spent a little while training though, we are now both very grateful for our fitness and health. So we thought while we're pedaling along the FDR, we wanted to do a little something for those affected by lung cancer that, almost certainly, would not be able to enjoy such an event. As this is a fun ride that a lot of people are doing for charity, and as lung cancer has affected many people in our lives, we have decided to use this opportunity to help, even if it's a little. We will be donating all money raised through the campaign to UNITING AGAINST LUNG CANCER, an organization dedicated to the researching treatments and cures for this incredibly misunderstood cancer. The EventThe largest cycling event in the U.S. is coming to Brooklyn this Sunday. Close to 32,000 riders will travel a 40-mile route spanning all five boroughs, with the longest routes in Brooklyn and Manhattan.In Brooklyn, cyclists will cross the Pulaski Bridge, weave down through Williamsburg and the Navy Yard, eventually riding the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. The tour promotes cycling in New York and gives riders the chance to ride in many areas normally closed off to bicycle traffic.For more info on the race: http://www.bikenewyork.org/Here is the route we'll be taking. It starts in downtown Manhattan:The CauseUALC is the lung cancer research organization in the US. They have the potential to make a significant impact on treatment and a cure. Since 2003, they have awarded over $11.5 million to academic investigators, leading to over $55 million in follow-on funding, new researchers entering the field, and scientific progress that is already impacting lung cancer patients. UALC is funding research that makes a difference.Lung cancer remains severely underfunded and misunderstood by the public. Anyone can get lung cancer, including never-smokers and those who have quit smoking.

<h3>Hello all,</h3>

Homes have been destroyed, biz's have been flooded, lives have been lost, and millions of people need to be reminded now more then ever that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>The Newport Buzz Team &amp; The Face Show are launching this fundraising campaign and hosting a fundraiser in an effort to call on our community to come together and do our part to give back to all those who lost so much and hopefully give them HOPE.</p>

With a large open deck, The Yoga Boat will enable a class with up to 20 students to practice yoga out on the water. This boat will offer FREE YOGA and run solely off of donations to pay the instructors and help save to fund the construction of more yoga boats! Well donations don't make it necessarily free, but, I want as many people as possible to be able to enjoy the life changing experience of yoga out on the water! I don't want The Yoga Boat to run off greed and focus on profits. I want The Yoga Boat to remind people that with love, and the support from the community, we can come together and create something that everyone will benefit from and enjoy. No limbs lost. 

I've always had a passion for the water and helping people. I bought my first small pontoon summer 2012 and if I wasn't in school or at work, I had my pontoon loaded with friends and was at the lake. Being out on the water helps me clear my mind and relax. It's also a great physical therapy for me, being that I have a hip condition. With yoga, I feel the water is the perfect environment to practice in. This will be my first step into yoga and I plan to document everything with hopes to put a documentary together to display all the wonderful benefits of yoga. From a spiritual standpoint, to helping me with my hip limitations, I want to help show the world that yoga can be a strong practice to utilize in our everyday life. 

Imagine a cool spring sunrise out on the water and you're in your mellow morning class getting ready to ease into the day. Or, you're looking for that jump-start for your mind and body and you're in your power yoga class. Either way, nature offers some of life's greatest experiences and is something we need to survive and live a life of true happiness.</span><div>

</div></span></span></div>","The Yoga Boat is going to offer yoga in a slightly new way. With a large open deck, The Yoga Boat will enable a class with up to 20 students to practice yoga out on the water. This boat will offer FREE YOGA and run solely off of donations to pay the instructors and help save to fund the construction of more yoga boats! Well donations don't make it necessarily free, but, I want as many people as possible to be able to enjoy the life changing experience of yoga out on the water! I don't want The Yoga Boat to run off greed and focus on profits. I want The Yoga Boat to remind people that with love, and the support from the community, we can come together and create something that everyone will benefit from and enjoy. No limbs lost. 

I've always had a passion for the water and helping people. I bought my first small pontoon summer 2012 and if I wasn't in school or at work, I had my pontoon loaded with friends and was at the lake. Being out on the water helps me clear my mind and relax. It's also a great physical therapy for me, being that I have a hip condition. With yoga, I feel the water is the perfect environment to practice in. This will be my first step into yoga and I plan to document everything with hopes to put a documentary together to display all the wonderful benefits of yoga. From a spiritual standpoint, to helping me with my hip limitations, I want to help show the world that yoga can be a strong practice to utilize in our everyday life. 

Imagine a cool spring sunrise out on the water and you're in your mellow morning class getting ready to ease into the day. Or, you're looking for that jump-start for your mind and body and you're in your power yoga class. Either way, nature offers some of life's greatest experiences and is something we need to survive and live a life of true happiness.

The first pieces of steel laid out

The barrels I'll be using for buoyancy

Sealing the steel for protection

Installing flooring. Finished flooring will depend on how much is brought in through IndiegogoWell, about half way through, due to some unforeseen events, I hit a financial wall. It stopped construction and I've been on a bumpy path ever since. I've also had to relocate my entire construction site due to the change in property management at the property I began construction at.

So I packed up and left!
The pictures displayed show half the boat. I'm building another identical section which will connect to this one. This will make the deck 16 feet wide, by 24 feet wide. That's 384 sq. ft. I've made it into two section so I can trailer it down the highway. 
With your support, I'll get the needed materials (electric motor, flooring material, canopy materials, lighting etc.) to finish the boat. You'll be able to see where your money is going via Facebook. 


Perks!


Thank you!Thank you for your time and support. I believe my purpose in life is to help others. This is my first step into helping others on a larger scale and I can't wait to get it out on the water.
Namaste~

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>I met the love of my life on June 16th, 2006 and we were married May 1st 2010. We have one daughter who is 3 years old. After two long hard years of trying on our own to conceive we were diagnosed with Infertility.  I have multiple cysts on both ovaries that make it impossible to ovulate. Diagnosing it was simple as we already knew something wasn't right.. Accepting the diagnosis and treatments available wasn't as easy. After the diagnosis I underwent every possible test under the sun to see what our options were to be able to have just one more child... as it turns out without IVF we have less than a five percent chance of having any other children. To write that is almost as hard as asking complete strangers for help... but without doing this and reaching out we may never have a chance at welcoming another life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The diagnosis for me was devastating. It goes against ever fiber in me to not be able to carry my husbands child.. to know that our chances are so minuscule without intervention is unbearable at times. To think that every time my daughter asks why she doesn't have a baby brother or sister like her friends is heartbreaking.Every month welcomes new hope and every month it is taken away from me. I have been through countless tests including ultrasounds, Hysteroscopy's, Hysterosalpingogram's, and mock IUI's, all paid out of pocket due to my insurance not covering anything to do with infertility. Without your help it will be impossible to raise the funds needed for the medications along with the procedure.</p>

<p><strong>The Accident.</strong></p>
<p>On March 17<sup>th</sup>, 2013 Jennie and Bobby Shadowens were out on a motorcycle ride on one of their first rides of this season when they were hit head on by a pickup truck.  The truck had crossed the center line.  They had just gone through a license check and were only riding at about 30 mph when the truck appeared.  The pickup, driven by an older man, veered out of his lane in a turn in the road and crashed into my friends.  Jennie was thrown from her bike and landed face down with a shattered helmet and Bobbie’s bike ended up landing on top of him.  They both sustained life threatening injuries and were air lifted to Charlotte Medical Center.  They were immediately placed into the Intensive Care Unit where Jennie stayed for three days and Bobby stayed for one week. </p>
<p><strong>The Injuries and Surgeries.</strong></p>
<p>We learned that Jennie had sustained a right side punctured lung, broken right ankle, and that her left knee and thigh had sustained some pretty bad injuries.  She also suffered broken facial bones and a large slice above her left eye, a broken left hand and various bruising and cuts.   She had a chest tube put in to drain the blood from her collapsed lung, multiple stitches above her eyebrow, Cat Scans, MRI’s, and X-rays.  Her surgeries so far total 3 with more due out in the future.</p>
<p>Bobby did not fare as well.  When he was hit, the bike landed on top of him.  His injuries were an aortic aneurism, an avulsed nerve in his shoulder and two compound fractures, one in his left arm and one in his lower left leg.  The doctors had to put a titanium rod that extends from his left knee to his ankle in order to correct the compound fracture.  He has already undergone several surgeries to his aorta and left arm which also had to have pins put in surgically and is due for future surgeries and skin grafts.  Bobby has also had Cat Scans, MRI’s, and X-rays. </p>
<p><strong>The Long Road Ahead: Rehabilitation.</strong></p>
<p>When Jennie is released from the hospital, she will have to be admitted to a rehab center to undergo physical therapy.  She is non-weight bearing for three months.  She cannot walk or put any pressure on her legs. </p>
<p>Bobby will also be placed in a Rehab Facility when he is released from the hospital.  The doctors say he may never have full usage of his left arm due to the severe nerve damage. </p>
<p>Bobby’s lively hood…using his hands to service and work on motorcylcles.</p>
<p><strong>Please Donate.</strong></p>
<p>Throughout this cycle of events, Jennie and Bobby’s spirits have been surprisingly high.  Never once were the words uttered…how could this have happened to us…?  Instead, everyday we hear them say they are doing great and that they are thankful for their network of friends and family.  Day in and day out people stream in and out of their hospital rooms to wish them well and bring them news or to just sit and watch tv together.  </p>
<p>This is why I have started this cycle of giving.  I know the motorist that hit them does not have enough insurance to cover the enormous amount of medical bills my friends will incur.   Although I have set a limit of $20,000, Jennie and Bobby will need so much more.</p>
<p>I also ask that everyone who reads this please pass the word on to others.   Jennie and Bobby will need all the help they can get on their long road to healing.  I know that Jennie and Bobby will be grateful for your support.  Just a FYI, 100% of all funds will go directly to Jennie and Bobby.</p></div>","Hi my name is Maribeth Clemens and I need your help.

<h3>....It's Zombie Time...</h3>
<p>My name is Jessica and I am an avid runner. Running helps calm me and bring me peace, it also controls my temper as I let my emotions bottle up inside. When I run I feel free and alive, I feel I stomp out my anxieties and internalized stressors- it's my only real rapture- it keeps me going &amp; stay positive. My job is currently a Renal Dietitian &amp; I have transfered job sites to Los Angeles to follow family and be in a more positive environment from the cold East Coast. Upon my very quick move, (I thought I'd have more time to move &amp; prepare) I was forced to back down from my one very exciting (and already paid for) goal of running the Ragnar Relay Race in May 2013 in Cape Cod- a race our team has prepared for- for over a year. We are an amateur zombie themed team infecting all of the East Coast- we raise extra funds each race for outside chairties and we infect others with our one thing we all share- our love for zombies! </p>
<p>By funding my goal to raise funds to fly to the East Coast I will be able to support myself and my team in running together one more time. This companionship and team effort keeps me going and is the motivation I need to continue to run. I love my team and I want to be a part of this with them. I plan to fly back- average flights are from 500-600$. The rest will be used for transport and if any is left over- I assume it will, I will donate it to the wounded warrior project- our charity that we also raise funds for.</p>

<p><span>Dear friend,</span></p>
<p>Emily is an incredibly vibrant, funny, and creative young lady who suffers from an illness that causes her to faint unexpectedly (among other symptoms noted in the video above). Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome<span> (POTS) is a form of </span>dysautonomia<span> -- or the abnormal functioning of the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS).</span></p>
<p>Instead of sulking, Emily has met this head-on with the belief that she's been ""allowed"" to go through, in order to help others. With that in mind, in 2011 she created the video above. This video has lead to many people being properly diagnosed and treated. But, today, she needs your help.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, September 5, Emily was matched with a cardiac-alert dog that can help her to stop fainting (details below). Her training begins on October 13, which while extremely exciting, couldn't come at a worst time financially (as many of you have experienced). </p>
<p>Without the funds required for the expenses related to the 23 days of training, Emily will forfeit her cardiac-alert dog and we're unsure when and if another match will become available.</p>
<p>To that end, we have provided a lot of information on this page to help answer nearly any question you may have in order to feel comfortable in giving.</p>
<p>Emily sees this cardiac-alert dog, ""Sunny"" as an opportunity for her to create greater awareness of her illness, leading to many more people being properly diagnosed and treated.</p>
<p>We remember very clearly how scary it was for the four years prior to our learning why our daughter was fainting daily. With your help, Emily and we can work together to ensure that no parent, or child has to experience this.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, for your consideration of our daughter.</p>
<p>Bill and Barb</p>
<p> </p>
<p>----------------------------------- More details below -----------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Imagine for a moment...</h3>
<p>Imagine having to live every day knowing that you could faint at any moment. It could happen as you were doing everyday things such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>walking up or down stairs</span></li>
<li><span>sitting at your desk</span></li>
<li><span>showering, or taking a bath</span></li>
<li><span>sitting in a movie theater</span></li>
<li><span>on a walk with a friend, and more...</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For our daughter Emily, this has been her reality since she was 11 years old (she’s now 17). <strong>Each year it has gotten progressively worse</strong>. Because of this, she needs <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">someone to be with her at all times.</span> </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>A person can't keep Emily from fainting...but, a dog can.</h3>
<p>We were amazed to learn of specially trained cardiac-alert dogs that can actually predict when a person will faint. Even more, they can <strong>“tell”</strong> the person minutes before <em>(and in some cases an hour or more)</em>. This gives the person time to rest and/or notify friends/family or those near them, about what could happen.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The $7,750 is for hotel, food, and other training-related expenses for 23 days</h3>
<p>Last week, Emily was matched with cardiac-alert dog ""Sundance"" (or, ""Sunny""). But, she needs to be able to attend training on October 13, <strong>for 23 days</strong> and complete it, before she can take Sunny home.  </p>
<h3><strong> </strong></h3>
<h3><strong>More than just fainting...</strong></h3>
<p>While fainting is the <strong>primary</strong> reason for Sunny, there are a host of other symptoms that Sunny can assist Emily with, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>balance, when she's dizzy</li>
<li>getting things she needs when she can't get out of bed</li>
<li>alerting others</li>
<li>and more covered in the video<em> (above)</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span>These cardiac-alert dogs provide people that have been restricted to having nearly no life, to be able to begin to experience a bit of independence and freedom in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span>In Emily’s case, her match Sunny will allow her to do things that most of us take for granted:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>being able to take a short walk alone near home</span></li>
<li><span>be present at high school (it's her Senior year)</span></li>
<li><span>go out with friends to a movie or the mall</span></li>
<li><span>look forward to attending college</span></li>
<li><span>look forward to getting a job</span></li>
<li>
<span>and so much more...</span> </li>
</ul>
<h3><span><strong> </strong></span></h3>
<h3><span><strong>How Long Do Most Matches For Cardiac-Alert Dogs Take?</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Most matches take <strong>years</strong>. Then, typically there are up to five months <strong>prior to </strong>training in order to raise funds. </span><span>This match has come unusually fast.</span><span> Meaning, as thrilled as we are, <strong>we only have days</strong> to raise the needed funds.</span> </p>

<h3><span><strong>About Emily’s Video</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Emily’s video (above) was created by her and a friend, just about a year ago. She was 16. Emily did this to help bring awareness to her illness. She wanted the kids at school to have an understanding of why she was fainting and not just be known as the “fainting girl.” </span></p>
<p><span>Since that time, we’ve been told that </span><span>her video has helped several people to see similarities to themselves (and friends) who have since been properly diagnosed and are receiving treatment</span><span>. </span></p>

<span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Independence</span>:</span><span> By pre-alerting Emily prior to a syncope episode, her service dog, Sundance (“Sunny”) will allow Emily to have independence <strong>for the first time</strong> in four years.</span>

</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><span><strong>Emily’s Story</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>Looking at Emily, she appears just like any other active, healthy kid. And she was, until six years ago. When Emily turned 11 she began to faint, some times several times a day, and this changed her life in many ways: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Being shunned</span><span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">:</span> Well meaning kids, thought she was anorexic and decided to teach her tough-love by telling her they wouldn't be friends until she began to eat properly.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">No interaction with friends</span>:</span><span> Because of the frequency of her fainting episodes (syncope), and the disruption it caused to the school (<em>they had to clear the classroom when a student fainted, per policy</em>) she had to become ""homebound."" Meaning, Emily had to stay at home and take classes online. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Rumors:</span><span> Being homebound further isolated Emily. In addition, it fueled rumors that she was pregnant, on drugs, bulimic, and some even said she was faking it.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Limited Dance</span><span>: Once we confirmed that the syncope episodes didn’t harm her brain or heart, Emily was able to resume dance (she'd been dancing since she was four and loves it). Unfortunately, many times she still couldn’t complete a full routine without fainting. And today, is rarely able to attend classes. </span>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Over a period of <strong>three years</strong> we sought the minds of two of the best health systems in the country: </p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hershey Medical</span></li>
<li><span>John’s Hopkins</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>No one could pinpoint it.</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime, Emily tried to make it through school each day, fighting against the many symptoms of her illness, in addition to fainting (see “What is POTS?” below). </span></p>
<p><span>Finally, we heard about Dr. Blair Grubb at the University of Toledo Medical Center. It took nearly a year to see him. But, when we did, he was able to diagnose Emily in about 15 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>While Dr. Grubb has given Emily hope in the diagnosis, and while we can manage some of the symptoms, </span><span>fainting at any time, any place</span><span> is still the most frightening of all. </span></p>
<p><span>Having to begin her Senior year in High School as a homebound student, Sunny couldn’t come at a better time for her. But, unless we can secure the funds required for training expenses, it won’t become a reality. </span></p>
<p><span>We appreciate whatever is on your heart to give. <strong>Even a dollar is not too little.</strong></span></p>

What is POTS (Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome)?
Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS, also postural tachycardia syndrome) is a condition of dysautonomia,[1] to be more specific orthostatic intolerance, in which a change from the supine position to an upright position causes an abnormally large increase in heart rate, called tachycardia. Several studies show a decrease in cerebral blood flow with systolic and diastolic cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity decreased 44% and 60%, respectively.[2] Patients with POTS have problems maintaining homeostasis when changing position, i.e. moving from one chair to another or reaching above their heads. Many patients also experience symptoms when stationary or even while lying down.
Symptoms present in various degrees of severity depending on the patient. POTS can be severely debilitating. Some patients are unable to attend school or work, and especially severe cases can completely incapacitate the patient.

This year, CRA doesn’t have enough funds to purchase the volume of naloxone necessary to meet the demand.  This fundraising campaign is our opportunity to appreciate the breadth of CRA’s work and to ensure that CRA continues to be able to provide the same level of naloxone access as in years past.  We need a lot more than $10,000 to buy all the naloxone we need.  Since this is the first time we have tried to raise money directly from the community and because indiegogo will charge 9% if we don’t actually meet our goal, we chose a figure that is about 20% of the amount necessary.  So, if we surpass this goal, the money will still go directly to purchasing naloxone. <em><strong>To receive a tax deduction, donate via the PayPal option.</strong></em></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other stuff you can do to expand naloxone access &amp; prevent overdose:</h3>
<p> </p>

<li>Ask your local public health department about naloxone distribution programs- suggest that they begin one.  <a href=""http://overdoseprevention.blogspot.com/p/resources-on-overdose.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">This is a website with good information</a>.  If overdose is a problem in your community (which it probably is!) the public health department is the organization that should be addressing it. </li>
<li>Talk with your doctor about prescribing naloxone.  S/he might not be familiar with the practice, but <a href=""http://prescribetoprevent.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here is a lot of good information for prescribers</a>. Also, the American Medical Association just adopted a <a href=""http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/news/news/2012-06-19-ama-adopts-new-policies.page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">policy in favor of community based naloxone distribution pilot projects</a>.</li>
<li>Write a Letter to the Editor of your local newspaper about International Overdose Awareness Day, the overdose epidemic and ways to prevent fatal overdoses, such as naloxone distribution programs. </li>
<li>If you have any connections with philanthropic organizations, encourage them to fund overdose prevention programs.  Overdose is the <strong><em>#1 cause</em></strong> of injury related deaths in the country- <strong><em>more than car crashes, drowning, fire arm deaths</em></strong><em>.</em>

Other stuff you can do to expand naloxone access & prevent overdose:
 

Ask your local public health department about naloxone distribution programs- suggest that they begin one.  This is a website with good information.  If overdose is a problem in your community (which it probably is!) the public health department is the organization that should be addressing it. 
Talk with your doctor about prescribing naloxone.  S/he might not be familiar with the practice, but here is a lot of good information for prescribers. Also, the American Medical Association just adopted a policy in favor of community based naloxone distribution pilot projects.
Write a Letter to the Editor of your local newspaper about International Overdose Awareness Day, the overdose epidemic and ways to prevent fatal overdoses, such as naloxone distribution programs. 
If you have any connections with philanthropic organizations, encourage them to fund overdose prevention programs.  Overdose is the #1 cause of injury related deaths in the country- more than car crashes, drowning, fire arm deaths.

 
Are you scared, frustrated, heartbroken and/or angry?
Consider joining a group for families concerned about overdose like Learn To Cope, Broken No More, Grief Recovery After a Substance Passing (GRASP), all of which have many chapters and forums for support on-line.
