<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are a co-operative of Equity artists in Ottawa who have come together because of a terrific opportunity: the chance to perform a brilliant adaption of Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw"" inside a haunted landmark during the Hallowe'en season -- including Hallowe'en night itself!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>It will be pitch black in the house after dark.  The audience will enter through the front door and make their way up to the second-floor landing, where they will take their seats.  Out of the gloom, two spirits will emerge to tell the tale of a governess who took on the job of looking after two orphaned children, and ended up defending them against two malevolent spirits bent on their corruption.  ""It is a tale of terror... and horror... and death,"" intones one of the spirits.  ""It made my very heart <i>stop</i>.""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We will be performing the play inside the historic former home of two Canadian Prime Ministers -- Wilfrid Laurier and William Lyon Mackenzie King.  Sir Laurier passed away mere feet from the area the play will be staged.  Prime Minister King was a dedicated spiritualist of who conducted seances directly above the area where the audience will sit.  These days, lights in the upstairs room turn themselves on.  A presence can be felt throughout the home, and one staff member refused to return to the house after a single night there.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The tradition of site-specific theatre is young in Ottawa, and this is a perfect opportunity to bring this visceral style of theatre to the nation's capital.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Unlike many theatre projects, this production isn't being created by a company.  We are simply a collective of like-minded artists who fell in love with a play, and found a terrific way to present it.  This means we have no operating funding, and limited resources.  We are doing big things without much money.  It's risky, but the up-side of that is that it won't take much fundraising to make this project everything it could be.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are committed to giving audiences an intimate and powerful experience.  Our staging limits our audience size to 30 patrons at a time, which seriously impacts our ability to recover costs.  It's risky, but we believe it's worth it or we wouldn't be working so hard to make it happen.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""p1"">Theatre companies that program more than one show per season are not likely to attempt an experiment like this, due to its limited scale; and yet this production gives us an opportunity to create a piece of theatre of the sort that is rarely seen in Ottawa. Take an ideal venue; pair it with an incredible adaptation of a classic ghost story, and some of Ottawa’s most in-demand theatre artists, and you have a recipe for something truly special.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""p1"">Every effort is being made to keep production costs low for <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>. The site-specific nature of our production reduces overhead in many areas, but we still need help. From our budget, our largest-ticket expense items are as follows:</p>
<p class=""p1"">• Venue staffing and rental: $2500</p>
<p class=""p1"">• Script royalties and rights: $800</p>
<p class=""p1"">• Insurance costs: $500</p>

<b>Hi there!</b><br/><br/>We're Cinderella Renegade Productions, an independent theatre company in Brisbane, Australia. From left to right in our photo, we are Sharmanee, Sam, Jay, Mitch and Andy. <br/><b><br/>Cinderella Renegade Productions</b><i> </i>is Jay's baby, and everyone is helping Jay make her baby grow. Shar, Sam, and Jay all study screen and stage acting together, while Mitch and Andy were roped in through the audition process. We're all under 25 and very passionate about creating quality theatre entertainment.

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>We're hoping to raise $3,000 to go towards our first two shows. The first; a variety show called ""Can You See Us Now?"", which is all about showing the people who doubt us that we ARE talented and we CAN make it in the industry, and will be closed by punk band <i>Goon on the Rocks.</i> The second; an abstract bastardized physical theatre piece called ""Heartsease"", which is about a patisserie chef discovering the world for the first time.<br/><br/> <b>FREE STUFF!</b><br/>If you donate you could receive a free shirt, drinks, tickets and supporting credits!<br/> The funds from this raiser would go towards our next show's props, venue fees, and paying our actors for their time.<br/><p></p>

<h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>
<p>For Shar, Mitch, Sam and Jay, getting Cinderella Renegade off the ground would 
be the launching of their careers, Shar, Mitch and Sam as actors and Jay as a 
director. They have dreams of Broadway and Hollywood, and have been 
dreaming about Oscars and Helpman's since day dot.  And Andy? Well he's just a brilliant guy along for the ride :)<br/>We hope to build our company into something that isn't as elitist and 
overbearing as a normal theatre company.  Segregation and judging people
 based on their experience is not what we do. We've found that even the 
most unexperienced baby giraffe can come up with something brilliant and
 pull it off. Art is in everyone. Ours just happens to be our future career and dream. To create is to live; so please help give us life!<br/><br/><br/>“Write it. Shoot it. Publish it. Crochet it, sauté it, whatever. MAKE.”

<p>This past fall, an ensemble of graduate and undergraduate students in the UMass Theater Department collaborated on a production of Jackie Sibblies Drury’s powerful play, <i>We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as Southwest Africa, from the German Sudwestafrika, Between the Years 1884-1915</i>.   Performing to sold-out audiences and inspiring transformational talkback sessions after each show, our ensemble was invited to re-mount our production for a 3-week performance run at UMass in February 2016 invited to present our work at the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown, South Africa, in July 2016.  </p>
<br/><p>Both humorous and harrowing, <i>We Are Proud to Present</i> portrays an ensemble of actors who are creating a work of theater about the little-known first genocide of the 20th century. As the actors wrestle with challenges of representation and encounter their own biases, they realize that the racial dynamics in the play hit very close to home. </p>
<br/><p>Our production of <i>We Are Proud to Present </i>was recently accepted into the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown, South Africa, happening between June 30th-July 10th, 2016.  The Grahamstown festival is the largest arts festival in the southern hemisphere and the second largest theatre festival in the world (outside Edinburgh in Scotland).  We are incredibly excited about the opportunity to share our work with an international audience and to learn more about the culture and history of South Africa.  </p>
<br/><p>As part of this experience, we are also taking part in a UMass summer study abroad program that happens in Grahamstown and Johannesburg.  The course is designed to study the performing arts as a lens through which to examine questions of social justice, race, class and gender politics, history, language, memory, and the role of arts in our global world. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>We are seeking $25,000 to help us fund our trip to South Africa.  This money will go to funding airfare for the 11 members of our ensemble and a portion of our tuition payments for the course.  </span></p>
<br/><ul>
<li><p>Roundtrip airfare of $1300 for 11 students = $14,300</p></li>
<li><p>$1000 toward tuition payments of $2650 each for 11 students = $11,000</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><p>Our total expenses required for this trip are $5000 per student.  We also need to secure rights to the play and manage the transport and rental of props. We will need $56,000 to fund this project. This Indiegogo funding request allows us to offset most of our travel expenses and a small portion of our tuition for the UMass summer study abroad course.  By taking the course we will develop a stronger understanding of the cultural context in which we are performing and be able to more fully engage with the other performances at the Festival.  This is a truly extraordinary opportunity for us.</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>When we presented our production in early December, we sold out for each show. We invited audiences to remain for talkback discussions after each performance, and each night, audience members thanked us profusely and emotionally for presenting this play.</span></p>
<p>During talkbacks, we witnessed our audience members process experiences of catharsis, of connection, of realizations about race, and for some, their own privileges.  </p>
<p>We look forward to sharing our work with South African audiences and entering into dialogue about race and identity with members of a country that not only shares history with Namibia but also shares parallels of racial tensions with the United States.  We hope that this international dialogue about race will support audience members and our own cast in expanding our understanding about race, representation, and ultimately lead to further work against racism in our home nations.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

Even in trying to raise less than half of what we need, we realize that we have an ambitious fundraising goal.  However, we created our December despite many challenges and obstacles and we were determined to make the strongest work we could.  Our determination and perseverance despite many personal, financial, and time obstacles culminated in a fierce and powerful work that united our ensemble.


We are prepared and ready to meet the fundraising challenges that lie ahead and we are determined to go to South Africa.  In addition to our Indiegogo campaign, we are contributing personal savings, we are requesting for financial support from the Dean of the College of Fine Arts and Humanities, we are applying for private scholarships, and we are planning various fundraisers on campus.  With your support, we believe we can make this trip of a lifetime happen.

<p>Stuart Meyers <span>is a a new and emerging multi-disciplinary artist from the great Garden State bridging the gaps between dance, theatre, the visual arts and fabulosity For the months of April, May and June, he is working with Hybridge Arts Collective as a Blueprint Breakout Artist to produce his first evening length solo, <em>On The Rocks</em>!</span></p>
<p><span>New to Philadelphia, he is a recent graduate of Boston University’s School of Theatre where he earned his BFA in Theatre Arts with a minor in Dance.  Studying all over the place during undergrad, such as in Boston, France, Italy and at Connecticut College, Stuart began to craft his provocative dance theatre pieces and received great praise.  This past summer, after performing in a musical in Boston and a new play workshop in NYC, Stuart had the pleasure of apprenticing visionary theatre director Robert Wilson at The Watermill Center in the Hamptons.  Beginning his Philly life in mid-September, Stuart was a majestic moth in Mason and Megan’s </span><em>Mining The Mine of The Mind For Minderals</em><span>, performed in Darcy Lyons’ work in Group Motion’s </span><em>Spiel Uhr</em><span> and danced in Christopher William’s dance-opera </span><em>Wolf-In-Skins</em><span>.  Iterations of </span><em>On The Rocks</em><span>, Stuart's most recent solo work in-progress, has been shown at Boston University, Bates Dance Festival, The American College Dance Festival, The InHale Performance Series, The Watermill Center and most recently at the Judson Church in NYC.   Stuart is also sharing and selling his visual art on Etsy.  Check it out!: </span><a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/StuartbArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.etsy.com/shop/StuartbArt</a></p>

<p><em>On The Rocks </em>is a new dance theatre experience performed and created by none other than Stuart Meyers.  A blurb about it:</p>
<p>A queer clown with a red bucket walks into a room and explodes it into a nightclub. He’s looking for lust, transcendence, and maybe even love. With a wink to the club kids, this fantasy unfolds like a feverish music video. But is this dream built to last? Prepare to be inebriated, disoriented and transported by On The Rocks.</p>

<p>- Dance with a red bucket</p>
<p>- Pour ice all over myself</p>
<p>- Make funny faces</p>
<p>- Butcher Voguing</p>
<p>- Cry</p>
<p>- Sing a little</p>

<h3>Alright... Tell me dear... Why is <em>On The Rocks </em>important?</h3>
<p>""Well... to start, at age 19, I ran around to Boston gay bars with a fake id.  My experiences resulted in feelings that ran the gammit: free, ecstatic, passionate, angry, impulsive, sexy, heartbroken, frisky, uneasy, anxious and fabulous to name a few.  It was complex to say the least.  But the most surprising detail I discovered is how a gay bar functions as a vaccum for lost souls.  As a young person, I thought gay bars were spaces to celebrate our ferocity against the odds, but instead I realized they're a whole other monster.  I found that so many people bring their insecurities to the club and with only a few sex-positive gay role models, young gay people just follow suit.  Therefore, my question is what we do to promote and own self-acceptance?</p>
<p>This is just a microcosm of a universal connundrum."" ~Stuart</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>And why is this opportunity so important for Stuart?</h3>
<p>""I truly believe that I was born to make art and inspire.  It's my gift and a damn good service I can provide for this world.  This is a pinnacle for me as a young artist.  I'm trying to facilitate a lifestyle in which I can have time and space to do what I do best and give back to the communities that have given so much to me.  Hybridge Arts Collective is providing me with an invaluable opportunity to make a radical mark as the artist I believe myself to be.  Presenting my work as their Blueprint Breakout Artist, I am sure this will be the key to continuing on my creative path towards a bright, prolific future.       </p>
<p>So On<em> The Rocks</em> is the first step.  After 3 years of gestating this work, it needs to be born, inspiring us all on our quest for self-love and inner peace.  This piece, my first full-length solo, is on the cusp of greatness and has the potential to create revolutionary change, but I sincerely need your financial support to share the best version of this dream.  I know that once <em>On The Rocks </em>is made, it will move on to even greater heights.  The sky's the limit!  The trick is just making this initial push to allow this nugget to explode."" ~Stuart  </p>
<h3>What is it we need to make <em>On The Rocks </em>soar??  </h3>
<p>Money.  And your emotional support.  But mainly money.  $1,900 to be precise.  </p>

Who IS Stuart Meyers??
Stuart Meyers is a a new and emerging multi-disciplinary artist from the great Garden State bridging the gaps between dance, theatre, the visual arts and fabulosity For the months of April, May and June, he is working with Hybridge Arts Collective as a Blueprint Breakout Artist to produce his first evening length solo, On The Rocks!
New to Philadelphia, he is a recent graduate of Boston University’s School of Theatre where he earned his BFA in Theatre Arts with a minor in Dance.  Studying all over the place during undergrad, such as in Boston, France, Italy and at Connecticut College, Stuart began to craft his provocative dance theatre pieces and received great praise.  This past summer, after performing in a musical in Boston and a new play workshop in NYC, Stuart had the pleasure of apprenticing visionary theatre director Robert Wilson at The Watermill Center in the Hamptons.  Beginning his Philly life in mid-September, Stuart was a majestic moth in Mason and Megan’s Mining The Mine of The Mind For Minderals, performed in Darcy Lyons’ work in Group Motion’s Spiel Uhr and danced in Christopher William’s dance-opera Wolf-In-Skins.  Iterations of On The Rocks, Stuart's most recent solo work in-progress, has been shown at Boston University, Bates Dance Festival, The American College Dance Festival, The InHale Performance Series, The Watermill Center and most recently at the Judson Church in NYC.   Stuart is also sharing and selling his visual art on Etsy.  Check it out!: http://www.etsy.com/shop/StuartbArt
 
First, what the heck is On The Rocks?!  
On The Rocks is a new dance theatre experience performed and created by none other than Stuart Meyers.  A blurb about it:
A queer clown with a red bucket walks into a room and explodes it into a nightclub. He’s looking for lust, transcendence, and maybe even love. With a wink to the club kids, this fantasy unfolds like a feverish music video. But is this dream built to last? Prepare to be inebriated, disoriented and transported by On The Rocks.
Cool things Stuart will do in this piece:
- Dance with a red bucket
- Pour ice all over myself
- Make funny faces
- Butcher Voguing
- Cry
- Sing a little
- Walk in slow motion
- Fake Breakdancing
Best part!!: On The Rocks will be presented on June 24th and 25th at Broad St. Ministry in Philadelphia, PA as a part of Hybridge Art Collective's ""Blueprint Breakout Series!""

<h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<p>Alyson and I have been chosen to present work at the Big Range Austin Dance Festival in Austin, TX! The festival features numerous dance exhibitions by choreographers from around the world, who present work ranging from ballet, to modern and everything in between. The four programs at Big Range present quality dance works that aim to strengthen and bring the arts community together. Alyson and I are excited to be a part of this supportive and diverse experience with the Austin community, sharing our vision for music and dance collaboration.<br/><br/>As artists, we not only share a passion for the performing arts but are both native Floridians with adventurous spirits. Alyson, who has been dancing her entire life, currently performs, choreographs, and is the Rehearsal Director for the professional modern dance company Fuzión Dance Artists, as well as an Adjunct Instructor of Dance at Booker High School and St Petersburg College. I have been banging on the drums since the age of 13 and currently play for The Wallies. I am also a teaching artist with Very Special Arts Florida where I have the opportunity to share my passion for music with students of all ages and abilities.</p>
<h2><strong>Alyson and Drew, Texas Bound!</strong></h2>
<p>The exhibition we were chosen to participate in is quite an interesting and exciting one, and has been called an audience favorite. Imagine this: 10 choreographers, each creating four 1-minute long pieces, cycling though each choreographer and back again, in a non-stop 40 minute long spectacle. This is called Dance Carousel and plays with the idea of creativity through confinement. The challenge is to present a complete idea, in movement, sound, and atmosphere, in 60 seconds. A challenge humbly accepted by your own redheaded dance vixen and Puerto-Jew bearded drummer!<br/><br/>Alyson was chosen as one of the ten choreographers (one of only two chosen from outside of Texas) with the music accompaniment provided by myself. Together we are exploring four different themes on human reliance: technology, relationships, adventure, and creation.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></h2>
<p>So now the obvious part, why an Indigogo campaign? As individuals who’s only real calling and passion in life is to create and share, funding is an extremely crucial element in making our vision come to life. All of the gracious people in our lives have helped us in so many ways with emotional, spiritual and literal support, so here we are again asking for whatever you can give to help make this experience possible for us and our audience.

As individuals who’s only real calling and passion in life is to create and share, funding is an extremely crucial element in making our vision come to life. All of the gracious people in our lives have helped us in so many ways with emotional, spiritual and literal support, so here we are again asking for whatever you can give to help make this experience possible for us and our audience. Thank you so much in advance!
 
Here’s the breakdown of how we would use your generous contributions:

Gas/Travel Expenses: $500Instrument Rental (Djembe & Timpani): $55Set Building Supplies: $45Texas Love-Seat : $50Food: $200

 
Please pass the word on about our campaign, we couldn't do this without you!

We see the woman take a more difficult journey until she bucks up, listens, and puts her creative energy into action. 
It’s about my journey, and perhaps, yours. 
Hi my name is Trilby Jeeves. I did change it when I was 5 years old. My artistic parents were cool and let me pick my own first name! I grew up in a visual arts home, and to probably the dismay of my parents, I ended up venturing into the performing arts. 
I studied acting, l’art de jeu, en Francais (a language I was just learning) in Quebec City for three years, and then went on to a varied career of acting, costuming, and other jobs in between to keep those financial wolves at bay.
But my dreams of creating my own work kept getting postponed. I watched others do it. 
Then, I had a back operation due to a massive herniated disc. I needed to revisit my dream. It would be the main way for me to work in my acting field. My foot and leg had nerve damage and limited the roles for which I could audition. 
Time to create my own work!
I’m a late bloomer, but I’m finally doing it. I’m writing, producing, and acting in my solo show Dusty Shoes this summer at the Edmonton and Regina Fringe Festivals. 
And, I need your help to support my venture. A solo show… isn’t. Lots of people have come forward to help me launch my dream and as they are artists, too, I would like to reward them financially. (funny how landlords don’t barter for rent… sigh ;))
What We Need & What You Get 
Money… not our favourite topic as artists! But, here is our budget for putting ‘Dusty Shoes’ on the road. 
(all fees are considered honorariums because if everyone was paid what they truly were worth, for all the hours they contributed… well, you get the picture!)

 (*A live Fundraiser in Vancouver will also help us to meet our final budget)
(*if we don't meet our goal, most funds will go toward the production team)
(*if by some tap dancing happy shoe moment we go beyond our goal, the remaining will go towards producing Dusty Shoes in Vancouver!)
The Impact
With 'Dusty Shoes', my goal is to have people leave the theatre questioning what their inner voice has been telling them to do (whether it’s write a snail mail letter to a long lost friend, or write that book) and then begin. Creative ideas beget more creative ideas and soon one person is an inspired being, inspiring another. With this mission, our communities have a chance to be a better place, one person at a time. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot donate, don't worry or fret! If you like our project, maybe you could just share our link, (on twitter consider adding #DustyShoes) and that will make us super happy. Thank you for taking time to read this, and consider helping keep the arts alive. With all the cuts that are happening within our country and world wide, this is a crucial time to teach our young, and beyond to keep our right brains, our creative ideas going so the world can truly be a better place.

<p>We are the <strong>Proud Kate Theatre Project</strong>: a confederation of actors, directors, designers, and artisans who specialize in the production of stylized and classical works that explore the changing roles of women in the world.  <br/><br/>Our current project, Harold Pinter's <strong><em>The Dumb Waiter</em></strong>, is part of a new venture we call <strong>TURNABOUT</strong>.  Proud Kate is primarily concerned with promoting women in theatre, and exploring women's issues.  That said, there are a great number of extraordinary men who have contributed blood, sweat, tears, and time to each of our projects.  In recognition of this, we have TURNABOUT, which features some of Proud Kate's proud men, and shines a light on how uncertain EVERYONE'S lives can be.<br/><br/>This campaign allows us to thank our men by letting us sink their teeth into a juicy text, and to create a revolutionary take on a classic piece of theatre.  It will be packed with action, laughs, screams, and a little bit of black magic.  It also allows us to create <strong>a great piece of theatre</strong>.  And now we need <strong>YOUR HELP</strong>.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>How It Works</strong>:</h3>
<p><br/>Every production has a core set of expenses before deisgners and acotrs even begin their work!  The company must rent the theatre for performances and a hall for rehearsal, provide insurance, and license the rights to the script.  These can total around $5000 on their own!  We're asking for $1800 to create the things YOU can see and hear onstage, so when you walk into the theatre, you'll know that you were a part of it.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>Where It Goes:</strong>
</h3>
<p><br/>Here's our design budget below:<br/><br/>$100 - Costumes (2 three-piece suits, shoes, ties, suspenders, and handkerchieves)<br/><br/>$100 - Props (guns - not real ones!, crockery, bed sheets, picture frame, fake cigarettes and matches)<br/><br/>$300 - Lights (rental lights and fixtures, light bulbs, extra cable, gels - for colored lights)<br/><br/>$50 - Sound (tracks for sound and effects, extra cable and speakers)<br/><br/>$700 - Set (lumber, paint, screws, drill bits, rope and pulley, beds)<br/><br/>$200 - Marketing (printing programs and posters to publicize)<br/><br/>$310 - Script License (the rights to the words the actors are speaking)<br/><br/>Remember, this doesn't include space, insurance, or salaries.  Our crew and design team are only getting a fraction of thier usual rate, so that we can put more into the materials that will build this show.  And the actors and director believe enough in this project that they're not taking any pay at all!</p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></h3>
<p>If you don't have the ability to contribute now, you can still help this show succeed!  You can make a friend donation - pass this along to other people you know and let us borrow your friends!  If you can't afford our tickets, contact us - we always need an extra set of hands during our tech week, and we want you to see the show!<br/><br/></p>

To celebrate the close of this campaign and the show, we're throwing a Bastille Day party on the evening of Monday, July 14th at Von, 3 Bleecker Street. All are invited to join the creative team and cast to raise a glass to the storming of the Bastille. Save the date!  
More about 2g
Led by Artistic Director Victor Maog and Managing Director Jane
Jung, 2g is dedicated to creating contemporary, world-class Asian American
theater that reaches across cultural and racial boundaries. 2g has partnered
with some of the country’s most prestigious theatre companies to co-produce
world premieres of new Asian American plays. Since its inception, Second
Generation has supported several hundred artists, through full productions of
new plays and community-based events, as well as grassroots developmental work
in service of cultivating new generations of excellence in Asian American
dramatic arts. The goal of 2g is to commission Asian American playwrights and
provide them with a cycle of development from initial workshop to final
production.
Second Generation Productions is supported by
NYSCA, DCA, and the ART/NY Creative Space Grant and Nancy Quinn Fund. Galois is
funded by The Ensemble Studio Theatre/Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Science &
Technology project",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>ShPIeL-Performing Identity will mount the Skokie premiere of THE INVASION OF SKOKIE in May 2013. It occurs in Skokie in the 1970s, when a Neo-Nazi group planned a demonstration (becoming a celebrated court case about civil liberties), which was an affront to the traumatic memory of those who had perished in and survived the Holocaust. But award-winning playwright, Steven Peterson’s play is also humorous and bittersweet, telling the story of a Jewish family’s desire and struggle to pass down their heritage and beliefs to the next generation. In other words it is about the future!</p>

</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul>
<li>We are The Secret Theatre in LIC, NY.  We promote new works through our New Voices Project, our two annual short play festivals, we produce both Classical and Contemporary in-house shows, we are the only theatre in the borough of Queens producing weekly children's theatre shows, we also work with a range of great theatre companies like Gideon Productions, Flux Theatre Ensemble, Boomerang, Caps Lock, Anti Matter, Going to Tahiti and many more, we produce musicals such as our critically lauded Steampuk Oliver!, Urinetown, &amp; Parade, we hold classes for students from 6 to 16 and provide coaching services to many. In addition we have become a center for great improv with over 5 improv shows a week &amp; classes taught by Face Off Unlimited, we have hosted many contemporary dance shows and specialty music events like the Queens New Music festival, our hugely popular Johnny Cash festival alongside special tribute shows for Alex Chilton and Bill Withers.<br/>
</li> <li>After a tough year when we discovered that the building we were in was not compliant we were hit with Dept of Buildings fines, architect fees and we had to move the Little Theatre to a different location with all the attendant moving and construction costs. Our budgets are tiny and with no real reserve to speak of we are dealing with a cash hole that threatens our existence.  The Secret has become a major contributor to the cultural life of Western Queens and LIC and has been responsible for creating a theatre scene in LIC where none previously existed.  With your help we can continue to win  plaudits from The New York Times [multiple critics pick awards] also many shows and artists have won or been nominated for the New York Innovative Theatre Awards, we can continue to support awesome artists and to push the envelope of what can be achieved in a borough that needs us.<br/>
</li> <li>So many people in this community and in the general NY theatre and arts community think of us as an Institution and yet we receive no money from either the city council, the New York Foundation for the Arts nor from the Dept of Cultural Affairs.  If you help us you will keep a truly grassroots supported organization alive. And Kicking.</li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Let's break down what we need and what for...<br/></p> <ul>
<li>We need around $10,000 + to help us close our funding gap and to enable us to make crucial upgrades.<br/>
</li> <li>If you donate to this campaign you can get really cool perks such as sponsoring a chair [your name or business on the back of the chair], at a higher level we will make you a sponsor of one of our annual festivals with full credit above the title line, logos on all our publicity, sponsor our Children's theatre programs - just $300 gets you 6 months with a full page advertisement on the back of either Pirate Pete's or Princess Particular's programs. Or get a full semester's tuition for 22 weeks for an aspiring actor [ages 6 - 16], get free tickets + a custom designed T-Shirt and much more...<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We are making essential changes to how we run the business and your contribution can help us transition to a much healthier place where we can imagine existing for another 10 years and beyond.<br/></p> <ul>
<li>The Secret Theatre doesn't receive tax dollar money nor does it get capital or project grants. If you contribute you will help a theatre that has survived in a difficult market, on mostly ticket income only, to carry on providing the entire community of NY theatre lovers a a vibrant performance space for theatre, dance, improv, comedy, music and more. There is no Queens Art Center but the Secret Theatre has been giving artists the kind of platform including gallery space for years.  Help us keep it going!<br/>
</li> <li>Our successful track record includes hit in house productions such as our Steampunk inspired Oliver! the Musical [5 glowing reviews, sold out crowds every night], Richard III [all reviews over the top positive, sold out crowds] as well as outside productions such as Flux's Hearts Like Fists [New York Times critics pick], Gideon Productions Advance Man, Blast Radius and Sovereign [all three NYT Critic's Picks]<br/>
</li> <li>All contributors will be invited to a free Ball if we reach our fundraising target. If you want any more information about the work of the theatre or how we intend to keep the wheels on our wagon please email our Artistic Director Richard Mazda - richard@secrettheatre.com<br/>
</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p> <ul>
<li>We thank you for your support. Be assured that the team at the Secret Theatre is committed to keeping our theatre alive with your help. We have done wonders in the last 7 years, what can we achieve with the support of our community? Miracles?  Why not!<br/>
</li> <li>Our plan for surviving this challenging period is already been put into action. Bookings until Spring 2015 are coming in and we have many new ideas to encourage growth including an expansion of our Children's Theatre programming, increased daytime classes to offset 'dark' hours which currently produce no income, we have also instigated a 'SECRET LOVES' campaign to identify and collaborate with local businesses. The Local NYC. Uncle Jimmy's Pizza [Sunnyside], Court Square Diner. Tiny You [LIC &amp; Sunnyside] have already signed up. We expect to have collaborative cross-marketing stragegies with up to 20 local businesses by early September with no limit to the number of partners.<br/>

  What We Need & What You Get Let's break down what we need and what for... 
We need around $10,000 + to help us close our funding gap and to enable us to make crucial upgrades.
 If you donate to this campaign you can get really cool perks such as sponsoring a chair [your name or business on the back of the chair], at a higher level we will make you a sponsor of one of our annual festivals with full credit above the title line, logos on all our publicity, sponsor our Children's theatre programs - just $300 gets you 6 months with a full page advertisement on the back of either Pirate Pete's or Princess Particular's programs. Or get a full semester's tuition for 22 weeks for an aspiring actor [ages 6 - 16], get free tickets + a custom designed T-Shirt and much more...
 
  The Impact We are making essential changes to how we run the business and your contribution can help us transition to a much healthier place where we can imagine existing for another 10 years and beyond. 
The Secret Theatre doesn't receive tax dollar money nor does it get capital or project grants. If you contribute you will help a theatre that has survived in a difficult market, on mostly ticket income only, to carry on providing the entire community of NY theatre lovers a a vibrant performance space for theatre, dance, improv, comedy, music and more. There is no Queens Art Center but the Secret Theatre has been giving artists the kind of platform including gallery space for years.  Help us keep it going!
 Our successful track record includes hit in house productions such as our Steampunk inspired Oliver! the Musical [5 glowing reviews, sold out crowds every night], Richard III [all reviews over the top positive, sold out crowds] as well as outside productions such as Flux's Hearts Like Fists [New York Times critics pick], Gideon Productions Advance Man, Blast Radius and Sovereign [all three NYT Critic's Picks]
 All contributors will be invited to a free Ball if we reach our fundraising target. If you want any more information about the work of the theatre or how we intend to keep the wheels on our wagon please email our Artistic Director Richard Mazda - richard@secrettheatre.com
 
  Risks & Challenges   
We thank you for your support. Be assured that the team at the Secret Theatre is committed to keeping our theatre alive with your help. We have done wonders in the last 7 years, what can we achieve with the support of our community? Miracles?  Why not!
 Our plan for surviving this challenging period is already been put into action. Bookings until Spring 2015 are coming in and we have many new ideas to encourage growth including an expansion of our Children's Theatre programming, increased daytime classes to offset 'dark' hours which currently produce no income, we have also instigated a 'SECRET LOVES' campaign to identify and collaborate with local businesses. The Local NYC. Uncle Jimmy's Pizza [Sunnyside], Court Square Diner. Tiny You [LIC & Sunnyside] have already signed up. We expect to have collaborative cross-marketing stragegies with up to 20 local businesses by early September with no limit to the number of partners.

But the threads of transmedia work, spanning everything from traditional costume design and choreography to the latest generative projections, draw ever closer.</p><p>A new generation of artists treats projection in the theater as something elemental, something that demands exploration.Vitruvian has gradually evolved in the ways it interweaves dance with opera, projected visualization and interactive sound with dance theater. An “interactive opera” in one act, it unapologetically adds digital imagery as an additional performer. But the human body insistently remains, in movement and voice, bathed in electronic light but not upstaged.</p><p>Just reading the bios of these artists is telling. True to the Renaissance icon the piece references, Leonardo, these are artists who are coders <em>and</em> conventional artists, drawing primarily from neither source.</p><p>The latest trailers and teasers give a bit of a taste of what they’re on, but consider this a preview. I think part of the challenge of this kind of work is that it tends to multiply the requirements for development and rehearsal geometrically. And it does that not only on the obvious technical side, but my making greater demands on the performers, too – it adds additional burden. But that’s also what makes it more exciting, and why I believe it’s essential to get these pieces in regular workshops and performances. Opera, the original transmedia spectacle, does the same: the convergence of different disciplines adds development atop development, even before you add digital technology.<a href=""http://createdigitalmotion.com/2014/02/the-visualized-opera-vitruvian-melds-dance-digital-with-operetta-unrender/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"" target=""_blank"">press CDM</a></p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""©Rebecca Uliczka"" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/002/796/53d760070631e42c249eeaae3fedf7b5_large.jpg?1399961227"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">recent performance </b><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>03.2013 “salon Revolutioner vol.3”Platoon kunsthalle Berlin(old version) </p><p>12.2013 “zoom focus” HfM Hanns Eisler Berlin (New version premiere) </p><p>02. 2014 “unrender” Lehrtersiebzehn Berlin</p><p><b> ""Vitruvian""(old trailer)</b></p><div>

<p><b>Challenges</b></p>
<p>The Vitruvian team is challenging opera genre staging innovative performance combining opera, digital audio video technologies, and dance and mixing various styles. The European tour we are going to take part in in 2014-2015 will be a major step to present this innovative performance to a wider audience and push boundaries of opera genre.</p>
<p>In the future I will continue to develop experimental opera performances and present new opera Ergosum that is being composed at the moment. To keep working on these projects and explore new media performances I need and highly appreciate your support.</p>

But the threads of transmedia work, spanning everything from traditional costume design and choreography to the latest generative projections, draw ever closer.A new generation of artists treats projection in the theater as something elemental, something that demands exploration.Vitruvian has gradually evolved in the ways it interweaves dance with opera, projected visualization and interactive sound with dance theater. An “interactive opera” in one act, it unapologetically adds digital imagery as an additional performer. But the human body insistently remains, in movement and voice, bathed in electronic light but not upstaged.Just reading the bios of these artists is telling. True to the Renaissance icon the piece references, Leonardo, these are artists who are coders and conventional artists, drawing primarily from neither source.The latest trailers and teasers give a bit of a taste of what they’re on, but consider this a preview. I think part of the challenge of this kind of work is that it tends to multiply the requirements for development and rehearsal geometrically. And it does that not only on the obvious technical side, but my making greater demands on the performers, too – it adds additional burden. But that’s also what makes it more exciting, and why I believe it’s essential to get these pieces in regular workshops and performances. Opera, the original transmedia spectacle, does the same: the convergence of different disciplines adds development atop development, even before you add digital technology.press CDMrecent performance 03.2013 “salon Revolutioner vol.3”Platoon kunsthalle Berlin(old version) 12.2013 “zoom focus” HfM Hanns Eisler Berlin (New version premiere) 02. 2014 “unrender” Lehrtersiebzehn Berlin ""Vitruvian""(old trailer)

Challenges
The Vitruvian team is challenging opera genre staging innovative performance combining opera, digital audio video technologies, and dance and mixing various styles. The European tour we are going to take part in in 2014-2015 will be a major step to present this innovative performance to a wider audience and push boundaries of opera genre.
In the future I will continue to develop experimental opera performances and present new opera Ergosum that is being composed at the moment. To keep working on these projects and explore new media performances I need and highly appreciate your support.",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

Think of the goals you set for yourself in your senior year of high school that you could have completed with a little bit of support!Why It MattersTo wrap up their college applications, the senior class would like to add the finishing touch to their resumes: A piece completely produced and directed on their own, something that not many high school students have under their belt. They are using this piece as a farewell to their high school careers and as an introduction to their future lives as young artists.Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand what it means to be tight on money, so don’t feel too bad about not being able to make a donation. However, don’t shy away from helping the cause!Spread the word!

<p style=""text-align: center;"">In 1936, Phyllis Pearsall makes

path to find her way in London. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">She then receives a telegram from

<p style=""text-align: center;"">The A-Z of Mrs P is a brand new
musical fable, written by author/playwright Diane Samuels and composer/singer

<p><i>""What
a creative adventure writing The A-Z of Mrs P has been with Gwyn! Working
closely together we have found inventive ways to interweave words, music, song

<p>
</p><p>Gwyneth
Herbert is a mesmerising performer, writer of striking original songs and
versatile musical adventurer, fleetingly inhabiting the worlds of the great
singer-songwriters, jazz vocalists and traditional composers whilst never quite
fitting easily into any of their camps. She has just been on tour around the UK
promoting her acclaimed new album The Sea Cabinet. </p>
<p><i>“I’d
never seen a musical before I started this crazy journey 5 years ago. Thing
was, I loved stories, I loved music, I loved the theatre. And now, after
working intensively and intimately alongside Diane exploring Mrs P’s own
inspiring journey, I find myself in love with this huge beast of an art-form:
its limitless possibilities for creative invention, the way you can plant one
thought or feeling and make it shudder through the whole piece, music and words
and action and visual art all weaving together. For me, I have found it’s the
most multi-dimensional and exciting way to tell a magical story.”</i></p>
<p>Diane and
Gwyneth are joined by musical arranger Sarah Travis (Tony Award for Sweeney
Todd on Broadway).</p>

<p><i>'I am
very excited to be joining the Mrs P team. Although music features heavily in
my comedy shows, The A-Z of Mrs P will be my first proper musical. As soon as I
heard the song Lovely London Town, I felt that this to be a really special show
that is as much about a gripping, funny and heartbreaking story as it is
spectacle and wonder. Also I have literally no sense of direction so I’m hoping
that by osmosis, by the end of the run I’ll be able to find my way home from
the theatre without looking at my phone.' </i></p>

<p>
</p><p>“I had
heard the buzz about the A to Z and was intrigued to hear the music and read
the script. Once I had read it, I couldn’t resist the opportunity to take this
show out of its workshop state and to be privileged enough to perform it for
the first time to the public.</p>
<p><i>'It’s a
brilliantly written piece and I have to say that Bella, my role, is a wonderful
part and she is just the sort of character I enjoy to play. She is Phyllis'
mother - eccentric, artistic but tragic. In the show she ages from fifteen to
forty-five which is certainly a challenge for any actress. Bring it on.”</i></p>

<p>THANK
YOU! </p>
<p>Again a
big thank you from the whole A-Z of Mrs P team!</p>
<p><b>The A-Z of Mrs P – mapping an entire city in a foot
tapping new British musical</b></p><h3><br/></h3></div>","*Click above to hear cast and creatives discuss the The A-Z of Mrs P*
*AND hear Isy Suttie sing 'Lovely London Town' by visiting the gallery tab!*
'Best Foot Forward...'
In 1936, Phyllis Pearsall makes
the life-changing decision to leave her husband in Venice and follow a new
path to find her way in London. 
She then receives a telegram from
her father, map publisher Alexander Gross....
And here begins the story of how
an eccentric Bohemian artist put down her paints and picked up the drawing
board to follow in her beloved and impossible father’s footsteps to map an
entire city!
The A-Z of Mrs P is a brand new
musical fable, written by author/playwright Diane Samuels and composer/singer
Gwyneth Herbert, based on Phyllis Pearsall's autobiographies. The show
opens in the very same borough in which she was made a celebrated resident, at Southwark
Playhouse on 21st February 2014.
'This is our time/My lovely
London town...'
WHY WE
NEED YOUR HELP!
Cast
Recording
A cast
album means that the show will have a life beyond the initial production. This
is an original British musical with a unique soundscape, written by an all-female
creative team - all these things are too rare in British Musical Theatre! Help
us capture this landmark show with a world class company. £9000 
Costumes
Phyllis Pearsall
was famous for her colourful and eccentric style - we would love
to stay true to her character and enhance our costume budget to do the
woman justice! £1000 
Very
special Lighting Effects
This is
something a little extra special to give the show that magical quality it
deserves - we have a few lighting tricks up our sleeve that we would love to
add onto Southwark Playhouse's rig. £1000
For all
this we need your help! We are looking to raise £11,000 to cover all the costs
of the recording including hire, production and marketing; the costume budget
for Mrs P's outfits; and the extra lighting hire/creation to make this production
as beautiful as it can be.
WHAT YOU GET!
We have
some fantastic perks up for grabs as rewards for your generous donations. For
just £5 you can have your name inscribed on the set of the show. We also have
recorded demo songs and signed show goodies to send to you – including a copy
of the cast recording of course! Tickets for the show, the press night party and
question and answer sessions with the cast and production team are all available. We’ve also teamed up with the artist Su Blackwell who has created and donated the sculpture
for the flyer, as well as Geographers' A-Z Map Company Limited who have very
kindly donated vintage maps, original Phyllis Pearsall artwork and her hat,
which Isy Suttie will wear in the production – all up for grabs! *An amazing chance is available for you or your company and business by becoming an Associate Producer of the cast recording: you will be there while we record, get a number of copies of the CD on which you will be fully credited, plus tickets to opening night.*And finally Southwark
Playhouse can be yours for the night with our premium reward – a performance of
the show just for you and your closest friends (all 250 of them!). Have a look
through the right hand side of the page to see what takes your fancy. We very
much appreciate every donation made.Please visit our 'Gallery' on the next tab to see images of some of the perks plus listen to Isy Suttie singing 'Lovely London Town' from the show under 'files'!

TEAM!

for thoughts from our fantastic cast and company!
CREATIVE
TEAM
Playwright
- Diane Samuels

Diane
Samuels is a playwright and author, raised in Liverpool, now living and working
in London. Plays include award-winning Kindertransport, touring nationally
in 2014, The Arrest of Rosa Gold, Swine and recently BBC Radio 4
Woman's Hour five-part drama serial Tiger Wings. Her new book, Author's Guide
to Kindertransport is published in Jan 2014 by Nick Hern Books.
""What
a creative adventure writing The A-Z of Mrs P has been with Gwyn! Working
closely together we have found inventive ways to interweave words, music, song
storytelling, autobiography and mythology to create a
seamless, flowing, highly theatrical and heartfelt show that is
as much about family business as mapping a city.""
Music and
Lyrics - Gwyneth Herbert

Gwyneth
Herbert is a mesmerising performer, writer of striking original songs and
versatile musical adventurer, fleetingly inhabiting the worlds of the great
singer-songwriters, jazz vocalists and traditional composers whilst never quite
fitting easily into any of their camps. She has just been on tour around the UK
promoting her acclaimed new album The Sea Cabinet. 
“I’d
never seen a musical before I started this crazy journey 5 years ago. Thing
was, I loved stories, I loved music, I loved the theatre. And now, after
working intensively and intimately alongside Diane exploring Mrs P’s own
inspiring journey, I find myself in love with this huge beast of an art-form:
its limitless possibilities for creative invention, the way you can plant one
thought or feeling and make it shudder through the whole piece, music and words
and action and visual art all weaving together. For me, I have found it’s the
most multi-dimensional and exciting way to tell a magical story.”
Diane and
Gwyneth are joined by musical arranger Sarah Travis (Tony Award for Sweeney
Todd on Broadway).
Director
- Sam Buntrock

Sam Buntrock is a theatre and film director,
previously resident assistant director at the Donmar Warehouse. His many
credits include the Olivier and Tony award nominated revival of ‘Sunday in the
Park with George’ Menier Chocolate Factory/West end/Broadway, and ‘The Real
Thing’ West End/Broadway.
Conceived
by - Neil Marcus

Neil is
Executive Director or Mercury Musical Developments and Artistic Director of
London Festival Of Cabaret. Producing credits include Maria Friedman and Adam
Guettel at The Hippodrome, Alexander Armstrong Celebrates The Great British
Songbook at The St. James Theatre, Soho Cinders - Soho Theatre/Queens Theatre
and Michael Feinstein at The Palace with Elaine Paige and Julian Ovenden.
‘5 years
ago Gwyn and I had a drink at Kings Cross to discuss a possible musical about Phyllis
Pearsall…and here we are! I hope you enjoy the show as much as we have enjoyed
putting it together’
Set
Designer - Klara Zieglerova

Klara's
design credits include Sister Act and Jersey Boys(Broadway and West End). She
has designed for the Public Theater, MTC, NYTW as well as numerous regional
theatres in the US and has won many awards including The Green Room Award 2010
(Australia) and The Best Set Design of the 2009 Theatregoers’ Choice Award
London (both for Jersey Boys) and 2005 Lumen Award (New World Stages). Klara is
also the interior architect for New World Stages in NY. 
'I’m
fascinated by the story of one woman who by losing her way in London once has
helped millions of others to find theirs. This piece is an homage to the
human spirit as well as the city of London and I’m honored to be working with
the authors, Gwyneth Herbert and Diane Samuels.'
 CAST
Isy
Suttie - Mrs P

Sony
award winner Isy is known to TV audiences as Dobby in Peep Show and Esther in
Shameless (Channel 4). She is also a prolific musical comic and is currently
recording series 2 of her BBC Radio 4 show, Isy Suttie’s Love Letters. 
'I am
very excited to be joining the Mrs P team. Although music features heavily in
my comedy shows, The A-Z of Mrs P will be my first proper musical. As soon as I
heard the song Lovely London Town, I felt that this to be a really special show
that is as much about a gripping, funny and heartbreaking story as it is
spectacle and wonder. Also I have literally no sense of direction so I’m hoping
that by osmosis, by the end of the run I’ll be able to find my way home from
the theatre without looking at my phone.' 
Frances
Ruffelle – Bella Gross

“I had
heard the buzz about the A to Z and was intrigued to hear the music and read
the script. Once I had read it, I couldn’t resist the opportunity to take this
show out of its workshop state and to be privileged enough to perform it for
the first time to the public.
'It’s a
brilliantly written piece and I have to say that Bella, my role, is a wonderful
part and she is just the sort of character I enjoy to play. She is Phyllis'
mother - eccentric, artistic but tragic. In the show she ages from fifteen to
forty-five which is certainly a challenge for any actress. Bring it on.”
Michael Matus – Sandor Gross

Recent
work includes ""The Sound of Music"" (Regent's Park Open Air Theatre),
""Yes Prime Minister"" (UK tour) ""Taboo"" with Boy
George,""Wonderful Town"" with Sir Mark Elder and the Hallé, ""Lend
Me A Tenor"" (West End) as well as 8 shows with the RSC, 2 with Shakespeare's
Globe and created Benoit in ""Martin Guerre"". 
This show
fills me with a love of London, a rare, home-grown bit of magic with a
brilliant score. And I get to be Frances Ruffelle's husband and Isy Suttie's
Dad. There will be fireworks!!
The cast
also includes: STUART MATTHEW PRICE (Parade, Shrek) as Phyllis’s brother Tony
Gross; SARAH EARNSHAW (Wicked); DAWN SIEVEWRIGHT (Glasgow Girls), SIDNEY
LIVINGSTONE (Acorn Antiques the Musical, Oklahoma!) and MAX GALLAGHER (History Boys - Colchester) is our latest addition!

delighted to be part of this enigmatic fable – Phyllis is an inspiration simply
because she was tenacious and determined – both in her pursuit of mapping
London alongside her Father, but also in her ability to cope at home as part of

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm <strong>Imogen Stirling</strong> and I'm bringing my spoken word show, <strong>#Hypocrisy</strong>, to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2018.</p>
<p>I'm a Scottish spoken word performer, musician and theatre maker. Following an extensive music tour of mainland Europe, I broadened my horizons and began creating and reading poetry for audiences in Berlin. Returning to Scotland, I swiftly garnered acclaim within our country's spoken word scene and since then have appeared in venues all around the UK. I will be coming to Edinburgh fresh from an extensive UK tour with poetry/music collective Words w/ Friends. Having previously been involved in the Fringe extravaganza as part of a company, I am thrilled to be bringing my first solo creation to the capital. <br/><br/><strong>This will be the show's absolute, ultimate debut</strong> - I'm looking for your help to make the ambition a reality.<br/> </p>

<h3>What's the show?</h3>
<p>#Hypocrisy is a response to the bizarre world we're living in.

<p>The format of #Hypocrisy is unique. <strong>It’s a blend of spoken word poetry, dark comedy and completely original music throughout.</strong> The show is presented from my perspective as a young white woman. Beginning by looking into my experiences travelling as a musician through Europe (during which time I often found myself reaping the benefits of my skin colour) it opens up to explore what is evidently becoming an increasingly racist world. The show is a contemplation and an interrogation of western privilege. It's an exposure of hypocrisy and a reminder of perspective. It is provocative, uplifting but funny too! <strong>It hands us back our own responsibility and reminds us to respond to people as people.</strong> I think it is an important piece to perform at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Play synopsis:</strong> Choi and Rhoul haven’t seen Marty in a while. Then, over coffee and a stale muffin, he casually tells them he has cancer. And he wants to go to Hawaii. MARTY HAS CANCER is a dark comedy about friendship, coming-of-age (in your 30’s), and the absurdity of “American Idol.”</p>
<p><strong>The goal:</strong> Our aim, with the help of four actors, some creativity, and (hopefully) an audience, is to produce the world premiere and Utah premiere of this bizarre, funny, and heart-wrenching play. </p>
<p>We would love to bring this story to audiences at the Hollywood Fringe Festival and Great Salt Lake Fringe Festival this summer, but Prufrock is just getting on its feet. Basically, toddling.</p>
<p>With a bit of help, Director Madeleine Gail Rex, Playwright Austin Archer, and others involved are confident we can bring something both entertaining and thought-provoking to audiences in these communities.</p>
<p><strong>What your donation will do: </strong>Any money raised will be used first for festival fees, production costs, basic marketing needs, and, potentially, travel expenses. Once these costs are satisfied, and should there be remaining funds, we would hope to set those aside for future Prufrock Productions projects. To be clear, no money raised through this campaign will be used to pay artists; such payment will only come from ticket sales. Essentially, it is through aid with these other expenses that we will be able to use ticket sales for this purpose.</p>
<p><strong>What we can give you:</strong> A whooooole lot of gratitude! We'll thank you in the program for any donation of $10 or more, for $20 Austin will send you a personalized thank you letter and a photo of him doing anything you want. ANYTHING. Except for skydiving. Or scuba-diving. Nothing too expensive. Okay there's a lot of things he won't do, but a lot he might. Donate $25 or more, and you can join the cast, playwright, and other creatives for an after party following the close of the SLC Fringe production. There will be music, appetizers, and, you know, lots of good stuff. But mostly, we'll love you forever.</p>

With your help, we will be able to pay our performers what they deserve to be paid, as well as fund the physical aspects of this play including sets, costumes, and a live band!</div> <div>
<p>We are asking for $15,000 from you to pay for artist fees, and set and costume production needs.  Any contributions made here through Indiegogo are sponsored by Abrons Arts Center/Henry Street Settlement and are tax-deductible.<br/></p>
<p>We have received a generous grant from the Jerome Foundation to get us 
started, but it only covers part of what we need to pay the incredible 
performing and design artists involved.  We have raised about half of what we need to pay our 9 performers and two band members, and still need to raise the money to pay the top notch designers, our composer and our choreographer. Though almost all involved are veterans in their fields, this is our first time out as a company, so we've kept costs very lean. Writer/director Sibyl Kempson is able to forego payment altogether for this project, thanks to a USA Artists Rockefeller Fellowship awarded to her this year, and Abrons Arts Center is providing us with free use of their rehearsal space and theater, plus marketing and PR in-kind contributions. Development of the play has been shouldered by workshops at New Dramatists, Duke University, and Sarah Lawrence College. So all of the money we are hoping to raise goes directly to the people involved in the production.</p>
<p>Amanda Villalobos is designing some fabulous t-shirts to help launch the company. She is a world-renowned graphic designer who designed and illustrated the 53rd State publication of Kempson's THE SECRET DEATH OF PUPPETS &amp; ICH, KÜRBISGEIST in 2012. She also happens to be playing the role of ""Jean Ann"" in LET US NOW PRAISE SUSAN SONTAG! So one of the perks will be a wonderful t-shirt that Amanda is making.</p>
<p>You could also garner an original cast recording of Ashley Turba's dizzying songs for LET US NOW PRAISE SUSAN SONTAG. <br/></p>
<p>Or what about a special seed-planting ceremony using the guaranteed methods depicted in the play? <br/></p>
<p>This is the first time I've ever done any kind of a fundraising campaign - in fact, I've never asked anyone outside of the INSTITUTIONS to donate money to any of my productions! And oh, man. It ain't easy for a lady to ask for help in this day and age, in these tough times - I'm terrified! But as I embark on the adventure of starting this company, the importance and the urgency of what we are setting out to do pushes me before you to ask for your support. <br/>
</p>
<p>As a playwright, I am looking to counter the narratives of American mass culture, to multiply interpretations of the signs surrounding us, to upend preconceptions of gender, genre, structure, language, and space - to call into question our perceptions of the
civilized in relation to ideas of the barbaric, in relation to ideas and
preconceptions of the sacred, the profane, the true, the ordinary, and the
animate. This particular play is about our relationship to the land we live on, what it gives us and what we give it, and it also contains a vision of possibility, of how things COULD and CAN be in our relationship to this land. My hope is that we can start to work together, using new narratives made together in our collective imagination, to steer our human progress in a direction that we can really actually truly feel good about. And this piece is my first step in making a space for that kind of imagining.<br/></p>
<p>The decision to begin this company has come about at the years-long urging of fellow artists who I trust, who have really pushed me toward taking this action to realize the visions contained in my own writing more clearly. For me it's a return to the way I began doing it earlier on in 1999, but this time with added experience from the incredible collaborations I've enjoyed in the years since and with the renewed encouragement from colleagues, students, mentors, and family. Even more importantly, it gives me the opportunity to more actively curate the assemblage of humans in the room with whom I am working. That's already proved (proven?) to be enormously exciting and rewarding. Hope you'll join me in applauding and making possible their stunning presence.  <br/></p>
<p>$15K is a lot of money to be raising this way! Honestly, I have very little sense of whether it's actually possible or not. We simply came up with the number based on what we need to pay the people involved what they deserve to be paid for the work they are putting in. I am late getting this campaign underway because I feel VERY VERY SHY about asking ANYONE for ANYTHING! But once we started rehearsals and I started working with this group of human beings, each with their own love to lavish on the world through the work they do, each so enormously expressive, flexible, funny, vulnerable and outrageous, full of questions, many of whom are hiring babysitters and packing their lunches, it lit a new fire under my butt to get this money raised to pay these remarkable humans for their contribution. </p>
<p>And then I think of all the people I know, and how much encouragement I've received in this tough, tough world of making artwork in NYC over the years - from friends, relatives, co-workers, employers who have watched me schlep and grunt and heard me whine and cry and shout as I build all the stuff, I think, ""Oh, hell. The answer's always 'no' until you ask."" So we're just going to give this a try and see what happens! <br/></p>
<p>So, do you feel like you'd like to help but just don't have the dough to cough up? Well, maybe you wouldn't mind helping me get the word out about the piece and the fundraising campaign! No pressure, but they at Indiegogo provide ""share tools"" of some kind that can help you to do so. <br/></p>

<p>I'm Jessica Lucia Andrade, a British Asian Actress and aerialist. I've created a new show called The Brownie Club, combining spoken word, physical theatre and aerial circus. The Brownie Club is based on events that have happened to me because of my skin tone, and explores how those events have affected me. This campaign aims to raise funds to provide free tickets for young people of colour to come and see the show, as well as to offer free workshops to explore some of the shows' themes. I want young people to have opportunities and positive experiences that I didn't always get the chance to, because they are the future.</p>
<p>I'm using the term ‘people of colour' because I'm talking about the things I've experienced based on my skin tone, and that has always been associated with the colour brown. I have always called myself brown and celebrate that fact, and I would also describe myself as Asian, South Asian and Goan. I would love people of all races, ethnicities, and genders to come and see the show as I want to have a conversation with the audience as well as talk about my own personal experiences. This can sometimes be a difficult conversation but it doesn't need to be if we come from a place of understanding each others circumstances. I am encouraging young people of colour to come and see the show because they are not often reflected in our audiences, and in that conversation.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've already budgeted £150 to enable 20 young people of colour to come and see The Brownie Club for free, and we'd love to be able to provide at least 60 more free tickets throughout the run.  We also want to offer free workshops to local secondary schools and local youth groups, to explore the themes of the show. </p>
<p>If we raise less than £400, all the money will go directly towards offering free tickets to young people of colour to see the show. Once we exceed £400, the money will be divided between free tickets and workshops. How much we raise will directly inform how many tickets, and how many workshops we can offer. The money for the workshops will cover staff to assist with facilitation and an education consultant to help us plan, coordinate and deliver them.  We'd love more than anything to exceed our target, and if we do, we'll simply buy more free tickets and offer more workshops!</p>
<p>We've got some perks on offer to show how grateful we are for your support. These include some awesome signed images and posters from the show, an invitation to attend an open rehearsal, behind the scenes tours, and free tickets. </p>
<p>This project means a lot to me as when I was younger I rarely saw people like myself in the worlds of Theatre, circus, performance and mainstream media, and I therefore had no idea they were available to me.  I want to be part of the change that means younger generations don't have this experience. The Brownie Club is my way of making that change. I want younger generations to be positively encouraged that they can do anything they put their mind to in the same way I did.  It takes hard work and determination but there are support networks out there to reach your goals. </p>
<p>I've been teaching aerial, circus and gymnastics in boroughs across London and understand the benefits of physical and creative arts. To have a teacher that understands and nurtures your drive, ambitions and talent is really important.</p>
<p>I came across aerial circus though an outreach programme with Upswing aerial when they were doing a call out for BAME actors and dancers.  From that opportunity they mentored me and encouraged me to train and develop my artistry, since then I have gone on to perform professionally, and lead classes and workshops for them.</p>
<p>I'm also working with a brilliant producer, Jo Mackie, to help produce the project. Jo has been producing dance, circus and theatre shows since 2013 and has run a number of high profile education and outreach projects with The Old Vic and Almeida. We've been working as a team since the beginning of 2018 and we're super confident we can pull this off - your support will just make the sky the limit!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With the brilliant, co-producing support of Jacksons Lane, a huge amount of development support from Proteus Theatre, and an incredible team of artistic collaborators, as well as funding from Arts Council England already in place, there are little to no risks in this campaign. With funding secured, we're already making the show, and we've started to build some links with local schools and organisations who are keen to take up the offer of free tickets for their networks of young people, including WAC (Weekend Arts Centre) and the Young London Goan Society. We have a degree of flexibility as to when we run the workshops, which means that as and when we know how much money we've raised, we can begin planning and coordinating them. Jacksons Lane are already holding 20 seats for us, which is the amount we've already built into our budget. They're ready to put more on reserve as and when the crowd funder raises money. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We completely understand that not everyone will be able to make a financial contribution towards this project. However, your support in sharing this campaign will make a huge difference, and we'd love you to come and see the show and tell us what you think! Another way you can really help is by giving me a follow on social media, keeping an eye out and sharing information about the show to others. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We (Shelley Farmer and Alex Hare) are theatre artists who began collaborating on this project based on Shelley's experience as a teenage fanatic of the groundbreaking films of the French New Wave -- films like Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless and Pierrot le Fou, Agnes Varda's Cleo from 5 to 7, and Truffaut's Shoot the Piano Player -- who then grew up to question the politics of these films and the world around her. The play uses live-feed filming (sometimes controlled by a cameraman, sometimes by audience volunteers)  to explore the connection between how women are captured on camera and how women are treated behind the scenes, on the street, in daily life, etc. Movies have shaped the way we look at each other, and while it can be wonderful to be looked at, it is also dangerous. It seemed worthwhile to gather a group of people together in a theatre to take a look at that dynamic in action, as well as to dream up alternatives to the narrowness of the male gaze.</p>
<p>We've assembled a team of inventive designers and committed actors, and we're raising money to ensure that 1) they are paid for their labor and 2) they have the resources to realize their essential roles in making this show. While the French New Wave was seen as an auteur-driven movement, we are striving to create a more egalitarian experience, and that means lifting up our team, which includes:</p>
<p>Greg Balla (actor), Erin Healani Chung (actor), An-lin Dauber (set/costume designer), Shelley Farmer (actor/co-writer), Jennifer Fok (lighting design), Michael Gildin (composer), Madeleine Goldsmith (producer), Alex Hare (director/co-writer), Abraham Marlett (stage maanger), Adam Weppler (actor), John Zhao (film consultant)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<p>The money will go to:</p>
<p>1) $1,870 - fees for our actors, set/costume designer, lighting designer, sound designer, stage manager, and other staff </p>
<p>2) $1,100 - Set, costumes, video technology, and lighting equipment</p>
<p>3) $200 - Marketing costs (digital, postcards, posters)</p>
<p>That's all! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The present moment is one of rare frankness about the structural disadvantages, obstacles, and abuses that women face in the entertainment industry (along with other industries). We want to be a part of that discussion from a different angle, using cinematic language as a lens. We also strive to harness the power of theatre to serve as a space where people of all or no genders can dream together about a better world, one in which a multiplicity of gazes is valued. We're sincerely grateful to anyone who is interested in helping us make that come to life.</p>

<div>Justine Lemos, PhD, (that's me, director of Nataraj West) has been studying and performing classical Indian dance in the lineage of Guru Ranjanaa Devi for 18 years. Such an intense and long-term relationship with a Guru (teacher) is rare in the contemporary world. It is my artistic path to learn and embody as much of my Guru's vast repertoire as I possible in my lifetime.  I regularly perform throughout the US including annual performances in Mendocino, CA. This fall My teacher, Guru Ranjanaa Devi, has given me an opportunity to study choreographies to expand my repertoire by traveling to the East Coast twice for dance intensives. I will travel to study dance with her in October and in November. Please support this campaign so I can continue to study with my teacher and that I might continue to offer performances of classical Indian dance to our community.</div> </div> <div> <h3>This is the deal:</h3> <ul>
<li>Nataraj West will raise $1000 to offset travel costs to the East Coast, guru dakshina (payment to one's teacher), and as seed money for a performance in Mendocino of new (to me) choreography</li> <li>All sponsors will be listed on our website and in playbills. All donations are tax-deductible.</li> <li>Even if we don't reach our entire goal we still can use funds to offset travel costs. </li> </ul>

It is my artistic path to learn and embody as much of my Guru's vast repertoire as I possible in my lifetime.  I regularly perform throughout the US including annual performances in Mendocino, CA. This fall My teacher, Guru Ranjanaa Devi, has given me an opportunity to study choreographies to expand my repertoire by traveling to the East Coast twice for dance intensives. I will travel to study dance with her in October and in November. Please support this campaign so I can continue to study with my teacher and that I might continue to offer performances of classical Indian dance to our community.   This is the deal: 
Nataraj West will raise $1000 to offset travel costs to the East Coast, guru dakshina (payment to one's teacher), and as seed money for a performance in Mendocino of new (to me) choreography All sponsors will be listed on our website and in playbills. All donations are tax-deductible. Even if we don't reach our entire goal we still can use funds to offset travel costs.  
  The Impact 
My teacher's lineage is precious. Please help me preserve these teachings.  If you loved our Bhakti performance of classical Indian dance and Music here is a chance to support this sacred art in our community.

<p>""Skill and talent and the balls to arrive at your own conclusions."" </p>
<p>-American Buffalo by David Mamet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This winter we will be
launching a stage production of David Mamet’s American Buffalo in a Chicago
venue. Mamet’s play is a character piece, set in Chicago. It’s a 3-man show that
brings us inside the lives of an everyday American in Don’s resale shop. One of
Mamet’s earlier pieces of work, it is credited with working “The iambic pentameter
out of the vernacular of the underclass.” It is a play rich in language,
character, meaning and cultural significance. The New York Post called it “a
gripping and exciting play which provides the richest and best qualities of
theater experience.”</p>
<p> We could not be more excited for our
performance, but we’re going to do
things a bit differently. </p>
<p>There will be three different
performances. Our actors will switch roles every night.</p>
<p> That means three opportunities for you to see
three different performances of one incredible show.</p>
<p>3 nights, 3 actors, 3
roles, 3 entirely unique performances. </p>
<ul>
<li>As artists, it is important to find plays that
     challenge us and make us grow. American Buffalo is one of those plays. Not
     only is it an amazing show for artists to perform, but it is a story that
     shines a light on the types of people in our society that we see every day
     on the streets, but never notice. It is an underdog story, sprinkled with
     realistic irony that makes for a great dark comedy.</li>
<li>With your contribution we will be able to put on the
     play. With a little bit MORE of your contribution we'll be able to make
     the play look great!</li>
</ul>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need to raise
enough money to pay for the performance rights to the script. Without your help
we will not (legally) be allowed to perform the play in public.</p>
<p>The rest of the
contributions will go toward building the set and making the costumes and other
technical production needs.</p>
<p>If we make our full
goal, we will also be able to fund advertisement’s, such as posters, flyers,
and postcards.</p>
<p> I (Tess, the director) have worked with
Mamet's text before, and have directed several plays and short films. The
actors are well seasoned, although they look young! Our crew is incredibly passionate
with resumes that make me feel like I should step up my game! I believe that
this show will be more than just a successful play.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>This is a great
opportunity for us as artists, but also for our community. David Mamet is a
Chicago raised writer, director, and actor, this play is in a way a portrait of
the working class of the city. This play focuses on the seedy characters in our
society and gives us some insight into the lives of those we might ignore. Even
if you’ve never heard of Mamet or American Buffalo, even if you’re not from Chicago,
you will be able to relate to the everyday struggle of the American dream
present in this script. We will be able to give the people in our community a
chance to see an exciting new take on a very relevant and powerful play. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Our biggest obstacle
is securing a venue. We need your funding to make our performance a reality.
With your help we can rent a performance space and get to work! However, if worse
comes to worst, we can probably find a church, school or library that likes us!</p>
<p>The second biggest
obstacle is securing the rights. If we don’t raise the funds in time, it is
possible for another company to buy out the rights for a winter show. If that
is the case we will have to push our performance into the spring.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Before ""I Love Lucy"", he loved Lucy.</p>
<p>Love is a thread that weaves together everything about this production! It has been in the loving hands of Robert Bartley and Danny Whitman for a number of years, and now it is time to make its full production debut at Pegasus Theatre, in Dallas, TX.  We're thrilled our friends and colleagues at Pegasus have thrown their heart and soul into this project! Pegasus Theatre has been in operation since 1985 and has an impressive track record with large and small productions. If you're local to the DFW area, you've more than likely seen at least one of their signature Living Black &amp; White™ stage shows.  In January of this year, they were even featured on the<a href=""https://www.today.com/video/go-behind-the-scenes-of-the-play-with-everything-in-black-and-white-1147407427707"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> TODAY Show!</a></p>
<p>Make no mistake, this will be a full-scale Broadway-style musical!  Pegasus has produced musicals in the past, but those shows were relatively small as their previous space didn't allow for a large cast onstage at a given time.  Today, working out of the beautiful Eisemann Center in Richardson, TX, as they have for the past twelve years, Pegasus has the opportunity to fill that space with an incredible new musical. More singing, more dancing, and more color than ever before!</p>
<p>Pegasus will be mounting the first fully staged production of this charming love story. <i>The Cuban &amp; The Redhead</i> will bring to life the heartwarming story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz long before ""I Love Lucy"" hit the air waves.</p>
<p>With your contributions, we can make sure this production gets the star treatment it deserves!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We need $20,000 to make this dream a reality.  That may seem like a lot, but it's only 10% of the total cost. Musicals are expensive to produce, and this one is no exception. There are costs we have never encountered before: paying a 25-person cast, costuming and wigging that 25-person cast, body microphones, a music director, a band, extra lighting and sound equipment, etc.   </p>
<p>""But what do I get?"" We hear you.  That's a lot of money to ask for. For varying levels of contributions, you'll get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access to Behind-the-Scenes information</li>
<li>Your name listed in our program</li>
<li>VIP tickets to the show</li>
<li>A signed photo of the cast</li>
<li>A signed copy of the musical score</li>
<li>A signed copy of the script</li>
<li>A backstage meeting with our Lucy and Desi after a performance</li>
<li>Meeting with the show creators</li>
<li>AND MORE!</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Pegasus Theatre's mission statement has always focused on bringing new comedies to life.  There's nothing more steeped in comic gold than Lucille Ball.  But her story (and Desi's) haven't always been the bust-a-gut rollicking misadventures their show gave us.  Robert and Danny have worked on this show for years, fine-tuning and rewriting, to make sure this is the pinnacle of perfection. This has been a labor of love for these two and Pegasus Theatre is more than excited to mount this show.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533151024/ef4gvcrdi6brw6jflb0d.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Pegasus Theatre has been in operation for more than 30 years.  Our original Living Black &amp; White ™ series has been a staple of the Dallas theater scene for ages.  And since our move to the Eisemann Center, our shows have gotten bigger, more technically refined, and grayer than ever before.  We have deft hands handling our big-budget shows, and this one proves to be no exception.  The only problem we have is that our coffers such as they are just won't support the extra needs of a large-scale musical.  And that's why we NEED you.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><p>If you can't contribute very much financially, there are more ways for you to help Pegasus Theatre reach our goal. <strong>Share, Share, Share!</strong> It's a numbers game. If we were to email every single person on our email list, statistics say only 2% will respond with a donation.  Not a huge number, right?</p><p>Well, if you share this on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, we can expand our reach. Who do you think would enjoy a show about Lucy and Desi? Did you grow up watching the show live? Do you want to introduce your kids, your grandkids, to this comic couple? DO YOU LOVE LUCY?</p><p>We've set up dedicated accounts on these social media platforms to be accessible! Check out our links to find us and follow our progress.</p><p><strong><a href=""https://facebook.com/pegasustheatredallas/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pegasus Theatre on FaceBook</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href=""https://twitter.com/CubanAndRedhead"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On Twitter @CubanandRedhead </a>   </strong></p><p><strong><a href=""http://www.instagram.com/thecubanandtheredhead"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">On Instagram @TheCubanandTheRedhead</a></strong></p><p>If you can contribute to our campaign, thank you. We are so excited about this leap we are making. It's a thrilling and daunting leap, and we know we can do it with your help.  </p></div>","Short Summary

Pegasus Theatre has been in operation since 1985 and has an impressive track record with large and small productions. If you're local to the DFW area, you've more than likely seen at least one of their signature Living Black & White™ stage shows.  In January of this year, they were even featured on the TODAY Show!
Make no mistake, this will be a full-scale Broadway-style musical!  Pegasus has produced musicals in the past, but those shows were relatively small as their previous space didn't allow for a large cast onstage at a given time.  Today, working out of the beautiful Eisemann Center in Richardson, TX, as they have for the past twelve years, Pegasus has the opportunity to fill that space with an incredible new musical. More singing, more dancing, and more color than ever before!
Pegasus will be mounting the first fully staged production of this charming love story. The Cuban & The Redhead will bring to life the heartwarming story of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz long before ""I Love Lucy"" hit the air waves.
With your contributions, we can make sure this production gets the star treatment it deserves!
What We Need & What You Get

We need $20,000 to make this dream a reality.  That may seem like a lot, but it's only 10% of the total cost. Musicals are expensive to produce, and this one is no exception. There are costs we have never encountered before: paying a 25-person cast, costuming and wigging that 25-person cast, body microphones, a music director, a band, extra lighting and sound equipment, etc.   
""But what do I get?"" We hear you.  That's a lot of money to ask for. For varying levels of contributions, you'll get:

Access to Behind-the-Scenes information
Your name listed in our program
VIP tickets to the show
A signed photo of the cast
A signed copy of the musical score
A signed copy of the script
A backstage meeting with our Lucy and Desi after a performance
Meeting with the show creators
AND MORE!

The Impact

Pegasus Theatre's mission statement has always focused on bringing new comedies to life.  There's nothing more steeped in comic gold than Lucille Ball.  But her story (and Desi's) haven't always been the bust-a-gut rollicking misadventures their show gave us.  Robert and Danny have worked on this show for years, fine-tuning and rewriting, to make sure this is the pinnacle of perfection. This has been a labor of love for these two and Pegasus Theatre is more than excited to mount this show.

Pegasus Theatre has been in operation for more than 30 years.  Our original Living Black & White ™ series has been a staple of the Dallas theater scene for ages.  And since our move to the Eisemann Center, our shows have gotten bigger, more technically refined, and grayer than ever before.  We have deft hands handling our big-budget shows, and this one proves to be no exception.  The only problem we have is that our coffers such as they are just won't support the extra needs of a large-scale musical.  And that's why we NEED you.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't contribute very much financially, there are more ways for you to help Pegasus Theatre reach our goal. Share, Share, Share! It's a numbers game. If we were to email every single person on our email list, statistics say only 2% will respond with a donation.  Not a huge number, right?Well, if you share this on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, we can expand our reach. Who do you think would enjoy a show about Lucy and Desi? Did you grow up watching the show live? Do you want to introduce your kids, your grandkids, to this comic couple? DO YOU LOVE LUCY?We've set up dedicated accounts on these social media platforms to be accessible! Check out our links to find us and follow our progress.Pegasus Theatre on FaceBookOn Twitter @CubanandRedhead    On Instagram @TheCubanandTheRedheadIf you can contribute to our campaign, thank you. We are so excited about this leap we are making. It's a thrilling and daunting leap, and we know we can do it with your help.",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

And even more to be announced!</p><p></p><p>Q: Sounds pretty cool, but is that all?</p><p></p><p>A: Fuck no!

For our out-of-town guests we suggest a stay at the Westin Convention Center that is only blocks from the venue and of whom we have no official affiliation. But it is gorgeous, close, comfortable, and you'll have an exquisite view of Pittsburghs downtown to help fulfill your stay in our beautiful city.

And keep in mind a lot of people helping are already doing this for free! T-shirts may not be printed if the goal isn’t reached, but other than that the show will go on! Of course to make up the difference we will unfortunately have to cover those costs by taking what little remainder there is from the door proceeds. Something we would REALLY like to avoid since the goal is to donate 100% of the proceeds and whatever extra money that could potentially be raised through our indiegogo.

But I don’t know much about the Breast Cancer Research charity you chose. Is it really a good charity? </p><p></p><p>A:  Abso-fucking-lutely! I can no longer display their name as they do not wish to be associated with the context of this event directly which is of course understandabl;e, but never the less, unfortunate. Where and how we will be donating the money can be learned through direct message inquiry either here or through facebook. But our charity of choices statistics are distrubted as follows, according to Charity Navigator, ONLY 2.4% goes to administrative expenses! And a whopping 91.9% goes to program expenses and the rest goes to the fundraising expenses and efficiency. But unfortunately in 2014 only 21.9% was raised by fundraising events. Let’s raise that fucking bar!</p><p></p><p>Q:  I donated a little and I am going to pay at the door, but is there anything else I can do to help?</p><p></p><p>A: Fuck yes, spread the motherfucking word!! You can go to our event pages and share our links or tell your friends or even invite your friends list from the event page directly! </p><p></p><p>And honestly every little bit helps. every penny, every post, every word of mouth conversation is a contribution that creates a snowball effect that will assuredly make Pittsburgh’s 1st annual Bondage Ball a huge success. We can’t thank all of you enough for your kindness, generosity, love, and understanding.

There will be flesh suspension, grind performances, burlesque dancers, fire sideshows, an aerial silk contortionist, and dj's from all of Pittsburgh's goth, industrial, and alternative dance nights! And even more to be announced!Q: Sounds pretty cool, but is that all?A: Fuck no! Free full body painting, free vac bed experience, free poi lessons, There will be a shibari play area, a spanking booth, BDSM equipment open for use, 2 bars to avoid crazy wait times, and kinky vendors!Q: WHOA, I can't miss this! But i'm from out-of-town and am unfamiliar with the city of Pittsburgh. Where might I stay?A: I know the fucking perfect spot! For our out-of-town guests we suggest a stay at the Westin Convention Center that is only blocks from the venue and of whom we have no official affiliation. But it is gorgeous, close, comfortable, and you'll have an exquisite view of Pittsburghs downtown to help fulfill your stay in our beautiful city. Address: 1000 Penn Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15222 Phone: (412) 281-3700Q: That sounds great, i'm ready to donate! I'd also love to donate! But what happens if you don't reach your indiegogo goal? are you going to cancel the event? If not, will we lose any of the awesome things that are planned?A: Not a fucking thing! Some of the boundlessly generous and talented performers chosen for this event have agreed to accept smaller forms of payment if necessary. And keep in mind a lot of people helping are already doing this for free! T-shirts may not be printed if the goal isn’t reached, but other than that the show will go on! Of course to make up the difference we will unfortunately have to cover those costs by taking what little remainder there is from the door proceeds. Something we would REALLY like to avoid since the goal is to donate 100% of the proceeds and whatever extra money that could potentially be raised through our indiegogo. But all the performances and activities will stay in effect, we’re ALL determined to raise a lot of money for the cause!Q:  I’ll be there for sure! But I don’t know much about the Breast Cancer Research charity you chose. Is it really a good charity? A:  Abso-fucking-lutely! I can no longer display their name as they do not wish to be associated with the context of this event directly which is of course understandabl;e, but never the less, unfortunate. Where and how we will be donating the money can be learned through direct message inquiry either here or through facebook. But our charity of choices statistics are distrubted as follows, according to Charity Navigator, ONLY 2.4% goes to administrative expenses! And a whopping 91.9% goes to program expenses and the rest goes to the fundraising expenses and efficiency. But unfortunately in 2014 only 21.9% was raised by fundraising events. Let’s raise that fucking bar!Q:  I donated a little and I am going to pay at the door, but is there anything else I can do to help?A: Fuck yes, spread the motherfucking word!! You can go to our event pages and share our links or tell your friends or even invite your friends list from the event page directly! And honestly every little bit helps. every penny, every post, every word of mouth conversation is a contribution that creates a snowball effect that will assuredly make Pittsburgh’s 1st annual Bondage Ball a huge success. We can’t thank all of you enough for your kindness, generosity, love, and understanding. We will raise the money needed, we will raise tons more to donate, and with our contribution to breast cancer research we are ensuring a beautiful tomorrow. Thank you all!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hello Everyone near and far! I am Katie, and in May 2011 I graduated from Alfred University where I received my Bachelor’s degree in theater and a minor dance. At Alfred University, I was awakened with this new found creativity as well as embraced with an amazing support system. Those influential people have helped me to become the person that I am today, causing me to want to make my own unique and positive impact on the lives of others. I found that I am inspired to create my performance work based on collaboration, mass (people), movement from site, happiness, spontaneity, and life experiences. Not only was I able to create work as a choreographer, but I was also able to develop as an actress as well by taking on various types of roles. These past four years of my life have been quite an exciting journey for me and have made me realize that I am looking for more!!     </p>
<p>Just this month I found out that I was accepted into Headlong Performance Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania for their Fall 2012, Post Baccalaureate semester! During this intensive semester I will have the chance to train, create, perform, and see work (including a full schedule of performances in the <a href=""http://www.livearts-fringe.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Live Arts/Philly Fringe Festival</a>) in the heart of Philadelphia's vibrant and internationally-known performance scene. This intensive Philadelphia semester is a hybrid performance founded and taught by working artists, including artistic directors of <a href=""http://www.headlong.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Headlong Dance Theater</a> and <a href=""http://www.pigiron.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pig Iron Theatre Company</a>. This is an AMAZING opportunity to further my education, but I am turning to you for your support. Since graduation, I have have been looking for that place of both comfort and community as well as my favorite, HAPPINESS, just like I received at my own college, and I know that Headlong Performance Institute is where I need to be :D</p>
<p>I need YOUR support, so I can be that person to make a diffrence in the lives of others and get an OUTSTANDING education, because I am rasing the money all on my own! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Although I was accepted, I can only go if I raise the money!</h3>
<h3> ONLY  5,000 total!!!!! (but I can't change the amount on here!!)</h3>
<p><strong>Let's Reach 5,000 for my tuition!</strong></p>
<p> Tuition (not including housing, meals, etc)</p>
<p>**This will be paying for all HPI performances trips and tickets which are included in the tuition fee.</p>
<p><strong>Let's reach 4,000 for housing and expenses!!!  </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Be the Change You Wish to See In the World</strong></h3>
<p>There is no doubt in my mind that Headlong Performance Institute will help me grow as an artist through exploration while finding new and inventive ways to work with others. There are still there many skills which I have yet to learn and would love to attain at Headlong. I am at that stage in my life where I want to push myself as an individual artist and test myself in the most creative ways possible.</p>
<p>If you contribute to helping me further my education, you are helping me get  one step closer to acheiving my dream!  </p>
</div>
<div>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This means so help that you are able to take the time and help me out!</p>
<p>If you could spread the word to friends, family and colleagues that would be AMAZING!!!!</p>

Named Best New Play at the 2007 San Francisco Fringe Festival, Conversation Storm jolts audiences from detached definitions of officially sanctioned interrogation techniques and confronts us with the real world consequences of our choices.  Conversation Storm was written by Rick Burkhardt, the co-creator of Three Pianos, which is currently completing a triumphant run in New York and which the Wall Street  Journal described as “a hilarious, yet wise, examination of friendship, depression and classical music.”   We feel that Conversation Storm is the ideal piece with which to introduce ourselves to the Los Angeles community, in that it simultaneously interrogates urgent political matters, the limits of friendship and the theatrical situation itself.  
We are enormously excited to enter the production process, so we invite you to help us reach our funding critical mass, that is, our goal of $10,000.   In doing so, you will take part in instigating the extraordinary. 
Also, we will be posting a video pitch in the next ten days, so keep on a eye on this spot!Uranium Madhouse is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions in behalf of Uranium Madhouse may be made payable to Fractured Atlas and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.

<p>Now you're thinking: ""That's terrific! But it sounds like it's going to be expensive."" You're right! We're raising money to pay for all the things necessary to produce a show in an Off-Broadway theater: actors, musicians, lights, costumes, sets, sound equipment, etc...oh and vests, did we mention the vests?</p>
<p>Now you're thinking: ""How can I help?"" See...this is why we like you. Click ""contribute"" at the bottom of the page and donate what you can! Because our project is fiscally sponsored by Fractured Atlas, your donations are tax deductible! Neat! We can't begin to thank you enough for your financial contributions. Seriously, our gratitude knows no bounds. Because it is difficult to hug you via the internet, instead we are offering the nifty perks you see on the right! So consider the perks an online hug.

A lot.</p>
<h3>ABOUT THE SHOW</h3>
<p>An obsessive-compulsive, socially awkward, tolerably attractive guy sings and tells jokes…and he has a twin! Donning sweater vests and each armed with a razor-sharp wit, The Rescignos are like Cain and Abel but with more singing and less fratricide. In The Rescignos Variety Show, the Rescigno boys join forces with a talented ensemble of actors for an evening of comedy, jaunty musical numbers, and sweater vests. We take our fun very seriously.</p>

It's challenging, it's exciting, it's complicated, it's expensive...but it's oh, so worth it to bring something new and original to life!
Right now, we are working on a sassy, sappy show about love to offer up this Valentine's Day weekend, but we need help to make it happen!
What We Need & What You Get
 
We need a budget for:
-Sets (approx. $250)
-Props (approx. $200)
-Costumes (approx. $200)
-Cast album recording costs ($150)
-Venue rental for performances ($500)
Obviously, the total here is more than our goal of $800. We are hoping for ticket sales to make up the rest, and of course if people want to keep giving once we surpass the goal amount, we won't complain! And even if we don't reach our goal, every little bit helps in the process of this production.
In exchange for helping us, you can gain recognition in our program, a free cast album, and/or a number of other awesome perks (in addition to good karma)!   The Impact 
Original scripts and new works are the future of theater. If you have ever loved a play or musical, remember that at one point, that playwright was unknown and trying to find a way to share their shows with the world. That's where we're at now.

<p>Recently, we were working hard in pre production with the web series version of ""From 1 to 10.""

<h2>Ok? So like, what's your project about? </h2>
<div>So glad you asked! </div>
<div>""From 1 to 10"" takes place at a full service marketing and research facility. At the helm is the office supervisor Brett, an over-weight, nerd, who puts the A in anti-social. Along with Brett are his employees, Natalie and Kelly. Natalie is a sassy Puerto Rican who falls in love with any guy with a great sob story. Kelly is the type of girl to shoot you with daggers from her eyes, then cloak you in a smile; the best friend you need, but really don't want. In the corporate world, these ladies always find themselves the assistant to the assistant, never the wife of the CEO, where they feel they truly deserve to be. </div>
<p>
</p>
<p>Today, the head honcho from Coca-Cola is coming in, as the Research Center will be conducting a focus group on a new flavor. This is a huge account so everyone is on edge, under pressure, and stressed out. Everyone except for Natalie and Kelly, that is, who couldn't care less. It isn't until Brett informs them that Jack, the son of the CEO and essentially our generation's John ""John-John"" Kennedy Jr. is also coming in to make sure everything goes smoothly with the Coca-Cola people, do Natalie and Kelly get swept up in the frenzy of the day as well. </p>

<p>Mistakes are made, secrets are unearthed, feelings are hurt, friendships are torn apart, someone looses an appendage - all before lunch - in this crazy workplace comedy. </p>

<div>Well, the truth is we need your donation to get our wickedly funny office comedy to the big stage and then to a screen near you! Just to be a part of the festival you must pay a fee, it's New York nothing's free! Not to mention, a show like this requires a talented team, and lots of pieces to bring it to light. </div>

Each round is another amazing shot to showcase your work! </p>

cheap drinks and wrestling-style entertainment.  The amazing community that led to the rise of PWR has kept us alive for 5 incredible shows.  As we plunge forward into ""PWR Presents: Darkwar"", our most high-concept and immersive show yet, we look again to the Multiverse to help us shoulder the financial burden of COMPLETE, MAXIMUM EVIL.  Despite always stepping our game up each show, we've played it fairly safe as far as setting and story.  NOT THIS TIME.  This is basically our dream show, and we are diving headfirst into it.<br/></p><p></p><h2>What the HECK is Darkwar? </h2>At our last show, JUDGMENT SLAM, a treacherous, sentient machine known as Deep Slam took the Partyweight Championship from the human hero Dock Master. Using a time portal opened from the future, he traveled forward into a dark distopia for reasons unknown, taking the Partyweight Belt with him and leaving PWR in ruin.  At DARKWAR, we will travel into the future and bring the audience with us as we begin the final battle for the fate of mankind. This show will be taking place IN THE FUTURE, so we will be going crazier with decorations, props, and lighting than we ever have before.  Think laser tag warehouse meets 80's cyberpunk distopia.  We have been VERY cost-effective with our budget and resources (most of our decorations have been crafted from literal trash) so this extra funding will help us make this show shockingly immersive and cool.<br/><p></p><h2>What We Need and What You Get </h2><p></p>Here are all the things we're looking to include on the show:<br/>* Bigger, better and MORE decorations (a crazy amount of blacklights, a fully functioning and 100% REAL time travel portal at the entrance of the venue, A BLOOD FOUNTAIN, lasers, etc.)<br/>*Costumes<br/>*Payments to own our ring, maintenance and upgrades (we're part of the way there thanks to past donations but the floor and frame still need some love)<br/>*Support people working on PWR (Planning the events requires a crazy level of work and incurs a lot of incidental costs)<br/>*Webhosting for our sweet website and webstore<br/>*Video equipment for promos and show coverage<br/><br/>Covering these costs with donations ensures we don't need to have a door charge for the shows and can keep them FREE.<br/><br/><h2>Risks &amp; Challenges </h2><p><br/>Challenges:<br/></p><p>PWR has mostly become self-sufficient, but now as it continues to grow we are entering a new realm of costs we could not have imagined before (but are very excited about!).  Thank you for your continued support.  Rest assured we are working night and day to make sure this event is the most fun thing you do all year.<br/><br/>Risks:<br/><br/>We laugh at the concept of ""risk.""

cheap drinks and wrestling-style entertainment.  The amazing community that led to the rise of PWR has kept us alive for 5 incredible shows.  As we plunge forward into ""PWR Presents: Darkwar"", our most high-concept and immersive show yet, we look again to the Multiverse to help us shoulder the financial burden of COMPLETE, MAXIMUM EVIL.  Despite always stepping our game up each show, we've played it fairly safe as far as setting and story.  NOT THIS TIME.  This is basically our dream show, and we are diving headfirst into it.What the HECK is Darkwar? At our last show, JUDGMENT SLAM, a treacherous, sentient machine known as Deep Slam took the Partyweight Championship from the human hero Dock Master. Using a time portal opened from the future, he traveled forward into a dark distopia for reasons unknown, taking the Partyweight Belt with him and leaving PWR in ruin.  At DARKWAR, we will travel into the future and bring the audience with us as we begin the final battle for the fate of mankind. This show will be taking place IN THE FUTURE, so we will be going crazier with decorations, props, and lighting than we ever have before.  Think laser tag warehouse meets 80's cyberpunk distopia.  We have been VERY cost-effective with our budget and resources (most of our decorations have been crafted from literal trash) so this extra funding will help us make this show shockingly immersive and cool.What We Need and What You Get Here are all the things we're looking to include on the show:* Bigger, better and MORE decorations (a crazy amount of blacklights, a fully functioning and 100% REAL time travel portal at the entrance of the venue, A BLOOD FOUNTAIN, lasers, etc.)*Costumes*Payments to own our ring, maintenance and upgrades (we're part of the way there thanks to past donations but the floor and frame still need some love)*Support people working on PWR (Planning the events requires a crazy level of work and incurs a lot of incidental costs)*Webhosting for our sweet website and webstore*Video equipment for promos and show coverageCovering these costs with donations ensures we don't need to have a door charge for the shows and can keep them FREE.Risks & Challenges Challenges:PWR has mostly become self-sufficient, but now as it continues to grow we are entering a new realm of costs we could not have imagined before (but are very excited about!).  Thank you for your continued support.  Rest assured we are working night and day to make sure this event is the most fun thing you do all year.Risks:We laugh at the concept of ""risk."" It is as outmoded as ""shame,"" or ""weakness.""Other Ways You Can Help If
 you don't want to donate money you can help us by getting the word out 
about this campaign and/or just word out about PWR and our upcoming

<p><b><i>Happy Few Theatre Company </i></b><i>is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-</i><i>profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of <b>Happy Few Theatre Company</b> must be made payable to “Fractured<b> </b>Atlas” only. Any contribution above perk value is tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.</i><br/></p><p><b>Our Company:</b></p>
<p><i>the goodbye room</i> is the second production of Happy Few
Theatre Company! Based in New York City, we aim to create actor-driven
productions that find the fundamental joy of storytelling in both classic and
new plays. We hope to engage audiences with productions that speak to ideas of
community and what is continually human, in a stripped-down approach that is
direct, inventive and fun. </p>
<p>Our first production, a seven-person <i>As You Like It</i>,
received three New York Innovative Theatre Award nominations, for Outstanding
Revival, Outstanding Ensemble, and Outstanding Original Music. Reviewers said
the production was “gutsy, highly enjoyable,” and “leaves you happy,” while the
actors were all “masters of their craft,” “hot,” and that “the whole cast
brings alive the beauty of Shakespeare’s words with clarity and passion, and…keeps
the audience propelled throughout with their talent.” </p>
<p>For our second production, we are excited to presenting the
world premiere of a brand new play, which is an equally important kind of work
for us, and with the same emphasis on a production that is what theatre’s
really about—being together in a single room.</p>
<p>Your support is crucial. Whether you helped us found the
company by contributing to our inaugural production or whether you’re thinking
about helping us out for the first time now, your donations are the only thing
that make our work possible. Our Indiegogo campaign for <i>As You Like It</i> was
our sole source of funding for the production, and we used 98% of the funds
raised for direct production needs and artist stipends.</p>
<p><b>Our Production:</b></p>
<p><i>the goodbye room, </i>a new play by Eric Gilde, gives us a
window into the relationship of two sisters following their mother’s death. Set
in a quiet Midwestern town, the play’s four characters each have a story to
tell, a contemporary lens on a timeless problem. Are grieving and moving
forward two sides of the same coin? Simple but heartfelt, the play explores
what we hide, what we share, and the individuality of response to this most
universal of human experiences. </p>
<p>The production will run March 3 – 19, 2016, evenings and
Sunday matinees, at the Bridge Theatre in Shetler Studios, conveniently located
at 244 W. 54th street in midtown Manhattan.</p>
<p><b>Who We Are:</b></p>
<p>Happy Few Theatre Company is excited to welcome in a few new
company members for this production! Co-Artistic Directors Eric Gilde
(directing) and Ellen Adair (“Bex”) will be joined by the very talented Craig Wesley Divino, Sarah
Killough, and Michael Selkirk. Sarah Lahue, our indomitable stage
manager for <i>As You Like It</i>, will be returning, as will Brittany Crowell, in
the role of production manager.</p>
<p><b>Our Budget:</b></p>
<p>Our budget is $10,250. Which is a lot of money—we know!—but we
got to that number by adding together these ones:</p>
<p>$4,450 – Space. About half of our budget goes to renting the
theatre for our tech process and three weeks of performances ($3,450) and our
four weeks of rehearsal in the most affordable spaces we could find ($1,100).
Many Off-Off Broadway theatre spaces in Manhattan can cost $3,000 PER WEEK, so
we are trying to make this production happen as affordably as possible.</p>
<p>$2,500 – Artist stipends for 4 actors, 3 designers, a stage
manager, production manager and a house manager, $250 apiece. Actors’ Equity
requires that actors in its union are given payment for a transportation
stipend in the labor-of-love contract that we’re all working under. We think
it’s only fair that our tireless management team and brilliant designers and
tech team receive the same compensation. We will be having a couple more
performances of <i>the goodbye room</i> than our last production, so we have given
everyone a little bit of a raise. Still, $250 for a couple of months of love of
and work is far less than we wish we could give!</p>
<p>$200 – Volunteer Accident Insurance. To cover the lovely and
talented people on the line item above.</p>
<p>$100 – Costumes</p>
<p>$1000 – Sets. We want to turn a little black box theatre
into a Midwestern living room.</p>
<p>$200 – Props</p>
<p>$50 – Additional Lighting Equipment. Most of what we need is
supplied by the theatre!</p>
<p>$1250 – Publicity and PR</p>
<p>$275 – Programs, Scripts</p>
<p>$125 – Stage Management Expenses (Rehearsal and Cleaning
Supplies, Laundry)</p>
<p><b>How You Can Help:</b></p>
<p>Mounting a second production can be even more challenging
than creating a first, and your support is more important to us now than ever.
Please help Happy Few Theatre Company continue to make work that is truly
audience-driven, but doesn’t have to cater to the production boundaries of
organizations with a larger upkeep.</p>
<p>We know it’s a hard time for everyone to donate, but no gift
is too small. A little can go a long way in the world of small independent
theatre! Having a large number of donors behind us will support us in spirit as
well as in practical financial terms. In addition, your donations are fully
tax-deductible, through the sponsorship of this production by Fractured Atlas. </p>
<p>If you would prefer to donate by check, please email us at
happyfewtheatre@gmail.com for specific instructions. Checks must be made out to
Fractured Atlas; we cannot accept checks made out to the production or the
company.</p>

spread the word about this campaign and about our company. Follow us on
Facebook for updates on the show and entertaining tidbits, and share our page
with friends who might be interested in seeing the show or the work that we do.</p>
<p><b>Contributions and Perks:</b></p>
<p>If you are able to donate (whatever you believe in, bless
you!), we have a few small perks as an effort to express our gratitude. Please
know that the fair market value of our perks will not be part of your
tax-deductible donation—if you would prefer not to get a perk and have the

perk.</p>

You will receive all of the above, plus credit in the program as the
patron of the performance or design you have sponsored, and a magnet with the
production artwork, signed by the artist you sponsored, AND a signed copy of
the play!</p>

<p>Please note that your offer of a ticket or tickets for any
amount above $25 will still require making a reservation for a particular
evening. We encourage you to make those reservations early since they will not
guarantee you a space should performances sell out, and our performance space
is very intimate—we want the audience to be part of the family! </p>

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><i> </i><b>Hello!</b></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">My name is Jack Webb. I'm a choreographer based in Edinburgh and for the past 10 years I've been working internationally as a dancer and choreographer with various companies and choreographers. Read about me here - <a href=""http://www.jackwebbperformance.com/jack-webb.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.jackwebbperformance.com/jack-webb.html</a></span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I'm looking for your help to realise my latest work 'THE END'.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>What on Earth is 'THE END'?</b></span></div>
<div>'THE END' is a new 70 minute contemporary dance performance and is a Tramway co-production.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>  <b style=""background-color: initial;"">What's it all about then?</b></p></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">'THE END' is very important project to me. It emerged during a time of choreographic research when I was considering what it might mean if I were to STOP choreographing altogether. What would I be left with? </span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">But I found that the idea of endings became very inspiring because it suddenly made a lot of space for new and positive beginnings!</span></div>
</div><div>
<h3></h3>
<p>'THE
END' will be a work that uses 'THE END' as a motivation to ask
questions about the human condition by making similar dramatic
provocations. What will the end of the world be like? What would you
say in the last moment at the end of your life? What are our internal
experiences and thoughts
at the end of a performance or the end of a disco and what does that
euphoric feeling leave us with for the future? By only ending our
movements do we create a new way to speak to the audience? In the
fragile and short moments between an end and a beginning, what sort
of universe exists within that time that we could learn something
from? When we end something, is this an opportunity to look at things
differently, openly and begin again? In our society today, are we in
between an end and a beginning, and if so, where are we now and where
are we going next politically and culturally? Considering all of
these provocations, 'THE END' mixes together personal, universal and
primal experiences of the dancers and choreographer with an aim to
communicate basic elements of the human condition that everyone can
relate to. 
</p>
<p><b>Where can I see 'THE END'?</b></p>
<p>'THE END' will premier at the world renowned <b>Tramway</b> in Glasgow on 10th and 11th June 2016 and then will tour in the UK to cities including</p>
<p><b>-Edinburgh</b></p>
<p><b>-Aberdeen</b></p>
<p><b>-London</b></p>
<p><b>-Dundee</b></p>
<p><b>-other venues TBC</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Who is in 'THE END'?</b></p>

</div></div>","Described by the Herald as 'dauntingly impressive', 'compellingly charismatic and compellingly watchable'  and as a 'choreographer of immense power'  by Gareth K Vile/ the Vile Arts/ The List, acclaimed choreographer Jack Webb is looking for your help!

 Hello!

My name is Jack Webb. I'm a choreographer based in Edinburgh and for the past 10 years I've been working internationally as a dancer and choreographer with various companies and choreographers. Read about me here - http://www.jackwebbperformance.com/jack-webb.html


I'm looking for your help to realise my latest work 'THE END'.

What on Earth is 'THE END'?
'THE END' is a new 70 minute contemporary dance performance and is a Tramway co-production.
  What's it all about then?
'THE END' is very important project to me. It emerged during a time of choreographic research when I was considering what it might mean if I were to STOP choreographing altogether. What would I be left with? 
But I found that the idea of endings became very inspiring because it suddenly made a lot of space for new and positive beginnings!


'THE
END' will be a work that uses 'THE END' as a motivation to ask
questions about the human condition by making similar dramatic
provocations. What will the end of the world be like? What would you
say in the last moment at the end of your life? What are our internal
experiences and thoughts
at the end of a performance or the end of a disco and what does that
euphoric feeling leave us with for the future? By only ending our
movements do we create a new way to speak to the audience? In the
fragile and short moments between an end and a beginning, what sort
of universe exists within that time that we could learn something
from? When we end something, is this an opportunity to look at things
differently, openly and begin again? In our society today, are we in
between an end and a beginning, and if so, where are we now and where
are we going next politically and culturally? Considering all of
these provocations, 'THE END' mixes together personal, universal and
primal experiences of the dancers and choreographer with an aim to
communicate basic elements of the human condition that everyone can
relate to. 

Where can I see 'THE END'?
'THE END' will premier at the world renowned Tramway in Glasgow on 10th and 11th June 2016 and then will tour in the UK to cities including
-Edinburgh
-Aberdeen
-London
-Dundee
-other venues TBC

Who is in 'THE END'?
'THE END' is performed by 3 extraordinary and inspiring dancers - Rachael O'Neill, Martyn Garside and Keren Smail all of whom are accomplished very talented dancers and performers. Oh and I'm in it too!

Where will your donation go?
Unfortunately a funding application wasn't successful to make this project happen. Boo! But I have some funds in place for some of the project but it's not quite enough. Another £5000 needs to be raised. Your donation will go towards
-paying 3 extraordinary dancers a decent fee
-paying the choreographer (that's me!)
-travel and accommodation on tour
-PR and marketing materials to advertise the show

PERKS!
For your donation you can receive a variety of perks to thank you including
-thank you on social media and my website and a personal email
- a personalised photograph
-a 1 minute special made dance video inspired by 'THE END'
- an invitation to see the work in progress before it premiers and a meet and greet with tea and cake in the studio

    The Impact of you donation
I strongly believe that even if the circumstances aren't perfect, it's essential to try to make it happen anyway.
I'm committed to contributing to the cultural landscape of Scotland and the UK as much as I can. With my work, I aim to provide an opportunity that people can be inspired by, can spark social and cultural change, can contribute to the ongoing development and growth of contemporary dance as an art form and providing artists and the public with an engaging, compelling and thought provoking experience in a time where the world needs it most. Art is important, essential, fun, crazy, inspiring and can give us all something of value.
Your donation will ensure that the talented dancers I want to work with can be employed and free from exploitation, ensuring that our working practice is ethical.
It will also help me to create a rich artistic experience for the public, a small but hopefully important contribution to the world.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Our three target villages are remote.
Think little to no access to schools, transportation, markets, or
entertainment. Decades of economic hardship cause village populations and
resources to dwindle, yet drug and alcohol addiction to rise. When you invest
in the Quetzales project, you invest in the Totonaco legacy and in the future
of the Totonaco youth. The leaders of Danza del Totonacapan envision connecting
our project’s youth with cultural institutions in bigger cities like Puebla or
Mexico City. With your help to train our young people in Totonaco dance and
music, their opportunities and network have a much greater chance of growing.</p>
<p>Whether you have ancestral Totonaco
ties, or you are passionate about dance, or you just wish to make a difference
in the lives of young people, be assured that any contribution you make will be
a cherished asset to accomplish our project goals. Donate now.</p>
<p><span><span>Coffee Growing Community</span></span> has a proven track record with raising funds for direct investment

families with protein and income sources. For more information on this project and

<p><i>Nuestros

transportación, mercados, o entrenamiento. Décadas de adversidades económicas
provocan que se disminuyan los recursos y la población de los pueblos, mientras
que se aumentan las adicciones a las drogas y alcohol.  Cuando usted invierte en el proyecto de los
Quetzales, invierte en la legacía totonaca y el futuro de los jóvenes totonacos.
Los líderes de la Danza del Totonacapan desean conectar los jóvenes de nuestro

Coffee Growing Community has a proven track record with raising funds for direct investment
in Chicontla and surrounding communities. Our most recent projects are backyard
poultry operations led by local veterinarian Dr. Javier Aranda Since 2012, 30
families have received a poultry coop kit and starter pullets, providing these
families with protein and income sources. For more information on this project and
how you can donate, click here. El impacto
Nuestros
pueblos enfocados son lejanos. Imagine muy poco o falta de acceso a escuelas,
transportación, mercados, o entrenamiento. Décadas de adversidades económicas
provocan que se disminuyan los recursos y la población de los pueblos, mientras
que se aumentan las adicciones a las drogas y alcohol.  Cuando usted invierte en el proyecto de los
Quetzales, invierte en la legacía totonaca y el futuro de los jóvenes totonacos.
Los líderes de la Danza del Totonacapan desean conectar los jóvenes de nuestro
proyecto con las instituciones culturales de ciudades más grandes como Puebla o
la Ciudad de México. Con su apoyo a enseñar la danza y música totonaca a nuestros
jóvenes, tendrán una probabilidad más grande de aumentar sus oportunidades y
redes. 
En cuanto a
si usted tiene conexión ancestral totonaca, o si usted tiene una pasión para la
danza, o si usted simplemente desea hacer una diferencia en las vidas de los
jóvenes, le aseguramos que cualquiera contribución que contribuye será un recurso
valioso para cumplir nuestras metas del proyecto. Done ahora.

Growing Communitytiene
una historia probada de juntar fondos para la inversión directa en Chicontla y
las comunidades alrededores. Nuestro proyecto más reciente incluye gallineros
de patio manejado por un veterinario local Dr. Javier Aranda. Desde 2012, 30
familias han recibido un conjunto de gallinero de patio y pollitos que las

This project requires coordination
between a large, dedicated team in two countries. Three languages are involved.
So there will be time needed to hire the music and dance teachers, schedule the
lessons and performances in each community, and to deliver the perks to our
supporters. We appreciate your support as we coordinate these efforts!Retos
Este proyecto
requiere la coordinación entre un gran equipo dedicado de dos países. Se
requiere tres idiomas. Así que se necesita tiempo para contratar a los maestros
de danza y música, programar las lecciones y representaciones en cada
comunidad, y para enviar los regalos a nuestros partidarios. ¡Le agradecemos su
apoyo mientras que coordinamos estos esfuerzos!

<p><b><b></b></b></p><h3 style=""text-align: right;""><b><b><i>Türkçesi aşağıda...</i></b></b></h3><h3><b><b>Who am I?</b></b></h3><p></p>
<p>Hello this is Fatih.</p>
<p>I am a performer from Istanbul. Upon receiving my BA in
Political Science in Istanbul, I moved to New York City to pursue an MFA in
Acting at CUNY Brooklyn College. I am based in my hometown, İstanbul, since
2010 and working as a performer, director, teacher and other things as need be.</p>
<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p><h3><b><b><b><br/></b></b></b></h3><h3><b><b><b>What have I done?</b></b></b></h3><p></p>
<p>Here is what I have done in the last couple of years back in
my hometown Istanbul:</p>
<p><b>Performed in</b>
Istanbul State Theater’s <i>Hamlet Machine</i>
in Int’l Istanbul Theater Festival, Theater Freiburg/garaistanbul co-production
<i>Cabinet </i>among others</p>
<p><b>Directed</b> the
devised piece <i>Isn’t it?</i> performed in
Int’l Istanbul Theater Festival, Theater Formen and Festival Premieres
(Germany)</p>
<p><b>Was nominated</b> for
<b>Best Promising Actor</b> in New Theater
Magazine Awards 2014</p>
<p><b>Trained with</b> SNDO
Dance School (Netherlands), Grotowski Institute (Poland) SITI Company in Paris
and Suzuki Company of Toga (Japan).</p>
<p><b>Taught at</b> Haliç
University Conservatory, Boğaziçi University, Özyeğin University, Istanbul
Contemporary Performing Arts Center (ÇGSM) among others.</p>
<p><b>Translated </b>Anne
Bogart’s <i>The Viewpoints Book</i>, Declan
Donnellan’s <i>The Actor and the Target</i>. Working on Tadashi Suzuki's texts.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p><h3><b><b><b>What do I want?</b></b></b></h3><p></p>
<p>As you may have guessed I am diligently working towards
being a potent performer as well as deepening my understanding and practice of
different techniques and disciplines. Since 2007, Suzuki Method of Actor
Training has been my principal focus and guide in my creative process. The
Method, concerned with the performers use of body and voice and the creation of
a theatrical ensemnle, is highly acclaimed worldwide and taught in many
institutions including the Juilliard School in New York and Moscow Art Theater
in Russia. <b>This year, I am invited,
among hundreds of applicants to participate in a workshop with the Suzuki
Company of Toga </b>once again. The incredible opportunity to be at the cradle
of the Suzuki method will enable me to deepen my understanding of the method
and gaining priceless insight into the creation and maintenance of a theater
company. I hope to bring home this wisdom and experience to use in my own work
and share it with the world. </p>
<p><br/></p><p><b><b></b></b></p><h3><b><b>Why do I want it?</b></b></h3><p></p>
<p>Although I have done a lot of training and projects
internationally, I have not received a single cent of support from institutions
in my own country. Sadly. The reason is there are <b>extremely limited funds available in Turkey</b> for freelance artists
to travel and access to those funds are more and more restricted in the last
few years with my kind of work labeled as too marginal by the authorities.
Therefore I have always relied on finding other ways to fund my travels
–usually by generating funds by myself. And it’s what I’m doing now. I turn to
my dearest friends, colleagues, teachers, supporters to help me get to Japan
for this precious opportunity.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b><b><b></b></b></b></p><h3><b><b><b>Here's the deal:</b></b></b></h3><p></p>
<p>Here are my expected costs:</p>
<p>Workshop Fee – $1000</p>
<p>International travel (airplane) - $1500 </p>
<p>Local travel in Japan from Tokyo to Toga village (trains and
bus) -$500</p>
<p>Accomodation in Japan - $500</p>
<p>Food and other expenses –$500</p>
<p>TOTAL: $4000</p>
<p>Every single dollar of donation is a great support for me.

still help. Here’s how:</p><p><br/></p>

Hello this is Fatih.
I am a performer from Istanbul. Upon receiving my BA in
Political Science in Istanbul, I moved to New York City to pursue an MFA in
Acting at CUNY Brooklyn College. I am based in my hometown, İstanbul, since
2010 and working as a performer, director, teacher and other things as need be.
What have I done?
Here is what I have done in the last couple of years back in
my hometown Istanbul:
Performed in
Istanbul State Theater’s Hamlet Machine
in Int’l Istanbul Theater Festival, Theater Freiburg/garaistanbul co-production
Cabinet among others
Directed the
devised piece Isn’t it? performed in
Int’l Istanbul Theater Festival, Theater Formen and Festival Premieres
(Germany)
Was nominated for
Best Promising Actor in New Theater
Magazine Awards 2014
Trained with SNDO
Dance School (Netherlands), Grotowski Institute (Poland) SITI Company in Paris
and Suzuki Company of Toga (Japan).
Taught at Haliç
University Conservatory, Boğaziçi University, Özyeğin University, Istanbul
Contemporary Performing Arts Center (ÇGSM) among others.
Translated Anne
Bogart’s The Viewpoints Book, Declan
Donnellan’s The Actor and the Target. Working on Tadashi Suzuki's texts.
What do I want?
As you may have guessed I am diligently working towards
being a potent performer as well as deepening my understanding and practice of
different techniques and disciplines. Since 2007, Suzuki Method of Actor
Training has been my principal focus and guide in my creative process. The
Method, concerned with the performers use of body and voice and the creation of
a theatrical ensemnle, is highly acclaimed worldwide and taught in many
institutions including the Juilliard School in New York and Moscow Art Theater
in Russia. This year, I am invited,
among hundreds of applicants to participate in a workshop with the Suzuki
Company of Toga once again. The incredible opportunity to be at the cradle
of the Suzuki method will enable me to deepen my understanding of the method
and gaining priceless insight into the creation and maintenance of a theater
company. I hope to bring home this wisdom and experience to use in my own work
and share it with the world. 
Why do I want it?
Although I have done a lot of training and projects
internationally, I have not received a single cent of support from institutions
in my own country. Sadly. The reason is there are extremely limited funds available in Turkey for freelance artists
to travel and access to those funds are more and more restricted in the last
few years with my kind of work labeled as too marginal by the authorities.
Therefore I have always relied on finding other ways to fund my travels
–usually by generating funds by myself. And it’s what I’m doing now. I turn to
my dearest friends, colleagues, teachers, supporters to help me get to Japan
for this precious opportunity.
Here's the deal:
Here are my expected costs:
Workshop Fee – $1000
International travel (airplane) - $1500 
Local travel in Japan from Tokyo to Toga village (trains and
bus) -$500
Accomodation in Japan - $500
Food and other expenses –$500
TOTAL: $4000
Every single dollar of donation is a great support for me.
Please consider donating what you can, if you can. And if you can’t, you can
still help. Here’s how:
Other Ways You Can Help

You can offer me accommodation in Tokyo –or Kyoto- or put me in touch with someone who can.
You can share this campaign in your circle (facebook, twitter, website, blog etc.)

You can refer me to organizations who may help me raise the
money.

İstanbul'da tamamladığım Siyaset Bilimi lisans eğitimimin ardından New York'taki CUNY Brooklyn College'de Oyunculuk Yüksek Lisansı yaptım. 2010'dan bu yana İstanbul'da oyuncu, yönetmen, eğitmen vs. olarak çalışmalarımı sürdürüyorum.Neler Yaptım?Son birkaç yılda yaptıklarımdan bazıları şunlar:
İstanbul Devlet Tiyatrosu'nda Hamlet Makinesi'nde, garajistanbul/Theater Freiburg ortak projesi Cabinet'te ve Studio 4 Istanbul yapımı Ali ile Ramazan'da oynadım.
Olmamış mı? adlı oyunu yönettim, İstanbul Tiyatro Festivali, TheaterFormen ve Festival Premieres'de (Almanya) gösterildi.
Yeni Tiyatro Dergisi Ödülleri'nde Beklan Algan Umut Veren Genç Oyuncu Ödülü'ne aday gösterildim.

SNDO Dans Okulu (Hollanda), Grotowski Institute (Polonya) SITI Company ve Suzuki Company of Toga (Japonya) ile eğitim çalışmalarına katıldım.
Haliç Üniversitesi Konservatuarı, Boğaziçi Üniversitesi, Özyeğin Üniversitesi ve Çağdaş Gösteri Sanatları Merkezi'nde ders verdim.
Anne Bogart’ın The Viewpoints Book ve Declan Donnellan’ın The Actor and the Target kitaplarını Türkçe'ye çevirdim, Tadashi Suzuki'nin kitaplarını da çevirmekteyim.

Ne İstiyorum?Bugüne kadar bir oyuncu olarak daha donanımlı hale gelmek için çalışmalarımı sürdürürken, farklı disiplinler ve teknikleri öğrenerek bir sanatçı olarak da bakışımı derinleştirmeye çalışıyorum. 2007 yılından bu yana düzenli olarak çalıştığım Suzuki metodunu Türkiye'de de yaygınlaştırmak için çabalıyorum.

<p> </p>
<p>DC's Occupiers, from whose stories the show takes root, came to see Tent of Dreams at Fringe... and loved it. They were so enthusiastic about this project that they encouraged us to bring the show to the 1 year anniversary of Occupy Wall Street. Nu Sass is thrilled to be continuing the journey - to ask people to participate in the conversation, and to think about and act in their communities! Unfortunately, New York is expensive... and that's were you come in! </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
<p>We aren't evangelizing for Occupy, we aren't trying to recruit our audiences to join the movement. We are starting a conversation about Occupy - its goals and successes, as well as its struggles. We're starting a conversation, and we're inviting YOU to participate. </p>
<p>Activism matters. No matter what your political ideology, the very fact that we have the ability - and the right - to be politically active is a gift that we should all be thankful for. So please, participate! </p>
<p>Art matters, too, for so many reasons, we couldn't begin to list them. But here's one of our favorites: </p>
<p>""Violence cannot flourish by itself; it is inevitably intertwined with LYING. Between them there is the closest, most profound and natural bond: nothing screens violence except lies, and the only way lies can hold out is by violence. ...usually it demands nothing of its victims, only allegiance to and complicity in the lie. </p>
<p>Writers and artists can VANQUISH LIES! In the struggle against lies, art has always won and always will. Conspicuously, incontestably for everyone. Lies can stand up against much in the world, but not against art. </p>
<p>Once lies have been dispelled, the repulsive nakedness of violence will be exposed - and hollow violence will collapse.""</p>
<p>--Alexander Solzhenitsyn, from his 1970 Nobel Lecture</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So, please. Help us start a conversation. Participate in art, participate in activism, and participate in the main message of Occupy - that a better world is a better world for everyone.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What we need &amp; What you get:</h2>
</div>
<p>We will ask our audiences to make donations when they come to see the show, but because we can't ensure an average donation, and won't be turning patrons away if they can't pay, we need to ensure the project is fully funded up front.</p>
<p>We can't stress enough that every little bit makes a huge difference. If you can donate $10 or $15, you will have made a significant contribution to our ability to go to New York. Its 3 cups of Starbucks coffee... or one lunch from home instead of eating out. To us, it will be a huge difference. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE EXPENSES<br/><br/></strong><strong>Literally, everything we need to make this happen. Just incase you were wondering where all those dollars go! Please note that artist stipends are NOT included. All extra money raised, and any profit from the show will provide artist stipends, for the hundreds of hours of work that have been done. </strong></p>
<p>Materials: $73 - all prop and set materials.</p>
<p>Transportation: $850 - 10 artists: 1 car (gas, tolls, and parking), 8 bus tickets, 10 Metro cards.</p>
<p>Signage: $142 - Posters and Venue ID signs.</p>
<p>Marketing: $310 - Postcards, stickers, and playbills.</p>
<p>Shipping: $45 - because that stuff doesn't mail itself.</p>
<p>Rentals: $2200 - 4 days space rental in NYC. Really, $550/day is a steal! </p>
<p>Insurance: $380 - An absolute must, for everyone's safety</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE BENEFITS</strong></p>
<p><strong>You get to feel so good about yourself. By contributing to this project, you are supporting art, independent activism, and grassroots actions all at once! We also have official donor benefits. You can read about them on the right side of the page, in the Perks section. We also have a complete description of all our donor levels on our website: <a href=""http://nusass.org/?page_id=141"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://nusass.org/?page_id=141</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>We would like it to be known ALL funds raised will go towards the production. If over $4000 is raised, the excess will be used to pay the  artists for their hundreds of hours of work.</strong></p>
<div>
<h2><em><strong> </strong></em></h2>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Don't have money? No Problem! Nu Sass needs help spreading the word - about our campaign and about the show! You can promote our campaign via email, FB, Twitter, LinkedIn and more. You can invite everyone you know to come see the show, too! </p>
<p>We always take physical object donations, which are also tax deductible. And there are plenty of other ways you can help! Perhaps you've got a place we can store the set? Maybe you know a friend somewhere in a theatre who has a cheaper space we can use, or have a connection to someone in the grant giving world? Help is help, and we accept all of it!</p>
<p>PLEASE SHARE THIS FUNDRAISER WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHO LOVES SUPPORTING THOSE CRAZY ARTISTS AND THEIR DREAMS.</p>

Between them there is the closest, most profound and natural bond: nothing screens violence except lies, and the only way lies can hold out is by violence. ...usually it demands nothing of its victims, only allegiance to and complicity in the lie. 
Writers and artists can VANQUISH LIES! In the struggle against lies, art has always won and always will. Conspicuously, incontestably for everyone. Lies can stand up against much in the world, but not against art. 
Once lies have been dispelled, the repulsive nakedness of violence will be exposed - and hollow violence will collapse.""
--Alexander Solzhenitsyn, from his 1970 Nobel Lecture
 
So, please. Help us start a conversation. Participate in art, participate in activism, and participate in the main message of Occupy - that a better world is a better world for everyone.  
 
 
What we need & What you get:

We will ask our audiences to make donations when they come to see the show, but because we can't ensure an average donation, and won't be turning patrons away if they can't pay, we need to ensure the project is fully funded up front.
We can't stress enough that every little bit makes a huge difference. If you can donate $10 or $15, you will have made a significant contribution to our ability to go to New York. Its 3 cups of Starbucks coffee... or one lunch from home instead of eating out. To us, it will be a huge difference. 
 
THE EXPENSESLiterally, everything we need to make this happen. Just incase you were wondering where all those dollars go! Please note that artist stipends are NOT included. All extra money raised, and any profit from the show will provide artist stipends, for the hundreds of hours of work that have been done. 
Materials: $73 - all prop and set materials.
Transportation: $850 - 10 artists: 1 car (gas, tolls, and parking), 8 bus tickets, 10 Metro cards.
Signage: $142 - Posters and Venue ID signs.
Marketing: $310 - Postcards, stickers, and playbills.
Shipping: $45 - because that stuff doesn't mail itself.
Rentals: $2200 - 4 days space rental in NYC. Really, $550/day is a steal! 
Insurance: $380 - An absolute must, for everyone's safety
 
 
THE BENEFITS
You get to feel so good about yourself. By contributing to this project, you are supporting art, independent activism, and grassroots actions all at once! We also have official donor benefits. You can read about them on the right side of the page, in the Perks section. We also have a complete description of all our donor levels on our website: http://nusass.org/?page_id=141
We would like it to be known ALL funds raised will go towards the production. If over $4000 is raised, the excess will be used to pay the  artists for their hundreds of hours of work.

 
Other Ways You Can Help


Don't have money? No Problem! Nu Sass needs help spreading the word - about our campaign and about the show! You can promote our campaign via email, FB, Twitter, LinkedIn and more. You can invite everyone you know to come see the show, too! 
We always take physical object donations, which are also tax deductible. And there are plenty of other ways you can help! Perhaps you've got a place we can store the set? Maybe you know a friend somewhere in a theatre who has a cheaper space we can use, or have a connection to someone in the grant giving world? Help is help, and we accept all of it!
PLEASE SHARE THIS FUNDRAISER WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHO LOVES SUPPORTING THOSE CRAZY ARTISTS AND THEIR DREAMS.",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Rik Deskin, an Actor/Comedian and the Artistic Director of Eclectic Theater Company (ETC). ETC is the Resident Company at Odd Duck Studio, a 49-seat black-box theater located right on the border of First Hill and Capitol Hill in Seattle. As Artistic Director, I've curated 5 years of Classic, Contemporary, Original work for the Stage and Screen in the form of Plays, Improv, Stand-Up &amp; Sketch Comedy as well as Play Readings and Screenplay Readings of new work in development. I want to continue to bring innovative, interesting programming to Seattle audiences and need sustained support for operational costs such as rent, utilities and insurance. This is a year-end fundraising campaign that ends on Thursday, December 30, 2011 and all funds raised toward our $5000 goal will help us continue to be sustainable.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Continuing a sustainable operation provides an affordable theater to itinerant Theatre Artists and Groups that might have a difficult time finding an accessible space for their projects. Some of our programming is free for audience members that might not be able to attend a show due to their own economic situation. If we don't succeed in raising the needed funds to continue, then Seattle might lose a theater venue that has a rich history dating back to 1997,where new, alternative work is created amidst many adaptations of classic and contemporary works. No other venue in Seattle generates the amount of original work year-round that we curate.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $5000 that will go directly to supplementing our rent, electricity and insurance for the first three months of 2012, and enabling us a little cushion as we generate box office and rental revenue from pending projects. For helping us, we have perks that range from show tickets to being able to produce your own show. For every dollar you contribute, you will get value that equals and surpasses your support.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please join me by sharing this campaign with people you know can help. Even if you can't contribute, sharing with others and spreading the word will help!</p>

</h3><p>I have been
blessed with a most exciting opportunity, for health healing and  Happiness, and am asking your help to
make it possible!</p>
<p>An anonymous
angel in my life heard I was dreaming of going to a retreat called Sacred
Circularities, In Bali, and gifted me with a place in the workshop! WOW!
THANKYOU!! </p>
<p>Food, accommodation and transportation while there is all
covered, plus the incredible classes 
in hoop, ecstatic dance, meditation, yoga and flow arts… It is a ten day
healing retreat, full of dance, play, friends and love! My heart, and my body,
really really need this time! </p>
<p>As most of you
know, I have had a hell of a time recently, recovering from a brain tumour,
failed brain surgery, destroyed pituitary, deep vein thrombosis and mysterious
blood loss… It has been a bit much. I need a little escape! Now I have one--All
I need is enough additional funds to get me there!</p>
<p>I figure it
will cost about $2,000—either for a plane ticket from Vancouver to Bali, or for
an extension of my time in Asia following  the work I am doing with Spark Circus in Thailand.
(the volunteer project runs January and February. I was going to come back to
Canada in March, but with enough funds I could possibly just stay on in
Thailand until the retreat. The time to rest and recover from the circus, in
the sunshine, would be fantastic!  </p>
<p>So many of my friends and family have helped me financially
through this difficult time (paying for my meds before I got disability, even
helping with my mortgage! )  I feel
it is inappropriate to ask for more in terms of just $ donations—cause this retreat
, though something I really want, is not a true necessity of life. It is for
fun.  Now, fun is important, so I
am going to try and make it possible for myself—specially since someone magic
has gone so far as getting me at least half way there! THANKYOU!!!  </p>
<p>What I hope to
do, is kind of use this platform as an exchange—and offer perks that are really
worth whatever $ you can offer! </p>
<p>I will be
putting up a variety of items handcrafted by me—hopefully something for
everyone. Jewellery, beadwork, leatherwork, leather masks, some simple fire toys…
hopefully I can create for you something that will be worth your contribution,
so we both come out of the exchange feeling rich and happy, full of creative
abundance!</p>
<p>Sacred Circularities is  important to me,
because one of the things I have been really missing since the  brain tumour diagnoses and subsequent
health nightmare, is TIME to just heal. No other obligations and stresses, time
to just move the energy through me, release, relax and let go. There is no flow
prop as effective as the hoop for doing this. I would really really love the
opportunity to spend this time with these amazing people, and hoop to heal!</p>

Drummers &amp; Dancers  Against Violence  at THEATRE FOR THE NEW CITY
October 17-19 (Friday &amp; Saturday at 8 PM; Sunday at  4PM)<br/>
155 First Avenue in New York City.</b></p>
<p>The
new show is presented in observance of <b>Domestic
Violence Awareness Month in October, </b>and will include real stories
of  women's abuse and their healing, woven into powerful sacred chants,
drumming and healing trance dances in Honor of the Black Madonna.  These
are the true stories of women that have attended my healing workshops over the
years, and have been healed of their trauma through the power of the
tarantella.  This dance is a cure for the feeling of being
""caught in a web that binds"" - a feeling that causes many women,
known in the Italian language as ""tarantate,"" to suffer a malady known
as ""tarantismo"" -a lethal mixture of depression, loneliness and
oppression. </p>
<p><b>ABOUT ME</b></p>
<p>My
name is Alessandra Belloni, I was born in Rome, Italy and live in New York
City.  </p>
<p>I
have devoted  over 30 years to this  very powerful  healing
tradition originally from Southern Italy, using my drumming skills and becoming
“the shaman” as I lead women into a trance with the  fast 6/8  on my
tambourine, bringing the tarantella back to its origins, as music &amp; dance
therapy.  </p>
<p>I
have just completed the <b>filming of a healing
dance session with women from the Combat Domestic Violence office with NYC
Media, at the Cathedral of St John the Divine,</b> to be aired during the
month of  October. </p>
<p>I
have been recognized internationally as singer, dancer and as award-winning
percussionist, (<b>best Percussionist of the
Year by Drum Magazine) REMO artist </b>(design
my signature series tambourines with Remo largest percussion industry in the
world .</p>
<p> I
am  also the director and co-founder of the <b>Italian Folk Music, Dance
&amp; theatre company I GIULLARI DI PIAZZA, artist n Residence at the Cathedral
of St John the Divine in New York City, </b>the largest Gothic Cathedral
in the World.  I have been leading my annual healing retreat RHYTHM IS THE

<p><b>Domestic
Violence is now on the news every day, especially when celebrities are
involved,  but  there are many women around the world and right here
in New York,  of unknown families that suffer from this horrible crimes.</b></p>
<p>This
show fills an important artistic, theatrical, and educational need. It informs
and introduces diverse audiences to the healing and transformative powers of
this trance dance. It entices audiences visually and musically.  I have
gathered a unique ensemble of women schooled in voice, percussion and ritual
dance to honor the female energy found in traditions from Southern Italy,
Brazil, Africa and the Middle East, emulating one of the most ancient ways of
praying and healing.  The strong, talented, beautiful and creative women
take a fiery percussive journey in honor of the feminine principle,  traditionally dressed in white with red lace scarves, singing, drumming, and dancing the wild and transformative tarantella to bring about healing</p>
<p>I have been guided to bring this show to life, even though our
organization is in desperate need of funding. Here are  a few reasons why:</p>
<p>§ <b>STATISTICS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</b></p>
<p>§ Every
9 seconds in the US a woman is assaulted or beaten.</p>
<p>§ Around
the world, at least one in every three women has been beaten, coerced into sex
or otherwise abused during her lifetime. Most often, the abuser is a member of
her own family.</p>
<p>§ Domestic
violence is the leading cause of injury to women—more than car accidents,
muggings, and rapes combined.</p>
<p>§ Studies
suggest that up to 10 million children witness some form of domestic violence
annually. .</p>
<p>§ Everyday
in the US, more than three women are murdered by their husbands or boyfriends.</p>
<p>§ Men
who as children witnessed their parents’ domestic violence were twice as likely
to abuse their own wives than sons of nonviolent parents.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need funds right now to pay for publicity, promotion, flyers,
rehearsal studio rental, artists fees, costumes, sets and for video production
of the show.</p>
<p><b>I need the support of my fans and friends like you to be able to

<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>Throughout
my  work as  healer and teacher  I have met amazing wonderful
women who have suffered a great deal from sexual abuse, domestic violence, and
as result were traumatized, afflicted by depression and suicide mania.  I
am  happy to say that great “miracles” have happened through the powerful
dance of the tarantella and the  drumming 
and that I have helped transform their lives, have beautiful
testimonials as well. I am also working on a film and book about this powerful
stories.</p>
<p>For
the first time I am portraying some of these stories on stage to bring
awareness to a crucial issue in our society in observance  of Domestic
Violence Awareness Month.</p>
<p>in
2009 I created a Women's Ensemble called DAUGHTERS OF CYBELE of voice,
percussion and dance, dedicated to the healing power of drumming. 
 The frame drums and tambourines are ancient ""female
instruments,"" connected with the mother/child heartbeat . In ancient
times,  women priestesses used them in healing and esoteric ceremonies all
over the Mediterranean, honoring the Goddesses Cybele, Isis, Artemis,
Aphrodite, Hecate, and Inanna.  I have kept this tradition a live
through tireless field research, education in these rituals, and belief in
their effectivenes.</p>

<p>Sean has created a rip-roaring, 80s music infused, adaptation of Shakespeare's <b><i>Twelfth Night</i></b>  (with elements of other plays as well) in which four actors play all 13 roles. It's a delightfully funny and inventive show that's perfect for the holiday season. By supporting this campaign, you'll help us give <i><b>Twelve Nights</b> </i>the New York Premiere it deserves.</p>

<p>Pull Together Productions is able to cover some of its expenses through ticket sales and grants but not all of them. We've set a fundraising goal of $2000 and we're asking for your support to help us achieve that goal.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges that smaller theater companies producing in New York face is paying for space.

<h3>Why This Play?</h3>Pull Together's mission is to create shows that embrace high theatricality and celebrate the inherent artifice of the medium. In <b><i>Twelve Nights</i></b>, four actors take on thirteen roles, instantly transforming from one character to another with just a change of their voice and body language. With this production we look forward to infusing a sense of play within 'the play' and encouraging our audiences to engage their imaginations to co-create the theatrical event. Your support can help us make this happen.</div><div>

Rhythm is our Business. And we are the American Tap Dance Foundation, a non-profit 501c3 Tap Dance Organization located in the West Village, New York City. 
 
For 25 years we’ve been:
- creating new venues and original productions!
- presenting unique artists and contemporary choreography!
- educating the next generation and building new audience!
- preserving the American history of tap dance!
  
In January of 2010, we moved into our new home at the American Tap Dance Center. Our training programs promote the joyful embodiment of rhythm and build critical life skills through active cooperation, creative problem solving, patience, confidence, discipline and attuned listening. 
 
BUT, we need a new LIGHTING SYSTEM to function properly. We have lights, but they are old, broken down and very harsh. We have around 500 people coming each week for daily tap classes. 190 of these students are kids. They deserve to see and be seen!
The Impact

Our philosophy is that Tap Dance is MUSIC and a UNIVERSAL form of expression; plus it’s FUN, HEALTHY and ACCESSIBLE to everyone!
 
Supporting our programs, and helping us raise enough funds for a new lighting system will give ALL of us (our teachers, our students, and our staff) a brighter future. 

Join us in CELEBRATING 25 YEARS of bringing Tap Dance into the world by donating $25!

<p><b>Message du metteur en scène Jacqueline van de Geer</b></p>
<p>5 femmes, venant de différentes origines, toutes amies depus des années, toutes heureuses sur la surface avec du comfort et du succès.  Mais quand l'une d'elle souffre du cancer, la réalité les force de laisser tomber leur façade, l'une après l'autre.  Quand j'ai lu cette pièce, je me suis sentie liée à l'histoire, l'amitié entre ces femmes, leurs jalousies, leurs petites compétitions et l'humour, surtout le thème qu'une maladie détruit les superficies entre elles.  De plus, je suis ravie de travailler avec une distribution multiethnique et féminine, une chance rare car, en général, la plupart des scénarios prêtent plus d'importance aux rôles masculins.  J'espère que L'entente sera disponible au publique francophone bientôt car ""la langue des thèmes"" de cette pièce est universelle!</p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;""><em>Another Evening of Awkward Romance</em> has been accepted into the New York International Fringe Festival!</span></strong></p>
<p>Wendy Herlich is back, with a whole new collection of awkwardly romantic characters and situations. The second in a series, <em>Another Evening of Awkward Romance</em> features six laugh-out-loud vignettes, including a chronic sinus infection sufferer who is infatuated with her pharmacist, a pair of lovelorn auctioneers, and dueling church choir members. This two-person comedy offers an unvarnished take on the search for love, and celebrates human beings at our most odd, endearing, and vulnerable.</p>
<p><em>Another Evening of Awkward Romance</em> is the follow-up to <em>An Evening of Awkward Romance</em>, which ran at the Tank in NYC in February of 2012. Theatre Is Easy said, ""...Fast-paced, hilarious, playful, and often-poignant writing...It's a successful mix: clever, evocative, and tender."" The Happiest Medium said, ""Ms. Herlich proves that she is not only a gifted writer with the ability to create short sketches which manage to be sweet, funny and (yes) awkward all at once, but she is also a deft comedic actress who can play any number of roles, ranging from whimsical to deadpan, with equal results: an audience that finds itself erupting in laughter as one scene after the next plays out.""</p>
<p>We are so excited about this opportunity. FringeNYC is the largest multi-arts festival in North America, and provides great exposure for the project. Our broader goal includes exploring future possibilities for this production, and FringeNYC is a great step in that direction.</p>
<p>Ruthie Levy is back on board as our director, and Aaron Phillips has joined Wendy Herlich to make up the cast.</p>

<p>As the tenth anniversary of September 11th approaches, Apple Core Theater Company will produce <strong style=""font-style: italic;"">By the Dawn's Early Light, </strong>two new one-acts by Mel Nieves illustrating the impact of that fateful day on three Latino families in New York City. Directed by Walter J. Hoffman, performances will begin on August 11th at the Studio Theatre on <b>Theatre Row</b>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In <strong><em>Los Embrujados,</em></strong> a nervous waiter at the Windows on the World restaurant studies with his gregarious brother for his impending U.S. Citizenship test. It's a time of possibilities on this bright, clear September morning, and as he prepares for his new life, ""Los Embrujados"" illuminates what it means to be an American.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our second play, <em><strong>Midnight Mass</strong></em>, follows a group of New Yorkers connected by 9/11: a war veteran whose trauma may cost him his family; his brother, who must leave his pregnant fiancee to go on his first tour of duty; a nurse whose husband perished in the Towers; and a fireman desperate to reclaim the courage he knew as a First Responder. In the wake of tragedy, <em>Midnight Mass</em> reveals the profound struggle to regain hope and faith. </p>
<h3>THE DEAL</h3>
<p>We are so, <strong>SO</strong> thankful for the generous friends we've met over the past year who have made the first phase of development for this project possible. But <strong>as a Tennessee Williams character might say</strong>, we must not only depend upon the kindness of our friends, but upon EVERYONE. That guy we always see on the train to work, the exceedingly cool couple we met at a buddy's party in Brooklyn, and grade school teachers whose first names we never knew. <strong>And</strong> <strong>you</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>With two months before the show to go, we hope to raise $2,000. And we hope you'll help us with a completely tax-deductible donation.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And what's more, your campaign will not <strong>only</strong> help us put on this beautiful show:</p>
<blockquote dir=""ltr"" style=""margin-right: 0px;"">
<p>** Just as we fundraised over $1,500 for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS during our recent production of <em>As Is</em>, we will <strong>""pass the hat""</strong> after every show to <strong>raise money for organizations that serve First Responders and the families of 9/11 victims.</strong></p>
<p>** As <strong>affordability and accessibility</strong> are primary components of our mission, your support will also help keep our ticket price at a remarkable <strong>$15.</strong> You can't beat that in NYC.</p>
<p>** And of course, you'll make a lot of working theater artists who are passionate about the project very, very happy.</p>

<div>'What can I do?' This was the question that moved me to write poetry for Africa as a child and day dream of solutions to end famine. Later, in high school, it would lead me to join forces with my best friend Kim Morgan and make a presentation in one of our classes on Apartheid. We showed the video of the song Sun City by Artists United Against Apartheid (<a href=""http://youtu.be/TlMdYpnVOGQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://youtu.be/TlMdYpnVOGQ</a>). I realized that art is such a powerful way to raise awareness. <p></p>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: collapse;"">When the song 'We Are the World' came out, I believed every word. When I look back on it art and activism and Africa have always been connected for me. It was the beginning of vague notions that art could change the world. I have never stopped asking 'What can I do?' With time, arts and activism in Africa would be my answer. </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: collapse;""><p><br/></p>
<h4><b>Why Focus on Violence Against Girls and Women?</b></h4></span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: collapse;""><p>When my brother died in 2001, I decided that life was too short to not realize my dream of going to Africa.  Unable to afford most exchange programs, I contacted foundations funding in Africa and identified reputable grassroots organizations. I contacted the organizations directly and set up my own work exchange program.</p>
<p>On my 30th birthday, I threw a fundraising party complete with soul food and a DJ and  invited everyone I knew. I bought my airline ticket and left for six months. I lived with total strangers in six different countries (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Tanzania, Zanzibar and Kenya) and visited advocacy focused organizations. Mind blowing -to say the least- I realized that this is what I wanted to do with my life. </p>
<p>One of the organizations that I lived with was Girl Child Network (GCN) in Zimbabwe.  Eight years later, GCN Founder Betty Makoni would win the CNN ordinary heros award for providing a safe haven for girl survivors of sexual abuse. </p>
<p><b><i>One woman can make extraordinary change in this world! </i></b></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was raped in South Africa the night before I left Africa. This launched a 12 year healing journey for me that centered on expressive arts and faith. I would like to share my experience, strength and hope of overcoming violence, poverty and gender based discrimination with African girls. </p></span><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><b style=""font-weight: bold;""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-weight: normal;"">African girls often face a large social narrative that their hopes and dreams do not matter.

<p>My first position working for Africa was in 2002 when I was Africa Program Director at International Development Exchange.

first thought they could not perform the dance, because it looked so
complicated, but due to the determination of [Kisha] the girls made it. Through
the flashmob, we have come to know that one needs to care for herself before
others can care for her. WISER girls need to be proud of themselves and tell

<h3>Girl Power like Never Before!!</h3>
<p>Innovative, moving, powerful and sustainable, the tour will culminate into organizing girls into a network called Girls Idea Generation which will support poor girls translating ideas into income generation. My intention is to follow the hopes, dreams and inspirations of the girls and created what is in the highest good for the girls. In the long term,  I plan to create a non -government organization: Girl Child Nation and institutionalize the learning from Flashmobs Against Rape. The focus of Girl Child Nation will be leadership development of girls. By 2017, Girl Child Nation will create a leadership development institution based in Africa for girls. The main goal of the institute will be to capacity build girls to use expressive arts as a tool for positive change at the grassroots throughout Africa. </p>
<p><b>Goals of Flashmobs Against Rape Tour:</b></p>
<p><i><b>1,000 Girls in their Power: </b></i>To reach 1,000 girls through the storytelling workshops and produce four flashmobs. </p>
<p><b><i>Girl Child Survival Guide: </i></b>As part of the storytelling workshops, I will be asking girls to give advice on how to survive as a girl in Africa. The art, poetry, essays and wisdom will be compiled into a book that will used as a peer to peer support guide offered to girl focused organizations globally. </p>
<p><b style=""font-style: italic;"">Girl Tech Africa: Using Technology to End Poverty and Sexual Violation      </b>Ending inter-generational poverty is often linked with ending cycles of violence. I will sit in circles with girls as part of a listening campaign where I will ask girls: what are her dreams? What is in the way? How can we-as a global community- help you get there? Built from her hopes, dreams and her vision for herself, I will create an online platform to help make her dreams come true. Whether her dream is to access education or gain start up capital for entrepreneurship initiatives or network with professional women in her chosen field, Girl Tech Africa will lead social change for girls by following her wisdom. Girl Tech Africa bridges girls, technology and development on terms that support girl child leadership development.</p>
<p><i><b>Boy Child Alliance: </b></i>Understanding that the empowerment of girls is interconnected with the empowerment of boys, I will create intentional forums to listen to boys, their issues, their challenges and their inheritance as boys. A core motivating question for me will be, 'What would it look like for a boy be fully in his power without violence against females?' I am planning on having workshops for boys that will use drama, dance and expressive arts to create dialogue on cultural and social narratives of manhood. This listening campaign will be the basis of creating a future network of boys called Boy Child Alliance that will focus on economic development of poor boys and developing a curriculum that can be implemented in schools to help boys to be allies to girls.</p>
<p><i><b>Wisdom Circles: </b>E</i>xternal answers to grassroots economic development are not sustainable. I will be facilitating meetings with African women entrepreneurs and women in business to tap into their internal wisdom as to solutions on gender equity and economic self-sufficiency of girls and women as part of a larger vision of a women mentoring program for girls. </p>

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>No Development without Addressing Trauma: </b>Most traditional models of international development overlook the one thing that can undermine most efforts at empowerment of girls and women: trauma. Without addressing healing of trauma, efforts at educating and funding gender equity are not sustainable and are often undermined as girls and women attempt to cope with the fall out of sexual abuse, violence, loss, poverty and discrimination. </li>
<li>
<b>Internal Healing, External Change: </b>Flashmobs Against Rape bridges healing and social change activism and literally puts creativity back into her hands. Once she understands she has the power to create, she can create her future and her reality in the face of gender based oppression.<b>  </b>Through helping girls and women tap into their inner power and faith, I will support girls and women to live whole, healed lives as a means to ending inter-generational poverty and trauma.</li>
<li>
<b>We Need African Boys and Men to Survive: </b>Working within a framework of healing trauma, Flashmobs Against Rape recognizes that poor boys are often also survivors of trauma. Far from criminalizing men, Flashmobs Against Rape works with boys to create a whole new possibility: one where boys and girls need each other to live whole and healed lives, share power and where they value the safety and well being of all. We will need the whole community to end sexual violence against girls and women.<b> </b>

Summary: I am
raising $10,000 to go on tour for 6 months through East and Southern Africa beginning in January 2014. My
goal is to use dance as a platform to support leadership development of girls
and boys to end violence against girls and women.
Why Africa? My commitment to Africa began as a child. When those terrible Sally Struthers commercials would come on, I would bust into tears upon seeing the starving children with flies all over them. I would beg my mother to call the phone number on the screen. I would cry, 'We have to do something mom!' My mom would call and we would get the materials. We didn't have much, but we shared what we had. 

'What can I do?' This was the question that moved me to write poetry for Africa as a child and day dream of solutions to end famine. Later, in high school, it would lead me to join forces with my best friend Kim Morgan and make a presentation in one of our classes on Apartheid. We showed the video of the song Sun City by Artists United Against Apartheid (http://youtu.be/TlMdYpnVOGQ). I realized that art is such a powerful way to raise awareness. 
When the song 'We Are the World' came out, I believed every word. When I look back on it art and activism and Africa have always been connected for me. It was the beginning of vague notions that art could change the world. I have never stopped asking 'What can I do?' With time, arts and activism in Africa would be my answer. 
Why Focus on Violence Against Girls and Women?When my brother died in 2001, I decided that life was too short to not realize my dream of going to Africa.  Unable to afford most exchange programs, I contacted foundations funding in Africa and identified reputable grassroots organizations. I contacted the organizations directly and set up my own work exchange program.
On my 30th birthday, I threw a fundraising party complete with soul food and a DJ and  invited everyone I knew. I bought my airline ticket and left for six months. I lived with total strangers in six different countries (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Tanzania, Zanzibar and Kenya) and visited advocacy focused organizations. Mind blowing -to say the least- I realized that this is what I wanted to do with my life. 
One of the organizations that I lived with was Girl Child Network (GCN) in Zimbabwe.  Eight years later, GCN Founder Betty Makoni would win the CNN ordinary heros award for providing a safe haven for girl survivors of sexual abuse. 
One woman can make extraordinary change in this world! 
Unfortunately, I was raped in South Africa the night before I left Africa. This launched a 12 year healing journey for me that centered on expressive arts and faith. I would like to share my experience, strength and hope of overcoming violence, poverty and gender based discrimination with African girls. African girls often face a large social narrative that their hopes and dreams do not matter. The obstacles are large and significant: 



discrimination based on gender 


lack of access to education 


harmful cultural practices such as early marriage and


poverty



The perils of poverty often force girls to make horrific choices: food or sex? Sanitary pads or education? Basic needs or domestic work where they often face abuses of power including sexual exploitation and rape. 
Violence against girls and women is an issue that hurts us all. We need girls to survive. We need boys to understand their power to create instead of destroy. We are being called to healing, so we can survive, live and maybe even thrive as a human race. 

Violence Against Girls and Women on the Rise in Africa
My first position working for Africa was in 2002 when I was Africa Program Director at International Development Exchange. During a site visit to Zimbabwe, I was asked to give a speech to more than 100 girls. I wrote a speech called, 'What do you hold onto in difficult times?' Here is an excerpt: 



You have gone through too much
You have come to far to stop now
You survived for a reason 
You are a warrior
Your eyes were not made for crying only
You were not born to suffer
Did you see the moon? Did you see the flowers?
Did you look in the mirror? How beautiful! 
Put your hand on your heart -You are still here- and that is everything
Hold on to your dreams
Hold onto hope
Hold on to each other
We can walk through together 

Ending Rape:We Can Walk Through Together 
I have been to East and Southern Africa on five different occasions:


2001: Tour at advocacy focused organizations
2002 and 2003: Africa Program Director (focus: economic development) 
2006: Consultant for foundations (focus: grassroots giving)
2011: Country Director (focus: education of girls) 



However, my passion for being a critical link to creating a better and safer world for girls and women in Africa, never left me and I tracked rape and sexual violation cases in Africa. 
Over the years, I have noticed a disturbing trend of sexual violence in Africa. 
I was in South Africa when a nine-month old baby girl was raped by six men in 2001: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/1362134/South-African-men-rape-babies-as-cure-for-Aids.html).
At the same time, I have also begun to read more and more about the rape of boys:  http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Brave-boy-walks-home-with-baby-after-rapes-20130807).
When I was working and living in Kenya from 2011 to 2013, everyday I read articles in the national newspaper that reported sexual violence against girls. One article featured local hospitals warning that sexual violence against children was on the rise. 
Here is an example of article about the gang rape of a 16 year old girl in Kenya: 
http://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/DN2/When-rapists-go-scot-free/-/957860/2022572/-/skd9s8z/-/index.html
South Africa has been dubbed the rape capital of the world with a South African woman more likely to be raped than educated: http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/a424c0804af19b5e9583fd7db529e2d0/SouthAfrica,-worlds-rape-capital:-Interpol-20121904
In Zimbabwe, rape of girls is on the rise: 
http://allafrica.com/stories/201309020810.html
Historically, sexual violence has been used as a weapon of war with Rwanda being no exception: http://www.nation.co.ke/oped/Opinion/-/440808/1999494/-/iw6nvbz/-/index.htmlJoin Me In Being Part of the Solution 
With your support, I would like to be a part of the solution that ends sexual violence from the ground up and inside-out. Flashmobs Against Rape will use dance as a platform to capacity building girls and boys to be leaders in their communities to end sexual violence in their lifetime. The Flashmobs Against Rape tour will take place in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Rwanda and Kenya. 

Flashmobs Against Rape: The Power of Organizing Girls Through Dance

Why Flashmobs? Dance is a powerful way to support leadership development of girls.  In a culture of silence and invisibility, dance is a powerful way for a girl to stand up and say, ""I am here!' 
Flashmobs Against Rape affirms the human rights of a girl child and the power of boys to be allies to girls. Flashmobs Against Rape affirms the right of a girl to express herself, to been seen and heard and to be safe and powerful in this world. 
In 2011, I ran a school for 90 girls in rural Kenya. I decided to organize the girls into a flashmob for International Women's Day. After 75 hours of rehearsal with no mirrors, too many boxes of biscuits (cookies) to count and more than 15 hours of editing, this is the result: http://youtu.be/BlDD-7aP068
Comments from the girls: 



The flashmob was very nice indeed. I came to realize that
one can make it no matter how difficult a situation can appear. The girls at
first thought they could not perform the dance, because it looked so
complicated, but due to the determination of [Kisha] the girls made it. Through
the flashmob, we have come to know that one needs to care for herself before
others can care for her. WISER girls need to be proud of themselves and tell
people that they can make it.


 

What I realized is that there is no activity for boys and
girls. What boys can do girls can also do. Flashmob is another way of controlling
stress as it is a form of doing exercise.


 

I liked the flashmob due to the fact that it gave us a
chance as girls to express our feelings to the community. I would like to thank
[Kisha] for coming up with such a wonderful and powerful activity.


 

The flashmob helped me to develop confidence in myself. It
enabled me [to] gain courage of acting in front of a crowd which I have never
done before.  The song was
interesting as it gave out the reality of what we as Muhuru girls go through. I
really love the flashmob. 


How Does it Work? 
Flashmobs Against Rape is a tour that will span across 4 different countries in Africa and will set the groundwork for the creation of a model that can be replicated across the African continent and world!
Flashmobs Against Rape uses dance as a platform to bring together girls and boys to address the underlying and root causes of sexual violence against girls. Often root causes of sexual violence are linked to issues of power, cultural narratives around gender roles and place of children (purpose/value), health (i.e. popular misnomers such as sex with a virgin cures HIV/AIDS and children left vulnerable after loss of caregivers/parents death due to AIDS), trauma and poverty. 
Step 1: Identification of Girls: Girls will be identified through networks that I am currently engaged in, community based organizations and schools that I visit as part of the tour. 
Step 2: Flashmob Practices: Girls will be shown examples of flashmobs and will choose the music and any signs they want to create as part of their creative protest. Dance practices will be timed such that the mob is performed, taped and uploaded on Youtube in time for large international days (i.e. International Women's Day/Earth Day/International Day of the African Child) in order to support girls in linking their individual stories with global citizenship.
Step 3: Helping Girls Find Power In Their Stories Storytelling Workshops: Free workshops will be given to girls (and separate workshops for boys) as an extension of rehearsals for the Flashmob. Using Theatre of the Oppressed (drama based games that focus on power), writing, visual arts and music, girls and boys will be given the opportunity to explore who they are and how they choose to use their power in the face of larger social and cultural narratives that support sexual violence. 
Her Birth Right: 
To Be Safe and Powerful In this World
Her Place Her Power Her Possibility Her Story 
Flashmobs Against Rape is all about helping girls to love themselves. 
The tour will have the following outcomes: 
Leadership Development of Girls: Flashmobs Against Rape help girls to link their individual struggles -as girls- with a larger platform of human rights for women globally. Flashmobs Against Rape supports girls in harnessing their power to make powerful choices for themselves and make change in their community. 
Break Isolation and Shame: Gender based discrimination and sexual violence often leaves girls feeling powerless in their own lives. Stigma is a powerful force that keeps girls quiet, living in secret that undermines them. The storytelling workshops provide girls with a safe platform to ask questions, speak up and out and break isolation and shame. I plan to help her to harness their power in the face of old past time narratives that limit her place, her power and her possibility. Flashmobs Against Rape is a way for her to write a new story: her story! 
Healing:  Many girls that I have interviewed over the years suffer from such profound loss, the pain of discrimination and rejection and the emotional toll of poverty. The arts can be a powerful tool for healing and transformation of larger social narratives that get in her way of realizing her full potential. Through expressive arts, we support girls to tap into their inner power and creativity to be change agents to end sexual violence and poverty in their lifetime. 
Public Education: The flashmobs give girls what they don't have in their communities: a public platform for her to express herself, tell the truth of their experience (and be believed) and send a message that violation of girls and women is not okay. 
Create Community: Often girls get lost in their individual story, not realizing that their stories are inter-connected with other girls as they are individually confronting a larger story that you do not count or matter. When they can come together, they find support, strength and similarity of experience through something as simple and profound as dance.  
Flip the Script: Dancing with other girls can give her the power to take a stand that she may not otherwise take on her own, while writing a new script of her value, her vision and her place on the planet. Flashmobs Against Rape helps girls make their dreams come true. 







Funky, Fresh and Fierce!


Girl Power like Never Before!!
Innovative, moving, powerful and sustainable, the tour will culminate into organizing girls into a network called Girls Idea Generation which will support poor girls translating ideas into income generation. My intention is to follow the hopes, dreams and inspirations of the girls and created what is in the highest good for the girls. In the long term,  I plan to create a non -government organization: Girl Child Nation and institutionalize the learning from Flashmobs Against Rape. The focus of Girl Child Nation will be leadership development of girls. By 2017, Girl Child Nation will create a leadership development institution based in Africa for girls. The main goal of the institute will be to capacity build girls to use expressive arts as a tool for positive change at the grassroots throughout Africa. 
Goals of Flashmobs Against Rape Tour:
1,000 Girls in their Power: To reach 1,000 girls through the storytelling workshops and produce four flashmobs. 
Girl Child Survival Guide: As part of the storytelling workshops, I will be asking girls to give advice on how to survive as a girl in Africa. The art, poetry, essays and wisdom will be compiled into a book that will used as a peer to peer support guide offered to girl focused organizations globally. 
Girl Tech Africa: Using Technology to End Poverty and Sexual Violation      Ending inter-generational poverty is often linked with ending cycles of violence. I will sit in circles with girls as part of a listening campaign where I will ask girls: what are her dreams? What is in the way? How can we-as a global community- help you get there? Built from her hopes, dreams and her vision for herself, I will create an online platform to help make her dreams come true. Whether her dream is to access education or gain start up capital for entrepreneurship initiatives or network with professional women in her chosen field, Girl Tech Africa will lead social change for girls by following her wisdom. Girl Tech Africa bridges girls, technology and development on terms that support girl child leadership development.
Boy Child Alliance: Understanding that the empowerment of girls is interconnected with the empowerment of boys, I will create intentional forums to listen to boys, their issues, their challenges and their inheritance as boys. A core motivating question for me will be, 'What would it look like for a boy be fully in his power without violence against females?' I am planning on having workshops for boys that will use drama, dance and expressive arts to create dialogue on cultural and social narratives of manhood. This listening campaign will be the basis of creating a future network of boys called Boy Child Alliance that will focus on economic development of poor boys and developing a curriculum that can be implemented in schools to help boys to be allies to girls.
Wisdom Circles: External answers to grassroots economic development are not sustainable. I will be facilitating meetings with African women entrepreneurs and women in business to tap into their internal wisdom as to solutions on gender equity and economic self-sufficiency of girls and women as part of a larger vision of a women mentoring program for girls. 
Through supporting Flashmobs Against Rape you will be part of creating a new and innovative model of leadership development of African girls and boys!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Romantasy Cabaret is a naughty lil vaudeville cabaret based in Phoenix Arizona and was established in 2007. The cast and crew have been performing in the Greater Phoenix Area since June 2007's debut show and now seek the opportunity to make a professional demo video of their performances to share their talents with a broader audience base. Romantasy Cabaret wishes to gain greater exposure and hopes to begin traveling with their show in 2012. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The core crew of Romantasy Cabaret consists of several hard working people who do everything to help put on shows from selling tickets, creating seating charts, setting up fund-raising shows, hosting raffles to raise money, greeting and seating our guests, mingling with our fans for photo opps, arriving early on show days to set up the venue as well as the stage set, staying well after the 3-hour show to tear down and pack away all of our gear, to creating their own costumes, editing their own music, attending photo shoots that they pay out of pocket for, honing their craft with endless hours choreographing and practicing their dances, routines, and crafts, attending rehearsals, making their props, and many of these invaluable people hold regular jobs and have families at home to take care of too. <br/></p>
<p>Having a professional video will aid this crew of artistic people in chances to promote their show to entities looking to hire a professional cabaret. Being paid for their time and talent will keep the cabaret alive and will, after 4 years (5 full seasons), earn the performers and crew, the financial rewards they so richly deserve. <br/></p>
<p>If the cast and crew do not benefit from financial assistance, they will not be able to afford funding a video, thus will likely not be seen by talent and booking agencies, and may remain a small-time, city-bound cabaret. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So far, the director, writer, producer and primary emcee for Romantasy Cabaret has offered $500 towards the video project. Another private donor has offered $150 and most of the cast and crew has offered to donate amounts varying from $20-$100 each. <br/></p>
<p>The funds we raise will go towards rental of a professional recording space, a professional videographer and editor, a lighting tech, a sound tech, an aerial apparatus to rig up our aerial artist, performers insurance, and food and hydration beverages for the day(s) of the shoot. <br/></p>
<p>$6000 will cover these costs and should any funding be left over after the video project is complete, the funds will be deposited directly into a fund for sole use of Romantasy Cabaret.</p>The cabaret has been self-sustaining since 2007 with time donated by all involved and often times expenses paid out of the managing partners' pockets. The cast pays for their own lessons and classes, costuming, props, supplies and we all do our own hair and makeup for the shows. We have survived on the thinnest of shoestring budgets but some of the old-timers with the cabaret since inception, could use a boost. <br/>A professional video will aid us in getting that boost. <br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cant thunk down a few bones to help us out, you can at the very least help by spreading the word of our campaign. Contributors who toss in $50 will earn a pair of seats at our video shoot. Contributors who donate $100 or more will receive a pair of seats to an upcoming cabaret so you can see your money at work. Contributors of $500 will earn a pair of seats for the August 27 and October 22 shows as well as a pair of seats at the video shoot. Any amount from $10 on up is HUGELY appreciated. $10 buys a case or two of water so yeah, ever bit helps. <br/></p>
<p>If you know of anyone interested in donating or becoming a sponsor for Romantasy Cabaret, please pass this along! <br/></p>

We have survived on the thinnest of shoestring budgets but some of the old-timers with the cabaret since inception, could use a boost. A professional video will aid us in getting that boost. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Even if you cant thunk down a few bones to help us out, you can at the very least help by spreading the word of our campaign. Contributors who toss in $50 will earn a pair of seats at our video shoot. Contributors who donate $100 or more will receive a pair of seats to an upcoming cabaret so you can see your money at work. Contributors of $500 will earn a pair of seats for the August 27 and October 22 shows as well as a pair of seats at the video shoot. Any amount from $10 on up is HUGELY appreciated. $10 buys a case or two of water so yeah, ever bit helps. 
If you know of anyone interested in donating or becoming a sponsor for Romantasy Cabaret, please pass this along!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><a href=""http://thebridgetheatrecompany1.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Bridge Theatre Company</a> is the only organization in New York City that produces exclusively Canadian work. Since 2004, we've exposed New York audiences to 17 plays by 15 Canadian playwrights. </p>
<p>Why?</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Canada deserves cultural representatives in the cultural capital of the world.</li>
<li>Because New York audiences deserve to see the best that Canadian theatre has to offer.</li>
<li>Because Molson Canadian gives us a lot of free beer. </li>
</ul><div>This year the Bridge is proud to present Matthew MacKenzie's <strong><em>The Particulars</em></strong> at the <a href=""http://fringenyc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New York International Fringe Festival</a> (FringeNYC). This project represents the fruits of our labor as well as any since our founding and is the reason for this campaign.</div>
<h3>The Production</h3>
<p><em><strong>The Particulars</strong></em> meditates on the biggest and smallest issues of our time. Our storytellers are Lillian, a youth minister recently returned from a journey to the central African jungle, and Gordon, a member of Lillian's congregation desperate to navigate societal norms after a tragic loss. Both long for answers amongst the daily distractions that permeate their lives. </p>
<div>Since graduating from the National Theatre School in Montreal in 2010, <strong>Matthew MacKenzie</strong> has quickly established himself as one of Canada's best and brightest. His play <strong><em>SIA</em></strong>, won the 2010 Alberta Playwriting Competition and was part of our seventh season. <em>SIA</em> was subsequently picked up by <a href=""http://tactnyc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Actors Company Theatre</a> (TACT) as part of their inaugural newTACTics Festival. Matthew went on to win the prestigious Urjo Kareda Residency Grant in August of 2011.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<em>The Particulars</em> will be directed by <strong>Jordana Williams</strong>, who comes to us with two FringeNYC Outstanding Production awards already in her pocket (for <em>Viral</em> in 2009 and <em>Hail Satan</em> in 2007). <a href=""http://ashlieatkinson.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Ashlie Atkinson</strong></a> (Neil Labute’s <em>Fat Pig</em>, Broadway’s <em>The Ritz</em>) and <strong>Brian Silliman</strong> (<em>Advance Man</em>, <em>Control Room</em>) star as Lillian and Gordon.</div>
<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>While FringeNYC remains the most cost-effective way to expose Canadian playwrights to commercial and critical attention in New York City, doing it right requires considerable support. This is our third consecutive go at Fringe producing. We've seen what works and what doesn't. The $5,230 we need to raise encompasses all aspects of the production. Our artists are paid (though not nearly what they're worth). Our marketing budget allows for advertising in new and old media. Our programs, our press photos, and our show art are all done by professionals. Our budget isn't about ""pulling it off"", it's about putting on the show our playwright deserves.</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>Supporting this campaign is about more than getting tickets to a performance, drinks at a hip bar in Greenpoint, or limited edition prints from an award-winning illustrator -- though we're thrilled to be able to provide those too. It's about investing in the journey and committing to the cause that will continue through the Fringe and well beyond <em>The Particulars</em>. It's about inspiring like-minded Canadians on both sides of the border to bring their work to places like New York (with or without our help - believe us, we'd love some competition). It's about continuing that 3000ish year tradition linking cultural and economic exchange. </p>
<div>And, of course, it's about free beer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We humbly ask that you climb aboard. Money would be great, but sharing this page and spreading the word will do just fine.</div>

<h3>So who are you anyway?</h3>
<p>We're Six Lips Theatre - that's Hannah, Anna and Roxanna. We're a York based theatre company, formed in 2010,</p>
<p>We aim to produce theatre that is engaging and magical, while celebrating the real. We love storytelling, and like to create shows that are not just textually rich but also a visual treat.</p>
<p>We open up our projects for collaborations with other emerging and established artists, hoping to provide a platform for everyone's fledgling ideas.</p>
<h3><strong><br/>What are you fundraising for?<br/></strong></h3>
<p>We've been working away on many shows around Yorkshire, but now we're ready to go futher and do more. Our goal for the year is to take Six Lips to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. To be blunt, this costs money - a lot of money. Venue hire, transport, accommodation, print and marketing, and all the boring additional things that you don't think of but are totally necessary. We need your help - we can't do this without you!</p>
<h3>What's the show?</h3>
<p>Faustus. Now wait, you might think you know this show, but hang on a minute and think again.</p>
<p>In the bowels of the industrial revolution, change is brewing. A particular kind of hunger is bubbling inside one of the world’s most powerful minds, and when an offer is made that promises to satisfy that hunger, he makes a choice. A bargain. With the devil. You see, even the best and wisest amongst us do things we later regret…</p>
<p>Under the bleak skyline, a company assembles to pass judgement on the greatest of a generation.</p>
<p>Actor musicians, live music. Heartfelt and gritty. It's everything you know turned on its head and pushed to the extreme in this new, modern language, version of a timeless story.</p>
<h3><strong>OK, so what's in it for me?<br/></strong></h3>
<p>Apart from the knowledge that you're obviously an all-round good sort of person? Well, we have all sorts of fabulous exciting perks. If you're here on Indiegogo, you're probably just like us, in the fact you're probably a struggling/starving arts-sort. So we've kept all the wonderful perks at an accessible rate. Remember that if you donate at one level of support, you still get all the perks from the levels beforehand! How awesome is that? <strong><br/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Is there anything else I can do?</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>Absolutely! If you're able to give us some pennies, then thank you so much! If you can't, then hey, we understand that too. But there's plenty that you can do, and some of it won't cost you a single penny</p>

<h3>Our Festival:</h3>
<p><em>PLANS</em> is a contemporary play festival produced by Dave Fertik and Stage Left Theatre Company, in association with producer Steve Wei. Our company got started in East Brunswick, New Jersey, as an entirely student-run theatre company, under the firm belief that studying our craft wasn't enough: to really learn anything, we had to put up shows. We had to own our work. When our studies took us to Philadelphia, we brought the work with us. These shows are going up one way or another, but as dirt-poor students, it's a strain to do it without help. Your greatest donation would be coming to see our shows (<span><span class=""fsl""><span class=""text_exposed_show""><a href=""http://plansfestival.brownpapertickets.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>http://</span><span>plansfestival.brownpapertic</span>kets.com/</a></span></span></span>), but if you can't come see us, or want to give more, your contributions here will mean we can get a decent lunch on our breaks--or better yet, we can put up more down the line.<em><br/></em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Deal:</h3>
<p>A show costs thousands of dollars to do right. Hundreds go to performance insurance, renting our space, creating and buying costumes, sets, and props, and overall making the world of the play. We don't just have one play, we have <em>three</em>. The sum of $2000 will only cover half of our budget for all of those things, but ticket sales will cover the rest. As we said, the biggest contribution would be for you to show up. If we sold every seat,  we'd still break even. But your contributions here will give us an extra element of security, and let us get some cooler props, give our set that extra finish, or get really magical with our costumes and makeup.</p>
We want to show our community that student work is not just viable as art, but is financially maintainable. Your assistance will help us prove both at once! Our continued work aims to give the rising generation of theatrical artists a voice, and every single dollar helps!</div>

I've set a highly optimistic monetary goal which would ensure I could get the most out of my experience, e.g. I might also be able to attend shows by other performers as valuable research. I will also need appropriate clothing, stationery, sheet music etc. This money would allow me to achieve my dream of running my own business as a performer. No donation is too small and shares on Facebook etc. would be greatly appreciated. If you can't give, maybe someone else on your friend list can. Every pound takes me one step closer and I'll be thankful from the bottom of my heart. (This mob will take 9% of what I achieve, so let's push for the target :-)Watch me in action at http://youtu.be/ZNsMYrL2G3U",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We have a preview of our new work at Dixon Place May 31st at 7:30.
 
We've invited several producers to see the work in the hopes that they'll produce the show next year.
 
In the mean time, we've been paying for the rehearsal space, insurance, costumes etc...
 
I'm raising money to help pay myself back.
 
We were given the opportunity to perform on the 31st before we had the chance to do a proper fundraiser.
 
Here's the breakdown:
$175 for insurance (required by Actor's Equity)
$250 to pay my share of the stipend to 5 of the 10 actors
$340 for costumes.
 
We finally found someone who is going to organize a big fundraiser for a full production of the show.
 
This will happen during the summer.
 
Feel free to contribute even just the cost of a ticket ($15) if you can't make the show.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Greetings! I’m Deanna Downes, a director of theater committed to telling the stories of people of color on stage. I am a doctoral candidate at the University of Colorado Boulder with an amazing opportunity to study the performing arts of Cuba for 5 weeks, basically the month of June, in Cuba!</p>
<p>Which brings me to the need for this campaign. The program is a fixed rate of $5,398.00 not including the airfare from Colorado to Miami, our departure city. I have secured a $550 scholarship through the Study Abroad program at CU Boulder but there is still a gap in my funding. Hence, this campaign is solely to help me raise the remaining funds for my journey.</p>
<p>As an artist scholar of African American theater I am excited to learn and compare the content of theater in Post Soviet Cuba, which is still under a U.S. trade embargo. What comparisons can be made between African American contemporary theater and Cuba’s theater? Are there folk plays, are there propaganda plays, and who are the playwrights? These are all questions I hope to find answers to in my studies.</p>
<p><strong>Funding Breakdown</strong></p>
<p>The program costs <strong>$5,398.00</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Instructional Costs  -- $3,336.00</strong></em> -- We have class from 9:30 am to Noon every day taught by the Cuban leaders in the fields of history, performance arts and politics. We also have a mandatory Spanish language course each day.</p>
<p><em><strong>Health Insurance –$70.00</strong></em> -- required part of the program</p>
<p><em><strong>Housing and Meals – $ 1,992.00</strong></em> -- We will be housed in dormitory style housing with two meals provided each day. The campus is one mile from our dormitory and I will be walking to and from classes each day – Woohoo! I’m really excited about this opportunity to experience the culture and people of Cuba each day to and from class.</p>
<h3>ANY and ALL funds will be put towards my participation in this program. If you are unable to help me please forward this email to a friend. Getting the word out is just as important!</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Those of you who know me know that I am the daughter and granddaughter of children’s librarians. I spent my youth tucked in library corners sitting on small chairs, reading children’s books. Children’s books hold the best life lessons that example how to be an awesome human. It’s those stories mixed with the highs and lows of living life that evolve and become plays that I long to direct. In my life there is power in hearing a story that I identify with and seeing a reflection of myself onstage to learn from or to challenge. This is the intention I bring to this trip and my studies in Cuba and the US and to the theatrical work I direct and produce. What are the stories that elders tell their children in Cuba? Can I see a reflection of my life in theirs? How are our lives different? How are they similar? This curiosity in the stories different cultures tell is leading my desire to study Cuban theater.</p>
<p>On a practical note, the experience of this trip will inform the layers of my dissertation writing about women playwrights of color. While I am on the island I have made plans to engage Cuban theater-makers in a joint exploration of a play that has touched my life, Ntozake Shange’s <em>For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf.</em> This joint exploration will culminate in a small tour of the production in Cuba and a later production in New York City at La Mama, ETC. Plans and another campaign for the NYC production will be forthcoming!</p>

<p><strong>WHAT IS 4.48 PSYCHOSIS? </strong></p>
<p>For one year we have worked tirelessly to devise, choreograph, and design this production of Sarah Kane’s infamous play, <strong>4.48 Psychosis</strong>. During this compelling process we engaged in a deep theatrical investigation of fantasy, violence, abandonment, the thin line between life and death, and the delicate balance between the carnal and the civilized.  Now re-envisioned, this story stands as a testament to one woman’s turbulent journey through her distorted memory as she searches for relief from her inner turmoil. Fifteen audience members per performance will move through this immersive and nightmarish landscape that attempts to blur the boundaries between theatre/performance- spectator/participant.</p>
<p><strong>WHO ARE WE?</strong> </p>
<p>Over a year ago, eighteen women were drawn together by the mysterious laws of attraction to a small classroom on a well-known arts school campus to work on <em>The Skriker</em> by Caryl Churchill. Little did we all know this project would be the string that sutured us into one ambitious monster. Today, <strong>Wirehead Collective</strong> is a collaborative-coalition made up of eleven women (and a few choice men!) dedicated to discovering the pulse of an emerging generation through theatre and performance art that is blatantly aggressive, provocative and impossible to ignore or avoid<em>. 4.48 Psychosis</em> declares our first official company production!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>OUR ASK:</strong></p>
<p><strong>With your help </strong>we will be able to afford to create this viscerally exquisite, In-Yer- Face experience for our audience to move through<strong>. </strong>Our goal is to raise $1,000.

bound is an evening length multimedia performance created by Yaa Samar! Dance Theatre Artistic Director Samar Haddad King, that tells the universal story of people who are restricted by society, politics, geography or gender. 
This Fall, bound will tour in the Arab World and Asia, with performances and workshops spanning from Palestine to Japan. Tour engagements extend from October 9 - 25 and include:        •  Two performances of bound in Palestine on October 9 and 10.        •  Workshops for non-dancers presented by the Seoul International Dance                       Festival in Seoul, South Korea on October 16.        •   A closing-night performance of bound at the world-renowned Seoul            International Dance Festival in Seoul, South Korea on October 18.         •  Workshops at Chonbuk National University in Jeonju, South Korea, October             20-21.        •  Workshops at the Kobe Art Village Center in Kobe, Japan, October 23-25.


Situated between mobile planes that act as buildings, borders, and projection surfaces, the seven performers of bound are continuously confronted by an evolving landscape of boundaries that tests their physical and emotional limits. Layered over and between the live action, the story of two lovers separated by circumstance unfolds via Skype. Set to an original score by boikutt, this production examines what it means to be bound: to a place, to a person, to an ideology, to noise, to silence.

why now
        •  This season represents the culmination of ten years of Yaa Samar!             Dance Theatre's dedication to transcending boundaries through international             communication and cross-cultural collaboration.                •  This tour of bound was created across continents, and features an             international cast of American, Japanese, and Palestinian performers,             representing the best in live performance from around the world.        •  Our workshops will reach broad populations including non-dancers and             aspiring artists, sharing YSDT's unique approach to movement.        •  This is the company's fourth and largest international tour.        •  After teaching and performing throughout the Arab World, Europe and the             U.S for the past ten years, this is the company's first trip to Asia! 


why us

        •  Yaa Samar! Dance Theatre (YSDT) is 501(c)3 non-profit organization            and multimedia performance company based between New York             City and Palestine, using art and technology to create performance            across disciplines, cultural geographies, and physical borders.        •  YSDT was founded in 2005 by Artistic Director Samar Haddad King, and             has a proven track record of ten years of successful performances,            workshops, and residencies around the world.        •  We have already raised half the cost of this large-scale international tour            through government grants, individual donations and a generous space grant             from Sareyyet Ramallah Group.        •  We can already cover the cost of transportation for our team of nine           artists across continents, and the construction of sets that are integral             to the work.        •  It is our mission to bring dance to new audiences, and illuminate the             untold stories of people and communities around the world. Inspired by world             events and personal histories, our narratives are accessible to experienced            dance viewers and novice audiences alike. 





why you
        •  We still need to raise $17,000 to cover the cost of this tour, including:            payment of international visa fees, rehearsal space rental in New York City,             and most importantly, to pay our artists!        • You believe in art that addresses and transcends geo-political divisions             and as a contributor you know you will join a strong international network of             like-minded individuals.        •  You know one or more of our artists and want to make a difference in their             lives, and in the lives of the audiences they touch through performance.        •  Even you can't make a donation at this time you, know that you can help by           sharing this campaign on Facebook, and sending directly to your            communities via email, to help us spread the word about the work that we do!

<div><i><b>Crabtree Carabetta Collective</b></i></div>
<div>Teaming up officially for the first time, long term collaborators Brian Crabtree and Audra Carabetta will be presenting a concert of largely new work under the banner of The Crabtree Carabetta Collective. Combining a rich history of dancing together in duets and ensemble work, both choreographers are excited to present dances that have been in process over the past year. As dance makers, they have a shared interest in careful and thoughtful composition, fluid musicality, and context. Both have distinctive movement sensibilities, and apply their wealth of experience in the studio with a mature and dedicated group of dancers. With musical scores that run the gamut from Chopin to Zoe Keating, the focus for both is the illumination of music with carefully made dance phrases that are sometimes chopped, turned, minimalized, sent in several new directions, and changed during rehearsal through dancer ingenuity. A process that yields dances worthy of a second look. The concert will run about one hour and a half with a short intermission. Tickets will be 25.00. </div>
<div>Audra and I are sharing a show as part of the Dance Complex series this fall. November 21st and 22nd at 8 p.pm.  </div>
</div> <p><br/></p>
<p>Specific to this project, we need funding to pay for Jayne Murphy, our wonderful lighting designer, to offset the price of the space and to help pay for a stage manager. We both have worked with Jayne before and she is sensitive and responsive to both of us as dance artists. We are setting a goal of $2000 to make a beautiful project run smoothly and be well lit. </p>
<p>This is the first project we have formally shared after years of dancing together. Our work has been well received and we both have an established reputation for thoughtfully crafted work. </p>

Directly inspired by the interpretations of these pieces by Rubinstein, I wanted to make a series of dances that build not only in personnel, ( from duet to trio to quartet) but also in dramatic urgency and the complexity of their composition. The first is very pastoral, the second overcast by the addition of a third who keeps a steady flow in and out of the action, and the third a dark and stormy quartet, with one couple being surrounded and eventually enclosed by another. <br/></p><p><i>Audra Carabetta</i></p><p>TAKE MY HAND/ a trio set to the beautiful music of Zoe Keating, explores the passing of time and it's effect on human relationships. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""></span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Energetically,

The first is very pastoral, the second overcast by the addition of a third who keeps a steady flow in and out of the action, and the third a dark and stormy quartet, with one couple being surrounded and eventually enclosed by another. Audra CarabettaTAKE MY HAND/ a trio set to the beautiful music of Zoe Keating, explores the passing of time and it's effect on human relationships.  Energetically,
the piece works with quick bursts of movement that soften at the end of asequence, and it plays
with a balance between grounded, bound movement, release and flow. Dancers work
together creating various repetitive, patterns that weave through
space with strength and precision.    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
""Alone among the Boston Moves competition winners, Crabtree understands that dancing inhabits and sculpts the space within it exists: the other choreographers could learn a lot by studying him.""
