<p dir=""ltr""><span>The statistics are telling: <strong>over 10 million young parents in the United States are suffering from some kind of significant emotional or mental stress due to parenthood and most of them are not receiving adequate help</strong> <strong>to assist them in this new phase in their lives</strong>.

<h2>What is Sailing Fitness Toolbox?</h2>
<p><span>Sailing Fitness Toolbox is a training manual for all competitive sailors. It is based on cutting edge training techniques but presents them in an easy to follow format that any keen sailor can use. There are exercise programs for the specific needs of different groups of sailors, with workouts designed for high performance skiff sailors, hiking boat helms and offshore racing crews to name a few. There is advice on nutrition and hydration as well as mental training and injury prevention and chapters dedicated to disabled and youth sailors.</span></p>
<h2><span>About the author</span></h2>
<p><span>As a physiotherapist I have been privledged to work with some of the best sailors in the world, including the </span>Swedish Olympic Sailing Team, where I helped them to secure gold and bronze medals in the sailing events at the London 2012 Olympics.</p>
<p><span>When I am not mending sailors, or writing about how to get better at sailing, I can be found out on the water foiling and racing in my International Moth. It is my love of sailing and my desire to help people achieve their goals on the water that prompted me to write Sailing Fitness Toolbox. To provide readers with a practical guide to help them improve in the sport they love. </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>When can I read Sailing Fitness Toolbox?</h2>
<p>The book has been written, training plans devised and a printer is on stand by with a press ready to roll. All that is needed now is your help with the printing costs to bring the project to life. The costs for setting up, printing and distributing, the first batch of books is £5000, which is where your help is needed. As soon as this campaign closes the presses will start rolling, with the first copies on their way to you hot off the press. If we don't reach the full total we will continue with a smaller print run.</p>
<h2>The benfits for you</h2>
<p><span>The better your sailing fitness, the better your sailing performance will be. Improved fitness means being able to hike for longer, trim harder, complete maneuvers more quickly, hoist and drop sails faster and avoid fatigue for longer; all of which means going faster all the way to the finish line. </span></p>
<p><span>Better sailing fitness means faster sailing, winning races, more enjoyment and fewer injuries. </span></p>
<p><span>By supporting the project, you can be one of the first to get a copy of Sailing Fitness Toolbox - and get the edge over your opposition.</span></p>
<p><span>You don't have to be a sailor to participate in this project.

My name is Holly Troy.  I am an artist, teacher, and alternative healer. I am so excited to be traveling to rural Peru to volunteer my services for the community there.
I need help in funding my trip! I will be traveling from August 13th - August 29th. 
I will be meeting with a group of alternative medical practitioners called Healer2Healer. Healer2Healer is an international organization based in New York City that brings volunteer alternative medicine practitioners - such as acupuncturists, Reiki practitioners, and medical massage therapists - to rural indigenous communities. In addition to five days of Community Clinic in Cahuide where H2H participants will work with Western and alternative practitioners in triage to treat the expected 2,500 to 4,000 patients from the local area, we will:·       Take part in indigenous ceremonies,·       participate in perma-culture activities,·       stay at and learn about The Paititi Institute for the Preservation for the Amazonian Rainforest and Indigenous Culture,·       experience lectures about healing on many levels and modalities,
·       and study indigenous traditions and natural medicine.

<h3>Help Kyle Smile!</h3>
<p>Kyle is a 13 year-old boy that has dealt with more than most his age. Upon birth he was infected with Group B streptococcus. GBS is a type of bacterial infection that can be found in pregnant woman. The infection overtook his system and within hours his labored breathing became a life-threatening situation. All attempts to aid his tiny body failed and he was soon transferred from El Paso Texas to Lubbock for one last treatment to save his life. There he received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (E.C.M.O) a technique of providing both cardiac and respiratory support oxygen to patients whose heart and lungs are so severely damaged that they can no longer serve their function. ECMO was the last option, Kyle’s last chance at life. With no certainty he was administered last rights. He remained on E.C.M.O for two weeks. Although he survived his ordeal the treatment left him with a developmental delay and a progressive hearing loss. We count our blessings - it could have been much worse.</p>
<p>Four years later Kyle developed Guillain-Barre syndrome; a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves. Weakness and tingling in the extremities are usually the first symptoms. Kyle progressively lost use of his limbs and could not walk and once again we found our child on a ventilator, struggling for life. He would once again find the strength to overcome adversity with the help of amazing medical professionals. Kyle went through rehabilitation to relearn how to walk and regain his strength.</p>
<p>Throughout his short life he has remained a positive thoughtful child. His hearing has gradually faded and he now uses hearing aids. He has fought adversity in school to overcome his learning disability. Although his hearing and eyesight have faltered his spirit has not.</p>
<p>Now Kyle is dealing with dental concerns. He is in need of orthodontic work to overcome a severe overbite and alignment problems. For a child with hearing aids and glasses he has never let others taunts and judgment bring him down yet his teeth do affect his confidence as much as the physical matter. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There is a plan to correct his dental problem with a cost of $5,000. With all Kyle has endured over the years I don’t want the high cost to limit his treatment. I ask for help to ensure Kyle gets the treatment he needs. Any amount that can help offset the cost will help.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want Kyle to one day have the ability to smile broadly with confidence without concern for what others think. No need to cover his mouth or suppress his smile.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand, not all of us have money to spare.  Here's how you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take up the cause.  Post the link to our site on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media sites.</li>

</div></div>","Help Kyle Smile!
Kyle is a 13 year-old boy that has dealt with more than most his age. Upon birth he was infected with Group B streptococcus. GBS is a type of bacterial infection that can be found in pregnant woman. The infection overtook his system and within hours his labored breathing became a life-threatening situation. All attempts to aid his tiny body failed and he was soon transferred from El Paso Texas to Lubbock for one last treatment to save his life. There he received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (E.C.M.O) a technique of providing both cardiac and respiratory support oxygen to patients whose heart and lungs are so severely damaged that they can no longer serve their function. ECMO was the last option, Kyle’s last chance at life. With no certainty he was administered last rights. He remained on E.C.M.O for two weeks. Although he survived his ordeal the treatment left him with a developmental delay and a progressive hearing loss. We count our blessings - it could have been much worse.
Four years later Kyle developed Guillain-Barre syndrome; a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks the nerves. Weakness and tingling in the extremities are usually the first symptoms. Kyle progressively lost use of his limbs and could not walk and once again we found our child on a ventilator, struggling for life. He would once again find the strength to overcome adversity with the help of amazing medical professionals. Kyle went through rehabilitation to relearn how to walk and regain his strength.
Throughout his short life he has remained a positive thoughtful child. His hearing has gradually faded and he now uses hearing aids. He has fought adversity in school to overcome his learning disability. Although his hearing and eyesight have faltered his spirit has not.
Now Kyle is dealing with dental concerns. He is in need of orthodontic work to overcome a severe overbite and alignment problems. For a child with hearing aids and glasses he has never let others taunts and judgment bring him down yet his teeth do affect his confidence as much as the physical matter. 


What We Need & What You Get
There is a plan to correct his dental problem with a cost of $5,000. With all Kyle has endured over the years I don’t want the high cost to limit his treatment. I ask for help to ensure Kyle gets the treatment he needs. Any amount that can help offset the cost will help.


The Impact
I want Kyle to one day have the ability to smile broadly with confidence without concern for what others think. No need to cover his mouth or suppress his smile.


Other Ways You Can Help
I understand, not all of us have money to spare.  Here's how you can help:

Take up the cause.  Post the link to our site on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media sites.
Keep Kyle and all the other children in need to medical care in your prayers.

Thanks so very much for taking the time to read Kyle's story.  If we pull this off, it will be a result of caring generous people.  You'll have our eternal gratitude.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Tuesday, September 5, 2012.  John is out of surgery and is resting! Everything went very well and we will update when we know more.  For now, THANK YOU for giving John a chance to go into surgery without the fear of overwhelming medical bills.  Love.</h2>

<p><strong>We are friends of Patti Digh and John Ptak.  We’ve been inspired by their writing, delighted by their stories, and enlightened by their wisdom.  After hearing about John’s diagnosis of kidney cancer—at a time when they are uninsured—many have asked: “How can we help?” </strong></p>
<p><strong>Patti and John, and their two daughters, Emma and Tess, can focus on what is really important right now—getting and staying healthy—if we can help alleviate some of the overwhelming financial burden of his medical care.  This is how you can help.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our goal is to raise $100,000.  While the exact costs of John’s treatment are unknown, it is clear that they will be extensive.  In fact, even though $100,000 is an extraordinary amount of money, it will probably not cover all the specialist consultations, hospitalization, treatment, and surgery expenses that John will incur as an uninsured patient.  Every dollar raised will be used to pay medical bills during John’s treatment.  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Every donation helps. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We already know that we can count on the support of those of us who know and love—and have been touched by—this unique family.  And we are hoping that you will share this news, and your stories of John, Patti, Tess and Emma, with those you love—and ask for their support as well. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Money won’t cure cancer.  But your support will encourage and allow John to follow an effective course of treatment without stressing over the daunting financial burden on his family. As John said in a recent e-mail, “whatever is . . . collected will be very helpful, because right now everything costs and will wind up costing everything . . . .”</strong></p>
<p><strong>We will be updating the site regularly with news and other ways to help.  Since John’s consultations with specialists have already begun, the best thing you can do is to donate whatever you can right now—and spread the word!</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/>****During the first 12 hours of this campaign, we have raised $18,000.  Here is a note from John:<br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>I just wanted to say a quick something here to everyone who has responded with such kindness and grace for my family and me, something quick because it is all so much, so overwhelming, that although I know where to begin I have no idea of how to end. It is all so incredible, all of you, all of the wonderful thoughts and words, and deeds, and charity. It is extremely humbling and happy, and shocking, to see so many hundreds of people contributing their thoughts and hopes and ideas and support. So, for tonight, I just want to say how much this enormous motion--this lifting wave--means to me, and what an almost unspeakably-great relief it is to have so so very many concerned for my family; and to say, for now, a simple ""thank you"". -John Ptak</strong></p></div>","Saturday, September 15th.

Each cluster can be adjusted independently:

Back sleepers might lower the central cluster to create a gentle valley for their head to rest 

Side sleepers might raise all clusters, to ensure their shoulders never compress, wherever they are on MUTU. 
     An ergonomic membrane sits on top of the air-suspension cushions, which will bend and flex according to the height of each cushion.                         The innovative patterned design of this membrane was created to provide firm but flexible support.Pillows that are soft often don't provide enough support, and pillows that provide support, are too firm. The innovative patterned design of this membrane was created to make a hard material flexible, marrying the comfort of a soft pillow with the support of a firm one.The membrane will flex to cradle your head while evenly dispersing pressure across its surface. This lets you to feel truly weightless. The membrane lies just below our natural latex padding, ensuring that your MUTU will never sag, lump or clump.    Our specially formulated latex padding is bacteriostatic and hypoallergenic. Our padding is also perforated to take advantage of MUTU's filler-less core and allow air to flow throughout the pillow's internals.This added ventilation keeps MUTU cooler and fresher, for a more comfortable and hygienic sleep.                                                                   
  Our liner is 100% cotton and is custom made for MUTU, with 3 pull tags attached to it.These pull tags are used to adjust the height of MUTUs 3 air-suspension clusters.                                                     
 MUTU's pull tags make it super easy to adjust the height of your pillow:
To raise a suspension cluster, pull the tag while ensuring your head in not on the pillow
To lower a suspension cluster, pull the tag while your head is on the pillow
Release the tag to lock your desired height in place 
It takes less than 4 seconds to fully inflate or fully deflate MUTU!You'll be having the best sleep of your life in no time!   Once you've adjusted your MUTU it will stay locked at the height more more than a month, so feel free to put your own pillow case over the MUTU liner to match your personal bed-spread.      ""The prototype for this developed at @SydneyIncubate was the most comfortable pillow I ever tried, the production version looks great""  @Mikenicholls88""If you are like me and your feather pillow is never quite right and ruins your sleep, check our @mutupillow air suspension pillow.

<p><b>airtrader
- avalanche respiration systems</b></p>
<p>Freeriders
around the world! Good news ahead: A new swiss avalanche safety product is on it's way! I invented an avalanche respiration system
called 'airtrader'! It allows you to breathe air under the
snowpack of an avalanche and definitely increases the chance of survival. It is very easy-to-handle - if you get caught in an avalanche, you activate
the system and can breathe for at least two hours!<br/></p><p>Our
mission simply is to reduce worldwide avalanche deaths by trading air to
avalanche victims under the snowpack.</p>
<p><b>tom
roos - inventor and founder</b></p>
<p>My
name is Tom Roos from Switzerland and I love the mountains, snow and
freeriding! As a kid I started skateboarding, when I was hurt I spent time at

- avalanche respiration systems
Freeriders
around the world! Good news ahead: A new swiss avalanche safety product is on it's way! I invented an avalanche respiration system
called 'airtrader'! It allows you to breathe air under the
snowpack of an avalanche and definitely increases the chance of survival. It is very easy-to-handle - if you get caught in an avalanche, you activate
the system and can breathe for at least two hours!Our
mission simply is to reduce worldwide avalanche deaths by trading air to
avalanche victims under the snowpack.

<p>So, the foundation of Plan-it Lean's technology is based on a few Ayurvedic principles....Please do read on....<br/></p>
<p><b>How The Plan-it Lean ""Throw Yourself a Lifeline"" concept was born:</b><br/></p>
<p>Upon opening her nutrition consulting practice AND experiencing a succession of client “fat loss” failures, Deborah threw the ADA Food Pyramid to the curb!  Intuitively knowing there had to be an answer somewhere to the myriad of escalating health problems across the planet ----- she discovered India and Ayurvedic Medicine! <br/></p>
<p>Seeking far more than she ever learned from her Biochemistry and Food Science degree, Deborah traveled to India 9 times to study Ayurvedic Medicine. Intrigued by this renowned science long tenured as the Planets’ oldest healing modality---- and, spurred on by the knowledge that all other “healing” modalities (including allopathic western medicine) were “off shoots” of Ayurvedic Medicine; Deborah gently embraced then fully incorporated the foundational principles of Ayurveda into her private practice.</p>
<p><b>Fat melted off her clients</b>- hormones rebalanced, menopausal women found their husbands cute once again- sleep cycles vastly improved-brains re calibrated-energy skyrocketed-moods stabilized- while toilets across the metro area were getting a workout!  <b>Best of all adult onset diabetic clients dropped blood sugar levels by 30 to 50 points  weekly ---while high Insulin levels (HgA1C) dropped consistently over 2 to 6 months.</b></p>
<p><b>A better way to help, guide and serve clients became a honed science!<br/></b></p>

</blockquote></div>
<p><b>How The Plan-it Lean technology works:</b><br/></p>
<p><b></b>Plan-it Lean's smart lifeline technology gives the user a simple easy to use software program that delivers directives such as <i>what to eat today</i> provided by daily food “maps” along with lifestyle recommendations (sleep cycle adjustments, additional workout protocols) based on the subscribers current food preferences, plus workout or,"" no workout today"" choices.  <br/></p>
<p>For example should the consumer ""enter"" consumption of alcohol or pizza into their program they will receive either a different calculation regarding total calories needed that day PLUS adjustments regarding the percentages derived from Proteins, Healthy Fats or low glycemic  Carbohydrates OR perhaps a  recommendation to increase minutes of cardio burn to level the Blast Fat playing field.</p>
<p> The goal is to educate and direct the user on how NOT to increase body fat...(should they desire to have their cake and eat it too) or ideally, how to ""blast"" current fat stores fast!<br/></p>
<p> The  1000's of algorithms embedded in the Lifeline technology delivers a program rich in its capabilities while offering an extraordinary number of personalized variables and options to the subscriber daily.. <br/></p>
<p>Goal dates set by the subscriber will be tracked by the Lifeline technology.  Options/reminders to alter goal dates based on performance by the subscriber will pop up daily within the users program.</p>
<p>Subscriber's goals can vary: from blasting belly fat and losing weight, to reversing high glucose levels, lowering HgA1C, increasing energy, sleeping better or saying goodbye to bloat, gas and constipation.</p>
<p>This information Lifeline technology software is delivered in the form of a subscription program which charts the user’s progress based on the input of 6 simple queries.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Technology tracking data includes:</b></p>
<p><b> 1.  Subscriber’s current weight</b></p>
<p><b> 2.  Approx current body fat percentage</b></p>
<p><b> 3.  Minutes of cardio burn per week</b></p>
<p><b> 4.  The user’s ideal weight</b></p>
<p><b> 5.  Ideal body fat percentage plus  </b></p>
<p><b> 6.  Target goal date.</b></p>
<p><b>The Plan-it Lean smart software program in turn calculates the users total pounds of body fat to lean mass ratios.</b></p>
<p><b>This allows the user to adjust the numerous algorithms within the program to create new preferred food “map” options based on variances in daily altered lifestyle choices.</b></p>
<p><b>Total minimum caloric requirements are based on the users lifestyle decisions. For example  (to exercise or not exercise). Food “map” downloads specify percentages, calories, grams plus units the user needs to consume from Proteins, Fats and low glycemic Carbs all driven by the Plan-it Lean revolutionary technology.</b></p>
<p><b>Weekly updates delivered to the user will track current weight and body fat percentage, total pounds of fat loss, pounds of increased lean mass,  as well as the number of days or weeks it will take to reach their ultimate goal based on their weekly progress.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Once daily food “maps” are downloaded by the subscriber the Plan-it Lean program will chart progress or lack thereof. The intelligent Lifeline action of the technology presents alternatives and adjustments to Lifestyle choices and variations such as exercise or not, the user’s total hours of sleep per night, the inclusion of alcohol or say, the desire for a “treat” such as pizza or a brownie.</p>
<p><b>Animation: Our educational ""edutainment"" component<br/></b></p>
<p>The Plan-it Lean Lifeline technology is not only intelligent it also delivers subliminal education via the insertion of engaging animated ""pop up"" characters.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b>The Heart Smart Kids and The Junk Food Junkie characters “pop up” daily as reminders for the user to track personal progress</b> and further utilize their program.  Through “edutainment” (education co- combined with animated entertainment) these educational characters deliver health information tidbits which “serve” <b>to inform, grow and expand the subscriber’s knowledge base.</b></p>

<p><b>With obesity and diabetes growing at an alarming rate  worldwide we need to throw ourselves AND our children a Lifeline! </b> Statistics reveal that over the last decade the rate of Childhood Type 2 ( adult onset) diabetes has grown by 29%.  This means 1 out every 16 kids under the age of 20 is tumbling towards ”add on” health problems down the road with obesity at the forefront. Our kids are clueless, unknowingly embracing future disease states that can be avoided through education and sensible food choices!</p>
<p><b>Here are the Facts:</b><br/></p>
<p>-<b>Childhood Type 1 diabetes is up 70% from 1985 to 2004</b> and growing strong.</p>
<p>-<b>One out of three kids will develop Type 2 diabetes</b> in their lifetime!</p>
<p>-From <b>2005 to 2030 </b>statisticians predict that <b>diabetes will advance from 1.3 billion people engulfing the lives of 2.0 billion people!</b></p>
<p>-In America <b>obesity rates</b> are moving like a Tsunami.  From<b> 2008 to 2013 obesity rates have risen from 25.5% to 27.2% of the population.</b></p>
<p>-Yet again, statistics show a <b>72% increase in diabetic trends word wide from 2010 to 2030!</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>It’s time to throw yourself, our children and the rest of our planet a Lifeline!</b></p>
<p><b>Plan it Lean’s “Throw Yourself a Lifeline” intuitive and intelligent technology</b> is designed to be launched as an online subscription program or a downloadable app. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>The algorithm based software program aims to do far more than just calculate and deliver food “maps” to the end user.  <b>The Plan-it Lean platform is revolutionary as well as unique to each user</b>.  <b>End game? Blasting body fat, reversing adult onset diabetes and bolstering energy!</b> These are just a few of the long term benefits. We are creating the consumer’s online personal nutritionist, accessible daily!</p>
<p><b>HOW MUCH WILL THE PLAN-IT LEAN LIFELINE SUBSCRIPTION COST?</b><br/></p>
<p><b>This $287.00 six week subscription program is not only your LIFELINE it is very intelligent! Computations and algorithms’ can vary daily Personalized for each user: </b> in that individuals tend to be either creative and variant <i>or</i> habitual in their food choices as well as lifestyle habits.</p>
<p>Formulated goals will track losses and gains with animated character “pop ups” delivering witty edutainment based educational tidbits as to how the user lost or gained fat or lean muscle mass!</p>
<p>If the subscriber is missing in action and has not logged in for more than 2 days the programs’ animated characters will automatically pop up on the screen-inquiring/cheerleading/ guiding the user back onto their path towards their personal preset goals.</p>
<p><b>Potential for Plan-it Lean , our NEXT STEPS:</b><br/></p>
<p>Within the upcoming year Arneson and her team of 5 aims to develop add on features to Plan-it Lean that assess/analyze, hence further triage and “fix” specific health concerns. Assessments will take into consideration nutritional deficits based on blood, hair mineral and hormone test results delivering to the end user recommended nutrient specific “re- balancing” protocols.</p>
<p>Inflammatory based diseases such as Arthritis, Rheumatoid, Eczema, or Irritable Bowel Syndrome can be addressed and resolved based on the infusion of specific targeted nutrients along with a personalized algorithm based dietary protocol to further reduce gut as well as other inflammatory conditions!</p>
<p>This “program with a brain” tweaks lifestyle habits moving the subscriber towards ultimate healthy goals with education as an option.  Lowering cholesterol and blood sugar levels is easy- while moving an individual away from “emotional” eating can be more complicated.</p>
<p>Nonetheless- studies show <b>if </b>satiety centers in the brain are satisfied biochemically-emotional triggers have less affect on the brain.</p>
<p>The beauty of <b>Plan-it Lean’s Throw Yourself a Lifeline technology</b>- comes with <b>built in privacy.</b> The adventure of altering ones health outcome can be done in the privacy and convenience of one’s home. Rather than paying upwards of $100 an hour for nutrition consulting and therapy, paying for parking, sitting in a waiting room,  <b>consumers can wade through Plan-it Lean’s “free” site which rolled out 6 months ago.</b></p>
<p>Plan-it Lean’s user friendly site hosts a cornucopia of information designed at expanding the consumer’s health knowledge!  As consumers gather knowledge- choices become education based and “knowing” rather than reactive or convenience based.</p>
<p><b>Our Plan-it Lean education site currently offers 5 quizzes (at no charge) </b>providing consumers with assessments and guidance plus explanations on what to incorporate/change in transition towards one’s ideal health scenario!</p>

So, the foundation of Plan-it Lean's technology is based on a few Ayurvedic principles....Please do read on....
How The Plan-it Lean ""Throw Yourself a Lifeline"" concept was born:
Upon opening her nutrition consulting practice AND experiencing a succession of client “fat loss” failures, Deborah threw the ADA Food Pyramid to the curb!  Intuitively knowing there had to be an answer somewhere to the myriad of escalating health problems across the planet ----- she discovered India and Ayurvedic Medicine! 
Seeking far more than she ever learned from her Biochemistry and Food Science degree, Deborah traveled to India 9 times to study Ayurvedic Medicine. Intrigued by this renowned science long tenured as the Planets’ oldest healing modality---- and, spurred on by the knowledge that all other “healing” modalities (including allopathic western medicine) were “off shoots” of Ayurvedic Medicine; Deborah gently embraced then fully incorporated the foundational principles of Ayurveda into her private practice.
Fat melted off her clients- hormones rebalanced, menopausal women found their husbands cute once again- sleep cycles vastly improved-brains re calibrated-energy skyrocketed-moods stabilized- while toilets across the metro area were getting a workout!  Best of all adult onset diabetic clients dropped blood sugar levels by 30 to 50 points  weekly ---while high Insulin levels (HgA1C) dropped consistently over 2 to 6 months.
A better way to help, guide and serve clients became a honed science!




Albert R.  on March 30, 2014Diagnosed by his physicians with: High blood pressure,  Adult onset Diabetes, Obesity, Kidney Problems, Chronic Fatigue Albert R.  on June 28, 2014Blood Pressure dropped         from 198/66  to 145/42Blood Sugar                                from 250 to 114HgA1C                                           from 6.7 to 5.8Body fat                                       dropped -22 poundsEnergy (scale of 1 thru 10)     was a 2, is now an 8with 10 being highLean Mass                                   up 12 pounds

How The Plan-it Lean technology works:
Plan-it Lean's smart lifeline technology gives the user a simple easy to use software program that delivers directives such as what to eat today provided by daily food “maps” along with lifestyle recommendations (sleep cycle adjustments, additional workout protocols) based on the subscribers current food preferences, plus workout or,"" no workout today"" choices.  
For example should the consumer ""enter"" consumption of alcohol or pizza into their program they will receive either a different calculation regarding total calories needed that day PLUS adjustments regarding the percentages derived from Proteins, Healthy Fats or low glycemic  Carbohydrates OR perhaps a  recommendation to increase minutes of cardio burn to level the Blast Fat playing field.
 The goal is to educate and direct the user on how NOT to increase body fat...(should they desire to have their cake and eat it too) or ideally, how to ""blast"" current fat stores fast!
 The  1000's of algorithms embedded in the Lifeline technology delivers a program rich in its capabilities while offering an extraordinary number of personalized variables and options to the subscriber daily.. 
Goal dates set by the subscriber will be tracked by the Lifeline technology.  Options/reminders to alter goal dates based on performance by the subscriber will pop up daily within the users program.
Subscriber's goals can vary: from blasting belly fat and losing weight, to reversing high glucose levels, lowering HgA1C, increasing energy, sleeping better or saying goodbye to bloat, gas and constipation.
This information Lifeline technology software is delivered in the form of a subscription program which charts the user’s progress based on the input of 6 simple queries.

Technology tracking data includes:
 1.  Subscriber’s current weight
 2.  Approx current body fat percentage
 3.  Minutes of cardio burn per week
 4.  The user’s ideal weight
 5.  Ideal body fat percentage plus  
 6.  Target goal date.
The Plan-it Lean smart software program in turn calculates the users total pounds of body fat to lean mass ratios.
This allows the user to adjust the numerous algorithms within the program to create new preferred food “map” options based on variances in daily altered lifestyle choices.
Total minimum caloric requirements are based on the users lifestyle decisions. For example  (to exercise or not exercise). Food “map” downloads specify percentages, calories, grams plus units the user needs to consume from Proteins, Fats and low glycemic Carbs all driven by the Plan-it Lean revolutionary technology.
Weekly updates delivered to the user will track current weight and body fat percentage, total pounds of fat loss, pounds of increased lean mass,  as well as the number of days or weeks it will take to reach their ultimate goal based on their weekly progress.

Once daily food “maps” are downloaded by the subscriber the Plan-it Lean program will chart progress or lack thereof. The intelligent Lifeline action of the technology presents alternatives and adjustments to Lifestyle choices and variations such as exercise or not, the user’s total hours of sleep per night, the inclusion of alcohol or say, the desire for a “treat” such as pizza or a brownie.
Animation: Our educational ""edutainment"" component
The Plan-it Lean Lifeline technology is not only intelligent it also delivers subliminal education via the insertion of engaging animated ""pop up"" characters.


The Heart Smart Kids and The Junk Food Junkie characters “pop up” daily as reminders for the user to track personal progress and further utilize their program.  Through “edutainment” (education co- combined with animated entertainment) these educational characters deliver health information tidbits which “serve” to inform, grow and expand the subscriber’s knowledge base.


This feature adds to positive outcome potential for the user by engaging and entertaining while reminding the user daily to keep their eye on the prize which is their ultimate goal!  We support subscribers’ successes by cheerleading ----thru edutainment.

With obesity and diabetes growing at an alarming rate  worldwide we need to throw ourselves AND our children a Lifeline!  Statistics reveal that over the last decade the rate of Childhood Type 2 ( adult onset) diabetes has grown by 29%.  This means 1 out every 16 kids under the age of 20 is tumbling towards ”add on” health problems down the road with obesity at the forefront. Our kids are clueless, unknowingly embracing future disease states that can be avoided through education and sensible food choices!
Here are the Facts:
-Childhood Type 1 diabetes is up 70% from 1985 to 2004 and growing strong.
-One out of three kids will develop Type 2 diabetes in their lifetime!
-From 2005 to 2030 statisticians predict that diabetes will advance from 1.3 billion people engulfing the lives of 2.0 billion people!
-In America obesity rates are moving like a Tsunami.  From 2008 to 2013 obesity rates have risen from 25.5% to 27.2% of the population.
-Yet again, statistics show a 72% increase in diabetic trends word wide from 2010 to 2030!

It’s time to throw yourself, our children and the rest of our planet a Lifeline!
Plan it Lean’s “Throw Yourself a Lifeline” intuitive and intelligent technology is designed to be launched as an online subscription program or a downloadable app. 
Our tech team in Kerala India, ThoughtLine Tech  is renowned for creating algorithm heavy technologies for companies worldwide.




Since 2008, ThoughtLine has provided niche, custom solutions to Fortune 500 companies with predictable, consistent service, day in and day out. Moving beyond the usual client-vendor relationship, ThoughtLine functions almost as an extension of the client. Their dedicated team of IT professionals, functioning from their state of the art facilities, provide world class service to their clients, taking care of their client's information technology needs - thus letting them do what they do best.

The algorithm based software program aims to do far more than just calculate and deliver food “maps” to the end user.  The Plan-it Lean platform is revolutionary as well as unique to each user.  End game? Blasting body fat, reversing adult onset diabetes and bolstering energy! These are just a few of the long term benefits. We are creating the consumer’s online personal nutritionist, accessible daily!
HOW MUCH WILL THE PLAN-IT LEAN LIFELINE SUBSCRIPTION COST?
This $287.00 six week subscription program is not only your LIFELINE it is very intelligent! Computations and algorithms’ can vary daily Personalized for each user:  in that individuals tend to be either creative and variant or habitual in their food choices as well as lifestyle habits.
Formulated goals will track losses and gains with animated character “pop ups” delivering witty edutainment based educational tidbits as to how the user lost or gained fat or lean muscle mass!
If the subscriber is missing in action and has not logged in for more than 2 days the programs’ animated characters will automatically pop up on the screen-inquiring/cheerleading/ guiding the user back onto their path towards their personal preset goals.
Potential for Plan-it Lean , our NEXT STEPS:
Within the upcoming year Arneson and her team of 5 aims to develop add on features to Plan-it Lean that assess/analyze, hence further triage and “fix” specific health concerns. Assessments will take into consideration nutritional deficits based on blood, hair mineral and hormone test results delivering to the end user recommended nutrient specific “re- balancing” protocols.
Inflammatory based diseases such as Arthritis, Rheumatoid, Eczema, or Irritable Bowel Syndrome can be addressed and resolved based on the infusion of specific targeted nutrients along with a personalized algorithm based dietary protocol to further reduce gut as well as other inflammatory conditions!
This “program with a brain” tweaks lifestyle habits moving the subscriber towards ultimate healthy goals with education as an option.  Lowering cholesterol and blood sugar levels is easy- while moving an individual away from “emotional” eating can be more complicated.
Nonetheless- studies show if satiety centers in the brain are satisfied biochemically-emotional triggers have less affect on the brain.
The beauty of Plan-it Lean’s Throw Yourself a Lifeline technology- comes with built in privacy. The adventure of altering ones health outcome can be done in the privacy and convenience of one’s home. Rather than paying upwards of $100 an hour for nutrition consulting and therapy, paying for parking, sitting in a waiting room,  consumers can wade through Plan-it Lean’s “free” site which rolled out 6 months ago.
Plan-it Lean’s user friendly site hosts a cornucopia of information designed at expanding the consumer’s health knowledge!  As consumers gather knowledge- choices become education based and “knowing” rather than reactive or convenience based.
Our Plan-it Lean education site currently offers 5 quizzes (at no charge) providing consumers with assessments and guidance plus explanations on what to incorporate/change in transition towards one’s ideal health scenario!
Free to the consumer quizzes include:
-A Basic health review which queries water intake, sleep habits, bowel movements, energy levels etc.
-The Stress Quiz assesses the consumer’s perceived stress levels with guidance on how to lower stress levels.
Deborah’s favorite and most useful tool is:
-The Adrenal fatigue questionnaire.  Responses indicate precisely how exhausted the user’s adrenal glands and endocrine system is at this point in time.  Giving the consumer answers/guidance to further explore the appropriate steps required to “fix” their adrenals which are the backbone of the immune system.
-A Mineral Deficiency questionnaire targets mineral/vitamin deficiencies which do a collective “dance” in the activation of metabolism.
-The Ayurvedic Assessment “What’s your Dosha?” is for the more enlightened consumer who is interested in this 5000 year old modality of healing with the understanding of their two primary “energies” or Doshas. Each of the 3 major doshas has “gifts” as well as potential health pitfalls. Knowing one’s primary and secondary Dosha reveals foods, herb’s and  flavors to incorporate daily; as well as foods to avoid to keep oneself in ideal Doshic  balance hence- disease free!
The good news for Arneson is she’s diving into a hot market segment with over $60 Billion being spent out of pocket by consumers seeking affordable online answers to weight loss alone.
 Meanwhile $34 Billion is being spent for alternative based protocols including nutrition supplementation.
The American Diabetes Association and the American Dietician Associations are befuddled and clueless as how to guide consumers in preventing, braking and reversing the crazy rise of obesity and diabetes in the U.S.
Clearly diets DO NOT work- with studies finding consumers packing on the fat faster than ever before in the history of mankind!
The entire U.S, and planet is ripe for a “map” on how to blast fat, bolster energy, reverse diabetic trends, activate their toilets, get rid of gas, bloat and Gurd, balance moods and hormones and lower cholesterol without drugs.  Most importantly?  Lessen visits to the Doctor AND save money!
Funding Requirements
Our Costs:
Plan it Lean’s funding requirements are $ 69,200.00
A total of $54,000.00 is required to develop the Lifeline technology. Thousands of algorithms will calculate 100’s of  food ""map"" alternatives along with providing the subscriber with a myriad of flexible options. 
A portion of the $54,000 will go into creating our Plan-it Lean's ""beyond extensive""  1000's upon 1000's of food options needed to create the Plan-it Lean data base. Currently there are no data bases available for purchase that can provide us with every conceivable food on the planet!
Our programers must then convert each and every food on the planet into our patented ""UNITS"" which breaks down and delivers total calories, grams, and percentages required from each food group to the subscriber.
 Incorporating every conceivable food  from around the world will revolutionize our ""intelligent"" technology!
The balance of $15,200 is required for the creation of our animated characters which will be infused as ""pop up"" educators in Plan-it Lean ""Throw Yourself a Lifeline"" technology.  
A total of 7 Heart Smart Kid animated characters plus 4 Junk Food Junkie characters are already drawn, designed and patented.
The animated educational characters reflect “cool” foods such as “Broc”. For example Broc represents a reminder to eat those veggies- increase fiber intake-experience amazing bowel movements! Ultimately Blast Fat!
The Junk Food Junkies represent “faux” foods that are taking our health down the drain.
These “Fast” junk food characters range from “Big Daddy” junk  to “Sneaks” a wired sugar cube to Tie Die- A seductive canned soda to Zombie, our mucus loaded greasy French fry!
 The animated character reminders are online healthy “teachers.” Termed “edutainment” these animated characters are infused into our Lifelinetechnolgy to educate, humor and encourage users to stay directed.
The Heart Smart Kids and Junk Food Junkies will entertain and engage. Using the consumer driven “edutainment” approach appeals to the “Big Kid” in all consumers! Teaching without preaching!
Our group in India will develop the intuitive technology based program for 168 food “map” variations. Each “map” has the capability of recalibrating the original map based on input data from the user. Optional “maps” provide up to 10 alternative templates based on the users Lifestyle choices for the day or week ahead.  
Percentages, grams, portions, total calories, along with ideal food lists presented in in the form of ""maps"" range from 600 calories (for children) up to 4800 calories (for body builders).
168 individual unique to the user downloadable “food maps” offer up to 10 variations per map depending on the following data input by the user:
1. Current weight
2. Weight goal
3. Minutes of cardio burn per week
4. Current body fat percentage
5. Ideal body fat percentage
6. Goal date
This intelligent intuitive technology platform delivers the subscriber a personalized unique to them food “map” incorporating a suggested (feeding) schedule. Further defined by  grams, portion sizes, ounces as well as allotted percentages from Proteins, Healthy Fats  and low glycemic Carbohydrates delivers the total MINIMUM  number of calories the user requires daily. Percentages are the key to the success of the program determined by lifestyle variations such as hours of sleep per night.

WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN US? 
We've come so very far since our project was just a dream!  Its been an amazing journey but also a tremendous amount of work for people with more than full time jobs and college curriculum's! on top of everyone's packed full time lives!It is now time for us to hire our team in India to help us move into production.Once our technology is produced we will need to tweek our intelligent/intuitive software- making it as simple and easy to use as possible for you, our consummate consumer!  We will then require a number of Beta testers to dive in and test drive our Plan-it Lean software program.We hope to have the technology completed within 4 to 5 months, hopefully by January 2015. We are blessed to have a cornucopia of potential subscribers, even before our product is ready.  Many of Deborah s' clients (some for decades) are, and have been ""chomping at the bit"" to have access 24/7 to Plan-it Lean's technology, giving them their own personalized online nutritionist always at the ready day or night! If you LOVE our concept, but aren't able to contribute financially--No Worries!  There are some other terrific ways to help out.  We are pretty certain that only a small percentage of the Planet knows about  Plan-it Lean's how to ""Throw yourself a Lifeline"" at this point in time.  Therefore we GREATLY appreciate your telling others about Plan-it Lean...be it by talking, tweeting, Face Booking, or just plain ""liking us""!


PARADIGM SHIFT
The implementation of Plan-it LEAN across the globe would change peoples health for the far better on so many levels! 
 Plan-It Leans' technology creates a personalized ""map"" encompassing lifestyle ""shifts"" guiding people towards the ""how to"" gently create positive changes --bearing enormous health benefits.
Current statistics denoting health/disease trends are almost incomprehensible along with just plain scary!
Throughout history the grass roots efforts of ""the people"", people just like you and me have created the most momentous of changes, Fueling ""outdated old "" paradigms towards their long overdue end --while igniting the ""ideal"" paradigm-- to take a strong hold----for the betterment of many!
Quid pro quo  is an outdated standard. At this point in the history of mankind the sabre tooth tiger are ""Lifestyle"" induced diseases with obesity and diabetes leading the way! Knowledge is key to survival of our species for those of us who wish to pass on our gene pool.
Statistics reveal by the year 2030 seventy percent of the world's population will be pre diabetic, diabetic as well as tap dancing with obesity !
The old adage ""you have nothing if you don't have your health"" is in our face more than ever....Without energy, vitality and a desire to move, produce, dance or just walk your dog...the 'envelope"" of one's life shrinks, everything else loses its luster...and so it goes....
The clock is ticking...ticking loudly! Cancer is targeting 1 out of 3 people across our Planet. Adult onset Diabetes is encroaching upon the lives of 1 out of 4 adults, the shocker? 1 out of 16 of our kids, with Obesity in fast pursuit!
The Plan-it Lean intelligent and intuitive technology will change peoples lives, give people back their health, put the brakes on diabetes and obesity, maybe even give people the desire to walk, jump, dance or get just out of bed! All are symptoms of ""good"" health supported by educated choices!
At some point in time we have all been or will be touched by someone we care about experiencing a disease.
Stress ramps up for each and every person involved in another's disease process-- Stress leads to high cortisol which packs on the belly fat which leads to insulin resistance....any disease is debilitating for all concerned.
 Plan-it Lean brings to everyone's table the answer in the form of education or, just good old fashioned practical guidance delivering the end user a personalized MAP!
We all  know this: to create change; knowledge or guidance is foundational, even more importantly ""it"" needs to be  simple and affordable. The ""it"" is Plan-it Lean!

The Plan-it Lean technology will give people everywhere the opportunity to change their health outcome towards the better.  Presenting an abundance of possibilities--
Personalized, unique and revolutionary......
 PLAN-IT LEAN IS THROWING YOURSELF A LIFELINE!  
More About Us
It's been a sometimes challenging yet MOST interesting and expansive learning curve as well as journey!  We started working on Plan-it LEAN in 2010.
We thank you each and every one of you for helping us to take our tried and true formulas/concept to a reality that has the ability to change our entire health paradigm to one of ""oh so much better"" for people all over our Planet!

</i>Hello! We are Odessa and Mai, Filipinos currently working in the U.S. From the other side of the world, we watched, in horror, as Typhoon Haiyan decimated our islands and claimed the lives of so many of our people. Thousands are now living in unimaginable conditions without food, clean water, light, and shelter. It's heartbreaking to see such overwhelming suffering and desperation.

<br/><br/>We want to help, but we need YOU.

<br/><br/>Your generous contribution can help us provide vital relief goods to those in greatest need in the Philippines right now. $10 can buy approximately 5 liters of water, 3 kilos of rice, 10 canned goods, several packets of noodles, crackers, and a bottle of paracetamol - enough to sustain a whole family for a few days. Imagine what you can do with $20! For those of us who are in the position to give, it takes so little to make such a big impact. <br/><br/>We are funding a small group of people based in Cebu City, Philippines, who have been taking it upon themselves to buy, pack, and distribute goods to severely affected areas in Leyte, Cebu, and its surrounding islands. It is an initiative which started with two people, and grew into a full-scale relief effort comprised of dozens of donors and volunteers.
 
<br/><br/>This is a grassroots operation. Whatever money is received from this campaign will go directly to our main contact in Cebu City, Ligaya Solera-Saberon, to be used to purchase necessary materials for scheduled distribution. Rest assured, your contribution will not be encumbered by bureaucratic roadblocks, and will directly reach the people in need, in the hardest hit areas, in a timely fashion (as is possible).

<br/><br/>Please see the ongoing operation in documents below, provided by Ligaya and her team, accounting for everything they have received - in cash and kind, what they have already accomplished and what they are still planning to do.<i><i><b><br/><br/><a href=""https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxFZ1VhxW9ppTHRTMUNFZHN1bTA/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">INFO about RELIEF OPERATIONS</a>  <br/></b></i></i><i><b><a href=""https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxFZ1VhxW9ppdC1Va0JNb0tEVWs/edit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Nov 13 UPDATE on RELIEF OPERATIONS</a></b></i><i><b><br/><a href=""https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxFZ1VhxW9ppdC1Va0JNb0tEVWs/edit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'></a><a href=""https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BxFZ1VhxW9ppQ2R3MWk0Q2tmTlU/edit"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nov 21 UPDATE on RELIEF OPERATIONS</a><br/><br/></b></i><p>Thank you for your generosity!</p><i></i><p><i><b><br/></b></i></p><p><i><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/194716/files/20131113062653-BYvSRt0CMAEq-UI.jpg?1384352813"" src="""" style=""""/></b></i></p><i><b><br/><br/><br/></b></i>

<p>With winter coming , the threat of pandemic is imminent. We have created <strong>the world's first pen-shaped EDC </strong>tool to avoid unnecessary public contact.

<p>With your support we can bring this product to life and achieve this goal. We thank you for your continued support.</p>
<p> Timeline and production</p>
<p>We are incredibly focused. We want to move fast, and we want to make sure everything works perfectly, so we refuse to put a half-finished product into production. Currently, we have finalized the process of our production methods but we are still negotiating material costs. We need to confirm an average production quantity in order to provide the most efficient costs that will allow us to ship the products to your hands.</p>
<p>In May-July 2020, our first prototypes were shipped to global testing sites, where they were tested by people of different ages, genders and nationalities. Now we are confident that the pen can work in all major cities. We have received feedback from the initial testers, and are currently modifying the grip and several add-ons such as better and more stylish straps for ease of use and better ring material for the user’s comfort.</p>
<p>Our current production schedule is optimistic, but we wish for the best and we are planning for alternatives if production happens to fall behind due to the everchanging pandemic situation. With your support, we are planning to start production in October and start shipping most of our products within December this year before the Christmas shipping peak. It is a tight schedule, and we expect that we may rely on faster and slightly more costly courier shipping services. We will update you with any changes or additional shipping cost whenever we have news.</p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>We are a continuously running production company with years of experience gained from different fields of design and manufacturing. These experiences will help us to meet the very high production standard, and deliver the best product possible. We have already gone through several prototype testing of the Contact Pen and although we have finalized the process of our production methods, we are still negotiating material costs. We need to confirm an average production quantity in order to provide the most efficient costs that will allow us to ship the products to your hands. We surely expect certain or potential challenges in the manufacturing of the project. One of the major one is the creation of the steel mould which will allow us to produce high quantity numbers and to achieve the perfect end result. We also took into consideration a potential new wave of COVID-19, and prepared ourselves to minimize it's effect on our production. We promise to keep you updated with regular progress until you get your reward. Our target is to make a quality product to help everyone.</p>

Inspired by futuristic and modern ergo-dynamic designs, the Livsy Contact Pen is practical, attractive and ergonomic. It has been fitted with an anti-slip surface for additional comfort during use. 

The size and shape of the Livsy Contact Pen has been carefully designed and tested to fit all hand sizes, from a small child to an adult and it can easily fit into your pocket, fanny pack or purse.



 The size of the Livsy Contact Pen with the Cap on:  9.46cm or 3,72 inches 
 The size of the Livsy Contact Pen without the Cap:  8.47cm or 3,33 inches 


The tip has been designed to work with differing button sizes, being narrow enough to hit the smaller buttons and strong enough to hit the larger ones. It can also be used in a variety of angles to allow use even in tight places.

 Sustainability is one of our major goals, and thus the Pen’s tip is completely replaceable, allowing you to simply buy a new tip to replace the old one instead of getting a new Pen. 


The Contact Pen’s base is currently available in three different colors, we have already made plans for production. And if we reach our Stretch Goals, we are planning on adding a variety of different options to allow you to customize the Pen to your personal preference.
Reaching these Stretch Goals would mean we could add more color variation to the Pen’s base and interchangeable tips, and it would also allow us to produce other versions of interchangeable tips that would further expand the functionalities of the Pen.




UPDATE: Additionally to the Strap Cord and the Ring, we are planning to soon extend the available addons with a Retractable Carabiner Keychain!

 We used modern, quick and high quality 3D printing technology to be able to test the shape and size of each iterations of the Contact Pen in a physical form in just a couple of hours time. This allowed us to modify and perfect the design before moving forward in the production. 




Available in a single, duo, family, and even a bulk sale option, the Livsy Contact Pen has a solution for all your needs. Whether you are a one person or a family, there is an option for you!




We believe people are power and when people genuinely want to help the world, things can get better. Every once in a while, a revolutionary design comes along to make the world a better place. This is our mission.
We are Livsy, we strive to help people to live a better life by creating useful daily products which are all high-quality, sophisticated and uniquely designed.

With your support we can bring this product to life and achieve this goal. We thank you for your continued support.
 Timeline and production
We are incredibly focused. We want to move fast, and we want to make sure everything works perfectly, so we refuse to put a half-finished product into production. Currently, we have finalized the process of our production methods but we are still negotiating material costs. We need to confirm an average production quantity in order to provide the most efficient costs that will allow us to ship the products to your hands.
In May-July 2020, our first prototypes were shipped to global testing sites, where they were tested by people of different ages, genders and nationalities. Now we are confident that the pen can work in all major cities. We have received feedback from the initial testers, and are currently modifying the grip and several add-ons such as better and more stylish straps for ease of use and better ring material for the user’s comfort.
Our current production schedule is optimistic, but we wish for the best and we are planning for alternatives if production happens to fall behind due to the everchanging pandemic situation. With your support, we are planning to start production in October and start shipping most of our products within December this year before the Christmas shipping peak. It is a tight schedule, and we expect that we may rely on faster and slightly more costly courier shipping services. We will update you with any changes or additional shipping cost whenever we have news.
Risks and challenges
We are a continuously running production company with years of experience gained from different fields of design and manufacturing. These experiences will help us to meet the very high production standard, and deliver the best product possible. We have already gone through several prototype testing of the Contact Pen and although we have finalized the process of our production methods, we are still negotiating material costs. We need to confirm an average production quantity in order to provide the most efficient costs that will allow us to ship the products to your hands. We surely expect certain or potential challenges in the manufacturing of the project. One of the major one is the creation of the steel mould which will allow us to produce high quantity numbers and to achieve the perfect end result. We also took into consideration a potential new wave of COVID-19, and prepared ourselves to minimize it's effect on our production. We promise to keep you updated with regular progress until you get your reward. Our target is to make a quality product to help everyone.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Thinking of Marrakech conjures up pictures of Arabian nights, exotic food and music, colourful markets and lavish accommodation. But the majority of the population in Marrakech live in conditions of poverty, which is never more obvious than when you enter any of the city’s busy emergency rooms. Services that are chronically under-resourced and over-stretched struggle daily to meet the needs of their patients, and as a result those with non-life-threatening injuries or illnesses often take a back seat.</p>
<p>Our plan is to show these people that they are important, that they deserve one of the most basic of human rights – that of access to excellent and affordable health care. We will build an Urgent Care Centre that will treat the cohort of patients that never take priority, allowing the public hospital to focus their limited resources on more major traumas and life-threatening illnesses that require in-patient care. We will provide an environment where Moroccan and foreign health care practionners can learn and serve together to provide world-class standards of care at a minimal cost.</p>
<p>With the strategic use of volunteered time and donated medical equipment from overseas, it is hoped that this project, once up and running, can otherwise be funded from entirely inside Morocco. We aim to develop a sustainable and reproducible model that could be developed in other cities and areas.</p>
<p>In order to get the program going we need to raise the start-up funds.  This is where we are asking you and your families and your contacts, would you like to be a part of this project? Would you like to help us start something that could be a catalyst to significant improvement in many people’s lives?!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Initially, we need seed money.  We are hoping to raise enough to cover the costs of getting the ball rolling – including staff training, shipping donated medical equipment from Europe and the US, all the legal paperwork and set-up administration, architects fees, and advertising / marketing.  We will also need to apply for large grants to cover the new build and initial running costs.  As many of the international foundations that give start-up grants do so on a ‘matched-funding’ basis, we need people to believe in us first, and then your money can be doubled!</p>
<p>In return for your generosity you will get to become part of our project team.  Through our rewards you can keep up to date with all that we are doing, come visit us, and even learn a bit about Moroccan life and culture.</p>
If we don’t reach our entire goal, every penny will still be put in to getting this project going.  If we hit 100%, still give – every penny over the 100% will go into building and initial running costs.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are working under the banner of Gateway Medical Alliance in partnership with other local charities.  GMA has been both a registered Moroccan and US charity since 2002, and we have experience working in healthcare and long-term charity projects in Morocco from Nador on the North Coast, to Layounne way down south in the desert.  We feel that through our cumulative experiences and using all the partnerships we have built on the ground, this is an excellent time to embark on this ambitious adventure.  We truly believe that this will have an incredible impact on the lives that need it the most, and that we can be a catalyst to encourage others to do the same.  Our moto in Gateway is ""We don't give and live, we stay and serve.""  We hope that this project will give us another unique opportunity to stay and serve the people of Marrakech and surrounding regions, and the local health service and health professionals.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know that not all of you will be in a position to give, but if you aren’t we would still love it if you can help us.  Please let all your friends and relatives and contacts know about what we are doing, and don’t forget to share our link on your facebook / twitter / websites.</p>
<p>Also, if any of you think you may be in a position to offer any of your skills and expertise, we would love to hear from you.</p>
<p>Many thanks for all your support.</p>

In order to get the program going we need to raise the start-up funds.  This is where we are asking you and your families and your contacts, would you like to be a part of this project? Would you like to help us start something that could be a catalyst to significant improvement in many people’s lives?!


What We Need & What You Get
Initially, we need seed money.  We are hoping to raise enough to cover the costs of getting the ball rolling – including staff training, shipping donated medical equipment from Europe and the US, all the legal paperwork and set-up administration, architects fees, and advertising / marketing.  We will also need to apply for large grants to cover the new build and initial running costs.  As many of the international foundations that give start-up grants do so on a ‘matched-funding’ basis, we need people to believe in us first, and then your money can be doubled!
In return for your generosity you will get to become part of our project team.  Through our rewards you can keep up to date with all that we are doing, come visit us, and even learn a bit about Moroccan life and culture.
If we don’t reach our entire goal, every penny will still be put in to getting this project going.  If we hit 100%, still give – every penny over the 100% will go into building and initial running costs.

The Impact
We are working under the banner of Gateway Medical Alliance in partnership with other local charities.  GMA has been both a registered Moroccan and US charity since 2002, and we have experience working in healthcare and long-term charity projects in Morocco from Nador on the North Coast, to Layounne way down south in the desert.  We feel that through our cumulative experiences and using all the partnerships we have built on the ground, this is an excellent time to embark on this ambitious adventure.  We truly believe that this will have an incredible impact on the lives that need it the most, and that we can be a catalyst to encourage others to do the same.  Our moto in Gateway is ""We don't give and live, we stay and serve.""  We hope that this project will give us another unique opportunity to stay and serve the people of Marrakech and surrounding regions, and the local health service and health professionals.


Other Ways You Can Help
We know that not all of you will be in a position to give, but if you aren’t we would still love it if you can help us.  Please let all your friends and relatives and contacts know about what we are doing, and don’t forget to share our link on your facebook / twitter / websites.
Also, if any of you think you may be in a position to offer any of your skills and expertise, we would love to hear from you.
Many thanks for all your support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Applying 4Jointz® is quick and easy. People have achieved exceptional results by applying 3 times daily for a recommended 2 -3 months. The following  video demonstrates how to apply 4Jointz® properly to various joints. For best results:</p>
<ol>
<li>Apply the 4Jointz® cream on all sides of the joint.</li>
<li>Lightly massage it in gently with the tips of your fingers for a minute or two until completely absorbed; it is important to apply and massage into ALL sides of the joint until it is totally absorbed leaving the skin completely dry.</li>
<li>For sensitive skin it is recommended that you wash or wipe off the joint thoroughly (especially areas such as the soft skin behind the knee joint) with warm water or a damp cloth 10 minutes after application.</li>
<li>The two tubes in each pack are sufficient for three daily applications for one knee joint or both hands for one month.</li>
<li>Two or three additional packs may be required. Major weight bearing joints would require additional product.</li>
<li>Dark coloured towels are recommended to avoid possible staining should excess cream be left on the skin.</li>

<h2>FAQs</h2>
</div>
<h3>When can I buy 4JOINTZ®?</h3>
<p>4Jointz® is available and shipping now - benefit from our special launch discounts now. </p>
<h3>How soon can I expect to see results? </h3>
<p>Most people start to experience some beneficial changes within the first few days and some within the first couple of weeks. Since osteoarthritis severity can vary, so can the application period for 4Jointz®. On average, the standard protocol for application is 8 -12 weeks. Once optimal results have been obtained, a tapering maintenance program is recommended to once a day and then 3 times weekly down to as and when required.</p>
<h3>Are there any side effects?</h3>
<p>There are no known side effects other than in rare cases, some users with dry or sensitive skin could develop a mild skin rash. If skin rash occurs cease using the product for sometime before trying again in a limited area, washing the area with warm soapy water ten minutes after application.</p>
<h3>What is in 4Jointz® that makes it so effective? </h3>
<p>4Jointz® is a unique and powerful synergistic blend of standardized botanical extracts specifically produced for 4Jointz®. Unlike most treatments which are administered orally, 4JOINTZ® is applied topically (through the skin)  directly to the affected joints targeting the pain, and additional challenges associated with joint discomfort.</p>

Easy to Apply
Applying 4Jointz® is quick and easy. People have achieved exceptional results by applying 3 times daily for a recommended 2 -3 months. The following  video demonstrates how to apply 4Jointz® properly to various joints. For best results:

Apply the 4Jointz® cream on all sides of the joint.
Lightly massage it in gently with the tips of your fingers for a minute or two until completely absorbed; it is important to apply and massage into ALL sides of the joint until it is totally absorbed leaving the skin completely dry.
For sensitive skin it is recommended that you wash or wipe off the joint thoroughly (especially areas such as the soft skin behind the knee joint) with warm water or a damp cloth 10 minutes after application.
The two tubes in each pack are sufficient for three daily applications for one knee joint or both hands for one month.
Two or three additional packs may be required. Major weight bearing joints would require additional product.
Dark coloured towels are recommended to avoid possible staining should excess cream be left on the skin.

yes, I originally made this for the hair on my head.) then about 30 minutes later, my eyes would start to itch like crazy until I washed the product out.  So, I started using just beeswax and slowly added ingredients to the blend that would not irritate me.</p><p>2) <u>Ease of Use</u> - After I had developed the hair product, I realized just how time consuming it is to use balms.  Taking a long time grooming my beard or hair is not my idea of fun. If I was going to use this on a daily basis, I knew that it had to be faster and easier.  And, that is how the <strong>Beard Balm Brush</strong> was born.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479846800/u7b273q2csa5kve6m1yx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>Description of the Brush</h2><p>The <strong>Beard Balm Brush</strong> while simple in concept is nuanced in design.  There are 2 layers to the brush.</p><p>A first layer (the balm layer) is lighter in color and consists of A) nourishing carrier oils, like: jojoba, almond, hemp, apricot kernel, argan, coconut and, or others, B) butters such as shea butter, or cocoa butter, and C) powerful essential oils we are talking rosemary, peppermint, cedar wood, lemon, lavender amongst many others, and of course D) pure beeswax.  This first layer is creamier in nature and is a beard's delight.  It is present on the tines and face of the brush to promote an even and penetrating application.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483681688/vsucqun1kf6mhcdbrcmu.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The 2nd layer is 100% beeswax.  This layer is firmer in nature and is formed to make a handle.  There are times when the bearded user may want to apply just beeswax to their beard.  It can lock in moisture, and help with styling, providing a firmer hold - amongst other benefits.  Users wanting to apply pure beeswax can simply rub the handle on their beard or mustache.</p><p>Varieties of the brush that are currently available are: Paul Bunyan: for soothing, Treebeard: for growth, and Ann (just bland).</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483910671/fhgevxm7jerwwbk2imwn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>

But, if you want to see these brushes available in stores and online, now is the time to show us.  Show us by ordering one.</p><p>2) <strong>Protect Our Idea</strong> - At least a portion of the funds will go towards protecting the idea.  There currently is a patent pending.  This is important because without proper protection innovators can get steamrolled by giant corporations.</p><p>3) <strong>Invest in Manufacturing</strong> - Crowdfunding is a powerful tool for getting the funds needed to invest in production.  We will use funds to make more molds, develop packaging, and perhaps a physical space depending on several factors.  If a large quantity of our brushes are ordered for the Valentine's Day deadlines then additional equipment will be purchased immediately to keep up with demand.  We will also start to create inventory for order fulfillment.</p><p>4) <strong>Expand our Ideas</strong> - The<strong> Beard Balm Brush</strong> is just one of the products that we want to offer at By Odin's Beard!  We have a whole line of amazing products that we are going to offer and we can't wait to start working on them.  Your support will not only make this product possible but all of those future ones as well.</p><p>5) <strong>Protect Whimsy</strong> - More and more often crowdfunding projects are just turning into pre-sale sites for big companies with lots of resources like professional marketing teams, camera crews, and all that jazz.  I don't harbor any ill-will toward them.  But, one of the true beauties and I think original purposes of crowdfunding was to give hope to a girl or guy that had nothing but a cool idea for a fun project and two willing hands.  </p><p>That is what I have.</p><p>There is no camera team - so please forgive the editing - just occasionally my girlfriend or a buddy.    There is no marketing budget.  I am the marketing team, until I trick one of my friends into helping out.  But just because I don't have those things, it does not mean that this idea does not deserve a fair shot.  So, when you back this campaign, you are backing a person, and you are declaring boldly with your actions that these projects are important and that whimsy is still alive.</p><h2>The Risks</h2><p>The biggest risk that we face is not enough people finding out about our campaign.  The product is already production ready.  The initial tools and molds are being built as quickly as possible.  We have already had some great success at local markets and events. This project is ready to soar.  However, we can not succeed if people do not share our campaign.  So, please share the link, tell your friends, remember that this can be used for all hair not just beards (well...maybe not nose, hair, or belly hair - you know what? lets just stick to hair on our heads and not in any crevices).  And, get the word out.  If you know of any media outlets, or Facebook groups, that may be interested, please message me about them.</p><h3>Share it!</h3><p>If you think that this is a good idea, please share it.  If you hate the idea but know someone that may think that it is a good idea, please share it.  If you hate the idea, and you think that everyone you know will hate the idea, and possibly insult you for sharing it, please share it.  Our campaign lasts only 60 days.  After that, you may never see something like this again.</p><p><strong>Other lesser risks</strong>:</p><p>Sickness - When you have a 1 person crew, a sickness can really muck things up.  We will mitigate against this via communication.  If I were to get sick, I would notify backers immediately, stop taking any new time-sensitive perk backers on and coordinate a way for someone else to fulfill the existing orders.</p><p><strong>Supplier failure</strong> - I do not harvest the wax myself.  However, I do use only local Florida apiaries and there are several in the area.  So, this risk is minimal.</p><p><strong>Campaign error</strong> - There may be some sort of misunderstanding about the product, goals, or perks.  Again, communication will be key.  There is a link where potential backers can message me.  If you see something wrong, or don't understand something, or have a question please message me. You are welcome to contact me regarding any of those topics.</p><p>We will be adding appropriate stretch goals.  We only developed the product very recently.  But, we wanted to let people get their hands on the product in time for Valentine's Day.  So, please bear with us as we get our campaign together!</p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Fine Print</strong></h3><p><strong>A word of caution:</strong></p><p>You may be allergic to one, some, or all of the ingredients used in our brushes or packaging.  If you are, please do not use or handle the brushes.  If you don't know, please proceed with caution and be careful.  Essential Oils can be powerful.  Women pregnant or nursing should only handle or use after consulting a qualified health care professional.  My brushes and any claims made have not been tested and/or reviewed by the FDA.  </p><p>Also, for people that are not familiar with wax or balms, they tend to melt (see our note on shipping below).  It is probably not a good idea to leave the brush in your hot car or anywhere else that it might melt.  This may seem like common sense to some, but I don't want any sad beards because people did not know.  Lastly, dogs really like to eat wax.  This Beard Balm Brush is not intended for consumption by humans or dogs (but maybe werewolves) so be careful not leave it where your dog or friend may eat it.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Note(s) on Shipping</strong></p><p>Wax melts.  The brushes are wax.  We don't want the wax to melt before you get to use it.  So, we may wait to ship certain perks until the following Monday or Tuesday so as to not have people's brushes sitting in hot warehouses or delivery trucks over the weekends.  Please open your package when it arrives.  While the risk of melting is minimal in the winter months, we want to help anyone whose product is damaged.  However, we also don't want people abusing the system.  So, we will ask for pictures to be sent of the brush(es) within a reasonable time (like a day) of receiving their package.  Please don't let it sit on your doorstep in the sun for a week and then wonder what happened.</p><p>When we say that we will ship something the same day, we mean any same-day backer perks that are claimed before 2pm on any given day should go out that same shipping day.  Perks claimed after 2pm will be sent out on the next shipping day.  So, not on Sunday and possibly not on Thursday or Friday depending on expected heat etc.  Also, the shipping cost for the U.S. factors in a small amount of handling and packaging costs.  We will handle international shipping on a case by case basis.</p></div>","Recently Featured InThe Independent Alligator           The Palm Coast ObserverReview by George Bruno To Get a Brush sent out today*Choose the 2nd Wave Perk --> Great ForStyling Beards & Hair            Conditioning the Beard      Short or Long beardsLocking in Moisture                Feels & Smells Great           Reducing Waste   Unique Valentine's Gift          Beards Feel Fuller                Beards Look Fuller Quick Facts

Inc. is a BRUSH made out of beard balm.  The Beard Balm Brush is the simplest way to get beneficial beard balm onto a person's beard or other hair.  Plus, it feels & smells great.  Most other balms on the market require people to: 1) scrape the balm out of a tin,2) rub it in their hands *sticky*,3) apply it to the surface of their beard,4) brush or comb it down past the surface,5) then try to wash the balm off of your hands,6) notice how cool it is when the water beads up on your hands,7) wipe your eyes with a towel because you of course touched them with your sticky balm hands, and then8) call your boss to tell them that they are late to work because having a groomed beard takes ages.With the Beard Balm Brush you simply 1) brush your beard.  And, you2) still have to call your boss to explain you are late but this time it is because you were complimenting yourself in the mirror.People love our brushes for styling their beards, mustaches, and any hair in a way that helps to moisturize and condition it while adding a pleasing scent and feel.The tines of the brush give a gentle face massage when applying that users find tough to resist.It is difficult for me to describe here just how excited people get when they see and use our brushes.What is a Beard Balm??For the people that don't know, a beard balm is a concoction of luscious ingredients that is applied to a beard to help style, moisturize, and condition the beard along with other benefits.Our balms are especially alluring because they contain only natural ingredients, are purpose specific, and are great not just for the hair but the skin also.  In fact, we have users who are bald and apply the Beard Balm Brush directly to their scalp.Many other quality balms retail for $20+ BackgroundMeMy name is Jordan.  I studied Entrepreneurship at the University of Florida, and I am an inventor.  This project is important to me because, probably a lot like you, I love to think up different ideas for products, movies, and all sorts of projects to improve people's lives.Indiegogo connects me with people that are like minded, and who want to be part of the finished product.The BrushThere were 2 main motivators that lead me to develop this product.1)  Artificial Products aggravated me - I am not talking about they just made me upset - they physically aggravated me.  Whenever I would use any store bought hair products (yes, even the expensive ones & yes, I originally made this for the hair on my head.) then about 30 minutes later, my eyes would start to itch like crazy until I washed the product out.  So, I started using just beeswax and slowly added ingredients to the blend that would not irritate me.2) Ease of Use - After I had developed the hair product, I realized just how time consuming it is to use balms.  Taking a long time grooming my beard or hair is not my idea of fun. If I was going to use this on a daily basis, I knew that it had to be faster and easier.  And, that is how the Beard Balm Brush was born.Description of the BrushThe Beard Balm Brush while simple in concept is nuanced in design.  There are 2 layers to the brush.A first layer (the balm layer) is lighter in color and consists of A) nourishing carrier oils, like: jojoba, almond, hemp, apricot kernel, argan, coconut and, or others, B) butters such as shea butter, or cocoa butter, and C) powerful essential oils we are talking rosemary, peppermint, cedar wood, lemon, lavender amongst many others, and of course D) pure beeswax.  This first layer is creamier in nature and is a beard's delight.  It is present on the tines and face of the brush to promote an even and penetrating application.The 2nd layer is 100% beeswax.  This layer is firmer in nature and is formed to make a handle.  There are times when the bearded user may want to apply just beeswax to their beard.  It can lock in moisture, and help with styling, providing a firmer hold - amongst other benefits.  Users wanting to apply pure beeswax can simply rub the handle on their beard or mustache.Varieties of the brush that are currently available are: Paul Bunyan: for soothing, Treebeard: for growth, and Ann (just bland).   
Perk Central (or was it Central Perk?)Most of our perks have to do with receiving some number of brushes by a certain deadline.  Please read the perks carefully so that you know when you are scheduled to receive any given perk. The different quantity amounts are as follows: Single Brush (of your choice), 3-pack, and 1-year subscriptionThe delivery times are as follows: Now (see our note on shipping), in time for Valentine's Day, and November.Now: Early Adopters and 2nd wavers will get the product as soon as possible.  We have already started production to ensure that these really will go out ""now.""  For being so brave, these backers get a discount.Valentine's: Next come the Valentine's beards.  Our brushes make a mighty handsome gift for the romantic day, especially for guys that take pride in their facial hair. We will make every effort to ship out your brush in time for the big day.  Please be patient.  Please order ASAP if you want your brush on time.  And, make certain that the shipping information that you enter is complete and correct.  We will enforce cut off dates to help prevent any sad beards.Also, there is a chance that we may open more Valentine backer levels up.  We will most likely only do so after all of the first wave of Valentine's backers have been produced AND shipped.  The best time to order a Valentine's gift is now while you are thinking about it and before we hit our limits.  Long story made short - order as soon as possible.The GoalWe are trying to raise $30,000 with our campaign.  We will then use that money to make the best beard balm on the market.1) Determine the Demand - Honestly, I don't know if I will still be making these brushes 5 years from now.  They might just be a fun 1 time thing.  But, seeing how close we get to the $30,000 goal will tell us pretty directly how much of a demand exists.  We have already sold some brushes at local farmers markets and have received an overwhelming response.  So we are very optimistic. But, if you want to see these brushes available in stores and online, now is the time to show us.  Show us by ordering one.2) Protect Our Idea - At least a portion of the funds will go towards protecting the idea.  There currently is a patent pending.  This is important because without proper protection innovators can get steamrolled by giant corporations.3) Invest in Manufacturing - Crowdfunding is a powerful tool for getting the funds needed to invest in production.  We will use funds to make more molds, develop packaging, and perhaps a physical space depending on several factors.  If a large quantity of our brushes are ordered for the Valentine's Day deadlines then additional equipment will be purchased immediately to keep up with demand.  We will also start to create inventory for order fulfillment.4) Expand our Ideas - The Beard Balm Brush is just one of the products that we want to offer at By Odin's Beard!  We have a whole line of amazing products that we are going to offer and we can't wait to start working on them.  Your support will not only make this product possible but all of those future ones as well.5) Protect Whimsy - More and more often crowdfunding projects are just turning into pre-sale sites for big companies with lots of resources like professional marketing teams, camera crews, and all that jazz.  I don't harbor any ill-will toward them.  But, one of the true beauties and I think original purposes of crowdfunding was to give hope to a girl or guy that had nothing but a cool idea for a fun project and two willing hands.  That is what I have.There is no camera team - so please forgive the editing - just occasionally my girlfriend or a buddy.    There is no marketing budget.  I am the marketing team, until I trick one of my friends into helping out.  But just because I don't have those things, it does not mean that this idea does not deserve a fair shot.  So, when you back this campaign, you are backing a person, and you are declaring boldly with your actions that these projects are important and that whimsy is still alive.The RisksThe biggest risk that we face is not enough people finding out about our campaign.  The product is already production ready.  The initial tools and molds are being built as quickly as possible.  We have already had some great success at local markets and events. This project is ready to soar.  However, we can not succeed if people do not share our campaign.  So, please share the link, tell your friends, remember that this can be used for all hair not just beards (well...maybe not nose, hair, or belly hair - you know what? lets just stick to hair on our heads and not in any crevices).  And, get the word out.  If you know of any media outlets, or Facebook groups, that may be interested, please message me about them.Share it!If you think that this is a good idea, please share it.  If you hate the idea but know someone that may think that it is a good idea, please share it.  If you hate the idea, and you think that everyone you know will hate the idea, and possibly insult you for sharing it, please share it.  Our campaign lasts only 60 days.  After that, you may never see something like this again.Other lesser risks:Sickness - When you have a 1 person crew, a sickness can really muck things up.  We will mitigate against this via communication.  If I were to get sick, I would notify backers immediately, stop taking any new time-sensitive perk backers on and coordinate a way for someone else to fulfill the existing orders.Supplier failure - I do not harvest the wax myself.  However, I do use only local Florida apiaries and there are several in the area.  So, this risk is minimal.Campaign error - There may be some sort of misunderstanding about the product, goals, or perks.  Again, communication will be key.  There is a link where potential backers can message me.  If you see something wrong, or don't understand something, or have a question please message me. You are welcome to contact me regarding any of those topics.We will be adding appropriate stretch goals.  We only developed the product very recently.  But, we wanted to let people get their hands on the product in time for Valentine's Day.  So, please bear with us as we get our campaign together! The Fine PrintA word of caution:You may be allergic to one, some, or all of the ingredients used in our brushes or packaging.  If you are, please do not use or handle the brushes.  If you don't know, please proceed with caution and be careful.  Essential Oils can be powerful.  Women pregnant or nursing should only handle or use after consulting a qualified health care professional.  My brushes and any claims made have not been tested and/or reviewed by the FDA.  Also, for people that are not familiar with wax or balms, they tend to melt (see our note on shipping below).  It is probably not a good idea to leave the brush in your hot car or anywhere else that it might melt.  This may seem like common sense to some, but I don't want any sad beards because people did not know.  Lastly, dogs really like to eat wax.  This Beard Balm Brush is not intended for consumption by humans or dogs (but maybe werewolves) so be careful not leave it where your dog or friend may eat it. Note(s) on ShippingWax melts.  The brushes are wax.  We don't want the wax to melt before you get to use it.  So, we may wait to ship certain perks until the following Monday or Tuesday so as to not have people's brushes sitting in hot warehouses or delivery trucks over the weekends.  Please open your package when it arrives.  While the risk of melting is minimal in the winter months, we want to help anyone whose product is damaged.  However, we also don't want people abusing the system.  So, we will ask for pictures to be sent of the brush(es) within a reasonable time (like a day) of receiving their package.  Please don't let it sit on your doorstep in the sun for a week and then wonder what happened.When we say that we will ship something the same day, we mean any same-day backer perks that are claimed before 2pm on any given day should go out that same shipping day.  Perks claimed after 2pm will be sent out on the next shipping day.  So, not on Sunday and possibly not on Thursday or Friday depending on expected heat etc.  Also, the shipping cost for the U.S. factors in a small amount of handling and packaging costs.  We will handle international shipping on a case by case basis.",9.0,1,"2 Campaigns

1>Milking Action Effect
This action helps the underlying muscle push the blood back to the heart and lungs as with the soleus muscle on the back of the calf that has the task of pushing blood back up the leg, the second heart of the human body.

5> Faster Recovery
QUICKFIT’s unique silicone taping technology supports muscles improve blood circulation during physical activity. It helps the muscles recovery faster and reduces swelling. The improved blood circulation also helps relieve pain through the gate control theory.








Kinesiology tape is an that is used for treating athletic injuries and a variety of physical disorders. For the first decade after its introduction practitioners in Japan were the main users of the therapeutic kinesiology tape. By 1988 the tape had been adopted by Japanese Olympic and professional athletes before spreading across the world.
You would have noticed that more an more professional athletes use kinesiology taping improve their sporting performance, prevent injury and allow them to return to sport quicker.












If the adhesion faints or some of the
substances do not fall off after cleaning, using a dry cloth and alcohol wipe
the inner silicone and then you would able to see the adhesive silicone
condition as you’ve experienced at the first time you used them!




Our company has developed a pattern of Bio-Adhesive silicone independently developed by using medical silicone parts similar to the cohesion of the Kinesiology Taping and considering muscle mapping for effectiveness.














Taping as well as there is little parts that can be ordered alone, non-professionals is almost the same effect simply wear taping professionals such as physical therapists, trainers come by, while our products are parts that need to know well the muscles map obtain. 
Although muscle tape is disposable, Quickfit is a permanent product.



QUICKFIT was developed to provide the benefits of taping without the drawbacks or discomforts. 


QUICKFIT is easy to put on and the medically certified silicone that contacts with the wearer`s skin helps avoid any problems.









Our innovative calf sleeve is the result of five years of research and development and it delivers a number of significant functions through the use of 3.6g of adhesive silicone and the new biological technology of Kinesiology taping.







What is the W.A.S. Method?
W.A.S. Method is Wave Adhesive Silicongel Method. Inner adhesive silicone lifts up skin, helps lymph circulation, reduces fatigue and helps blood flow smoothly.






WAVEWEAR is a result of the combination of functional supporter and biological taping.The unique silicone taping technology supports muscles to improve blood circulation during physical activity. It helps the muscles recovery faster and reduces swelling.

It’s hard to get the value and the benefit out of your training if you don’t know if you are hitting your targets.</p><p><strong>Unique Challenges: </strong></p><ul>
<li>It's difficult, especially with large teams, for coaches to give time feedback to each of their swimmers (and swimmers don't always get their own times)</li>
<li>Swimmers without an on deck coach often have to time each other or get the best accuracy they can on their own with the pace clock</li>
<li>Stroke rate is difficult to measure (requires someone on deck with a stopwatch); coaches can only get stroke rate for one or two swimmers on occasion</li>
<li>If you don’t train it in practice your body and mind won’t know how to do it in a race</li>
</ul><p><strong>Firebelly Solution: </strong></p><ul>
<li>Firebelly provides the accuracy you need to know if you are hitting your targets or need to adjust (typically as accurate as stopwatch times)</li>
<li>Firebelly gives you a full picture of your swim – not just time, but also stroke count &amp; stroke rate so you can tell if you are matching your race goals in practice</li>

It’s hard to hear.  Pace clock math is tricky. Watches are hard to see and buttons are hard to find & press. “Doing the same thing & expecting different results is the definition of insanity”Swim performance feedback hasn’t changed much in the last 40 years. Continuing to improve requires doing things differently than the way they’ve always been done.“Other sports have feedback, why not swimming?”   Improvement requires immediate and consistent feedback.  In running, just flip your wrist.  In biking, peek at the handlebars.  In swimming?  Not so much. “I’m not here to go through the motions”Feedback keeps you honest and keeps you motivated. Feedback let’s you know if you’re on track or need to kick it up a notch.Help is on the way... Firebelly is a patent pending, first of its kind, bone conduction audio swim performance monitor. It measures every part of your swim - analyzing times, stroke count, and stroke rate for each length.  Firebelly is designed to improve your swimming with the most advanced analytics possible. 

Instant Feedback: Make real-time adjustments with instant performance feedback via bone conduction audio

Review Data: Analyze performance data, track your progress, and identify opportunities for improvement with the free smartphone app
Whether you are a beginner or an advanced swimmer, Firebelly was made for you.  It has no wires, no earbuds, no buttons to fumble with, no trying to see a small screen through foggy goggles.  Just hit a button, swim, and get crystal clear audio feedback to fuel better performance and help you achieve your swimming goals. Better Feedback.  Better Swimmers. *Requires purchase of Head Position feature  The free Firebelly App is available for iOS and Android.  The app uses Bluetooth to pair with the device in order to view workout data and program custom feedback modes.  Swim data that can be viewed in the app includes:
Total Time
Splits (per per 25, 50, 100)
Cumulative time
Stroke Count per length (SC)
Stroke Rate per length (SR)
 “No matter what mode I tune it to, it tells me the same thing: ‘Go Faster!’”“It provides a self-kick in the ass”“I don’t go to the pool to go through the motions. This alerts me if I’m falling off and gets me back on track.”“Helps me swim faster”“Keeps me honest”“For 20 swimmers you would need more than a dozen stopwatches to give all of the feedback that Firebelly can give those swimmers” Some Firebelly Fans:  Firebelly was designed to be as seamless to integrate with your workout as a pair of fins or a pull buoy.  With its easy to use design Firebelly can go from your equipment bag to ready to give swim feedback in less than 20 seconds.  Modes are set up to allow you to select the type of feedback you’d like to receive; e.g. time, stroke count, stroke rate, etc. The type of feedback can be selected based on the training goal of the set or workout.Firebelly's sensors collect over 800 data points each second and advanced algorithms are tuned to detect swimming-specific movements.  Bone conduction audio assures that you can hear the swimming feedback in the water by bypassing the ear canal and conducting audio through the cranial bones directly to your inner ear.  Swim performance data is stored on the device during your workout and can be viewed with the free mobile app.    Firebelly is easy to use and can unlock your potential and help you achieve your swimming goals. Time Firebelly automatically gives you highly accurate times while you swim.  You can select which splits you want to hear (e.g. each length or every other length for longer swims).  It also announces your total time at the end of each swim.  Hearing your splits and times lets you know if you are on track and helps you lock in your sense of pace.Stroke Count & Stroke RateStroke count and stroke rate are both important measures of swimming efficiency and are key to swimming fast.  Firebelly automatically detects the type of stroke you are swimming and counts the number of strokes you take per length.  Firebelly calculates and announces your stroke rate in either seconds per cycle or cycles per minute depending on your preference.  CadenceCadence mode on Firebelly provides stroke rate guidance with traditional tempo training ""beeps"" which, unlike a traditional tempo trainer, start & stop when you do.  Firebelly also provides advanced cadence features.  The device can be configured to provide cadence beeps only on the odd lengths allowing you to get a sense of swimming with the rate guidance and then trying to hold the rate on your own.  Another option provides a learning mode where Firebelly detects your stroke rate on the first length and automatically sets the cadence beeps for that rate for subsequent lengths.  This encourages you to hold an even tempo throughout your swim.  Cadence mode can be combined with stroke rate feedback to give you the rate guidance beeps while you swim and then announce your actual stroke rate after each length.  This allows you to know how close you were to your target.  Head Position*Ever watch an elite swimmer swim and notice that they just “look different” in the water?  This is partly because they have great body position - i.e. they keep their head low in the water and their body and feet high.  Proper ""head position"" leads to proper body position and proper body position improves your stroke efficiency which can improve your speed.It's difficult to feel and train yourself to keep proper head position.  Even if you know what to do, sometimes you just need a reminder.  Firebelly’s head position feature gives you immediate audio feedback on your head position every two strokes.  Additionally, you can setup a threshold mode that only turns on head position feedback when your head position exceeds a preset target.*An additional feature license must be purchased for the head position feature on Firebelly. The Firebelly App is a free mobile app for iOS and Android devices.  With the Firebelly App you can:
View detailed swim performance data from your workout, such as time per length, stroke count, and stroke rate
Email a spreadsheet with the detailed workout data to yourself, your coach, or others 
Configure feedback modes such as how often to hear split times, stroke count, stroke rate, distance, etc.
Manage the device, e.g. view the battery & memory levels, update the device software, and delete old workout data
 Masters Swimmers and TriathletesMasters swimmers and triathletes are motivated to improve their performance and want to stay motivated.  Often times they train on their own which can be challenging.Unique Challenges:
It's not easy to get performance feedback on your own
It's easy for your mind to wander without the help of a coach or teammates there to keep you focused on the swim
Consistency often suffers or you fall into a slow pace or settle for sub-par technique
It is difficult to improve stroke technique without feedback
Firebelly Solution:
Firebelly’s immediate feedback keeps you on track and makes you aware of key swim performance metrics such as split times, stroke rate, head position and more
Data is stored on the device and can be recalled later to track workouts, see improvements, and get motivated for change
Stored data can be shared with a coach for remotely coached athletes
Race Pace TrainingGoing race pace means hitting precise target times and specific stroke rates. It’s hard to get the value and the benefit out of your training if you don’t know if you are hitting your targets.Unique Challenges: 
It's difficult, especially with large teams, for coaches to give time feedback to each of their swimmers (and swimmers don't always get their own times)
Swimmers without an on deck coach often have to time each other or get the best accuracy they can on their own with the pace clock
Stroke rate is difficult to measure (requires someone on deck with a stopwatch); coaches can only get stroke rate for one or two swimmers on occasion
If you don’t train it in practice your body and mind won’t know how to do it in a race
Firebelly Solution: 
Firebelly provides the accuracy you need to know if you are hitting your targets or need to adjust (typically as accurate as stopwatch times)
Firebelly gives you a full picture of your swim – not just time, but also stroke count & stroke rate so you can tell if you are matching your race goals in practice
Firebelly detects your actual start so it doesn’t matter exactly when you leave
Test Set TrackingTest sets give swimmers the opportunity to measure their training and fitness in a practice setting.  By repeating a particular test set throughout the season, progress can be tracked and adjustments can be made to the swimmer's training.Unique Challenges: 
Tracking swimmer progress on test sets often requires juggling stop watches and log books (and water and paper are not compatible!)
Swimmers without an on deck coach often have to time each other or get the best accuracy they can using the pace clock
​Firebelly Solution: 
Firebelly allows you to track your performance so that you can compare a series of test set results, look for improvement, and determine if training adjustments are needed
Motivate your swimmers by comparing to past test set performance; analyze the data to identify areas for improvement
Firebelly tracks your workout data history enabling you to look for improvement opportunities
Example of test set data captured by Firebelly: Firebelly was designed to be as seamless and in the background to your swimming as your goggles or swimsuit.  Many people who use it say they forget it is there (until it talks to them!). Here’s a look at some specific differences from other swim technology products.Earbuds:Earbuds fall out or your ears fill up with water and then it sounds like the audio is, well, underwaterFirebelly uses bone conduction audio which is always crystal clear even when you have water in your earsPutting device on:Goggle strap mounts are confusing to use, don’t allow for quick on/off for a particular set, and don’t allow for device sharing in a team environmentFirebelly has no clips, straps, or wires; it easily slides into place – taking less than 20 seconds to go from gear bag to feedbackType of feedback:Humans process audio information up to 10x faster than visual informationFirebelly gives audio feedback; it is seamless to your workout and is easy to understand and use when you are swimming hardSwim watches:Swim watches require you to push buttons at the start & finish to get your times; the screen is difficult to see through foggy goggles and there is no feedback during your swimFirebelly gives feedback that is seamless to your workout; you get feedback without breaking stroke allowing you to practice the way you want to race, not how the tool makes you swimTempo training beeps:Tempo training beepers provide rate guidance but there is no feedback on how close or far you actually are from your target; additionally beeps continue even when you aren’t swimming which is distracting at best and can cause you to miss important feedback from your coachFirebelly provides tempo training beeps, but also gives you your actual times and actual stroke rates; its cadence mode starts & stops when you do and can be setup to turn on for even lengths and off for odd lengths to build muscle memory faster rather than becoming dependent on the device What's IncludedFirebelly swim performance monitorUSB charging cable Quick start guideSensors & Components3-axis accelerometer, gyrometer, and magnetometerOver 800 data points per second captured and analyzedBone conduction audio transducerBattery and PowerLithium-polymer rechargeable batteryBattery life up to 6 hours of swimming timeCharge time: 1 hour or less depending on charge levelWireless ConnectivityBluetooth Classic + Bluetooth LEWireless sync with iOS and Android smart devicesMemoryRecord detailed data about every length of every workout: split times, stroke count, stroke rate, total times, and distancesStore 1M+ yards/meters of workout dataWaterproof3 meters depthMaterialsCase is made of durable polycarbonate plasticButtons and goggle strap channel are made of flexible TPU plasticMobile App SoftwareFree Mobile App available for iOS and Android devicesBluetooth is used to retrieve stored workout data and configure custom modesFirebelly has already been produced in small quantities and is being used by swimmers and teams across the US.  With your help we will scale production and let more people in on the Firebelly phenomenon.Note that due to the certifications required to sell in each country, Firebelly is only available in the USA for now.  If you live outside the US and are interested in Firebelly, please contact us and we will note your interest and keep you up to date as to when we are able to obtain the certification required for your country.  The ""Father of Firebelly”I have been a lifelong competitive swimmer and have a great passion for the sport.  I also have been involved with technology for most of my life.  Firebelly represents a combination of those two passions.  More importantly developing Firebelly was a chance for me to give something back to the sport that I love.I truly hope that Firebelly is a useful training & coaching tool and helps you improve your swimming.  I also hope if you are new to swimming that Firebelly will deepen your enjoyment of the sport, or if you’ve been involved forever like me, that it adds a new dimension to your swimming and reinforces your passion.The Firebelly device you see today is the result of over 3 years of research and development.  I’m committed to delivering your Firebelly to you and hope it earns a place in your swim gear bag and becomes a regular & useful part of your swim training.- Matt Keller How do I get started?It's easy – just turn on your Firebelly device by pressing the top button once, put the device in place under your goggle strap or cap (wherever it is comfortable for you) and press the top button again to put the device into swim detect mode.  Then just swim and start hearing helpful performance feedback.Do I have to hit the stop button every time I stop at the wall?Nope! Once the unit is turned on simply hit the top button once to put the device into swim detect mode. Once in swim detect mode, all detection of starting, stopping, rest periods, etc. is automatic.How does Firebelly determine my time?Firebelly has the same type of advanced 3D sensors as a smartphone and can determine when you start, stop, and turn based on your motions.  It then determines the time between these swim events. Do I need to change the way I swim or turn?No. The device is designed to recognize the four competitive swim strokes and either flip or open turns. What is bone conduction audio?With bone conduction audio the sound bypasses your ear canal and is transmitted directly through your skull to your inner ear. In this way you can hear even when your ears are plugged with water. Is bone conduction audio safe?Yes. Bone conduction audio is actually the primary way in which you hear yourself talk and is why you think your voice sounds different when you listen to a recording of yourself. In some ways it is safer than audio through the ear canal where high volumes can damage your hearing. Is the Firebelly device compatible with my goggles?Very likely - the goggle strap slot is wide enough to accommodate most size goggle straps and either single or double straps.  You can also wear the device under your swim cap instead of under the goggle strap. How long does the battery last?A full charge will last 6+ hours of swimming time depending on the frequency of audio feedback (more frequent feedback reduces the battery life). Do I ever need to replace the battery?The Firebelly device has a rechargeable lithium polymer battery that is designed to last the lifetime of the device. How much swim data can the device store?The device can store over 1 million yards/meters worth of swim data. We hope you fill it up quickly! Does the device work with the app while swimming?The device is designed to be self-contained in the pool. Configured modes are quickly accessible with a couple of button clicks and all of the workout data is being stored on the device for later review from a smart app. Can the device be used by more than one person?Yes, although the workout data stored on the device and is displayed in the Firebelly App by date and time and not user. How do I view the swim workout data?The Firebelly App is used to view the workout data after the workout is completed.

<p>Our continuous commitment through
years and our technical skills led us to achieve the victory in the Formula SAE
Brazil in October 2014. Thanks to this award, Unibo Motorsport became the first
Italian team to win a race in the competition since its birth. UniBo Motorsport
is now working on the new car, the 4th built by the team, which will bring
great improvements in several aspects.</p>
<p><b>Car improvements for 2015</b></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The <b>vehicle division</b> is realizing one of
the most important car development since the birth of the team: for the first
time, there will be a carbon monocoque <u>chassis</u>, which replace the
previous steel tube trellis frame solution. There will be an important review
of the <u>suspension</u> system geometries, due to the introduction of
aerodynamics and the reduction of the rims diameter from 13 ‘’ to 10’’. All
these features result in many advantages; of course, the most relevant will be
a significant weight reduction,which is always a very important goal in a
motorsport competition.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Taking into
account the crucial role that <b>aerodynamics</b>
has in the car's performance, this year we decided to develop a <u>complete
aerodynamic package</u>, with front and rear wings specifically engineered to
provide the possibility to change the incidence of each profile. In this way,
it is possible to modify the vehicle attitude and meet the driver’s demands.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The team
produces all its <b>electronic systems</b>;
this feature makes UniBo Motorsport a unique team in its kind. Thanks to the
proven reliability and the efficiency of electronic systems developed during
2014 season, the activities of the Electronics division will be mainly focused
on refinements. In particular, our already powerful telemetry and data-logging
systems will be enhanced by the integration of an entirely <u>new Inertial
Measurement Unit,</u> which, combined with the use of a GPS receiver, will
allow us to track  the car position on
the circuit and to associate a location in space to the data collected.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>After an
accurate design, the <b>engine</b> will
finally be equipped with a new <u>gearbox</u>. The gearshift, properly spaced,
will have four gears and will allow, with a well-defined final transmission
ratio, the use of the engine in the maximum torque and power RPMs for most of
the track. Thanks to studies focused on the optimization of existing models,
the use of CFD simulations made possible the complete re- design of the intake
and exhaust systems, mutually “tuned”, in order to improve the already
excellent performance of the engine.</p>

I am looking to raise £7,000 (US$ 10,700)
which will pay for the treatment of these 7 patients
to have cardiac surgery in a reputable hospital in Vietnam. The success rate for these operations is around 95%. MTB Himalayas is rated as one of the
toughest mountain bike endurance events in the world and I have spent most of
the last 4 months training for the event. This has involved an indecent amount
of time in wearing spandex, 5am daily alarm calls and numerous near misses with
cows, bikes and buses in the congested Saigon traffic. 
It would be great if you could support this worthy cause
and help motivate me on the long bike climbs!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Optikal makes keeping your eyes healthy easier by delivering everything you need right to your doorstep! Every three months you'll get a new box of contact lens care supplies with your Optikal subscription. <strong>Hassle-free, with no stress.</strong> As a contact lens wearer with a busy lifestyle, it's easy to find yourself slacking off when it comes to proper contact lens care. It's hard enough to keep all of your care supplies stocked and even harder to remember when to replace your lenses and my cases.                                            </p>
<p>Getting careless about contact lens hygiene doesn't go without consequences. In fact, nearly one million doctor and hospital visits every year are due to bacterial eye infections caused by improper contact lens care.</p>

<h3>Did you know that breast and cervical cancer kill more women each year than does HIV/AIDS in the developing world?</h3>
<p>It's true.  And in Colombia, more than 6 out of every 10 women are diagnosed with cancer late- sometimes so late that their disease is too advanced to treat.  The medical system in Colombia is difficult to navigate, particularly for women who have limited income and limited literacy.</p>
<h3>Who is Partners for Cancer Care and Prevention?</h3>
<p>PFCCAP is a team of health professionals with a passion for improving access to high-quality breast and cervical cancer care.  We believe that no woman should die from cancer because of a fractured health system, and we know that with techincal support, providers across the health system can make a difference in women's health experiences!</p>
<p>In 2012, we teamed up with doctors, administrators and nurses at the oldest hospital in Colombia.  Together with patients and outside experts, our team is working to improve women's transit through the health system. </p>
<p>This brings us to why we need YOU!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
This year, PFCCAP has partnered with world-renown non-profit Nueva Vida, a support network for Latina women with cancer ( <a href=""http://www.nueva-vida.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nueva-vida.org</a> ).  Nueva Vida is a leading expert in patient navigation for the Latino community, and the Nueva Vida team has improved cancer programming in Virginia, Maryland, DC, Florida, Mexico and Argentina.</div>

<div>We have a chance to bring a leader from Nueva Vida ( <a href=""http://www.nueva-vida.org/members.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.nueva-vida.org/members.php</a> ) to Cali to work with medical experts on the ground.  With Nueva Vida's assistance, our team can help to redefine how the health system serves women with cancer in Colombia.  <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>Because both PFCCAP and Nueva Vida are non-profits, we need YOU to help bring Nueva Vida to Cali.  Your support will be used for the exclusive purpose of funding a flight to Cali so that we can run Nueva Vida for hospital staff and administration.  With any contribution that you make towards our goal of $2,500, we can bring Neuva Vida to Cali three times to run in-person trainings and to support hospital personnel and patients!</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
In our six-year history, we've brought free services to over 35,000 patients, and provided free surgical services to over 3,000 people.  With your help and with patient navigation, we will make a sustainable impact on cancer morbidity and mortality in Colombia!</div>

<p>We have been together for 6 years.  We met when Adam was stationed in Great Falls, Montana, serving in the Air Force and Amy was working in a home for troubled youths.  When Adam proposed, we discussed our future and decided that it would be best for our family if he left the military and found a job that provided more stability for raising a family.  Adam left the military and we married shortly after, and, with us both being in our 30's at the time, understood that if we wanted a family, it would be best to start then, so we began the journey that has brought us to this point. </p>
<p>The first year, we tried to get pregnant ""the old fashion way"", but it did not work.  We went to see the doctor and they recommended that we continuing trying the same way for six more months.  After that, the doctors put Amy on a regiment of pills to help with fertility.  We ran through three cycles of that, increasing the doses each time.  Then the doctors recommended a shot for Amy, which resulted in more failed attempts and higher costs.  </p>
<p>When artificial insemination was the next option, we began to get more excited, but that was another failure and more savings gone.  Along our journey, we have continued to pay the financial and emotional expense of paid procedures and diminished hopes, all in the name of having a family.  Last month, our doctors recommended that we try In Vitro Fertilization (IVF).  The doctors say that they aren't quite sure why we haven't gotten pregnant yet, but this significantly increases the likelihood that we will conceive.  Then they hit us with the price....at least $15,000, none of which is covered by insurance.</p>
<p>We looked at each other and were just sick to our stomachs.  The last few years have taken such a financial and emotional toll on us that we began to feel defeated.  But, like any good dreamers, we decided it is still worth pursuing, no matter the cost. We decided we will scrimp and save every penny until we get there.  We volunteered to be infertility study participants to help offset the costs, but the few studies that are being run, we do not qualify for. We have sold items on craigslist to raise funds.  We both work full time, and every extra dollar we had went to two things before, trying to get pregnant, and paying off our mortgage early, but we are putting the latter on hold to pay for the procedure.  </p>
<p><strong>How You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We have never asked anyone for money before, so this is very difficult and humbling for us. There is nothing we would not do to see each other happy and we are willing to discard our pride and ask for a contribution from strangers to help us make our dream come true.  </p>
<p>We are looking to raise $15,000 dollars by mid-January so that we can continue on our journey of experiencing one of life's greatest pleasures.  Even a $1 donation gets us closer than we are today. There are only two ways that we can ever show our gratitude for your donation.</p>
<p>First, by continuing to love and support one another and create a loving and nurturing environment to raise a child in; we vow to do that every day.  </p>
<p>Second, we would love to have a picture of you, so that we can build a photo album to show our child that they are loved so much that before they were even conceived, so many people supported them and wanted them to be in this world that they gave of themselves to see it happen.</p>
<p>Even if we fail to reach our goal of $15,000, any little bit collected will go a long way towards helping us pay for this procedure.  If we exceed our goal, the money left after the IVF procedure will be donated to Shriners Hospitals for Children, Erie, Pennsylvania to help pay the expenses of other families that have children with medical needs.</p>
<p>We understand how tough times are now, and if you cannot donate, perhaps you know someone who may, and if you could pass this on to them, we would be forever grateful. </p>

<p>Frank is a former successful restaurant owner with a passion for quality and customer satisfaction and has the entrepreneurial spirit needed to make sure this product is presented to the tailgating public. It is a ""why did'nt I think of that?"" idea. A father of 3 and an avid football fan. Look on you tube and see the real tailgating  fan reactions in  Chicago and NY to this product. Unscripted and genuine. It is a winner.<br/><br/>Brian is a retired NYPD detective and has been tailgating for over 20 years. He is also the father of 3 children.He has designed and enhanced this project with his skill and knowledge of what tailgaters need. Made the first prototype out of wood for conceptual purposes, but the weight almost killed us. Brian has several ideas to help make the tailgating experience more organized and easier in his head so this is just the start.<br/><br/>Craig is a successful account rep for a major corporation and is a father of 5 children. His work ethic and dedication to his family and clients is unmatched. His sales skills are what will make our project a guaranteed winner. He too is a football fan and immediately saw the value of this product.</p>
<p>We want to bring this product to market because we know it serves the casual and die hard tailgating sports fan by making their preparation for a good time with friends just that much easier.The funds raised will launch the product with tooling and manufacturing. We already have the market in line we just need to launch.</p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The $225,000 will get the tooling,production,packaging,and distribution of the first 3000 Gate Mates to the retailers and wholesalers that have expressed interest in or placed orders for the Gate Mate. Each Gate Mate will be fully stocked with all the esential tools and equipment needed for tailgaters, made of durable thick plastic for ease of use,lightweight patented insert. The ones produced for the perks and rewards will be   customized/personalized according to the specific teams or personal request. The funds raised short of the goal will get the tooling and production of the minimum first 1000 will be produced. </p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Gate Mate is a product that we have been working on for more than 24 months. It is the creation and idea of Brian Carey a retired NYPD detective and a long suffering Jet season ticket holder and fan. We have a patent pending on the design and the trademark is now registered. We have conducted extensive research and the feedback and response to the prototypes we have made and brought to various games to show tailgaters has given us the necessary market confidence to launch it for all tailgating fans to make getting organized for their games, BBQ's, concerts, and outdoor picnic events. We now have significant interest from a major race venue for 500 Gate Mates and we have to produce them as we are ready to go to market for all tailgaters. Bottom line is we need to raise the funds so we can get those first ones to market and take this working man's product to success. We understand the first ones we produce will be going to our supporters and we want to make them unique and special for the first several hundred supporters and we intend on making 3000 to sell and continue to grow the product for all NASCAR,NCAA and pro football markets. It transcends several markets, including corporate pic-nics, backyard BBQ's, camping enthusiasts.</p>
<p>We understand that not everyone can go the full contribution to get a Gate Mate. We would like to offer those who can contribute something to our launch a discount on the purchase of Gate Mate products.

<br/><h1>Zoi for everyone</h1>
<div>Running as an immediate experience is not about miles, kilometers or how many calories you burn. Running is more about movement, using your muscles to take your body through space, feeling your strides on the ground and your heart pumping. We make no compromises in measuring and honing that experience for you.</div>
<p>
Zoi is a fascinating wearable product for all recreational runners.  It is something never seen in market before. Zoi measures the running motion, evaluates running technique and
skills, and guides towards better running economy and a healthier gait.</p>
<p>Zoi is perfect for runners who are
passionate about</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>improving their performance,</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>preventing overuse injuries,</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>achieving their goals with smart coaching,</p>
<p>•<span> 
</span>sharing their progress and highlights with their friends,</p>
<p>•<span>  </span>being forerunners on knowledge based training
through Zoi Cloud, and</p>
<p>•<span>  </span>finding their running beat</p>
<p></p>
<p>Zoi is a combination of sophisticated sensor technology and smart refinement of the data produced by it. While two state-of-the-art sensors precisely capture the movement of your feet and upper body, the mobile application analyzes the data to give both casual and advanced runners actionable advice for enjoyable, injury-free running.</p>
<p>The no-compromise design philosophy behind Zoi is something previously seen only in scientific applications costing top dollar. We are passionate about running and improving it, so for us there is no other way. Now is your chance to help us realize our vision of affordable technology to support our runner’s instincts.</p>

<h2>Zoi cornerstones</h2>
<p><b>Running technique evaluation</b></p>
<p>Zoi gives runners exact information about their running characteristics, running economy and injury risks. Zoi measures movement untiringly and continuously follows your progress and gives useful information. Are you heel-striking, Are you overstriding,  how long strides are, how well you move in balance, how much you are bouncing. Zoi is your personal running lab that works in every environment.</p>
<p><b>Real-time smart coaching</b></p>
<p>Zoi is your personal running coach. She takes in all the available data about your gait, body movement and heart rate, then analyses it and guides you accordingly. It also asks you about your mood and problems.  She advises you towards economical and injury-free running style.</p>
<p><b>Enjoyment driven</b></p>
<p>We believe everyone should enjoy running. Zoi introduces smart and joyful exercises that strengthen your body. Zoi application includes training plans and technique cues which help you to find your optimal running beat. Everyone can achieve the flow of joyful running. Out of this ideology, Zoi was born.</p>
<div><br/></div>
<div><h2><b>Zoi sensors</b></h2></div>
<div>
<p><b>Zoi</b> sensors are wireless, lightweight and they mount to the laces of your running shoe and to the chest strap. This unique set-up makes Zoi to gather more complete biomechanics data than any other wearable solution.</p>
<p>The sensors have two operating modes. In Connected mode, sensors are connected to application in real-time. In Standalone mode, the sensors store your exercise and you are able to study the results afterwards.</p>
<p>The sensor can store exercises up to 10 hours and its operating time with one charge is 10+ hours.</p>

<h2><b>Why Zoi</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Running is a very popular sport, but still huge number of runners suffers
from overuse injuries. This is mostly due to wrong training (too early, too much)
and poor running skills and technique. That all leads to pain and un-motivation.</p>
<p>We love running. We want everyone to enjoy running. Everyone deserves a personal
coach. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We want technology to work seamlessly. Good trainer knows you personally, and so does Zoi. </span></p>
<p>The latest technology lets us make incredible things that were not
available in the past. We put extra effort to ensure that technology gives our customers great experiences. In addition, we want to give runners the whole benefit of it all. By
collecting information on running, we can learn amazing things. For example, how
people are running in different locations, what running shoes are most
injury-free, what drives running economy and causes overuse injuries. In this effort we
collaborate with the scientists – both big data and biomechanics.</p>
<h2><b>Zoi team</b></h2>
<p>The history of Zoi roots back to
2010 when Tommi was choosing new running shoes in local
sport store. The physiotherapist helping him recognized issues in
alignment of his feet. Based on this experience, Tommi soon realized how
important role running technique and skills play in running economy and injury
prevention.  </p>
<p>Runteq was founded in 2012 to
develop automatic running technique assessment. The team worked hard to bring
the first non-camera based product available for its first customers. Finnish
Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation supported the endeavor. </p>
<p>Our first product (RunLab Coach)
received great feedback from scientists, fitness testing centers and coaches in
Finland, UK and Ireland. But most importantly, the interest among the consumers
was even higher.</p>
<p>Today, team has grown, but the
core vision has stayed intact. We all strive to make Zoi available for everyone. Runteq is closely collaborating with Finnish electronics design house
iProtoXi who bring their competence in wireless electronics and manufacturing.
Evident Solutions brings supreme software development to the Zoi team.</p>

<h3><em>you know yoga changes lives because it changed yours</em></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>At Yoga Outreach we think everyone should have the opportunity to experience the wonderful benefits of yoga. What started out as a labour of love in the 90's has continued today as a passion for compassion.</p>
<p>Yoga Outreach partners with yoga instructors, community organizations, social service agencies, and correctional facilities to provide mindfulness-based yoga programming for our community’s most underserved members.</p>
<p>Donna Farhi said, “No matter who we are or how long we have been entrenched in self-defeating behaviours, through daily Yoga practice we can become present to our own fundamental goodness and the goodness of others.”</p>
<p>This is what Yoga Outreach offers each person no matter who they are or what their circumstance is. When a YO teacher goes into the Vancouver Woman’s Health Collective in Vancouver’s downtown Eastside to teach a weekly class we know it makes a difference. We know this because the VWHC Director has told us that some of the women say they don’t drink the night before they come to yoga, that they look out for each other, and that they look forward to seeing one another. <em>Yoga Outreach provides human connection and affirmation in a world where increasingly we have none.</em> </p>
<p><span>The day to day work of keeping Yoga Outreach not only running, but growing, can sometimes be a strangely disconnected experience. We do a lot of number crunching, make phone calls, and answer a seemingly un-ending barrage of emails. In this never-ending parade of small tasks it’s easy to lose sight of the big picture: Yoga Outreach exists to serve others. That is why we are here. </span></p>
<div>
<p><span>The fact of the matter is too many great organizations go down because they can’t find the money to go on. Your contribution can keep us moving towards a day when everyone has access to yoga regardless of their financial, physical, or emotional means. </span></p>
</div>
<p>We have some fantastic perks aside from the warm fuzzy feelings you will have from joining our community. Our world famous Rhubarb Coffee Cake recipe is worth its weight in gold! We have some great new t-shirts, our signature scent as well as discounts and passes to upcoming yoga workshops, trainings, and events.</p>
<h3>Here's what students are saying about their YO classes</h3>
<p><span>Students at the Vancouver Women’s Health Collective (VWHC)– <br/></span><span>“Having yoga in the DTES [Downtown Eastside] for women that is accessible and free is saving my life. My physical well-being is so enhanced with the stretch, strength and relaxation. When I feel better my outlook is more positive and I can struggle with being a single mom on welfare with enhanced vigour. It's cool to meet other women too!” </span></p>
<p><span>“This damaged soul finds healing in a safe, calm environment. Enriching my life and building strength from the acceptance and kindness from the teacher and the group. Thank you.”</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>About our students</h3>
<p>Since 1996 we have facilitated approximately 17,000 yoga classes at no cost to our students. As students of yoga ourselves we came to love the way yoga made us feel and we wanted to share that with everyone! Yoga Outreach was born out of that and we remain committed to making yoga as accessible as possible. </p>
<p>When asked if their YO yoga class left them with an overall good feeling 92% of students said YES! When asked if they would recommend their YO yoga class to others 95% of students said YES!</p>
<p>Our students have told us that they would not be able to attend yoga classes without YO. Simply removing the cost is not enough, our students face other challenges in accessing mainstream yoga classes. Many of our students have experienced violence, have mental health challenges, or are struggling with addiciton and they need teachers that recognize and understand this.

</div></div>","you know yoga changes lives because it changed yours


At Yoga Outreach we think everyone should have the opportunity to experience the wonderful benefits of yoga. What started out as a labour of love in the 90's has continued today as a passion for compassion.
Yoga Outreach partners with yoga instructors, community organizations, social service agencies, and correctional facilities to provide mindfulness-based yoga programming for our community’s most underserved members.
Donna Farhi said, “No matter who we are or how long we have been entrenched in self-defeating behaviours, through daily Yoga practice we can become present to our own fundamental goodness and the goodness of others.”
This is what Yoga Outreach offers each person no matter who they are or what their circumstance is. When a YO teacher goes into the Vancouver Woman’s Health Collective in Vancouver’s downtown Eastside to teach a weekly class we know it makes a difference. We know this because the VWHC Director has told us that some of the women say they don’t drink the night before they come to yoga, that they look out for each other, and that they look forward to seeing one another. Yoga Outreach provides human connection and affirmation in a world where increasingly we have none. 
The day to day work of keeping Yoga Outreach not only running, but growing, can sometimes be a strangely disconnected experience. We do a lot of number crunching, make phone calls, and answer a seemingly un-ending barrage of emails. In this never-ending parade of small tasks it’s easy to lose sight of the big picture: Yoga Outreach exists to serve others. That is why we are here. 

The fact of the matter is too many great organizations go down because they can’t find the money to go on. Your contribution can keep us moving towards a day when everyone has access to yoga regardless of their financial, physical, or emotional means. 

We have some fantastic perks aside from the warm fuzzy feelings you will have from joining our community. Our world famous Rhubarb Coffee Cake recipe is worth its weight in gold! We have some great new t-shirts, our signature scent as well as discounts and passes to upcoming yoga workshops, trainings, and events.
Here's what students are saying about their YO classes
Students at the Vancouver Women’s Health Collective (VWHC)– “Having yoga in the DTES [Downtown Eastside] for women that is accessible and free is saving my life. My physical well-being is so enhanced with the stretch, strength and relaxation. When I feel better my outlook is more positive and I can struggle with being a single mom on welfare with enhanced vigour. It's cool to meet other women too!” 
“This damaged soul finds healing in a safe, calm environment. Enriching my life and building strength from the acceptance and kindness from the teacher and the group. Thank you.”


About our students
Since 1996 we have facilitated approximately 17,000 yoga classes at no cost to our students. As students of yoga ourselves we came to love the way yoga made us feel and we wanted to share that with everyone! Yoga Outreach was born out of that and we remain committed to making yoga as accessible as possible. 
When asked if their YO yoga class left them with an overall good feeling 92% of students said YES! When asked if they would recommend their YO yoga class to others 95% of students said YES!
Our students have told us that they would not be able to attend yoga classes without YO. Simply removing the cost is not enough, our students face other challenges in accessing mainstream yoga classes. Many of our students have experienced violence, have mental health challenges, or are struggling with addiciton and they need teachers that recognize and understand this. They need teachers who are able to share yoga with them in a way that is safe, supportive, and nurturing. Things that you are I might experience positively like having a teacher adjust your posture or call you by name in class can be down right terrifying to someone who has experienced abuse. 
What YO creates is a safe space for people from all walks of life to experience the positive and healing benfits of yoga - we meet them where they are at and support them to find themselves on the mat.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>
Going Back home was formed after several parents of long term hospitalised children realised that there was no support services for the parents or care givers of these patients when it came time to Go Home. The group was formed to help raise awareness of the needs of caregivers and to provide products and services to assist in the transition from Hospital life to the real world. 
</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Transition from hospital life to the real world can be daunting. We have already met several other parents who financially and emotionally find it hard to transition back to normality - IF it can ever happen again. Going Back Home has been set up to fill the gap and provide a helping hand where possible. We have a large number of volunteers already waiting to be able to assist where required. Going Back Home has designed a series of Carer Folders and additional methods to assist the care giver when it comes to dealing with the myriad of medical, financial, social work and social security paperwork that is generated after such an event. Our main goal is simply to get the folders prepared ready for purchase and/or gifting to care givers where possible. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Going Back Home needs to purchase materials and printing to make the Folders available. All donations will be going into the purchase of the folders. Once the folders are completed  we will be starting distribution to those in need.  For those who donate we will be offering a position in our Founding Funding members page if you choose to take it up. These positions will be split into various levels depending on donation made. Once you have purchased this place it will remain there for a period of no less than 2 year from the initial date.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Going Back Home will need to have plenty of Word of Mouth advertising as well as we will be needing locals who are willing to assist with the compilation, making and distribution of the Folders. </p>

<p>Thanks for checking up on us! My name is Matthew Miner and I am the co-founder of Bosky. Outside of being an avid fan of the outdoors, my passion towards Bosky stems from my career focus. I am currently studying renewable material science at <b>Oregon State University</b> and am about to kick off my senior year! Call me overeager, but I just couldn't wait until graduating to start applying what I've learned. </p>
<p>The idea for Bosky grew from a discussion with one of my best friends, and Bosky co-founder, Alex Cruft. Despite living in the environmentally conscious city of<b> Portland, Oregon</b>, we both noticed substantial shortcomings in the green movement. We noticed how prevalent plastic has become in our society, along with the current consumerism fueling its production. A heavy emphasis has been placed on recycling, however, less is mentioned of making plastic products out of alternative materials. For this reason, <b>we made it our mission to reduce plastic consumption and demonstrate that superior products can be made with renewable, eco-friendly materials</b>. Over the last year, we have put our idea into action. Currently, Bosky boasts a line of renewable sunglasses made exclusively out of exotic hardwoods. To make this use of alternative materials more sustainable, we have partnered with Trees for the Future foundation. For each pair of sunglasses sold, a tree is planted!</p>
<p>The frame of the renewable goggles will be produced using a specially engineered<b> bioplastic that is based on 60% renewable plant materials</b>, specifically castor bean oil. Castor oil plastic is significantly more durable and longer-lasting than petroleum-based plastics. An added benefit of castor bean oil is that it does not interfere with food sources as compared to corn plastics. This bioplastic will outperform standard petroleum-based plastics used in all other snowboard goggles. The reason for this is due to its better flexibility at lower temperatures, something every snowboarder and skier knows is important. Another source of innovation, the thermal ventilation system in the goggles will be made from a <b>100% hemp fiber textile</b> which is not only renewable, but UV resistant, far stronger, and longer lasting than polyurethane foam in all other goggles. With a little help, we will be able to accomplish something never done before, and continue to spread our ideals of original renewable optics! </p>

Raised by both parents with a very tight bond. So about a year ago my mother was diagnosed with Stage IV Lung Cancer, and ever since then nothing has been the same at all. I've never seen my mother struggle so much in life until now. She has good days and bad days, but recently things haven't been looking too good.  The past year was very difficult for her as well as the rest of the family and loved ones. Chemotherapy, radiation as well as other treatments have really took a toll on her. Weekly trips back and forth from hospitals in Fitchburg, Leominster and Worcester. But she's a very strong woman and I love her for that. She means the world to me, and all I ever wanted to do was make her proud and keep her safe.My parents never had a legitimate wedding before or after they had me, so I wanted to do something for them before anything tragic might happen. I know it would make her extremely happy, and I know it would make a huge impact on everything overall. They've always wanted to have one, but unfortunately money and times are and have been tight. I figured that any help would be an excellent start. But If the limit couldn't be reached, than the money will be donated to a Cancer Society of my family's choice, and or to medical bills. If however you cannot make a donation.. Please spread the word and try to help a family in need. Please and Thank You! God Bless!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a 28 year old female with Cerebral Palsy. I received a Bachelors and a Masters from the University of New Orleans in Sociology. I require 24 hour personal care attendant services through the Louisiana NOW Wavier to live and work independently. I am currently employed as an online Sociology instructor for Texas A&amp;M Central. I was accepted into the University of Illinois at Chicago's Ph.D. in Disability Studies Program for Fall 2012. However, I had to defer my acceptance until Fall 2013 because my request to utilize my services while in school was denied by the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospital. I have been denied my dream. </p>
<p>I have deferred my acceptance until Fall 2013 (August 2013). If I am unable to move to Chicago by August 2013. I will have to reapply and my education will bev put on hold yet again.

When we dug deep into the realms of neuropathy we realized that a method called active compression could be a wonderful solution to this. That took us down the route of looking at active compression and the technologies we could use to achieve this. </p><p>In our journey, the more we researched, the more we realized that active compression could not only offer a potential solution for diabetic neuropathy, but it had far more expansive potential therapeutic effects.

Check out our interview with Digital Trends.


 What Is Active Compression?Active leg compression is a form of compression that mimics natural muscle contractions in your calves. It helps improve circulation, increase cellular oxygen supply, and stimulate tissue repair.Active Compression helps:By compressing your legs, you encourage circulation of blood where it needs the most support. This, in turn, can help reduce swelling and usher in fresh blood, nutrients, and lymphatic fluid to your legs to help accelerate healing and recovery.Supporting Circulation In Your LegsDue to gravity, your legs usually have the worst circulation in your body- especially if you’re standing or sitting all day. Without active circulation through your calves, blood will pool at your feet - resulting in swelling and pain.When your muscle pump remains inactive, you risk blood pooling, and inhibit circulation throughout your body (the blood in your feet is the same blood that is circulated through your heart and to your brain).This is why we focus on actively compressing your legs to help get that blood moving!The Benefits of Improved CirculationActive Compression is an effective way to improve circulation, flush lactic acid, and increase oxygenation to muscle tissues to get you back on your feet faster. Get more oxygen throughout your body and higher performance.Improved Circulation can help:Passive Compression Just Doesn’t Cut ItYou’ve likely encountered other compression tools such as socks, wraps, and sleeves.The main issue with these passive compression accessories is that they don’t do much when you’re in an office, plane, car, kitchen - anywhere you’ll be sitting or standing.Passive compression only provides support when you are using your muscle pump. In other words, they only work when you’re ALREADY active - in a workout or on a walk/run.This is where Active Compression comes in.Active Compression actively MIMICS the action of the calf muscle pump without you needing to do anything!The Beauty of Active CompressionThe Problem With Other DevicesCurrent devices are ineffective or only accessible to professional athletes. These devices end up being bulky, covered in wires and hoses, not portable, and extremely expensive.They can have poor compression patterns that don’t use active compression, don’t match the muscle pump, or, worse, do more harm than good by pushing blood in the wrong direction.
Bulky - complicated, heavy, not portable
Expensive - reserved for high-paying professional athletes
Poor Compression Pattern - dangerous and harmful
The Power of SPRYNG™Using our patent-pending WaveTech compression pattern, SPRYNG™ effectively mimics your skeletal muscle pump - which means it is the best way to help enhance your body’s natural circulatory flow.This means you get safe, powerful, and effective active compression that compliments your body’s natural rhythm. No reverse flow (which can get dangerous) - SPRYNG™ makes sure your blood goes where it needs to go, the way it’s supposed to go, faster and more effectively.Patent-Pending WaveTech PatternOur unique patent-pending compression patterns actively and gently push your blood in the right direction and work with the natural flow of your body.                  They do this by mimicking the skeletal muscle pump that acts as a second heart - aiding the return of blood to your core to help reduce swelling and muscle injury.You’ll feel your blood circulating through your calves, up your thighs, and through your body fluidly and powerfully. Relax as your body enters accelerated flow.Strategic Pneumatic PressureWe compartmentalized the compression areas to three strategic parts of your calf to make sure we help maximize blood flow and the efficacy of the compression.Feel the powerful massage hit just the right spots.Targeted Compression Affects Your Whole LegNot just for your calves! Improving circulation at the lower extremities naturally helps push blood upwards through your thighs towards the heart. As a result, the lower extremities of your legs are one of the best targets to help improve blood circulation.Synchronized CompressionSPRYNG™ isn’t just synced with your naturally occurring muscle pump and blood circulation, it syncs with its adjoining pair automatically.Through the use of Infrared technology, each SPRYNG™ device connects and syncs with its pair to give you dual active compression.The patterns in each leg will be synced up and matched, so you have a cohesive and comfortable session in complete harmony. 3 Levels Of IntensitySimply press the intensity button to increase or decrease the level of compression intensity you want.Internal sensors ensure SPRYNG™ never pushes beyond your comfort, so you know you’re in good hands!Choose between two powerful compression patterns:3 Steps To SetupUntethered PerformanceSPRYNG™ is completely wireless and tubeless. You can use it in whatever position and any situation. Simply strap it on and let it run! There’s nothing to plug in or connect - a fully untethered experience.Compact & PortableNot only is SPRYNG™ wireless, it’s also small and compact. You can easily fit it in your bag and even use it on a plane.Through its unique design and patent-pending compression pattern, you’ll get improved circulation throughout your entire leg with just a small area of compression. The device only wraps around your ankle and calves, so you can remain totally mobile without clunkiness or constraint.Feels AmazingDid we mention? SPRYNG™ feels absolutely incredible! We honestly can’t talk about it enough. The pneumatic compression is like a a deep tissue leg massage that helps circulate your blood, pull out pain, and relax your entire body.Check out what users had to say about it!Long-Lasting BatterySPRYNG™ has a powerful battery that can give up to 2.5 hours of active use. That means you can have up to 10 sessions before needing a recharge.The device can be easily recharged via micro-usb cable.One Size Fits MostWhether you have large legs or tiny calves, SPRYNG™ has you in mind. We used a one-size-fits-most model using velcro straps to attach the device.The straps are fully adjustable, so you can switch sizes quickly and easily.Machine-WashableSweaty legs? Not a problem! The inner layer of SPRYNG™ can be removed and is 100% machine washable.Sustainable & AffordablePneumatic active compression used to be reserved only for professional athletes, universities, and the uber-rich. Now, we’re bringing its performance enhancing powers to you for a tenth of the cost (that’s 90% off)!You’ll not just be getting the same effects, but you’ll have it better, faster, and much more portable than the rest.Throughout this process, we were heavily influenced and inspired by video games. We loved the artwork, design, and mechanics found in these fictional, digital worlds and wanted to create a regeneration tool like those seen in games.With SPRYNG™, we believe we got pretty close. Naturally, we felt our outer layer skin designs should reflect this achievement. So we designed our outer skins to have four unique colorways that draw homage to our favorite video game experiences. SPRYNG™ is your real-life power boost and looks it too!SPRYNG™ isn’t just for athletes! If you stand or sit a lot, you need to get blood circulating to stay healthy, relieve tired and achy legs, and help increase cognitive performance! This means Spryng is perfect for everyone!From DJs to Moms to CEOs and gamers, get higher level performance across all areas of life!   

We want our backers to have a great experience with SPRYNG™. We are doing everything in our power - from sourcing the best quality materials to rigorous quality control processes - to ensure that we would get the best product into the hands of our backers. As we are just starting up and offering SPRYNG™ at highly discounted prices on Kickstarter, we are only able to accept returns due to a manufacturing defect.
Several years ago our team was focused on looking at one significant leg condition – diabetic neuropathy. When we dug deep into the realms of neuropathy we realized that a method called active compression could be a wonderful solution to this. That took us down the route of looking at active compression and the technologies we could use to achieve this. In our journey, the more we researched, the more we realized that active compression could not only offer a potential solution for diabetic neuropathy, but it had far more expansive potential therapeutic effects. It was something that could benefit tens of millions of people all over the world. Sadly, a lot of the active compression solutions that were out there were either very very expensive or were used in hospital settings that were inaccessible for many people. We wanted to do it differently. We wanted to bring active compression to everyone out there. Hence, we created Spryng! Through Spryng, we want to bring the benefits of active compression in an easy to use and affordable manifestation to all of you!",71.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Projects for Underserved Communities (PUC) is a course at The University of Texas at Austin that brings together social work and engineering students to collaborate on analyzing, designing, and implementing sustainable projects that have a high impact in underdeveloped communities across the globe.</p>
<p>The Mangiang Water Initiative is focused on implementing a solar water pumping system in the community of Mangiang, Papua New Guinea. Mangiang is a close-knit community of about 600 people. Currently, the villagers get the water they use for cleaning and bathing by digging holes by the side of local river, and carrying the water back in heavy yellow buckets. Water in the river has possible exposure to pesticide contanimated runoff from farms upstream and is far from meeting quality standards for sanitary bathing and drinking water. </p>
<p>In the village there are three wells and a borehole, sources of untested water currently used for drinking. Villagers are able to haul buckets of water out of one of the wells for drinking, and the other three sources lie defunct. In addition, the village is too remote to be connected to a power grid. Our team will address this issue by cleaning out their usable well, purifying the water, installing a submersible DC pump that is powered by a photovoltaic array, and implement a gravity-powered distribution system in a central location, creating easy, reliable access to clean water for 20+ years. </p>
<p>The importance of clean drinking water cannot be understressed. Unsanitary drinking water poses a variety of health concerns. By fixing this well, we would be reducing the community's exposure to waterborne illnesses. Access to clean water will be fufilling a fundamental need for the entire community.</p>
<p>Your involvement with this project will make a huge impact on the lives of the people of Mangiang. Something as simple as access to clean water will cause a marked increase in the standard of living for this community. Every contribution helps us get closer to our goal -- every bit gets us closer to making a difference!</p>
<h3>How is Mangiang Involved?</h3>
<p>To make this project sustainable, community members of Mangiang will actively participate in the construction of the solar water pumping system, and take charge of managing the distribution of water and continued upkeep. During our stay in Papua New Guinea, our team will assist the community in forming and organizing a Water Users Committee, which will be responsible for guarding and maintaining the solar water pumping system. This committee will be composed completely from the men and women of Mangiang. We will also be holding educational classes and activities to teach Mangiang on the importance of clean water and how solar energy and the pumping system works.</p>
<p>We have been working closely with the Appropriate Technology and Community Development Institute (ATCDI) at The University of Technology in Lae, Papua New Guinea to collaborate with Mangiang on this project. They are looking forward to seeing us there this summer, and we can't wait to meet them!</p>
<p>All materials, tools, and labor for this project will be purchased or hired in-country. That means everything is locally sourced in Papua New Guinea to support local business.</p>

I work two jobs, I work through the pain because I have no choice. By the time I get home I am in pain and am unable to function like a normal mother and wife. I will do anything for my family and they are the sole reason I have not given up. It would be amazing if I could give up one of my jobs for a while to focus more on treatment and research for my disease. Please google the disease and see for yourself. I truly appreciate any help I can get and thank you for reading.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

After 10 months of high dose chemo therapy and a surgery, our son became an above knee amputee due to bone cancer in his right tibia. Though he won't always be a cancer patient, he will always be an amputee.</p>
<p>We have been blessed with having decent health insurance due to my husband being active duty and serving in the US Air Force for 21 years. Now retired and not able to find a job and 70% disabled, it's becoming harder for us to afford to pay out of pocket cost for new prosthetic legs as Ty continues to grow.</p>
<p>Right now Ty is learning to play Ice Hockey and he wants to play standing up, not in a sled. We just found out that due to the new health care laws our insurance provider will loose it's contract at the end of the month, which means our out of pocket cost for Prosthetics will skyrocket. Our Co-Pays could go from 12 dollars a visit to 300. Ty has to have many fittings with his Prosthetist in order to have a leg that will allow him to be independent.</p>
<p>For Ty, being able to play Ice Hockey like everyone else is more than just being normal, it will give him a sense of independence that a person deserves, he will no longer have to go sit on the bleachers with friends during stick time and watch, he will be able to suit up and play the game he has come to love so much.</p>
<p>We have set the goal to what we are expected to pay for just this one leg, anything that exceeds the goal will be set aside for a fund for Ty's future legs and medical cost.</p>
<p>Ty has been cancer free for almost 3.5 years,though he will continue to have  more scans in the next 2 years to make sure he continues to stay cancer free,  his next set of scans will be September 11, 2012, which will be exactly 4 years to the day that he was diagnosed. We know there are great things in Ty's future and we are praying that Ice Hockey is one of them.</p>
<p>We know were fortunate to have all we have, and it's hard to ask for this help, but our faith in people has grown by leaps and bounds since he was diagnosed.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Windham Harm Reduction Coalition Inc. was founded in 2009 with the mission of empowering and making a difference in the lives of people involved with drugs, commercial sex workers and their partners/ families through offering comprehensive user driven harm reduction services, education and training.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>The Windham Harm Reduction Coalition is a volunteer run community health organization. Our agency provides free confidential HIV prevention and other health and wellness services to over 70 individuals in Northeast Connecticut's Windham county. Our Services include:<br/>- Syringe Exchangeâ€¨ <br/>- HIV Testing and Counseling Referrals<br/>- Drug Overdose Prevention / Safer Use Trainingsâ€¨  <br/>- LGBTQ Youth Suicide Prevention Workshops â€¨ <br/>- Drug Treatment Referrals<br/>- Housing Referrals<br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>The Windham Harm Reduction Coalition (WHRC), recently received disheartening news from the North American Syringe Exchange Network (NASEN), who is the largest funder of our agency's work. NASEN announced with regret that they will not be funding syringe exchange programs in 2012. Here is a link NASEN's web-site and their official statement regarding funding for syringe exchange programs in 2012. <a href=""http://http://www.nasen.org/news/2011/nov/02/2011-nasen-grants-announcement/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">http://www.nasen.org/news/2011/nov/02/2011-nasen-grants-announcement/</a><br/><br/>â€¨â€¨Since 2009, WHRC has received $10,000 in annual grant funding from NASEN for the purchase of sterile injection supplies. This funding has been critical in ensuring WHRC's ability to offer comprehensive user driven harm reduction services to residents of Northeast Connecticut. It has enabled WHRC to distribute over 50,000 safe injection kits.â€¨â€¨With the absence of grant funding from NASEN, the Windham Harm Reduction Coalition is in danger of having to scale back and possibly discontinue critical harm reduction services. <br/><br/>We need to raise $10,000 to ensure we remain able to fulfill our mission of providing critical health services  to prevent transmission of Hepatitis and HIV in our community in 2012. At the moment we have enough supplies to continue operating through April 30. Our goal is to raise $2,500 of the $10,000 needed to continue operating this year by April 30. If we are unable to meet this goal will be forced to scale back and possibly discontinue critical harm reduction services.<br/><br/>â€¨â€¨Now more than ever we need your support! Please give generously. A small contribution of $20.00 will allow us to purchase 100 sterile syringes to be distributed through our agency's syringe exchange program.<br/><p><br/></p>

<h3>
<strong></strong>My name is Robin Engholm and I am personal friends with Liam's family. They lived with me and my family while Liam underwent 4 weeks of daily radiation in the hopes of kicking this disease.He is a fighter and is close to his 1 year anniversary of diagnosis. Things are not going well and if required we will need to move the family closer to Children's Hospital in St Louis MO. He has 2 sisters that are currently over 3 hrs away staying with friends while mom and dad are in the hospital with Liam. We need your help!!! His story, originally written around December is below. He has been through more radiation and chemo than listed as well as an additional Bone Marrow Transplant. This family needs our help! They have been through more than I would ever want to go through as their 6 yr old daughter is in remission from an unrelated type of cancer!!!</h3>
On July 23rd, 2011 our world SUDDENLY changed, Liam was diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma. We had finally achieved the ""American Dream"" in Raymondville, Missouri! We had 3 happy and healthy children, summer was in full swing and we finally had all of the love and support of our families within spitting distance from us. Liam had not been feeling well, but like any normal parent we thought it wa<span class=""text_exposed_show"">s due to the heat. Then the night of the 22nd Greg went to hug Liam goodnight and he gasp in pain and threw-up. We immediately rushed him to the ER. They said he needed to poop and he had worms. The next morning he was no better and running a fever, so back to the ER we went. A CT scan was ordered. The next thing we know the doctor comes in and gives us the news that he has a massive tumor in his belly region and he is in first stages of Liver failure. The doctor then said that Liam was being rushed to St Louis Children's Hospital in St Louis, Missouri. It took a minute for it to sink in, then WAM! It hit! All I could think about was JUST SAVE MY SON! The tears came flowing and it took everything in me to catch my breath. Once in the hospital all of the tests started. He had to go in for a biopsy and a bone marrow biopsy as well as have a central line put in his chest. Then the wait started for all of the tests to come back. Waiting was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do. I can honestly say the 4 days it took seemed like an eternity. His belly just kept growing! Liam wasn't being treated yet, so it felt like we were watching him die in front of us. Then the results came in. It was confirmed. He has Stage 4 Neuroblastoma and a minimum of 18 months of treatments ahead IF he makes it. We were then told the tumor grew out of his adrenal gland, which is on top of your kidney, pushed out his liver, wrapped around his aorta, then split his diaphragm and settled on the bottom of his lungs. Due to the size of his tumor and where it was it was creating a blister effect causing fluid in his lungs. The next thing we know Liam is being sent down to the PICU and on life support. Those 2 weeks were the longest 2 weeks and full of roller coaster ups and downs. We had to watch our son, crash and turn a horrible color grey, watch them bring him back, and then wait for Liam to decide to fight. He rested and regained strength enough that the PICU doctors wanted to take his breathing tube out again. We were a nervous wreck. We watched and prayed. FINALLY, Liam was breathing on his own. Meanwhile, all of this is going on our other two children, Natasha 11 and Natalie 5, were still in Raymondville with our Grandma. Once we knew, how long of a fight Liam was going to have we had to make a difficult decision to move in with my parents since they are closer than 3 hours to the hospital. So leaving my son in the hospital with Greg, I left to get the girls. I went back to Raymondville loaded what I could in the truck along with the girls and headed back here. The 3 hour trip was full of a lot of questions and tears. All Natasha could say was she was scared. Upon pressing, she was scared her baby brother was going to die and where would she go to school. Fast forward to school starting, the girls were enrolled and ready for their first day. Liam was STILL in the hospital and had not come home yet. They both were a ball of nerves. The bus showed up and they both climbed on. I was nervous for them but knew they were in good hands as both the Intermediate and Elementary schools knew what was happening with Liam. Natasha had told their bus driver, Jennifer Hall, all about Liam that first day. She told the girls she would be praying for him. About 2 weeks later, Liam got to come home for 48 hours. The girls had no idea! They jumped off the bus and went running for their brother. Finally, our family was whole again even for only 48 hours. Liam gets admitted every 22 days for Chemo and has to stay in for 5 days at a time. When he is home, every morning the bus comes and Liam is right there to greet the kids and Jennifer. Liam has finished Round 5 of chemo and pulled thru surgery and his first bone marrow/stem cell transplant. Liam will be going in for bone marrow/stem cell transplant #2 on the 20th of Feb. Keep those prayers coming :)</span>

<h3>
<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style="""">Hi there!</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>When I first heard about Buds to Blossoms (.org), I was wrapping up my practicum for my master's in divinity program.  I had been integrating my trainings that showed me the social, ancestral, and personal factors that lead towards the breakdown of families in our culture and the factors that return families to a state of health relatively quickly. Infant massage was a component of my work that was included but I knew more was possible with it.</p>
<p>When I heard that Buds to Blossoms not only brings volunteers to Southeast Asia to massage children with compromised immune systems, but also teaches the children how to massage each other, I got that funny feeling I needed to go.</p>
<p>Up until recently Buds to Blossoms was working with two orphanages in Cambodia where the kids have experienced a tremendous amount of trauma in their young years including abuse, prostitution, and slavery - not to mention the loss of their peaceful country and the loss of their parents.  In just two years, these kids went from violently hitting each other, which was pretty normal for them, to reaching out in care for each other as modeled by the Buds to Blossoms program.       </p>
<p>I find this incredibly exciting because it shows the power that gentle massage has to restore a sense of wholeness, connection, and care for one another despite the amount of trauma and challenges one has faced.  </p>
<p>The children we'll be working with in Vietnam are fairly new to the Buds to Blossoms program.  Apparently they are very thirsty for the massage.  They live in a very understaffed orphanage where it's not unusual for a volunteer to be in a room of 15 kids and 2 or 3 infants.  If the children can learn to take care of each other through massage, my heart will be very happy.</p>
<p>Massage has a tremendous amount of benefits.  It boosts their immune system, it relieves pain....  Studies have shown that adults abused as children decrease repeating the abuse when they take the time to massage their children.  Australia is running a pilot massage program in their elementary school system.  It's proving to be the most favorite part of the children's day and it's significantly reducing incidences of bullying.</p>

When I first heard about Buds to Blossoms (.org), I was wrapping up my practicum for my master's in divinity program.  I had been integrating my trainings that showed me the social, ancestral, and personal factors that lead towards the breakdown of families in our culture and the factors that return families to a state of health relatively quickly. Infant massage was a component of my work that was included but I knew more was possible with it.
When I heard that Buds to Blossoms not only brings volunteers to Southeast Asia to massage children with compromised immune systems, but also teaches the children how to massage each other, I got that funny feeling I needed to go.
Up until recently Buds to Blossoms was working with two orphanages in Cambodia where the kids have experienced a tremendous amount of trauma in their young years including abuse, prostitution, and slavery - not to mention the loss of their peaceful country and the loss of their parents.  In just two years, these kids went from violently hitting each other, which was pretty normal for them, to reaching out in care for each other as modeled by the Buds to Blossoms program.       
I find this incredibly exciting because it shows the power that gentle massage has to restore a sense of wholeness, connection, and care for one another despite the amount of trauma and challenges one has faced.  
The children we'll be working with in Vietnam are fairly new to the Buds to Blossoms program.  Apparently they are very thirsty for the massage.  They live in a very understaffed orphanage where it's not unusual for a volunteer to be in a room of 15 kids and 2 or 3 infants.  If the children can learn to take care of each other through massage, my heart will be very happy.
Massage has a tremendous amount of benefits.  It boosts their immune system, it relieves pain....  Studies have shown that adults abused as children decrease repeating the abuse when they take the time to massage their children.  Australia is running a pilot massage program in their elementary school system.  It's proving to be the most favorite part of the children's day and it's significantly reducing incidences of bullying.
I can't help but think that massage is a powerful way to bring more peace into our world. Your contribution or help in spreading the word about this endeavor will make a huge difference in the lives of the orphans and in the work I do with families.  I learn through experience.  Volunteering with the children in Vietnam will anchor in an experience I can draw from for many years to come.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>There is a time when everyone's life where things have gone wrong and you've lost hope. If you haven't felt this way than I pray you never do. If you have than I pray you can sympathize with those who truly need a helping hand.</p>
<p>The backstory to the campaign is pretty simple. My name is Kristen Clark and I'm writing on behalf of my mother Julia Kammerer.There have been situations in my life where we have had nothing but an air mattress and peanut butter with crackers. But the situation has never been as dire or as urgent as the immediate. I'm asking you to help us in this time of need.</p>
<p>My stepfather about two months ago was diagnosed with Stage IV Lung &amp; Liver cancer. He was given roughly about 4-6 months to live. The doctors wanted to do Chemotherapy and Radiation but his liver in such a terrible condition that the aggressive treatment would have killed him. My stepfather decided he would take the route of Hospice and spend his last few months with his family comfortably and in no pain. But what we didn't know was that he wouldn't make those 4-6 months. A few weeks after recievnig the diagnosis he passed away at home. </p>
<p>My stepfather was very close to being my father and I loved him dearly. My mother loved this man beyond belief and the struggles we're going through makes it even harder to grieve. A day doesn't go by we don't miss the man who made our house a home. </p>
<p>My stepfather's disability was the reason we were able to live from the month, we barely scraped by but we made it. We were able to live month to month by sheer luck. After his passing my mother learned she will not recieve his disability from the state. The beginning of August the State of Pennsylvania ran out of funding for cash assistance so we recieve no funding from that department. The only thing we recieve from the state if food stamps each month so we can have food on our table. But how do we pay the montly bills?</p>
<p>My mother is disabled from a work related injury. I, Kristen, am the only one with an income that is coming into the house. I work a small part time job at JCPenney and don't earn enough to support us. I can't get another job because they'd cut our foodstamps and take away my medical insurance.</p>
<p>I pay what bills I can while paying my own. I put gas into my car to get to and from work. But we're at the bottom of the barrel and have no financial help from any of my mother's siblings. None of them are really involved in her life.  We're close to potentially getting evicted from our home. We can't afford the bills. We've sought every single avenue for help. We keep looking for doors to open but they keep closing instead. Open a door for us to walk through and feel safe.</p>
<p>We're asking you to help us keep a roof over our head since no one else can. We're asking you to give us a fighting chance. We're asking you to keep a mother and daughter together so we're not forced to seperate if we get evicted. We've already lost our stepfather, we don't want to lose our home.</p>
<p>We're good people with good hearts, we just have been delt a terrible hand. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>Any funding we do recieve will go to helping us try to stay afloat while also donating half to local Cancer Institute near us.  Every single penny really does count, because we're simply out of pennies. If you don't have a penny to throw our way, please share our link to your friends. Share it on IndieGoGo. Help us out, please. If we don't recieve all the money in time we'll still split it 50/50. We're good and honest people. </p>

Our Aim


I believe that a healthy smile is an important aspect of a healthy life. While some people are fortunate enough to own the products needed for a healthy smile, others are not as privileged. This puts them at risk for serious health problems, including gum disease, tooth decay, and heart disease.


Smiling Again is committed to solving this problem. We provide shelters in Vancouver with toothbrushes, toothpaste, and other oral hygiene products needed for a confident, healthy, and happy smile.


Your support will enable us to help more people than we could otherwise, so donations are welcomed. Every cent helps, and your contribution will go far in bringing a healthy smile to the face of someone in need.

Goals

Our goal is to raise at least $1000. This amount enables us to purchase roughly 2000 toothbrushes and over 100 tubes of toothpaste.  If the goal amount is not reached, the funds raised will still be used to purchase toothbrushes and toothpaste.

You need not donate a large amount to make a large difference. A donation of $1 allows us to purchase an extra toothbrush, and every cent moves us toward our goal.

<p><span style=""font-family: Candara; font-size: medium;"">108 Monkeys (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/108monkeys"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/108monkeys</a>) is a nonprofit that started out as a way to bring free yoga to kids' afterschool programs in New Haven, CT. . . Then, their parents, teachers, therapists, counselors, you name it, started asking for it too. We couldn’t say no. We observed something unique happening when both caregivers and their clients have the opportunity to practice mindful movement <em>together</em>. “Street Bodhisattvas-in-Training” is the project we designed around that concept.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Candara; font-size: medium;""> </span></p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-family: Candara; font-size: medium;"">The Training: What is a Street Bodhisattva?</span></strong></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Candara; font-size: medium;"">A Street Bodhisattva is a yoga practioner,  yoga teacher or even nascent yoga enthusiast who wants to bring yoga to an underserved group—e.g., homeless families, disabled individuals, or at-risk kids.  Is that you?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Candara; font-size: medium;"">Street Bodhissatvas-in-Training will attend the Street Yoga Training (<a href=""http://www.streetyoga.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.streetyoga.org</a>) over the weekend of September 7-9, 2012, or on September 10-11, 2012, and then spend about 1-4 service hours per week for two months helping a nonprofit partner build a sustainable yoga program in their organization.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Candara; font-size: medium;"">With the guidance of 108 Monkeys, they will collaboratively plan how to appropriately introduce yoga or contemplative practices to the nonprofit’s clients/students.  They will combine what they learned in the Street Yoga Training, the staff’s deep knowledge of their client’s needs, and a strong connection to yoga. With weekly mentoring, the teams will use this to design yoga practices that are ambitious but appropriate, so that the practice of yoga can take root and continue to flourish without additional funding.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: Candara; font-size: medium;"">On November 10, 2012 we'll have a rockin' graduation celebration to honor all that contributed and participated.</span></p>

The Story 
108 Monkeys (www.facebook.com/108monkeys) is a nonprofit that started out as a way to bring free yoga to kids' afterschool programs in New Haven, CT. . . Then, their parents, teachers, therapists, counselors, you name it, started asking for it too. We couldn’t say no. We observed something unique happening when both caregivers and their clients have the opportunity to practice mindful movement together. “Street Bodhisattvas-in-Training” is the project we designed around that concept.
 
The Training: What is a Street Bodhisattva?
A Street Bodhisattva is a yoga practioner,  yoga teacher or even nascent yoga enthusiast who wants to bring yoga to an underserved group—e.g., homeless families, disabled individuals, or at-risk kids.  Is that you?
Street Bodhissatvas-in-Training will attend the Street Yoga Training (www.streetyoga.org) over the weekend of September 7-9, 2012, or on September 10-11, 2012, and then spend about 1-4 service hours per week for two months helping a nonprofit partner build a sustainable yoga program in their organization.  
With the guidance of 108 Monkeys, they will collaboratively plan how to appropriately introduce yoga or contemplative practices to the nonprofit’s clients/students.  They will combine what they learned in the Street Yoga Training, the staff’s deep knowledge of their client’s needs, and a strong connection to yoga. With weekly mentoring, the teams will use this to design yoga practices that are ambitious but appropriate, so that the practice of yoga can take root and continue to flourish without additional funding.
On November 10, 2012 we'll have a rockin' graduation celebration to honor all that contributed and participated.
Who Else is Involved?
We are lucky to have great partners.
Street Yoga of Portland, Oregon (www.streetyoga.org) will visit us to give their 3-day training, as long as this fundraiser succeeds so we can pay them! Their fee is $9,000 per training.
Meanwhile, back in New Haven, Connecticut Mental Health Center, Clifford Beers Clinic, and the Boys & Girls Club of New Haven have promised to chip in half of the Street Yoga training costs, free up some time for their staff to be trained, and fund community outreach. Friends at Yale University have offered to put their brains into evaluating the effectiveness of the program.
To top it all off, our generous community yoga studios—Balanced Yoga, Fresh Yoga, The Breathing Room, Your Community Yoga Center, and Bikram Yoga of New Haven—have all committed significant donations of space and/or used mats.
 
The Impact
New Haven, a small city of 124,000, suffered 36 youth murders during the 2011-12 school year.  
 
Violence of this kind is just a symptom.  The disease?  At its deepest level, disconnection from others and from the physiological reality that we are all the same.
Yoga is a tool to re-connect to feelings, and to the truth that our lives are all inextricably intertwined. When we remember how to feel that we are one, empathy returns; with it healthier social patterns. 
After their first yoga class, which the teacher described as ""overwhelmingly positive,"" a New Haven Academy student asked if they could do this again, commenting ""We're actually being nice to each other!""

FAQâ€¨â€¨
 
Why 108?
The individual numbers 1, 0 and 8 represent one thing, nothing and everything (infinity).    108 represents the ultimate reality of the universe as being simultaneously One, emptiness and infinite.
 
108 is the number of
• beads on a rosary
• beads on a mala
• names for Buddha
• letters in the Sanskrit alphabet
• stitches on a baseball
 
Why Monkeys?
That’s us!  Buddha described the human mind as being filled with drunken monkeys; jumping around, carrying on, capricious and fanciful.  Yoga and mindfulness help you get intimate with your whimsical inner monkey.
Our name is also in honor of Hanuman, the monkey God.  Modest despite great strength and wisdom, our monkey Hanuman was a devoted yogi, an expert dancer and a great ambassador.   In one story he jumped the sea to help free Sita; in another he delivered a mountain of medicinal herbs to dying soldiers.  Then put the mountain back in its right place.  Hero, humanitarian and environmentalist; rock on Hanuman!

My mom has always been my best friend. Growing up she sacrificed everything to take care of my brother, sister, and I. 15 years ago she and my father divorced and my mom has been on a downward spiral ever since never quite getting back on her feet. In roughly 2005 she was advised by her physician that she had the beginning stages of C.O.P.D.- Chronic Obstructed Pulmonary Disease and she was encouraged to quit smoking. Unfortunately she did not(However she has been smoke free for several years now). Her disease progressed so rapidly and she developed Emphysema and was recently advised that she also has fibromyalgia. My mom went from being an active and outgoing woman who loved to fish, camp, spend time in the outdoors, travel, playing with her grandchildren to being housebound. She is on oxygen 24 hours a day/7 days a week. She has 17% use of her lungs and is no longer able to really do much of anything. The highlight of her week is hopefully making a short trip to the grocery store.</div>
<p>Up until February 2012 my mom worked. She was able to maintain employment as an onsite apartment manager which allowed her to basically work from home. As long as she was able to perform her job she had a place to live as well as an income however she did not have health insurance. In February her employment was terminated and she was forced to move from her apartment where she had resided for the past five years. The impact was devastating. That income was the only way she was able to pay for the multiple prescriptions that she is on. They gave her a small severance check. If she were able to maneuver stairs she would have just moved in with me but she is not. All of the restrooms in my home are upstairs and she cannot access them. My mom is essentially alone. My brother is staying with her and helps her with most day to day activities and I am there quite often as I am not working at this time. But she has spent her savings on her medication, monthly utility bills, and personal care items. We have reached a dismal point.</p>
<p>She applied for and was denied unemployment. I helped her apply for Social Security Disability as her first application was denied as well. Her doctors have advised that she is a walking miracle. Most people that are as ill as she is are bed ridden in a hospice or hospital. While my mom can no longer do the things that she has already done and even just using the restroom is difficult there is hope. Her doctors believe that she is a prime candidate for a lung transplant. She will be placed on a waiting list as soon as her insurance begins. She is 56 years young.</p>
<p>I love my mom more than words can express. It is difficult to see her in so much physical and emotional pain. She has to deal with her mortality on a daily basis and is often overcome with fear of what might happen if she does not have access to oxygen. She should not have to worry about prescription drugs or paying her utility bills. I cannot begin to express how grateful we would be for any help. We are asking for $3,000 as I believe this amount is enough to pay for her medication, traveling oxygen tanks, and utilities until we hear from SSI. We’re hoping to hear any day now.</p>
<p>If we do not reach the goal of $3,000 we have asked that my mom is still allowed to keep the funds. Anything will help her. The funds will go to pay for her inhalers, pain medication, portable oxygen tanks, and to help keep her electricity paid. We cannot offer much by way of giving back to you for your generosity but I will send a thank you to every single contributor and I can also keep the contributors updated as to her status. I would like to create a page that would allow contributors to follow her journey and to hopefully see her go on to a full lung transplant and recovery!

<p><b>INTRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>Hello - I’m Chris Cain. I have been living with muscle spasms for 25 years due to a spinal cord injury. In my lifetime I have tried treatments from pharmaceuticals to herbal remedies, but the only thing that has worked for me consistently without creating a physical addiction or bad side effects has been cannabis. It is an illegal substance in some states, which makes it difficult to acquire and avoid prosecution by the law. In my hometown, I have been harassed, arrested and accused of being a criminal. I have testified in front of legislative committees multiple times in Austin to bring a medical marijuana bill to a vote, but it has not happened. Because of this, I have researched every avenue of obtaining this medicine without prosecution.  </p>
<p>After learning about CBD oil, I feel I have finally found a way to cure my spasms without fear of legal prosecution, and without having to put tar laden smoke into my lungs for the rest of my life! This is because the oil can be extracted from industrial hemp which contains only minuscule amounts of the psychoactive ingredient, THC. </p>
<p>While I began my research to find an answer for my muscle spasms, along the way I learned that there are millions of people suffering debilitating neurological disorders that CBD oil relieves. Specifically, some disorders cause children to have dozens of epileptic seizures a day. There are documented cases that show that CBD oil can decrease seizures from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9qkYLtAhSQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9qkYLtAhSQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">300 per week down to just 1</a>. For all the children going through debilitating seizures and their families who give up their lives to care for them, I have developed the EpiVape - a quick, safe solution that is legal in all 50 states.</p>
<p><b>INTRODUCING THE EPIVAPE</b></p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/400/943/0851dfca947e3b62925138e5cf71556f_large.jpg?1407426742"" src="""" style=""""/> </figure><p></p>
<p>1. The EpiVape is a cost effective disposable hemp oil vaporizer, shaped differently so vaping medicine will move away from the connotation of smoking as most vaporizers look like cigarettes. </p>
<p> 2. The EpiVape contains a proprietary vaping liquid consisting of the highest quality CBD oil from World Hemp Oil with a high percentage of CBD. The oil is imported from Europe where it is extracted from the flowering material of industrial hemp using a process to ensure that all of the medicinal compounds in the oil remain intact. </p>
<p>3.	By vaporizing the CBD oil, the medicine enters the blood stream quickly and stops seizures and spasms much faster than ingestion methods. Because there is no fear of a CBD overdose, a child can puff from the EpiVape that is hanging around his/her neck at will to suppress oncoming seizures. </p>
<p>4. Because people are familiar with the EpiPen, a device used for immediate treatment of allergies, the name EpiVape will automatically be associated with a medical product. In this case, Epi stands for epilepsy rather than epinephrine. It can be used for other ailments as well such as muscle spasms due to spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis, and tremors associated with Parkinson’s disease among others.</p>

Our partner, World Hemp Oil, has sourced its oil from these quality farmers, and we have developed it into our proprietary vaping liquid for fast results.</p>

Hello - I’m Chris Cain. I have been living with muscle spasms for 25 years due to a spinal cord injury. In my lifetime I have tried treatments from pharmaceuticals to herbal remedies, but the only thing that has worked for me consistently without creating a physical addiction or bad side effects has been cannabis. It is an illegal substance in some states, which makes it difficult to acquire and avoid prosecution by the law. In my hometown, I have been harassed, arrested and accused of being a criminal. I have testified in front of legislative committees multiple times in Austin to bring a medical marijuana bill to a vote, but it has not happened. Because of this, I have researched every avenue of obtaining this medicine without prosecution.  
After learning about CBD oil, I feel I have finally found a way to cure my spasms without fear of legal prosecution, and without having to put tar laden smoke into my lungs for the rest of my life! This is because the oil can be extracted from industrial hemp which contains only minuscule amounts of the psychoactive ingredient, THC. 
While I began my research to find an answer for my muscle spasms, along the way I learned that there are millions of people suffering debilitating neurological disorders that CBD oil relieves. Specifically, some disorders cause children to have dozens of epileptic seizures a day. There are documented cases that show that CBD oil can decrease seizures from 300 per week down to just 1. For all the children going through debilitating seizures and their families who give up their lives to care for them, I have developed the EpiVape - a quick, safe solution that is legal in all 50 states.
INTRODUCING THE EPIVAPE

 
1. The EpiVape is a cost effective disposable hemp oil vaporizer, shaped differently so vaping medicine will move away from the connotation of smoking as most vaporizers look like cigarettes. 
 2. The EpiVape contains a proprietary vaping liquid consisting of the highest quality CBD oil from World Hemp Oil with a high percentage of CBD. The oil is imported from Europe where it is extracted from the flowering material of industrial hemp using a process to ensure that all of the medicinal compounds in the oil remain intact. 
3.	By vaporizing the CBD oil, the medicine enters the blood stream quickly and stops seizures and spasms much faster than ingestion methods. Because there is no fear of a CBD overdose, a child can puff from the EpiVape that is hanging around his/her neck at will to suppress oncoming seizures. 
4. Because people are familiar with the EpiPen, a device used for immediate treatment of allergies, the name EpiVape will automatically be associated with a medical product. In this case, Epi stands for epilepsy rather than epinephrine. It can be used for other ailments as well such as muscle spasms due to spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis, and tremors associated with Parkinson’s disease among others.

 
CBD OIL EXPLAINED
Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Chief Medical Correspondent from CNN, publicly supports this natural compound as a real solution to epileptic seizures and muscle spasms. Cannabidiol, or CBD, is a compound in cannabis that bonds with naturally occurring cannabinoid receptors in our bodies located in the endocrine system, the spleen, white blood cells and the nerve cells. CBD, or cannabidiol, stimulates the production of our own cannabinoids. These cannabinoids promote health in ways that are still being discovered. Because it does not contain the psychoactive ingredient, THC, it does not get you high or make you feel stoned. CBD oil is being used to treat symptoms of epilepsy, and muscle spasms caused from MS, Parkinson’s and other neurological disorders.


EPILEPSY STATISTICS

One in 100 people will develop Epilepsy.
In two-thirds of patients diagnosed with Epilepsy, the cause is unknown.
Up to 50,000 Americans die each year from seizures and related causes.
 30% of those diagnosed are children. 
Uncontrolled seizures may lead to brain damage and death.
Epilepsy can develop at any age and can be a result of genetics, stroke, head injury, and many other factors. 
For many soldiers suffering traumatic brain injury on the battlefield, Epilepsy will be a long-term consequence. 
The current drugs used to treat epilepsy have extreme side effects such as inducing coma and internal bleeding.

No longer does anyone have to suffer, waiting for states to pass laws allowing CBD oil that is extracted from medical marijuana.
HOW WILL THE FUNDS BE USED?We believe this campaign will not only give us the financial resources to move forward with the EpiVape, but through it we will build a supportive community. Together, we can improve the quality of life for people suffering seizures and spasms and their families.

70% for setting up manufacturing 
10% to establish a database of families in need

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In September 2011 I was diagnosed with Adenocarcinoma (a form of non-small cell lung cancer). This type of cancer is mainly found in lifelong smokers, but has a small, puzzling rate of occurrence in young, female non-smokers. <br/><br/>""The prognosis of nonâ€“small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) largely depends on tumor stage; indeed, the overall low survival rate (about 15% at 5 years) is primarily due to the high frequency of late diagnosis, when the tumor has become unresectable. Conversely, early-stage NSCLC patients (stage Iâ€“II) have a significantly better prognosis (30%â€“60% survival at 5 years).""</p>
<p><br/>Fortunately I was diagnosed in Stage I, and treated in Stage I and II through two surgeries: a Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) on October 28, 2011 and a wedge resection on December 21, 2011. The latter was a thoracotomy, which involved breaking and spreading three lateral ribs to gain access to the necessary area. Based on the preliminary surgery results (the surgeon's evaluation and an initial CT scan), the prognosis is very good.  </p>
<p><br/>I'm now recovering at home in the Chicago area with the physical and emotional assistance of many generous friends. I should be able to get around within a week and resume normal activities within a month. </p>
<p><br/>However, in order to pay $1,250 in medical bills, I've had to sacrifice the ability to visit my family or have my family visit me during these surgeries. As many of you know, I've also worked as much as I can tutoring and doing odd jobs around campus to pay these bills. I originally asked for an iPad for Christmas on this site, but... </p>

integrate into their lives, promoting self-healing, awareness, and 
connection to themselves and others
-our youth are often being dismissed and are not provided with the proper resources to cope/deal

<p>Kris Burke has been battling breast cancer since 2001, and the cancer has now metastacized to other parts of her body. Last year she lost her job as a teacher, and with it, her affordable health insurance. Kris and her husband Ben have tried to keep life normal for their daughter Skyler, a kindergartener at our school, but their financial situation has been tough and at one time their house was close to foreclosure. Members of our community have held several fundraisers to help the Burkes with their medical and household expenses, but now we face a new challenge.</p>
<p>Kris' doctor recently told her that the chemotherapy was no longer controlling the tumors on her liver, so she is now using holistic naturopathic treatments, many of which are not covered by health insurance.  Our current project is to make some repairs on their house, including a new roof, so their family can have a safe, comfortable home in which to savor their family time.  We're raising money to pay for the building materials, and most of the work will be done by volunteers. </p>
A donation of any amount is greatly appreciated.  We'd also be very grateful if you would share Kris' story via social media, email, or any method you can think of.  There is much more information on <a href=""http://www.KeepingKrisStrong.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.KeepingKrisStrong.org</a> including several articles that have appeared in the local media.</div>

Beautiful, and a whole life to live.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Throughout my transition, there are challenges.  Major and minor ones, just like any change one would go through. Most of those changes are simply a matter of time and being on the right mix and amount of prescription medication and hormone therapy. Change is slow but sure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have noticed that there are two changes in which no matter how much time passes, it will not change without, outside interference.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first is my facial hair. This simply will not go away by waiting for time to expire. This is not a huge issue as I do not seem to have a heavy beard or 'stache. I do have a 5 o'clock shadow that is noticeable. I do have esthetician, that is willing to do the work on my hair for 150-175 per session and it should only take about 6 sessions, so that is $1050.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the hardest things in my transition from my former life to my new existence, is my voice. I consistently get confused as a guy.  I don't look like a guy, I don't dress or act like a guy, but my voice is that of an Alto singer guy, from what my spouse says. No matter what the range of my voice is, I am referred to as ""sir"", ""he"", ""him"". Even by those I work with closely. This is not a matter of sounding like a boy on the phone, it's about sounding like a boy in all aspects of my existence. I am scheduled to start talks with a voice therapist on the 16th of October to start voice training for MtF TG voice issues.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a person in my condition, these two things are the most troublesome of things to overcome.  Many of you have known me for a good deal of time now and some of you have just met me.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am not asking for pity, I am not asking for charity, I am not asking for a hand-out. I fully expect and I am fully prepared to ""pay"" for the help which is given.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have my own business making paracord survival bracelets, collars, leashes, belts and key fobs. For your help and donation, I will give you the equivalent of your donation, in my product. This means that if you donate $10 to helping me achieve these two goals, then I will give you $10 worth of product. This can be any items from my site, so long as the total matches your donation. Rules will apply here.  1) do NOT order from the site. At this time I do not have the means to put coupon codes into my website to allow for this. If you donate and choose to accept product in return, then please email me. We will conduct business through email. 2) You do have the option of refusing product in exchange for product or asking that product be donated to an individual or organization. 3) Please remember that because this is a business I can't give product away for an unlimited amount. I do have to limit this to $50.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you have questions or concerns or even idea please feel free to share. I would also like to assure everyone that helps, that this money will ONLY go towards the causes that I have listed here. If there is more donations than are needed, the remainder will be donated to a foster care charity.</p></div>","As many of you know, I am in the ""middle"" of a transition.  A pretty major actually.  I'm like a butterfly that is emerging from her cocoon.  For 35 years I was one thing, and now I am emerging as something , no Someone, different.

<h3>My good friend Becca was diagnosed with breast cancer this year.  She is an amazing woman and I can't believe that she has to go through this!</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Last month Becca had surgey to remove both breasts and lymph nodes.  She has to now go through 1 year of chemo and other therapies to try and get at this aggressive form of cancer. Through all this Becca has not complained, has not asked for anything, and has been there for others to help them cope with her cancer. She is amazing with her words.. and her definitions.. and her positive outlook...  .... she IS amazing! </p>
<p>This is something you just don't think of ... Becca is a young woman!  She has a husband,  two kids, two dogs, 2 guinea pigs who love her so much.Becca's husband has been through so much, he has had to work full time, and now take care of both girls, do all the errands, clean the house, and take full care of Becca while she recovers from such an extensive surgery.  </p>
<p>Becca works for as a family resourse coordinator and seriously LOVES helping other families all the time!  During all this Becca has been off work. Between her being off work and her husband taking days off things are tight.  </p>
<p>I went over to visit, see how Becca was.  Her father was on the way to see her, and her husband was out in the yard fixing something for the kids.  Becca said to me ""I wish he had some help cleaning the house, he's doing such a good job keeping up on everything but he's just so exausted, and now I wish I could run the vacuum before my dad comes over without having to bother anyone"" ... you see Becca was on the couch, propped up, recovering from intensive surgery .. and still thinking about not bothering anyone.  We  I ran the vacuum, but havn't got that image out of my head.</p>
<p>I am hoping to raise enough money that I can at least help hire a cleaning person to go in there and clean her home once a week for the year that Becca has to go through Chemo. If we can get more than that at least the family won't be in danger of financial hurt along with everything else they are already going through.</p>
<p>I wish I was better with words so that I could explain how much this would mean for her family.  We are thankful for everything that comes in no matter how much. </p>

<p><b>What can VITA FX do for me?.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>VITA FX
will bring you the possibility to get in touch with your healthcare
professionals,  share exams,  meet other people like you,etc.. We want to
create one of the biggest communities for healthcare and support in the world. </p>
<b><br/></b><p><b>How does VITA FX make this possible?</b></p>
<p>VITA
FX  has different functionalities for
healthcare professionals, which are at the center of the patient’s experience
improvement. For example, with VITA FX, healthcare professionals can create
workgroups to analize specific cases [ONLY WITH the PATIENT’S
APPROVAL]. This will improve patient care by optimizing the information flow. It’s
simple and easy. You will never again wait forlong to receive your physician’s opinion
about  your exams. It’s easy! </p>
<br/><p><b>How does VITA FX make sure that my interaction with health care professionals work?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We believe that the owners of the information are patients
themselves, thus VITA FX is not a healthcare provider web based service.  VITA FX is a tool for you to take ownership
of your own information. Each patient and healthcare professional have their
own responsibility in terms of how they use the VITA FX network, and how they
commit to their patients. That’s why we are an open and flexible health
network. Everyone is invited! </p>
<b><br/></b><p><b>¿Who can see my clinical data [PHR]?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>No one, unless you give someone access. Your
data is only shared with the people you give permission.. If you don´t give
permission to others, the only one who can see your data is you. Please, don’t
share your data with profiles/people that you don’t know in real life. </p>
<b><br/></b><p><b>I have tried to connect with my healthcare professionals but haven’t been able to do so, is this part of VITA FX service?</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">
</span></p>
<p>VITA FX is not responsible for the use that
healthcare professionals give to the VITA FX network. The VITA FX project
supports a more closed relationship between healthcare professionals and
patients. But,we are not a healthcare provider. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Is this network only for Physicians?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>At VITA FX we believe in a people-centered
healthcare. Because of that, we are an open and flexible system that wants to
integrate in the same network everyone working for patients health including
Psychologists, Nurses, etc., others. The main thing is to improve communication
among them.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Could i invite complementary medicine practitioners or other types of medicine (E.g.: acupuncture)?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Of course. Everyone is invited. However, We
want to protect our users from problems. Therefore, we will differentiate
between healthcare professionals with credentials from healthcare institutions
and those who don’t have them. We only recommend you to be in touch with
people/profiles that you know in real life.

What can VITA FX do for me?.


VITA FX
will bring you the possibility to get in touch with your healthcare
professionals,  share exams,  meet other people like you,etc.. We want to
create one of the biggest communities for healthcare and support in the world. 
How does VITA FX make this possible?
VITA
FX  has different functionalities for
healthcare professionals, which are at the center of the patient’s experience
improvement. For example, with VITA FX, healthcare professionals can create
workgroups to analize specific cases [ONLY WITH the PATIENT’S
APPROVAL]. This will improve patient care by optimizing the information flow. It’s
simple and easy. You will never again wait forlong to receive your physician’s opinion
about  your exams. It’s easy! 
How does VITA FX make sure that my interaction with health care professionals work?


We believe that the owners of the information are patients
themselves, thus VITA FX is not a healthcare provider web based service.  VITA FX is a tool for you to take ownership
of your own information. Each patient and healthcare professional have their
own responsibility in terms of how they use the VITA FX network, and how they
commit to their patients. That’s why we are an open and flexible health
network. Everyone is invited! 
¿Who can see my clinical data [PHR]?


No one, unless you give someone access. Your
data is only shared with the people you give permission.. If you don´t give
permission to others, the only one who can see your data is you. Please, don’t
share your data with profiles/people that you don’t know in real life. 
I have tried to connect with my healthcare professionals but haven’t been able to do so, is this part of VITA FX service?


VITA FX is not responsible for the use that
healthcare professionals give to the VITA FX network. The VITA FX project
supports a more closed relationship between healthcare professionals and
patients. But,we are not a healthcare provider. 

Is this network only for Physicians?


At VITA FX we believe in a people-centered
healthcare. Because of that, we are an open and flexible system that wants to
integrate in the same network everyone working for patients health including
Psychologists, Nurses, etc., others. The main thing is to improve communication
among them.  

Could i invite complementary medicine practitioners or other types of medicine (E.g.: acupuncture)?


Of course. Everyone is invited. However, We
want to protect our users from problems. Therefore, we will differentiate
between healthcare professionals with credentials from healthcare institutions
and those who don’t have them. We only recommend you to be in touch with
people/profiles that you know in real life.",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Short Summary</span><br/>
</h3> <p>               Hello everyone! My name is <i><b>Samran</b></i> ( which means <b>HAPPY</b> in Thai language). I am the creator of  Owie unique emergency medical box. The idea of Owie medical box comes from both my outdoor activities and nursing experiences.</p>
<p>              I worked as a triage nurse, community health nurse, and education nurse more than 20 years. I like outdoor activities such as cruising, camping, fishing, and hiking…… etc. I believe many of us enjoy traveling as much as I do. I know we all do not want to get sick during the vacation. However, unexpected health problems and injuries could happen  anytime and anywhere such as finger cut, stomach pain, diarrhea, itchy rash, bug bite, tooth pain, headache, and back pain.</p>
<p>           Life threatening situation also can occur during vacation, such as dehydration and <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoglycemia/basics/complications/con-20021103"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Hypoglycemia</b></a>. Imagine you have diabetic person in the car who need to eat or drink  immediately to increase  his or her blood sugar. However, you are driving in an unfamiliar and remote area, you don't know where to go and when you can find food or drinks. Every minute is counted; money is not matter at this moment,  <b>Glucose tablets</b> in your emergency box could be life-saving in this circumstance. </p>
<p>          <b> Owie box</b> is a unique and compact medical box contain several vital medications and medical supplies such as Tylenol, Ibuprofen, burn cream, anti-itch cream, allergy medication, single use thermometer and glucose tablet. The Owie box is not only small enough to keep in the glove compartment  and the boat glove box, or carry on the trip but also efficient enough to reduce  the severity of many unpredictable  health consequences until further assessment by a medical providers.</p>
<p>         <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Unique features of Owie box</b> that make it different from

<p>1.  Small, compact and lightweight medical kit that make it easy for users to see content inside the box and take it with them wherever they need.  The Owie Every Day Carry (EDC) box is measured 15cmsx20cmsx4cmsand weight only 12 ounces.

<p>The idea behind herbiwarrior is simple: to develop high-quality, vegan and allergy-friendly supplements, while making the whole process from production to shipment as eco-friendly and sustainable as possible. If you love sports and/or believe in conscious consumerism this is the campaign for you!<br/><br/>The first product, a delicious chocolate protein powder called ['veÊ¤], is ready to roll out and this campaign is to raise funding for the very first batch.

<li>purely plant-based</li>
<li>allergy-friendly*</li>
<li>all essential amino acids</li>
<li>packaging and labeling material from FSC-certified renewable resources</li>
<li>CO2-neutral shipment</li>
</ul><p><br/>*(The manufacturer gets payed extra to specially clean the machines before production and to do lab checks for gluten, soy, milk and egg residue afterwards)<br/><br/>For a detailed nutrient breakdown, click <a href=""http://herbiwarrior.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/nutritional_value.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""here"">here</a>.<br/><br/>Here's what other people (who were fortunate enough to procure a sample) have to say about it:</p>
<div>“Easy on the tastebuds and not as overly sweet as many other products out there. I’d like to have it as a post-workout drink regularly.”<br/> - Philip D. (Martial arts instructor)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“It’s got everything I wish for: Creamy and delicious, plus it has 71% protein! I was actually a bit sad when my sample ran out.”<br/> - Jonas P. (Postgrad student)</div>

<div>['veÊ¤] will sell for 27,99€ in retail, which is about 36$. One package will give you 540g (1.2lbs) of chocolaty goodness.</div>
<div> </div>
<h3>Financial fineprint</h3>
<p>The manufacturer has a minimum order of 500kg. This is about 950 of the packs seen in the video. Below you can see a breakdown of the costs that the campaign goal is made up of.</p>

<p><strong>the shirts<br/></strong>The limited edition shirts are made from organic cotton, have the company logo imprinted and will designate you as a contributer (pictures coming soon). The printjob is done in a facility here in Berlin that teaches juvenile delinquents useful skills (such as silk screen printing) to help them get back on track.<strong><br/><br/>the ebook<br/></strong>The ebook will be specially made for contributers of this campaign. Within, I will compile some of my favorite hacks for working out and eating well plus strategies for motivation and behavioral change that I have gathered over the years and apply personally.<strong></strong><strong><br/><br/></strong><em>All material perks will be shipped via a service that offsets the emissions produced during shipment. Shipping costs are always included in the perk amounts.</em><strong><br/><br/>If the goal is surpassed<br/></strong>Should the campaign raise more than the goal I would be able to invest into the company infrastructure such as the upcoming shop or possibly pay some money to the amazing people that have been providing their services for free so far. At twice the amount I would be able to also order the first batch of protein powder in <strong><em>vanilla</em></strong>. The development of that second flavor is already finished and it is waiting to be made.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><br/>Thank you for your support and please contact me for questions, comments and everything else!</strong></p>
<p><br/>If you can not contribute at this moment...don't worry, we're still cool. But if you would share this on facebook, tell a couple of your friends, family, peers, classmates or that one friend with the top 100 blog about it, you have my full and sincere thanks!</p>

“Easy on the tastebuds and not as overly sweet as many other products out there. I’d like to have it as a post-workout drink regularly.” - Philip D. (Martial arts instructor)
 
“It’s got everything I wish for: Creamy and delicious, plus it has 71% protein! I was actually a bit sad when my sample ran out.” - Jonas P. (Postgrad student)

Perky perks
the shirtsThe limited edition shirts are made from organic cotton, have the company logo imprinted and will designate you as a contributer (pictures coming soon). The printjob is done in a facility here in Berlin that teaches juvenile delinquents useful skills (such as silk screen printing) to help them get back on track.the ebookThe ebook will be specially made for contributers of this campaign. Within, I will compile some of my favorite hacks for working out and eating well plus strategies for motivation and behavioral change that I have gathered over the years and apply personally.All material perks will be shipped via a service that offsets the emissions produced during shipment. Shipping costs are always included in the perk amounts.If the goal is surpassedShould the campaign raise more than the goal I would be able to invest into the company infrastructure such as the upcoming shop or possibly pay some money to the amazing people that have been providing their services for free so far. At twice the amount I would be able to also order the first batch of protein powder in vanilla. The development of that second flavor is already finished and it is waiting to be made.
Thank you for your support and please contact me for questions, comments and everything else!
If you can not contribute at this moment...don't worry, we're still cool. But if you would share this on facebook, tell a couple of your friends, family, peers, classmates or that one friend with the top 100 blog about it, you have my full and sincere thanks!

<h2>I'll TRI anything for Women's World of Boxing!</h2>
<p>As most of you know, I TRI. It's not my favorite thing to do, but I like that it keeps me active and headed toward a challenging goal. I've run races before benefitting causes I care for, but when starting to train for this race, I couldn't think of any other cause I care for more than getting a gym for <strong>Women's World of Boxing (WWB). </strong></p>
<p>Speaking of my favorite things to do, I started boxing in January 2012. The argument can be made that boxing changed my life. I won't go into it too much, but after 6 months of boxing, I am leaner, meaner, and a boxing machine-(r). I also met T (my coach) at that time, who has turned out to be one of the most inspirational and passionate women I've ever met. Because of the time and commitment T has put into me, T's mission is now mine as well -- to open a women's-only boxing gym to create an empowering place for women to box.</p>
</div>
<div>I'm raising money in hopes that I can help toward this dream. I'll be participating in the Cayuga Lake Triathlon in Ithaca, NY in August for WWB. I will be 1 of 384 kicking our own butts to swim, bike and run to the finish line.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Every dollar donated will go to WWB (apart from some fees taken from this website! I won't even tell you what happens if I don't reach my fundraising goal). Every dollar will help, too. We need a SPACE, heavy bags, speed bags, a ring, equipment, etc. We need it all. Boxing has changed my life, and I know it can change many more.</div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Take a moment to think about how I am sweating it out training for this crazy thing, possibly stop and chuckle at that, then <strong>PLEASE DONATE!</strong>

<p>In October 2002 I married the love of my life.  I knew when I met John back in 1996 that I would be with him forever!  We’ve had a lot of happiness in our life – we have 2 beautiful nieces and a handsome nephew and I have an adorable Godson.  We have a wonderful family and awesome friends that are just like family.  But in our life we’ve also had to deal with two great losses… I lost my Mom in 1997 and John lost his Dad in 2001.  But we’ve always come thru the hard times with the help of each other.  We’ve always wanted a big family and now we’re coming up to our 10 year anniversary and we’re still missing the one thing we wanted most – kids.  It’s been a very emotional and heart-breaking experience for us.</p>
<p>We started trying to have kids in 2006.  And thought it would be an easy task.  You just want kids and you have them.  Well, that wasn’t the case for us.  We thought we just weren’t timing it right or it would happen soon enough, but 6 years later - it hasn’t.</p>
<p> I talked to my OB/GYN about it and he referred me to a Fertility doctor.  She told us we were the 1% of the population that had unexplained infertility.  So we decided to first try Clomid.  After 6 cycles -  nothing happened.  It was so hard to wait every month and then be disappointed when we weren’t pregnant.   After taking a few months break, the doctor then recommended we try the next step and go with the injectible fertility treatments of Follistim and Ovidrel with an IUI (Intrauterine insemination).  We were excited to try this next step.  Then we found out it wasn’t covered by our insurance.  We didn’t care - $1400 later we tried it for the first time.  And it didn’t work.  Two more times and nothing.  After our third try I needed a break.  It was emotionally and physically exhausting.  Having a baby was something we thought about every day –waiting and waiting to see if <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">THIS</span></strong> time was going to be the time. </p>
<p>This spring we decided to try a new doctor.  Dr. Bruce Rose of Infertility Solutions.  We heard awesome things about him.  We went and it was so exciting.  He is so positive.  After some tests on John and a hysteroscopy on me it was time for the bad news.  The doctor said with the issues we both have (John’s sperm aren’t strong enough to penetrate the egg &amp; I have a layer of tissue covering my ovaries making it impossible for sperm to get thru) we will NEVER have children naturally – it just won’t work.  Our only option was to have IVF.  After that news sank in – we knew what we needed to do.</p>
<p>So here we are today.  We’ve decided that’s if this is the path we were meant to take then it’s the path we’re going to take.  And we can really use your help to bring our first baby into this world.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Where the money will go: </span></em></strong></p>
<p>We’re opting to have Multi-Cycle conventional IVF (3 for 2) package.  If the first two cycles don’t work – they will do a third at no additional cost.  The charge is $19,000.  A single cycle is $11,000 so we thought it would be better to opt for more tries than a one-time only. </p>

<p>Our Monastery is the oldest Orthodox Christian Monastery in America. Our summer camp reaches out to children in the surrounding area from all income brackets and in past the monastery has given scholarships to low-income children. Our kitchen is from 1969 and has not been updated since it was built. In order to stay up to code, we need to improve our kitchen with new cabinets, 2 sinks, new flooring and wall boards. The total cost will be $13,500. We do not necessariy expect to meet our goal to raise $10,000 but whatever money is donated will go directly to this project. To understand our monastery better, you can view our website at <a href=""http://sttikhonsmonastery.org."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sttikhonsmonastery.org.</a> Our finanacial statements are available on line at <a href=""http://sttikhonsmonastery.org/files/Review-St-Tikhon.pdf."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sttikhonsmonastery.org/files/Review-St-Tikhon.pdf.</a> We have had a summer camp here for several decades and the staff (most of which work for free) deserve and need a better place to work and prepare the food in a safe environment. For anyone donating more than $50.00 they will receive a free CD from our 100th anniversary celebration, a beautiful Russian Orthodox a cappella choir of 100 voices (recorded live.) We thank you for any donations and ask God to reward your kindness. If you have any questions concerning this project or our monastery, please contact us directly at monasteryinfo1@gmail.com. We have been renovating the entire monastery for some time (our third world cinder block buildings) and are making the place beautiful through the support of people like you!

The total cost will be $13,500. We do not necessariy expect to meet our goal to raise $10,000 but whatever money is donated will go directly to this project. To understand our monastery better, you can view our website at http://sttikhonsmonastery.org. Our finanacial statements are available on line at http://sttikhonsmonastery.org/files/Review-St-Tikhon.pdf. We have had a summer camp here for several decades and the staff (most of which work for free) deserve and need a better place to work and prepare the food in a safe environment. For anyone donating more than $50.00 they will receive a free CD from our 100th anniversary celebration, a beautiful Russian Orthodox a cappella choir of 100 voices (recorded live.) We thank you for any donations and ask God to reward your kindness. If you have any questions concerning this project or our monastery, please contact us directly at monasteryinfo1@gmail.com. We have been renovating the entire monastery for some time (our third world cinder block buildings) and are making the place beautiful through the support of people like you! Help us to rebuild our Monastery today!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p> </p>
<p>I have begun a series of photographs showing the journey of people affected by breast cancer. I hope to portray and capture in my photography, this tremendous struggle and every aspect of human nature, from sadness to victory and triumph. My photography will be a photo collection of life altering, empowering and sometimes tragic series of photos showing human nature as it triumphs in many instances and succumbs in others, a real life portrayal of a disease no one wants to talk about.</p>
<p>My photos are just the beginning of my project. Although these photos will be dramatic in nature, I feel they will convey a story of hope, strength and life.  My photos will also bring awareness to those that may not understand this fight. My goal is to exhibit this project and publish a book of my photos and stories of people that have been affected personally from this terrible disease. I would like this book to create awareness and to give back encouragement to peoples lives. Proceeds from the sale of each book will be going to a specified breast cancer fund.</p>
<p>I am seeking support to help cover the costs of materials and services required to proof, print, and frame the photos. I plan on producing 20 to 30 prints for exhibition. Your support will also go to the production costs of making the book. This will include the printing, binding and packaging.</p>
<p>Breast cancer is more than just pink t-shirts and ribbons, but it is a battle that shouldn’t be fought alone. Everybody has the ability to help change the world, but it’s just a matter of what you can do to help. Through my photos and my book, I hope to add my part to changing the world. If you can donate, I would appreciate it. If you can't, please just share this page if you are willing. If you are a survivor of Breast Cancer or you know someone that is going though it, I want you to remember to “Stay Strong.”</p>

<p><strong>About Tim</strong></p>
<p>Tim has been a friend of mine for probably 5-6 years now. He is a loving husband, father of 4, and follower of Christ. He has worked in the medical sales field for 23+ years and is currently a Senior Sales Manager. His family played a big role in my life as a single man. They constantly opened up their home to dozens and dozens of singles from our church on a weekly basis and offered encouragement, friendship, and love. Within in the last few weeks, he found out he has Aggressive Inoperable Grade 4 Brain Cancer. His family has been such a blessing to so many people with their kindness and love and I would like to see their medical bills and any other financial needs met.</p>
<p><strong>What They Need</strong></p>
<p>ANY DONATION AMOUNT WILL BE A BLESSING</p>
<p>Regardless of the amount, all funds donated will go to help Tim and his family. The funds will be donated through a church (501c3 tax-deductible) account and will be given 100% to them (minus the small percentage to Indiegogo and PayPal).<strong> <br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Please share this campaign with your friends, family, and continue to pray for them during this challenging time.  </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> A small $1,000 goal was set so there are no 9% penalties set if we do not meet the goal. Please give generously and help support this wonderful family that has touched so many lives!</p>
