I was diagnosed on October 30, 2014 with a very aggressive non operable stage 4
pancreatic cancer. Chemotherapy was my only option. After 12 rounds of
treatment my tumor shrunk by almost half. The results are positive, but
unfortunately it left me with a lot of nerve damage.<br/>
<br/>
While undergoing chemotherapy I added holistic treatments. I believe they are
working for me as my original eight week chemo break was recently extended.
Although the tumor showed a slight increase in size and mild spreading after
eight weeks, it was felt I was well enough to wait until the end August for
more follow up tests. I continue to do these complementary treatments and have
recently added Far Infar Red Saunas.<br/>
<br/>
My osteopath suggested trying electrotherapy for the nerve damage and the
viruses associated with cancer.<br/>
After extensive research I discovered when the immune system is not strong it
allows the viruses to grow and mutate. Electrotherapy ('Frequency Therapy' ) is
often used in Europe to kill the viruses associated with cancer rather than
drugs. To be effective the treatment should be done twice daily. At present I
am able to do this therapy four times a week at the home of a colleague who has
graciously offered to give me use of his equipment. <br/>
<br/>
We are doing a fundraiser to purchase this equipment and continue the therapy
daily at home. <br/>
This is a very difficult thing for me to do, to ask for help.<br/>

</p><p>By the end of
the year 2013, after her wedding, my sister Olga Ulinici (Haretonenco) was
diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia at only 25. The wish to have a happy
and healthy family, to become a mother, to have kids and enjoy life… all that
was gone… Two years of treatment for leukemia at The Institute of Oncology from
Chisinau, Republic of Moldova remained without any positive results. We felt
that the world in crumbling, because when someone you love has such a disease,
you share the pain, the suffering and the hopes, but none of us was going to
give up. So on 8 July 2015 she was hospitalized in the Clinical Institute
Fundeni in Bucharest Romania, at the Center of hematology and bone marrow
transplantation. We have put all our hope and found there a rescue and acure
for Olga. The doctors have taken the decision to save my sisters life and we
are very grateful for being given such a chance. I was ready to do anything for
her – my sister, my best friend, my childhood adventure partner, my support and
my role model. We were blessed and the results of the analysis of my stem cell
research were good, it turned out that I am a 100% compatible donor, so Olga
can get a transplantation of the bone marrow from me. I remembered seeing her
on her wedding day – how beautiful and happy she was. How she hold her husband’s
hand, dreaming of a life she now might never have. I remembered her telling me
about the plans that they made together - having a boy and a girl, a nice, cosy
home, succeeding as a good jurist, as she is tremendously talented. But the
disease stole it all from her. It was the best news in the world for our family
and Olga’s husband, but soon we found that stem cell transplantation is a
complicated and risky procedure and a very expensive at the same time. In the
previous years our family has not only sleepless nights, but also incurred huge
expenses. We can’t afford this procedure on our own. Olga is not a Romanian
citizen, so she doesn’t have a medical insurance that could have covered at
least some expenses. All I want is to bring back Olga’s smile and now it is
possible, but I can’t do it on my own. I need help… I need your help. Saving
Olga, you will not only save a young woman, you will save us – her family, her
future children, her friends and all other people in her life she influenced in
a good way and inspired. We believe… We hope</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
""I want to make handSteady affordable and available"" Chris Peacock - Inventor
A successful campaign will allow me to place a much larger factory order dramatically reducing the price of handSteady to £15 per cup (approx $23 US), bringing the joy of a comfortable, hot and safe cuppa within reach of the elderly, seniors and thousands of people with Essential Tremor, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) symptoms, Arthritis, wrist weakness, Stroke, Muscular Dystrophy, Parkinson's, MND and other conditions.





US NBC News highlights the passion behind the handSteady invention.
""I always admired great design and the challenge of a family member suffering Parkinson's inspired me to gain an Industrial Design Engineering Masters at the Royal College of Art where I invented the handSteady solution, supported by Guys and St. Thomas's Charity"", Chris Peacock

  






Hundreds of happy handSteady customers, charities, support organisations and the papers love it!




   
What We Need & What You Get
Well it's really simple, a successful campaign will allow me to place a much larger factory order bringing the price right down from £40 to £15! So, by supporting the campaign you will ensure that many, many more people benefit from handSteady at an affordable price.



Our PERKS offer you the first ever handSteady cups at the new, lower price of £15 - Better than half price!! (available elsewhere at £40).
Not only can you obtain a new low price handSteady for yourself or a loved one, maybe as the perfect gift promise for Mothers Day, but how about the ultimate gift of Tea at The Ritz with your own handSteady cup for you or a group of 7 friends and the inventor Chris Peacock, or a super generous gift of handSteady cups to your local care home or favourite charity who could distribute handSteady to their members?



Please feel free to ask any questions about the Perks or the Campaign.


The Impact

Great news, the more we overfund our target, the more people will once again enjoy a hot cuppa safely and without pain. ""It’s really good. I have limited dexterity and swallowing difficulties. I like the handle because I can put all of my fingers into it and it doesn’t drop."" Vincent, Norwich
""All the participants who had used handSteady regularly felt that it offered a beneficial alternative to a static traditional mug handle"" Health Design & Technology Institute independent trial finding

Risks & Challenges
If we don't hit our target I will still deliver the promised handSteady perks as we have to many, many satisfied customers to date.

<p>Camp Pumziko is a national camp that serves multi-gendered youth ages six through seventeen and is a program of Community Aid Development (CAD), the New Afrikan People's Organization and the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement.
 The activities offered teach political, cultural and historical 
subjects while incorporating outdoor camping skills. CAD’s Camp Pumziko 
has been training youth for twenty years to become activists in their 
respective communities.  Because the coordinators are veteran liberation
 movement activists themselves, the young people gain a unique insight 
into the Civil Rights Movement and the subsequent movements, allowing 
them to analyze the strengths and challenges of individuals and 
organizations.<br/><br/>We are members of the Community Aid Development 
(CAD) New Afrikan People's Organization (NAPO), the Malcolm X Grassroots
 Movement (MXGM), New Afrikan Scout Organization (NASO) and activists 
in our communities that teach our youth about wilderness survival, self-determination
 and sustainability of culture and community from an African-centered 
perspective, all while having fun! Our staff of volunteers fly and drive
 in from around the nation to support the consistency and growth of our 
camp. </p>
<p>A vast majority of our campers rely on 
donations and sponsorship from the community to get them to camp. Our 
entire staff consists of volunteers and a large number of them take off a
 week from work in order to attend camp. </p>
<h3>That's Why We Need You!</h3>
<p>Our goal is $5,000. That amount covers half of the administrative costs 
including space, activities, supplies, equipment and food. The camp is 
fully staffed with volunteers and we have children come from cities 
around the nation. We have had children and staff attend from 
Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, Michigan, California, 
Connecticut, NY and more.</p>
<p> Your donations will help us rent a host 
camp facility, purchase insurance for the week of camp, buy supplies for
 activities, procure food and provide scholarships to campers with 
financial need. </p>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal, we will still be able to offer some scholarships to campers in need.</p>
<h3>How You Can Help!</h3>
<p>We want to encourage donations of any amount! We appreciate the words
 of encouragement that have come and the support of donations big and 
small. To let you know how much your contribution is appreciated, we 
offer small incentives as our thanks. The groups at camp are separated 
into ages by these names, Pakas (6-8 yrs), Chuis (9 and 10 yrs), Simbas 
(11 and 12 yrs) and Panthers (13-17 yrs). Our perks reflect our age 
groups and include notable mentions, photos, t-shirts and scrapbooks.</p>

 and word of mouth using the Indiegogo share tools on this page.</p>

<h1><strong>When a child loses a loved one to cancer, their world
changes forever.</strong></h1> They may feel angry, sad, confused, and above all else, alone.
<p>Cancer<i>Care</i>’s free <b>Healing Hearts Family Bereavement Camp</b> allows
families who have experienced the loss of a loved one to cancer to come
together for a weekend retreat. Each year, families spend three days at a
working dude ranch in the beautiful Poconos. Fun activities like swimming,
horseback riding, and fishing are combined with therapeutic grief activities
led by Cancer<i>Care</i> professional
oncology social workers. </p>
<p><b>“The camp is a place
where the families can come together and not feel different,”</b> explains
Cancer<i>Care</i>’s Claire Grainger, LCSW. “The kids meet others who have experienced
a similar loss and they don’t have to explain anything to one another…There are
a lot of tears, but there is also so much laughter. They’ve all found new
friends – people that understand.”</p>
<p>Less than three months after losing her husband Tom to
cancer, Jenny and her daughter signed up for the camp. Jenny shares, “I was
nervous about going since our loss was still so raw, but we’ve now attended the
Camp for the past four years and it really means so much to us to be with
others who have experienced a similar loss. It is a wonderful way for all of us
to be together to honor our loved ones. <b>We
know that everyone there understands how we feel and we’re safe to cry or laugh
with no fear, no judgment.”</b></p>
<p>Like all of Cancer<i>Care</i>’s
services, the Healing Hearts Family Bereavement Camp is offered to families
completely free of charge. That’s why we need your support to help us offer the
camp to even more families who have lost a loved one to cancer. </p>
<ul><li><p><b>A gift of
$10 can help us buy marshmallows for the kids to enjoy by campfire. </b></p></li></ul>
<ul><li><p><b>A donation

<div><b>The story:</b></div>
<p>I didn't set out to create Lemon Sole. I discovered that it was something that needed creating almost by accident, and rapidly became passionate about it and excited by the concept. A smelly training shoe changed my life.</p>
<p>I realised that whilst we regularly strap our feet into all different types of trainer and shoes, we really don't do much to look after them.  Especially with the pounding they get. And then we are surprised or annoyed when our feet and shoes get smelly or worse, get an infection like athletes foot. </p>

<br/><p>How many times have you thrown out trainers not because they are worn out but because they are too smelly?  Or been embarrassed to take them off in company. It need not be that way.</p>
<p>Lemon Sole is a 100% natural spray made with essential oils that is great for feet and helps keep shoes smelling fresh.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The story started on my honeymoon. My wife was a little upset that her favourite shoes were gaining too much of their own personality and might need throwing out; I had to agree, there were six weeks of close quarters living out of backpacks ahead of us. We were in a spa hotel that week and there were various natural oils and such like around us. In an attempt to improve the shoes, I sprayed some of the good smelling liquids into them.  As you would expect they smelt better but that was just the start.</p>

<p>They stayed smelling not just better, but good and not for a couple of days but for our entire six week adventure through Thailand, Laos and Cambodia in hot, humid tropical conditions. And having also given my own shoes the same treatment our honeymoon was free of any smelly shoe induced stresses!</p>
<p> </p>

The Basics:

I (Winemaker Bob) started small volume wine making in 2007 to indulge a long-time passion for wine, producing the award-winning Zinpiphany© Zinfandel and Rhone-styled #2red.  Passion changed to purpose after a pair of ""normal"" prostate biopsies to evaluate an elevate PSA were then followed by the diagnose of incurable prostate cancer. Determined to make the best of the situation, I created the Robert and Susan Hollander Foundation, an IRS approved 501c3 non-profit in support of prostate cancer research.  Since then, all proceeds from my wine making efforts at 2redWinery have been committed to supporting prostate cancer research through the Foundation. Help me continue my efforts with the 2015 vintage, producing great wines for you in support of prostate cancer research.

The PerksLike wine futures,  you can secure wine from the upcoming 2015 vintage.  I will be offering single bottles, mixed two-packs, half-case/6 bottles and full cases of Zinpiphany and #2red. In addition, because of the longevity and age-ability of the #2red, can you secure magnums (1.5L, equal to two standard bottles) and the ever impressive 3L jeroboam.  The just bottled 2013 #2red will also be available in big bottles.  For those of you with immediate gratification needs, you can select from my existing wine library, including some of the wines listed above.

september wordt voor mij het begin van mijn tweede carrière als voetballer. Na
in mijn jeugd wat jaren gevoetbald te hebben mag ik van de artsen weer gaan
voetballen. Onder 1 strikte voorwaarde: bescherming voor mijn ICD.</p>
<p>Die ICD
heb ik in 2007 gekregen nadat ik hartritmestoornissen bleek te hebben.
Inmiddels heb ik mijn tweede ICD. Dat ik nu een ICD heb komt omdat ik bij mijn
geboorte een hartafwijking bleek te hebben. Deze <a href=""https://www.hartstichting.nl/aangeboren-hartafwijkingen/transpositie-van-de-grote-vaten"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">transpositie
van de grote vaten</a> hebben ze toen ik 6 weken oud was, we praten over april
1985, operatief behandeld. Iets dat toen nog erg risicovol was. Maar niet
ingrijpen was sowieso geen optie. Hierdoor vielen veel dromen al meteen in
duigen. Want echt 100% zo sporten als andere lukte me nooit. Maar verder valt
er best goed mee te leven. En ook met de ICD is best te leven alleen het niet
mogen karten en mogen voetballen blijft erg vervelend. Maar in dat laatste komt
dus verandering. Er is immers inmiddels bescherming. </p>
<p>Dat die
bescherming, een Pace-Pro, er is weet ik sinds een paar weken dankzij St.
Hartekind. Ik las een artikel in de STIN , een blad voor ICD/Pacemaker dragers,
over Kian een joch van dertien met een pacemaker. Hij voetbalde ‘gewoon’ waar
ik het niet mocht van mijn artsen. Ze waren immers bang dat een bal,
ploeggenoot of tegenstander de ICD of de draden zou beschadigen. In een kolom
stond uitgelegd dat Stichting Hartekind zorg droeg voor Pace-Pro’s voor kinderen.
Voor meer informatie nam ik contact met hen op. En na diverse berichtjes heen
en weer en contact met mijn arts kwam er groen licht om te voetballen. Hiervoor
zal ik wel een Pace-Pro moeten aanschaffen. Iets dat mijn verzekeraar niet
dekt. </p>
<p>En weer
schoot Hartekind te hulp. Ze rijden 20 september mee met de Dam tot Dam
fietsclinic (<a href=""http://www.damtotdamfietsclassic.nl/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.damtotdamfietsclassic.nl/</a>)
 om geld voor kinderen die een Pace-Pro
nodig hebben op te halen. Ik heb na een paar nachtjes slapen besloten mij aan
te sluiten en de 40 KM mee te fietsen om mijn eigen Pace-Pro te betalen. Al het
geld dat ik meer inzamel gaat uiteraard naar Hartekind voor kinderen die er ook
1 nodig hebben.</p>
<p>De Pace-Pro
is een persoonlijke pacemaker/ICDbeschermer die voorkomt dat de pacemaker
beschadigd raakt of dat een draad breekt waardoor een kind opnieuw geopereerd
moet worden, met alle eventuele risico’s van dien. Met een Pace-Pro kunnen deze
kinderen dus wèl gewoon spelen en sporten. Het op maat laten maken van één Pace-Pro
kost ongeveer 900 euro. </p>

<p><b>Over aangeboren hartafwijkingen en Stichting
Hartekind</b></p>
<p>Jaarlijks
worden er ongeveer 1.500 kinderen in Nederland geboren met een aangeboren
hartafwijking (1 op de 100 baby's). Er zijn meer dan 40 verschillende typen
aangeboren hartafwijkingen, van relatief mild tot zeer ernstig en
levensbedreigend waarbij kinderen vaak direct al na de geboorte risicovolle
openhartoperaties moeten ondergaan en vaak lange tijd in het ziekenhuis
verblijven. Meer dan 50% van de kinderen zal tenminste 1 (open)hartoperatie
moeten ondergaan. Bijna 50% van de kinderen met een gecompliceerde
hartafwijking heeft een verstandelijke en/of motorische beperking met
ontwikkelingsproblematiek en 25% gaat naar speciaal onderwijs. </p>
<p>Per jaar
overlijden er in Nederland ongeveer 100 kinderen aan een aangeboren
hartafwijking maar dat is al 30% lager dan in het begin van de jaren 90.
Vroeger groeide maar 25% van deze kinderen op. Nu is meer dan 85%. </p>
<p><b>Over Stichting Hartekind</b></p>
<p>Stichting
Hartekind is in 2008 opgericht en de enige fondsenwervende organisatie die zich
alleen inzet voor onderzoek naar aangeboren hartafwijkingen. Wij zetten ons in
voor de brede groep Hartekinderen. Zo zijn er de jongste patiëntjes en hun
ouders, die zich door de schok van de diagnose in een chaotische situatie
bevinden en behoefte hebben aan meer informatie en lotgenotencontact. Of de
jongeren die, zelfs als hun medische situatie stabiliseert, toch moeite kunnen
hebben met dingen die voor andere kinderen heel gewoon zijn, zoals opleiding of
sporten.</p>
<p>Onze
doelstellingen zijn betere medische kansen te bieden voor Hartekinderen en het
verbeteren van de dagelijkse situatie van Hartekinderen waarbij de kwaliteit
van leven centraal staat. Dit willen we bereiken door het stimuleren en
financieren van relevant (medisch) onderzoek en het (onder)steunen van
projecten en initiatieven om de kwaliteit van leven van Hartekinderen te
verbeteren. De Pace-Pro is zo’n initiatief wat helaas niet vergoed wordt door
de zorgverzekeraar.</p><p><br/></p><p><b>ENGLISH</b></p><p><b></b></p><p></p><p>September 20th

""Before Team Serendipity entered the race, when we imagined who we want to be in mur 60s our short list included the words “alive”, “retired” and “tolerably good at bridge”. Then Team Serendipity applied for the R2AK and our list is now lies in the bottom of the recycling bin, a crumpled up ball of college-ruled shame. Team Serendipity is comprised of two 60+ year old organic farmers who are revisiting their lifetime of watery achievement and entering the R2AK to promote healthy, muscle powered sports for those over 60.

<p>At fifteen I became a vegetarian, cut
my chemically straightened hair and never looked back. I was on a mission to
learn everything I could about alternatives to the onslaught
of chemical exposure in food and personal care products. </p>
<p>Of coarse this was much to the chagrin
of my family and I was met with serious opposition and dismissal. Many of these
toxic substances had come to be associated with privilege and civility and
folks were none too excited to release them. </p>
<p>I had no idea that in 20 years or so
there would be a mass exodus of women (and men) of color, who would say no to the toxic
hair chemicals, skin lighteners and harmful personal care products that have
plagued our lives and our health for so long. </p>
<p>If you had told me then that millions of
women would embrace their unique curly kinky hair and their diverse
complexions, I simply wouldn’t have believed you. But that day <i>has</i> come and I’m <i>so</i> proud to be part of this movement by
providing you with natural alternatives for skin and hair care.  <br/></p>

remedies from Africa, Asia and the Americas that have proven effective for
healthy skin/hair. <br/><br/>The Apothecary launched in 2012 and it really excites me that this business has grown

<p><b>Summary</b></p>
<p>As of today, August 25, 2015 we have received an additional $5475 in check donations to CHIMES bringing our total to $9,055,    We have reached 72% of our goal.  Thank you all!</p><p>Helping build community-based healthcare
in one of the most remote, rural and poor areas of Honduras has been the focus
of CHIMES, California Honduras Institute for Medical and Educational Support
since 2005. Our volunteers assisted the Garifuna community in building the
first-ever out-patient facility in the region, the Ciriboya Medical Center.</p>
<p>The community-based center empowers the
community, particularly women, in addition to providing
previously non-existent health services for the poor. </p>
<p>In 2013, Dr. Luther Harry began
construction of two more buildings at the center; a Birthing Center and a
Surgery Center. The Surgery Center construction is furthest along.  It
is in urgent need of a roof, before the rainy season in October.</p>
<p>That’s
where you come in!  With your help we can raise the roof and
protect what’s been built so far.
With a roof, progress on the building can continue.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We must raise $12,500  in the next 40 days for supplies and
labor to put the roof on the Surgery Center. That
could be 500 people contributing $25 each.</p>
<p>Your contribution of $25 or whatever you
can afford, will make a world of difference to tens of thousands of people
in the region.</p>
<p>Your donation is an essential part the
continuing transformative changes in the Garifuna community's physical and
emotional strength as a result of the center's work. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we will
prioritize protecting the structure from the heavy rains of fall and winter.</p><p>We will keep you updated through e-mail on further developments
of the center and its services through CHIMES.<span> 
Because CHIMES is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization, your gift is
tax deductible.</span></p><p></p><p><b>Impact</b></p>
<p>Your contribution to the raising of the
roof on the new Surgery Center is the indispensable next step in continuing the
improvement of access to essential medical care for the Garifuna people and
their neighbors in the Iriona region of the state of Colon.</p>
<p>Not long ago poor families didn’t name their children until they were two years old
because so many died before that age.  Most
were anemic and all had intestinal worms.</p>
<p>With over 800,000 medical visits since
the center’s inception, women
are not dying in child birth and infant mortality has been reduced.</p>
<p>Your contribution now, will literally,
be a life or death matter for some people with traumatic illness or injury,
simply because of time. </p>
<p>Currently, it is a two-hour drive over
rough roads and rivers with a cement ford, assuming a vehicle is available, to the nearest hospital.
These roads become impassable during the long winter rainy season.</p>
<p>Building community-based health care is
making a lasting world of difference. The center is training people as medical
professionals. </p>
<p>With local residents trained and
employed in the center, communication is optimized and services most
effectively focused.</p>
<p>Over half the students training as
Medical Doctors are women who will return to their home town to serve its citizens.<br/></p>
<p>Community classes in practical health
and hygiene provided free of charge, further empower the people. These
community roots will only be strengthened with time.</p>
<p>The success of this community-based
medical center and program are results of the foresight and tenacity of the
Garifuna people and the generosity of people like you.</p>
<p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p>Our immediate challenge is to raise
$12,500 within the next 40 days, so that roofing materials can be purchased and
delivered in time to construct the roof prior to the rainy season beginning in
October.</p>
<p>Our most immediate risk is that we don’t raise all the $12,500.In
that case, funds will be prioritized to protect what has been built through the
rainy season. Any funds in excess of $12,500 will be
used to purchase windows and doors and finish the interior of the building.</p>
<p>Broader challenges for the medical
center and the services provided are political. In Honduras, as in the U.S.A.,
funding for public services and infrastructure are in danger of being reduced
or eliminated. At the same time, privatization of both is advancing.</p>
<p>Finally, outright corruption within the
government can lead to lack of support for vital services to the people. While
these serious challenges are beyond the scope of CHIMES and may affect the rate
of progress, none of them will stop this community-based and internationally
supported project.</p>

As of today, August 25, 2015 we have received an additional $5475 in check donations to CHIMES bringing our total to $9,055,    We have reached 72% of our goal.  Thank you all!Helping build community-based healthcare
in one of the most remote, rural and poor areas of Honduras has been the focus
of CHIMES, California Honduras Institute for Medical and Educational Support
since 2005. Our volunteers assisted the Garifuna community in building the
first-ever out-patient facility in the region, the Ciriboya Medical Center.
The community-based center empowers the
community, particularly women, in addition to providing
previously non-existent health services for the poor. 
In 2013, Dr. Luther Harry began
construction of two more buildings at the center; a Birthing Center and a
Surgery Center. The Surgery Center construction is furthest along.  It
is in urgent need of a roof, before the rainy season in October.
That’s
where you come in!  With your help we can raise the roof and
protect what’s been built so far.
With a roof, progress on the building can continue.
What We Need & What You Get
We must raise $12,500  in the next 40 days for supplies and
labor to put the roof on the Surgery Center. That
could be 500 people contributing $25 each.
Your contribution of $25 or whatever you
can afford, will make a world of difference to tens of thousands of people
in the region.
Your donation is an essential part the
continuing transformative changes in the Garifuna community's physical and
emotional strength as a result of the center's work. 
If we do not reach our goal, we will
prioritize protecting the structure from the heavy rains of fall and winter.We will keep you updated through e-mail on further developments
of the center and its services through CHIMES. 
Because CHIMES is a 501 (c) (3) non-profit organization, your gift is
tax deductible.Impact
Your contribution to the raising of the
roof on the new Surgery Center is the indispensable next step in continuing the
improvement of access to essential medical care for the Garifuna people and
their neighbors in the Iriona region of the state of Colon.
Not long ago poor families didn’t name their children until they were two years old
because so many died before that age.  Most
were anemic and all had intestinal worms.
With over 800,000 medical visits since
the center’s inception, women
are not dying in child birth and infant mortality has been reduced.
Your contribution now, will literally,
be a life or death matter for some people with traumatic illness or injury,
simply because of time. 
Currently, it is a two-hour drive over
rough roads and rivers with a cement ford, assuming a vehicle is available, to the nearest hospital.
These roads become impassable during the long winter rainy season.
Building community-based health care is
making a lasting world of difference. The center is training people as medical
professionals. 
With local residents trained and
employed in the center, communication is optimized and services most
effectively focused.
Over half the students training as
Medical Doctors are women who will return to their home town to serve its citizens.
Community classes in practical health
and hygiene provided free of charge, further empower the people. These
community roots will only be strengthened with time.
The success of this community-based
medical center and program are results of the foresight and tenacity of the
Garifuna people and the generosity of people like you.
Risks and Challenges
Our immediate challenge is to raise
$12,500 within the next 40 days, so that roofing materials can be purchased and
delivered in time to construct the roof prior to the rainy season beginning in
October.
Our most immediate risk is that we don’t raise all the $12,500.In
that case, funds will be prioritized to protect what has been built through the
rainy season. Any funds in excess of $12,500 will be
used to purchase windows and doors and finish the interior of the building.
Broader challenges for the medical
center and the services provided are political. In Honduras, as in the U.S.A.,
funding for public services and infrastructure are in danger of being reduced
or eliminated. At the same time, privatization of both is advancing.
Finally, outright corruption within the
government can lead to lack of support for vital services to the people. While
these serious challenges are beyond the scope of CHIMES and may affect the rate
of progress, none of them will stop this community-based and internationally
supported project.

</div><p>On April 25th, a powerful earthquake
devastated the country of Nepal, killing more than 2,500 people and affecting
thousands more. The earthquake had a devastating effect on the entire country,
including the already inadequate clean water supply. Earthquakes often cause
damage to wells and water systems, which are a major source of fresh water for
the people of Nepal.</p>
<p><u>Who Are We </u></p>
<p>Droppure is one of the largest manufacturers of water
filtration bottles in India. It is our belief that drinking water is a key
component to health and that everyone should have access to clean water. </p>
<p>Apart from selling our filtration bottles commercially, Over
the past One and Half years we have worked on almost every major disaster Earthquake/Tsunami's
and Floods in India and around Indian subcontinent.</p>
<p>These strikes entail us providing access to clean water
by distributing Portable Water Filtration Bottles to community centers, refugee
camps, and individual families in these areas</p>
<p>Our initial goal with any project like this is to help
mitigate the immediate suffering by providing victims with access to safe
water.</p>
<p><u>The Plan</u></p>
<p>Through our Water charity program, Droppure is looking to
donate several drinking water filtration systems to quake victims. </p>
<p>Our initial goal with
any project like this is to help mitigate the immediate suffering by providing
victims with access to safe water. Once we have boots on the ground, and the
framework of our program there is built, we will start to develop/implement
long term programs that can be managed and built upon, locally. It is really no
different than the work we have done (and continue to do) in different locations
around the world.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>The first
phase is urgent in nature and made up of multiple strategic strikes into the
hardest hit areas of the disaster zone. These strikes entail us providing
access to clean water by distributing portable water filtration systems to
community centers, refugee camps, and individual families in these areas.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span> The second phase, though still providing
relief, consists of expanding the program by implementing more long term
solutions ­ such as rain-water harvesting systems on schools and medical
clinics, restoring dead wells/pumps, and actively seeking out new regions of
need beyond ground zero.</p>
<p>Our team will be on the
ground by mid of next week with at least 5000 clean-­water filtration bottles (Out
of which 2500 will be donated by Droppure) which can provide quake victims with
access to clean water, almost immediately. </p>
<p>However, our goal is to
get as many of Droppure filtration bottles to ground zero as possible. This
will all depend on the support that follows our initial launch this coming
week. </p>
<p><u>About Droppure Filtration Bottles</u></p>
<p>No
more digging wells if there is a water source, no constructing sand filters,
and no more purification chemicals. No one has to boil their water to make it
safe ever again. <br/>
<br/>
Families are able to get absolute clean drinking water just by squeezing the
water bottle. All they have to do is to open the bottle lid, fill the water
bottle with any water available and then squeeze out the water from the bottle
after closing the lid on the bottle. <span>The
fast flow rate mean anyone, anywhere can have clean water in a matter of
seconds. <br/>
<br/>
The DROPPURE WATER FILTRATION BOTTLE is a POINT-OF-USE SYSTEM. Since there is
such a high flow rate, it eliminates the need to store water which reduces the
chances of water being contaminated after it's filtered. The only external
force required for the system to function is by squeezing the bottle.</span></p>
<p>The
water from the bottle can not only be used for drinking water but also for
cooking. Though this bottle is for self consumption, but can be used to
provide clean water to others in urgent need by squeezing water out of the
bottle<br/>

Droppure filters deliver absolute micron biological filtration, removing 99.9%
of all bacteria like Salmonella, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae and Salmonella typhi

<p><b><br/>Dear Friends,</b></p>
<p>Today’s health care system remains mostly divided into various health spheres: one for your body, one for your brain, another for your emotions. Nowhere is this outmoded reality more evident than in the area known as mental health. As a result of these arbitrary divisions, far too many people face emotional challenges that continue to go unchecked. We are being conditioned to believe that having emotional challenges means you have a mental illness. With your help, together we can change this. By changing the way we think about and approach health. Let’s start focusing on whole health!</p>

Let's Start Focusing on Whole Health!


Many people are affected by life’s challenges. 


When you think about your own life and those you love, can you relate to how destructive and damaging emotions and stress, resulting from the following, affect dally living? 





the devastating results of depression, 


the inability to cope with grief, 


anxiety interfering with daily functioning


feelings of worthlessness due to low self esteem, 


the trauma of dealing with cancer, 


managing chronic pain, 


the impact of financial burdens, 


life and business devastation, 


communication and interpersonal relationship issues, 


conveying hope to what seems like hopeless situations.




Would you like to  be a part of changing the way we focus on health? 


Your contribution will support the LIVE WELL TODAY online consumer engagement network that offers the tools and guidance positively impacting your life and the lives of those you love. 




Dear Friends,
Today’s health care system remains mostly divided into various health spheres: one for your body, one for your brain, another for your emotions. Nowhere is this outmoded reality more evident than in the area known as mental health. As a result of these arbitrary divisions, far too many people face emotional challenges that continue to go unchecked. We are being conditioned to believe that having emotional challenges means you have a mental illness. With your help, together we can change this. By changing the way we think about and approach health. Let’s start focusing on whole health!
PROBLEM - MENTAL HEALTH COST TO SOCIETY 




PROBLEM - CONVENTIONAL MEDICINE NOT ALWAY THE BEST REMEDY
PROBLEM - CAM (Complementary and Alternative Medicine) IS FRAGMENTED AND TRAINING VARIES


PROBLEM - FINANCIAL, OCCUPATIONAL, SOCIAL, AND SPIRITUAL HEALTH IS OVERLOOKED
PROBLEM - NO COLLABORATION IN HEALTH CARE

SOLUTION - “LIVE WELL TODAY” . . . a web portal to support Whole Health.






LIVE WELL TODAY (a division of Holistic Health Services Inc.) is a web portal where accredited professionals can interact with those seeking their help and support. The aim is to develop a truly comprehensive online network that links online collaborative care with consumer engagement.
Emotional-intellectual problems often result from many factors: unhealthy relationships, poor diet, lack of physical activity, financial stress, work issues, social isolation and lack of spiritual connection or a sense of life’s purpose. When left unchecked, we can become unhealthy and the various components of the whole self begin to suffer. Keeping the mind, body and spirit in balance is what helps to keep us healthy and whole. 
By developing an all-inclusive membership platform that links and serves both accredited professionals who work in emotional-intellectual health—as well as physical, financial, complementary, occupational, social, and spiritual health—with a growing population seeking their help and support, we will help millions of people to live well today, in mind, body and spirit. 
Every member, professional and consumers alike will benefit from the services offered through LIVE WELL TODAY.


What We Need & What You Get
We are seeking $52,000. Every dollar goes into program development to make LIVE WELL TODAY interactive, exciting and unique. 
All funds raised will be used to develop a user-friendly comprehensive web portal with a variety of support mechanisms for members to ENGAGE, ENERGIZE and EMPOWER. Our focus is whole health!
We need YOU - We need you to make this a reality. Studies show that we need to address whole health in order to create and sustain balance and LIVE WELL TODAY.

<p>Ayahuasca is the most common name for a medicinal plant beverage used by indigenous tribes throughout the western Amazon
rainforest.  This unique medicine is consumed in healing ceremonies led by trained shaman, called curanderos.  Ayahuasca ceremonies
form the foundation of an ancient medical tradition, one that is still
currently employed and developed in the Amazon region, most especially in Peru.  </p>
<p>In these ceremonies, curanderos sing particular songs, called icaros, to communicate with the spirits of plants and animals, and through their work with ayahuasca, it is possible to
have out of body experiences, to see inside the physical body to diagnose
conditions, to relive past events and release emotional traumas, to find
solutions or cures for afflictions using various plant treatments, and to
better understand one’s life, path, and existence.  Beyond the ceremonies, the healing tradition is a vast science of holistic medicine, rooted in a different paradigm than modern science, that treats the body, mind, and spirit using an array of natural plant remedies and traditional practices.  </p>
<p>While
some research on the botanical, chemical, and pharmacological aspects of
ayahuasca has been conducted and published in peer-reviewed scientific
journals, little to no research has been done on the healing tradition, called curanderismo, within which ayahuasca is only a part.  Therefore, the goal of the Riosbo Ayahuasca
Research Center will be to better understand the ideology and methodology of the indigenous healing tradition so
that new models can be developed that integrate ancient traditional principles into modern medical practices to enhance the healing benefit of any and all treatment.</p>

a legacy for generations to come. </span></p><p></p>
<p>The myhealthjourney system comprises of a website, app,""in clinic"" loyalty program and healthcare coaching/coordination service. We license technology from the University
of New South Wales, a premier University in Sydney, Australia and we have
some of the world’s leading Healthcare professionals and entrepreneurs on our
team. Testing with Diabetic patients has shown control of Diabetes within 6 months and a reduction in Healthcare costs by 50%!</p>
<p>Our vision is to create a global, low cost, effective healthcare
system. Our goal is to help one billion users within 10 years. </p>
<h2><b>The many problems facing our
healthcare system  </b></h2>
<h4><b>Worldwide over 100 million people per
year fall into poverty because of healthcare costs. In America 62% of all
bankruptcies are due to medical bills!<sup> </sup></b></h4>
<p>The world’s
healthcare system is sick and needs an overhaul! So why is it so slow to change?
Well healthcare is complex with multiple stakeholders each with different,
often conflicting demands.</p>
<p>Long wait queues
with increasing costs in hospitals and clinics typify the current healthcare
system around the world. Payers be they individuals, governments or Insurance
companies have limited and reducing funds to pay for healthcare, while
healthcare professionals require to be adequately compensated for their years
of study and dedicated work. The patient often becomes the “meat in the
sandwich” being provided sub optimal care even with the best intentions of both
the payer and healthcare professional. This leads to unnecessary suffering, prolonging disease and many preventable deaths.</p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>How myhealthjourney.com addresses the problem</b></h2>
<h3><b>Our early testing shows myhealthjourney can save the average member up to 50%
in Healthcare costs while improving health outcomes. </b></h3>
<p>There are enough healthcare professionals in the world, combined with our improved communications and travel to provide healthcare for the entire world within a week! We have the resources, the solution involves a better, faster reallocation of resources, including funding. </p><p><span>Let’s face it
you and your love ones will someday have a medical emergency. Achieving the best
care depends on how well you are connected to Healthcare professionals and how
much you can afford. Myhealthjourney aims to help provide both these elements.</span></p><p></p>
<p>myhealthjourney connects patients to healthcare professionals to form health teams, provides  health coaching services (for the chronically ill)   and alternate funding channels for patients. Funding channels include a loyalty program for patients (myhealthbanc.com), crowdfunding,  charity type events and other ways to pay for healthcare costs. Our
system pays for any health related expenses including preventative healthcare
costs such as gyms fees, insurance costs and any co-payment fees.
Myhealthjourney also improves the efficiency and effectiveness in healthcare by providing the
ability for “on demand” video consultations as well as in clinic bookings.  This makes contacting your healthcare practitioner faster and cheaper. </p><p><b>Our early tests show the myhealthjourney system can greatly improve patients with type 2 Diabetes within 6 months while reducing the out of pocket costs by 50-100%. </b></p>
<p>
</p><h2><b>Finding the best ways to Treat and Cure disease</b></h2>
<p>Have you ever
heard of the person who was cured from a disease in an
unconventional way? Yes this happens, but there is often not enough scientific
evidence to prove it. Our platform will allow a patients “health journey” to be
analysed to scientifically discover cures or to find the best ways to treat a
disease. The key is to analyse a large number of patients creating large data sets. With myhealthjourney and your help this can be a reality. We will be targeting chronic disease states and can help when a
pandemic situation occurs to quickly find the solution connecting patients with
researchers and Healthcare Professionals.</p>

<p>We have been testing now for almost 3 years and we are at a stage

America this year after extensive testing in Australia. Our dedicated team have

more productive economies and better societies.  </p>

cost of healthcare, improve health outcomes and find cures to
disease along the way. Our system can save lives, minimise suffering and leave
a legacy for generations to come. 
The myhealthjourney system comprises of a website, app,""in clinic"" loyalty program and healthcare coaching/coordination service. We license technology from the University
of New South Wales, a premier University in Sydney, Australia and we have
some of the world’s leading Healthcare professionals and entrepreneurs on our
team. Testing with Diabetic patients has shown control of Diabetes within 6 months and a reduction in Healthcare costs by 50%!
Our vision is to create a global, low cost, effective healthcare
system. Our goal is to help one billion users within 10 years. 
The many problems facing our
healthcare system  
Worldwide over 100 million people per
year fall into poverty because of healthcare costs. In America 62% of all
bankruptcies are due to medical bills! 
The world’s
healthcare system is sick and needs an overhaul! So why is it so slow to change?
Well healthcare is complex with multiple stakeholders each with different,
often conflicting demands.
Long wait queues
with increasing costs in hospitals and clinics typify the current healthcare
system around the world. Payers be they individuals, governments or Insurance
companies have limited and reducing funds to pay for healthcare, while
healthcare professionals require to be adequately compensated for their years
of study and dedicated work. The patient often becomes the “meat in the
sandwich” being provided sub optimal care even with the best intentions of both
the payer and healthcare professional. This leads to unnecessary suffering, prolonging disease and many preventable deaths.

How myhealthjourney.com addresses the problem
Our early testing shows myhealthjourney can save the average member up to 50%
in Healthcare costs while improving health outcomes. 
There are enough healthcare professionals in the world, combined with our improved communications and travel to provide healthcare for the entire world within a week! We have the resources, the solution involves a better, faster reallocation of resources, including funding. Let’s face it
you and your love ones will someday have a medical emergency. Achieving the best
care depends on how well you are connected to Healthcare professionals and how
much you can afford. Myhealthjourney aims to help provide both these elements.
myhealthjourney connects patients to healthcare professionals to form health teams, provides  health coaching services (for the chronically ill)   and alternate funding channels for patients. Funding channels include a loyalty program for patients (myhealthbanc.com), crowdfunding,  charity type events and other ways to pay for healthcare costs. Our
system pays for any health related expenses including preventative healthcare
costs such as gyms fees, insurance costs and any co-payment fees.
Myhealthjourney also improves the efficiency and effectiveness in healthcare by providing the
ability for “on demand” video consultations as well as in clinic bookings.  This makes contacting your healthcare practitioner faster and cheaper. Our early tests show the myhealthjourney system can greatly improve patients with type 2 Diabetes within 6 months while reducing the out of pocket costs by 50-100%. 

Finding the best ways to Treat and Cure disease
Have you ever
heard of the person who was cured from a disease in an
unconventional way? Yes this happens, but there is often not enough scientific
evidence to prove it. Our platform will allow a patients “health journey” to be
analysed to scientifically discover cures or to find the best ways to treat a
disease. The key is to analyse a large number of patients creating large data sets. With myhealthjourney and your help this can be a reality. We will be targeting chronic disease states and can help when a
pandemic situation occurs to quickly find the solution connecting patients with
researchers and Healthcare Professionals.
So what do we need to make
myhealthjourney.com a reality?
We have been testing now for almost 3 years and we are at a stage
where we either give up or find more funding. Our aim is to launch in
America this year after extensive testing in Australia. Our dedicated team have
put their own money and time into the project and we now need more help.
Specifically we need more funding and more awareness of what we are doing. 

Your Impact …leave your legacy
Your sponsorship will
save lives, stop suffering and finds cures to disease
Through your sponsorship together,
we will help more people around the world have faster and more effective access
to healthcare, saving lives and reduce unnecessary suffering.  We will find cures to disease that are right
now unknown and help those with diseases get better treatment. 
With your help we will create a world where our patients can
live their lives to their fullest potential. This results in happier families,
more productive economies and better societies.  
Your investment is important in our goal of helping a
billion people in 10 years. Any sponsorships above $500 will result in your name
immortalised on our founding contributor’s wall which will be on our site forever.

Other ways you can help …..The first 300 people  to refer us to 2 friends (and pledge a modest $1) will receive a $50 credit towards their healthcare costs.
The challenges to reach our vision are significant but not

What is Nutritional Balancing?




Nutritional Balancing is a newer method 
of healing that is a synthesis of many modern and ancient healing 
sciences. In many cases, it is able to cause healing at very deep levels
 by delicately balancing the body chemistry and increasing the body’s 
adaptive energy level.Nutritional balancing integrates nutrition (a specific diet for your metabolic type), the proper type and amount of drinking water, natural detoxification, light exercise, healthy lifestyle, meditation and personal growth into a whole system healing path based on your own personal mineral profile. Using a simple Hair Tissue Mineral Analysis your profile reveals the mineral imbalances in your body that can reduce your longevity and vitality. In addition, mineral imbalances can lead to all kinds of emotional, mental and physical health conditions.
Our healing program brings your body and mind back into a state of balance by helping to restore the body's enzyme systems. Nutrient minerals return toward ideal levels while toxic metals are reduced, thus increasing your vitality. Higher vitality means higher resistance to disease and can even help extend your life.

The concentrated mist effectively gets to those hard-to-reach places.Mist HeadThe vaporizing technology within the Mist Head spreads nanometer particles of electrolyzed water that are lighter than air. These tiny droplets are 50,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair, and essentially float around the room and capture harmful particles. MediQ can clean and sterilize anytime and anyplace, inside and outside of your home!Use it in your car, on the plane, in mass transit and more. Wash fresh fruits and vegetables to remove pesticides, clean baby’s and pet’s toys, and purify the air around you.Home & OfficeClean your floors, furniture and door handles.

<p>I thought we ate pretty healthy, but little did I know at the time that her gut health was likely compromised  since birth, when I was put on broad spectrum antibiotics - as so many are! <i><strong>Researchers estimate that over 40% of women are given an antibiotic immediately before delivery.  By the time my daughter was 3 years old, she had been on a course of antibiotics, and her palate started getting pickier.  </strong></i></p>

<p>Once we finally put the pieces together, we did lab testing for her which found <strong>significant gut imbalance. including candida (yeast overgrowth) and  low levels of good bacteria...</strong> I was ready to make some <i>serious changes!</i> And once I explained it to my daughter, she was on board too... she wanted to help her ""good buggies"" win. </p>

</div><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i>Here's to Happy, Healthy, Kids!</i></h2></div>","I developed The Good Buggies initially with no other goal in mind other than to help my own daughter.  When she was 3 years old, I had discovered that her gut health was the root cause behind the tantrums, rashes,  and chronic inflammation she had developed. 
I thought we ate pretty healthy, but little did I know at the time that her gut health was likely compromised  since birth, when I was put on broad spectrum antibiotics - as so many are! Researchers estimate that over 40% of women are given an antibiotic immediately before delivery.  By the time my daughter was 3 years old, she had been on a course of antibiotics, and her palate started getting pickier.  

Once we finally put the pieces together, we did lab testing for her which found significant gut imbalance. including candida (yeast overgrowth) and  low levels of good bacteria... I was ready to make some serious changes! And once I explained it to my daughter, she was on board too... she wanted to help her ""good buggies"" win. 
 
But we still had some major problems when it came time to giving her probiotics... aka ""good buggies"":
 
So, we had to go back to square one. In order to find the best probiotic, I thought about how to get probiotics naturally, WITHOUT a supplement.
And I found the answer...
FERMENTED FOODS!
Historians have traced fermented foods back THOUSANDS of years, and up until a couple of generations ago, our ancestors used to eat fermented foods daily - so they were ""taking their probiotics"" naturally every single day!

 
When we eat those raw, fermented foods, we are taking in TONS of good bacteria that are live and active - they are STRONG, and get to work right away!   

But what about the probiotic supplements? Aren't they ""live"" too?  Those powders, gummies, and chewables might ""technically"" be live, but they are certainly not active - most probiotic supplements are completely dormant because they've been so highly processed.  
This means the good bacteria in them are very weak, and need to slowly ""wake up"" and come alive again once they make it through to the gut (many of those won't even survive that far... which is why those probiotics need to be loaded up with billions of CFU!).
 
But most children these days don't want to eat raw sauerkraut and kimchi every day...
 
That was my problem! And I worked hard to solve it, and my goal is to help even more kids in the process...
A fermented food-based probiotic... that is KID-APPROVED!

 
I couldn’t find a product anything like what I was looking for, so I decided to partner with a lab and create it myself!

<strong>Fully Adjustable</strong>: allowing the user to quickly adjust the unit to desired need</li>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Upright Advantage</strong></h2>
<p>The ""Upright Advantage"" is a term we use to describe the benefits of the wall-mounted KTS. KTS and the Upright Advantage fully avoids problems with ground-based movements and tools, such as foam rollers, balls of all sorts of shapes, sizes and hardness. Using tennis and lacrosse balls on the ground and on the wall is very difficult and not very effective. The ground is hard to maneuver, you cannot control pressure, the floor is dirty and makes it difficult to target specific areas, especially if you are dealing with pain.</p>
<p>The Upright Advantage gets users off the ground and allows them to control the pressure onto the targeted muscles with ease and adjust massage units to desired position, all while muscles are in a more relaxed state to increase results. A system with the ease of use and adjustability of KTS encourages and promotes more frequent use and allows the user to enjoy the same benefits as a massage multiple times a day. The ease of use KTS offers allows all markets to enjoy the benefits it can bring, including chronic pain sufferers, patients with neurological conditions, patients with degenerative disk disease, obese, athletes, office employees and the list goes on.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is Self Myofascial Release (SMR)?</strong></h2>
<p>Fascia is a tough connective tissue that is found throughout the body that surrounds and attaches to all structures from head to toe. When healthy, it can stretch and move without restriction. Trauma such as poor posture, sports, car accidents, working in front of a computer daily etc cause the Fascia to become stressed, cause inflammation, and adhesions form (commonly referred to as Trigger Points). The formation of adhesions can cause pain, muscle imbalances, reduced blood flow to surrounding muscles and tissue and prevent recovery. The Fascia becomes tight and restricted and enables tension to grow in the rest of the body.</p>

<p>I'm Scott Steven the inventor of Knot Therapy Systems (KTS). My motivation for creating KTS came from suffering back pain for over 20 years and spending countless hours on every imaginable therapy to relieve my back pain. When the therapies worked, and I got to the point where I was pain free, I wanted a method to prevent these annoying and painful injuries from reoccurring.</p>
<p>Being a golf professional made it challenging to address my back pain as the golf swing movement in itself is not exactly good for the spine. I saw numerous therapists who all stressed the importance of massage, stretching, foam rollers, therapy balls, and more to keep my muscles loose and to address any sore spots right away. I started rolling my back out on tennis and lacrosse balls on the ground and against a wall, and would get very frustrated. I wanted to come up with a way to keep the ball stationary so that I could better and more easily target specific sore spots on my back. This was the beginning of KTS.</p>
<p>I quickly went to work on a prototype at my family's machine shop, and within a few hours I had a working product as shown (pic). As soon as I mounted it and used it for the first time, I knew immediately that it exceeded my expectations, and it had an immediate impact on my golf game, as well. I was able to completely control pressure and angles, and I had the ability to target very specific areas on my back, arms, neck, and shoulders. My weakness has always been lower back (specifically L4 and L5) and with KTS, I was finally able to really target my piriformis muscle (a contributor to lower back tightness) like never before.  It is something that is part of my daily routine as I use it every morning, after work, and before I go to bed, usually for about a minute each time.  </p>

Problems with products on the ground:

Difficult to maneuver
Can't control pressure
Painful 
Let's face it- most people deal with pain and injuries at home and most products in this space are designed to be mobile which has significant challenges.   Knot Therapy Systems was specifically designed for effectiveness and ease of use in mind

 
 
Frustration using these products led to the creation of Knot Therapy Systems (KTS).  So what is special about KTS?


Wall-Mounted: gets the user off the ground and allows user to control pressure 

Fully Adjustable: allowing the user to quickly adjust the unit to desired need

Multiple Attachments: allowing user to target specific areas or massage a general area
Simply put, KTS is the fastest and most effective way to get rid of Knots or Trigger Points through Self-Massage Period.

 
 
 
 
 
Why KTS?

The Truth About Back Pain
The number of Americans experiencing lower back pain and problems is on the rise. Typically, 54% of Americans who experience low back pain spend the majority of their workday sitting. Here's the lowdown on back pain in America and the reasons why KTS offers relief for so many.




 
 
 
 
 
 
The Upright Advantage
The ""Upright Advantage"" is a term we use to describe the benefits of the wall-mounted KTS. KTS and the Upright Advantage fully avoids problems with ground-based movements and tools, such as foam rollers, balls of all sorts of shapes, sizes and hardness. Using tennis and lacrosse balls on the ground and on the wall is very difficult and not very effective. The ground is hard to maneuver, you cannot control pressure, the floor is dirty and makes it difficult to target specific areas, especially if you are dealing with pain.
The Upright Advantage gets users off the ground and allows them to control the pressure onto the targeted muscles with ease and adjust massage units to desired position, all while muscles are in a more relaxed state to increase results. A system with the ease of use and adjustability of KTS encourages and promotes more frequent use and allows the user to enjoy the same benefits as a massage multiple times a day. The ease of use KTS offers allows all markets to enjoy the benefits it can bring, including chronic pain sufferers, patients with neurological conditions, patients with degenerative disk disease, obese, athletes, office employees and the list goes on.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Using KTS for Back Pain


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What is Self Myofascial Release (SMR)?
Fascia is a tough connective tissue that is found throughout the body that surrounds and attaches to all structures from head to toe. When healthy, it can stretch and move without restriction. Trauma such as poor posture, sports, car accidents, working in front of a computer daily etc cause the Fascia to become stressed, cause inflammation, and adhesions form (commonly referred to as Trigger Points). The formation of adhesions can cause pain, muscle imbalances, reduced blood flow to surrounding muscles and tissue and prevent recovery. The Fascia becomes tight and restricted and enables tension to grow in the rest of the body.

The Benefits of KTS

User controls pressure which allows the user to find difficult to get to knots
Easily adjusts and can get to knots from head to toe
Stationary ball away from the wall allows the user to dig into the tissue and pin down knots
Multiple attachments allow the user to use the system as a massage tool or if you have a specific area of pain you can target that, as well
Wall mounted allows the user to to easily find knots and use movement to breakdown those knots.  Ease of use promotes daily use.
Therapy band Ring-Attachment allows the user to use bands to increase desired pressure and get deep into the tissue.
KTS system can double as a piece of exercise equipment.

The Knot Therapy Systems Story

I'm Scott Steven the inventor of Knot Therapy Systems (KTS). My motivation for creating KTS came from suffering back pain for over 20 years and spending countless hours on every imaginable therapy to relieve my back pain. When the therapies worked, and I got to the point where I was pain free, I wanted a method to prevent these annoying and painful injuries from reoccurring.
Being a golf professional made it challenging to address my back pain as the golf swing movement in itself is not exactly good for the spine. I saw numerous therapists who all stressed the importance of massage, stretching, foam rollers, therapy balls, and more to keep my muscles loose and to address any sore spots right away. I started rolling my back out on tennis and lacrosse balls on the ground and against a wall, and would get very frustrated. I wanted to come up with a way to keep the ball stationary so that I could better and more easily target specific sore spots on my back. This was the beginning of KTS.
I quickly went to work on a prototype at my family's machine shop, and within a few hours I had a working product as shown (pic). As soon as I mounted it and used it for the first time, I knew immediately that it exceeded my expectations, and it had an immediate impact on my golf game, as well. I was able to completely control pressure and angles, and I had the ability to target very specific areas on my back, arms, neck, and shoulders. My weakness has always been lower back (specifically L4 and L5) and with KTS, I was finally able to really target my piriformis muscle (a contributor to lower back tightness) like never before.  It is something that is part of my daily routine as I use it every morning, after work, and before I go to bed, usually for about a minute each time.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Importance of Prevention

This campaign is especially important to me as I believe so many injuries and muscular related problems could be prevented if more time was spent taking care of your healthy body as opposed to taking care of it when it breaks down. KTS does exactly that:

KTS allows you to quickly and comfortably treat pain and injuries, prevent injuries, increase range of motion, and correct muscle imbalances.
KTS not only addresses problems as they come up, but used on a daily basis KTS can help prevent future problems. Using KTS even 2-3 minutes a day can significantly reduce recurring injuries and revent new problems from occurring. 

By supporting this campaign you will be contributing to the injury prevention movement which, in the real world, is an area that most people do not focus enough of their time and energy on. At KTS, we believe you will be so satisfied with the results and ease of use of this product that you will be buying it for others, as well.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Jannah Hancock. I want to inspire you to live your best life! I am a Health and Wellness Coach, Podcaster and the author of “<strong>Feel GOOD and GET Tough with Your HEALTH</strong>”. I am passionate about Health and Wellness. Feel GOOD and GET Tough is about feeling good about the choices you make by using self-discipline to accomplish your goals. This concept can be applied to all areas of your life and can help you accomplish goals you thought were impossible. What this campaign is about is helping me build a community that can support each other on their journey to become happier, healthier and how to enjoy living a life you love to the fullest every single day. This is about coming together with common goals to help each other in discovering your passion and what drives you and help support you in accomplishing what's most important in your life. </p>
<p>Over the last 15 years I dedicated my life to resolving my own health issues. I wasn't getting satisfactory results with medications. I started keeping a journal of what I was eating and I discovered the <i>secret to feeling good</i> <u><i>is about the foods you eat</i></u>. I have found the key to making good decisions is self-discipline.</p>
<p>My book is a new approach to how you look at food and how to enjoy a good quality of life by eating foods you like and discover what foods make you feel good. This is about asking yourself the right questions that help you to make decisions you feel good about, not just right now, but in the future. Mindset also plays a role in how successful we are in accomplishing goals. The community I want to build isn't just about food. It's about taking control of your life and empowering others to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>In this community I want to build; </strong></p>

<strong>Educational Seminars</strong> - Scheduled roll out October 2020. For everyone that wants to make positive change in their lives. Especially for those that don't have the resources to hire a proffessional coach. I believe everyone has the right to live their best life regardless of race, gender or economic status.

Hi, my name is Jannah Hancock. I want to inspire you to live your best life! I am a Health and Wellness Coach, Podcaster and the author of “Feel GOOD and GET Tough with Your HEALTH”. I am passionate about Health and Wellness. Feel GOOD and GET Tough is about feeling good about the choices you make by using self-discipline to accomplish your goals. This concept can be applied to all areas of your life and can help you accomplish goals you thought were impossible. What this campaign is about is helping me build a community that can support each other on their journey to become happier, healthier and how to enjoy living a life you love to the fullest every single day. This is about coming together with common goals to help each other in discovering your passion and what drives you and help support you in accomplishing what's most important in your life. 
Over the last 15 years I dedicated my life to resolving my own health issues. I wasn't getting satisfactory results with medications. I started keeping a journal of what I was eating and I discovered the secret to feeling good is about the foods you eat. I have found the key to making good decisions is self-discipline.
My book is a new approach to how you look at food and how to enjoy a good quality of life by eating foods you like and discover what foods make you feel good. This is about asking yourself the right questions that help you to make decisions you feel good about, not just right now, but in the future. Mindset also plays a role in how successful we are in accomplishing goals. The community I want to build isn't just about food. It's about taking control of your life and empowering others to do the same.
In this community I want to build; 


Educational Seminars - Scheduled roll out October 2020. For everyone that wants to make positive change in their lives. Especially for those that don't have the resources to hire a proffessional coach. I believe everyone has the right to live their best life regardless of race, gender or economic status. These seminars will be built on the premise of teaching you how to fish so you can adequately provide for yourself. Here are some topics;
Financial Health

Mental Mindset
Relationships

<h3>But how to keep your eyeglasses clean?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>      ✔️ Anyone who wears eyeglasses knows the problem of eyeglasses getting smudgy. It could be anything that causes the problem: <strong>Air, dust, sweat, moisture, rain, oil from skin, eyelashes, </strong>etc. Whatever may be the cause, smudgy glasses are an annoying and recurring problem for many of us.</p>
<p>     ✔️ Current Solution: For most people, the go-to solution is to use their T-shirt. Some concerned ones carry a microfiber cloth in their pocket.</p>
<p>     ✔️ Using T-Shirt/clothes to clean eyeglasses does not solve the problem. They might leave invisible scratches on the glasses.</p>
<p>     ✔️ Using microfiber cloth might sound like a good idea, but it is incomplete. A microfiber cloth in a pocket or in a purse will in itself attract small particles. And cleaning smudges without a cleaning liquid does not clean the smudges completely.</p>
<p>     ✔️ When we are home, we can always use some cleaning liquid and clean the glasses.</p>
<p>     ✔️ What about the times we need to clean smudges when we are outside/ away from the kitchen?</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>We intuitively know what is the best way to clean our glasses.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We wash our clothes using <strong>washing detergent and water. </strong>
</li>
<li>We clean our dishes using <strong>cleaning detergent and water. </strong>
</li>
<li>We clean our bodies using <strong>soap and water.  </strong>
</li>
<li>We clean our glass windows using a cleaning solution and water. </li>
<li>Heck, we clean our eyeglasses with cleaning liquid and water and wipe them with nice microfiber -- when we are home. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We know that.</strong> We know intuitively this is the best way to get oil, debris, and micro-particles out of our glasses so that we can see clearly again. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>But.. what stops us?</strong></p>
<p>What stops us from cleaning our eyeglasses with cleaning liquid and microfiber when we are away from our home? The answer is, we don't have an easy way to carry cleaning liquid and microfiber with us wherever we go. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the solution? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We need a portable and complete eyeglass cleaner that carries Lens cleaning liquid and a nice pair of microfiber pads, that we can carry around effortlessly.</li>
<li>Introducing 'UnSmudge'. A complete eyeglass cleaner that fits in your palm. It comes with a cleaning spray, a fork with 2 spongy microfiber pads. You can carry it in your pocket, purse and clean your eyeglasses anywhere. </li>

<p>UnSmudge comes with everything that you need to clean your glasses. Be it eyeglasses or sunglasses. The fork holds two microfiber pads. They are protected in a shell so they never get in contact with any foreign particles. They just clean your eyeglasses and go back into the shell. Just like a turtle's neck. In a good way.</p>

<div>And we did not stop there. We know your phone is very important to you. But we also know that hygiene is also very important to you. Just like your eyeglasses, your phones travel with you everywhere. I mean - everywhere.</div>

<p>We don't know if you noticed, but there are a few<i> red flags</i> in there. And Phone surface glasses are not the best at keeping germs away. Why would they? Their function is not to keep themselves clean. It's up to us to keep them clean.  Because we tend to use out hands to send food to our mouth. And you know where these hands were when you were in the restroom. We'll leave it to your imagination/reality. </p>
<p>Yep. It fits in an eyeglass box. Right next to your eyeglasses. Whether you carry an eyeglass box or not, you know someone who carries one. So UnSmudge is a perfect fit for you or them. </p>

<p> Why phone surfaces get so dirty so quickly? The problem is again the phone 'glass' and all the protective covers are made of Aluminosilicate. This has a soft surface. Which means it has weak surface structure with slight static. This plays a vital role in attracting particles, germs, bacteria and viruses.  </p>

<p>These germs, bacteria and viruses are no joke. No, this is not a cheap attempt to scare-sell you anything. We know you are smarter than that. We know we should be better than that. But, as a human society, we all are witnessing something very unfortunate events across the world right now. If someone told us the whole comes to a halt because of a virus, we would have laughed it off. The point is, these invisible enemies are ruthless. And if we knowingly make a mistake of not being careful enough, the fault will be at our hands.</p>

<p> We need an easy way to keep our phones clean. And we need to do it the right way. We want to clean the surface with germ killing liquid and a clean microfiber cloth to clean the surface. So we combined both into a neat package. You can carry UnSmudge anywhere with almost zero hassle.</p>

<p>And what else did we  focus on? The finer the microfiber thread, better the clean. We are using 260GSM microfiber cloth. This is recommended by optometrists. Note that all the microfiber cloths you find online/stores are not 260GSM. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And one set of microfiber pads will last months. And they are replaceable when needed. So this keeps those DRY microfiber pads where they belong. In those drawers.  </p>

We don't remember the fastest 'unsmudging' time. But we all agreed that it can be done in less than 30 seconds.</p>

You wear eyeglasses. What does it mean? It means you recognized the ability to see clearly is an essential and critical part of your life. You got your eyes examined. You consulted an Optometrist and got the lenses with the right power. Now you should be able to see clearly. Technically, yes.
 

Technically, the problem is solved. But is it completely true? You should be able to see the world clearly wherever you go. Correct? But what about those dry microfiber cloths in your pocket, in your eyeglass pouch, in your car dashboard? Yeah that's right. We know that they get smudgy ALL THE TIME. Why? Let's look closer.
                           
 
                           
 
Your eyeglasses are made of Polycarbonates and CR-39 Resins. And that is GOOD and BAD. 
 
 
 


 
 
 

Because they have weak surface structure, surface static, and scratch prone. Which means when you step out of the house, you are inviting the dust and debris to come settle on your eyeglasses .
 
But how to keep your eyeglasses clean?
 
      ✔️ Anyone who wears eyeglasses knows the problem of eyeglasses getting smudgy. It could be anything that causes the problem: Air, dust, sweat, moisture, rain, oil from skin, eyelashes, etc. Whatever may be the cause, smudgy glasses are an annoying and recurring problem for many of us.
     ✔️ Current Solution: For most people, the go-to solution is to use their T-shirt. Some concerned ones carry a microfiber cloth in their pocket.
     ✔️ Using T-Shirt/clothes to clean eyeglasses does not solve the problem. They might leave invisible scratches on the glasses.
     ✔️ Using microfiber cloth might sound like a good idea, but it is incomplete. A microfiber cloth in a pocket or in a purse will in itself attract small particles. And cleaning smudges without a cleaning liquid does not clean the smudges completely.
     ✔️ When we are home, we can always use some cleaning liquid and clean the glasses.
     ✔️ What about the times we need to clean smudges when we are outside/ away from the kitchen?
 



We intuitively know what is the best way to clean our glasses.

We wash our clothes using washing detergent and water. 

We clean our dishes using cleaning detergent and water. 

We clean our bodies using soap and water.  

We clean our glass windows using a cleaning solution and water. 
Heck, we clean our eyeglasses with cleaning liquid and water and wipe them with nice microfiber -- when we are home. 

 
We know that. We know intuitively this is the best way to get oil, debris, and micro-particles out of our glasses so that we can see clearly again. 
 
                            
 
But.. what stops us?
What stops us from cleaning our eyeglasses with cleaning liquid and microfiber when we are away from our home? The answer is, we don't have an easy way to carry cleaning liquid and microfiber with us wherever we go. 
 
What is the solution? 

We need a portable and complete eyeglass cleaner that carries Lens cleaning liquid and a nice pair of microfiber pads, that we can carry around effortlessly.
Introducing 'UnSmudge'. A complete eyeglass cleaner that fits in your palm. It comes with a cleaning spray, a fork with 2 spongy microfiber pads. You can carry it in your pocket, purse and clean your eyeglasses anywhere. 

   
 

 
 

 
 
 

UnSmudge comes with everything that you need to clean your glasses. Be it eyeglasses or sunglasses. The fork holds two microfiber pads. They are protected in a shell so they never get in contact with any foreign particles. They just clean your eyeglasses and go back into the shell. Just like a turtle's neck. In a good way.
                         

 


And we did not stop there. We know your phone is very important to you. But we also know that hygiene is also very important to you. Just like your eyeglasses, your phones travel with you everywhere. I mean - everywhere.

Restroom/thumbs/Phone
Kitchen-floor/thumbs/Phone
Shoe-Rack/thumbs/Phone

Office-desk/thumbs/Phone

We don't know if you noticed, but there are a few red flags in there. And Phone surface glasses are not the best at keeping germs away. Why would they? Their function is not to keep themselves clean. It's up to us to keep them clean.  Because we tend to use out hands to send food to our mouth. And you know where these hands were when you were in the restroom. We'll leave it to your imagination/reality. 
Yep. It fits in an eyeglass box. Right next to your eyeglasses. Whether you carry an eyeglass box or not, you know someone who carries one. So UnSmudge is a perfect fit for you or them. 

 
 

 Why phone surfaces get so dirty so quickly? The problem is again the phone 'glass' and all the protective covers are made of Aluminosilicate. This has a soft surface. Which means it has weak surface structure with slight static. This plays a vital role in attracting particles, germs, bacteria and viruses.  

These germs, bacteria and viruses are no joke. No, this is not a cheap attempt to scare-sell you anything. We know you are smarter than that. We know we should be better than that. But, as a human society, we all are witnessing something very unfortunate events across the world right now. If someone told us the whole comes to a halt because of a virus, we would have laughed it off. The point is, these invisible enemies are ruthless. And if we knowingly make a mistake of not being careful enough, the fault will be at our hands.
 
                                                                   
 We need an easy way to keep our phones clean. And we need to do it the right way. We want to clean the surface with germ killing liquid and a clean microfiber cloth to clean the surface. So we combined both into a neat package. You can carry UnSmudge anywhere with almost zero hassle.
 
 


Think of your loved ones. Spouse, kids, parents, grand-parents. Everyone either wears eyeglasses, or carries a phone. Or both. Think of giving them a meaningful gift this summer. The one that helps them stay clean and handy to clean smudgy eyeglasses. They will thank you for you being so considerate. Or get a few for your office mates. 
Be that cool cat at your work.
 


 

You are busy with your life. Smudges are just an annoyance and a distraction.  You are not eagerly waiting to get your eyeglasses smudgy so you can see your world blurry. You are not willingly putting some oil and debris on your eyeglasses before going to watch a movie or a concert. This Sh*t just happens. And You need a solution. And quick. It should be as easy as buying a banana from a banana cart. 
UnSmudge just does that. Take it out. Spray. Clean with microfiber pads. Snap it back in. And you are done.
  
And what else did we  focus on? The finer the microfiber thread, better the clean. We are using 260GSM microfiber cloth. This is recommended by optometrists. Note that all the microfiber cloths you find online/stores are not 260GSM. 
 
And one set of microfiber pads will last months. And they are replaceable when needed. So this keeps those DRY microfiber pads where they belong. In those drawers.  
 
 

UnSmudge is so easy to carry. It is so handy, it fits in your pocket. So you can carry it everywhere without any inconvenience. You can have one in your car, one at your work. So you never run into smudgy eyeglasses problem. Ever.
                            
 


 
 
Who protects the protector? You can clean your phone with the microfiber layered on the shell. But how to protect it? We cover it with an acrylic shell. That way, everything is protected wherever you carry. And however you carry it. 
 
 

                         
How easy to carry it? As easy as you can imagine. A pocket. A purse. A bag. A backpack. You name it. You got it.  
 
How fast can you clean your eyeglasses?  
It's not like we had a competition or anything but our testing team had some fun with our prototypes the other day. Finding out how fast can they 'UnSmudge' their eyeglasses. Names have been called, curses were yelled, microfiber pads flew across the room during the event. At the end, pizza boxes and beer bottles were emptied. We don't remember the fastest 'unsmudging' time. But we all agreed that it can be done in less than 30 seconds.
 
Now that you have UnSmudge, you don't have to worry about keeping track of all those DRY microfiber cloths. They never were the right choice to clean your eyeglasses in the first place. 
 

Risks & Challenges
 

While the product prototypes are looking real good, mold making and production may bring in some challenges. We are prepared for any surprises. We will keep you posted how we are making progress each week.
We have thoroughly tested the samples beforehand, to make sure that we are production ready as soon as the kickstarter campaign ends. Production is estimated to take 8-10 weeks and transport will take an additional 2-3 weeks.
After that we are ready to ship the towels to you.
As with any mass production there can be unforeseen challenges that are out of our control, which could delay the process. We assure you, that we will keep all our backers up-to-date on all the latest news and/or changes and will operate as transparently as possible, so you can follow every step until you have the product in hand.

Create an easy to use platform for both clients and practitioners to undertake psychometric profiling tools commonly used in private practice. But most importantly to create a compulsory process for practitioners to assess the risk of each patient at each session for the risk of suicidal tendencies.  This tool not only makes the process of analysis psychometric tools faster, it also removes the risk for human error and misinterpretation of data.   What We Need & What You Get We have developed the tool to a point where it is ready to get better.  We need to:  Expand the platform from an app based program to an online web service option so that we can broaden the way practitioners help clients.  Translate the tool from English to a number of other languages where the program can be used. As well as tweak and fix minor technology issues created with the introduction of more assessment tools.    The Impact This tool has already proven to save lives and by taking it further we will only empower more professionals working with individuals in various ways to help them:  Identify the risk of acts of self harm and acting out risk - meaning violent acts towards others. Through our community of support and training for licensed practitioners we also will grow the capabilities of professional helpers to work with people in times of great distress and crisis. We also like that this tool helps to develop individual practitioners by giving clients and patients a platform to feedback to the practitioner how well they are doing.    Risks & Challenges  When we first looked into this possible tool we identified some key risks.  First of all we did not want to re-invent the wheel as such we recognise that there are a number of great profiling tools to assess patient risk and moods.  Secondly we where concerned about empowering practitioners to identify risk but then not know what to do.  So we decided to...  Firstly work with researched and evidence based profiling tools that have already gained the respect of the mental health community and combined these tools into our platform.  These measures are used under  international licence agreements from the original authors of the tests. Secondly to ensure a practitioner is best able to help an at-risk client we have done two things (i) included in the tool specific questions and instructions for the mental health practitioner on what to do when a risk is flagged.  And (ii) we have established training partnerships with professional registered training providers and this training is compulsory for any practitioner prior to being provided with a licence to use our tool within their clinic.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, however that doesn't mean you can not help:  Please help to create some noise about our campaign and spread the word about our NeuroAssess tool. Or drop us a note and have a chat letting us know how you might be able to help.   Cheers, thanks a lot!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Yesterday, I was at breaking point with Ollie. His physical
health and behaviour, both intertwined, were really challenging me. So I did
something that I’d never done before with him.
</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>I talked about his birth.</p>
<p>You gotta start the healing
somewhere, right?</p>
<p>With utmost sensitivity and honesty (and a slightly
down-played story about tadpoles from Wez and baby eggs in my tummy) I shared
with my 7 year old the highs and lows of loving him in my womb.</p>
<p>I guided him through a deeper lesson on emotions, feelings,
fear, control, trauma... He was ready. (So was I.)</p>
<p>I heartfeltly explained what it’s like to want to leave your
own body behind after going through a seemingly tough experience. Not so much
in a suicidal way, but because you’re too petrified to fully acknowledge the
sadness inside and all that lies beneath.</p>
<p>Sometimes we allow our body/mind to take us further and
further away from those core afraid sensations. In any way we can. Although ironically
often we want to bring resolution/release to our old feelings so we accidentally
make our life repeat circumstances in order to give rise. It’s pretty clever,
really. I’m actually a genius at both of those tricks.</p>
<p>“How do you feel now, Ollie?” I asked at the beginning of
our early morning session.</p>
<p>“Bored.” He checks the time on our clocks. Like he does 150
times a day. “It’s 7:17, Mum.”</p>
<p>“Thanks Ollie. I was pretty sure it was, because you told me
when it was 7:16. Let me share with you some important stories about when you
were born.”</p>
<p>I kept it factual. But I ended up weeping. I shared with him
how my waters broke.</p>
<p>Yep, I went there.</p>
<p>The general hospital in Launceston was short staffed. It was
Tuesday and the week leading up to Easter 2008. 24 hours after I audibly heard
the plug to the bathtub pop, I began contractions. Another, yes another, 24
hours after that, Ollie was born ‘normally’ on Thursday. By then I knew I/we had
endured the extra kind of torture no woman (or newborn) deserves.</p>
<p><b>Yet that was just going to be the beginning of it.</b></p>
<p>The contractions were a breeze. It was the shooting pain in
my back and down my leg that got me. Ollie was flipped or posterior or
something. So even though his head was descending he was turned around the
other way. Sunny-side up, when the back of the baby’s head is against the mum’s
spine. And I have a suspicion posterior head circumference measures larger than
anterior head circumference. That thing was huge.</p>
<p>I had Wez and my beautiful friend Rosa Koster with me for
the birth. Rosa, even though she had been through more than her fair share of baby
challenges, was simply unbelievable. Luckily she knew how dysfunctional I was especially
back then (I have a tendency to disassociate myself from... well, pretty much
everything/everyone) and patiently guided me through and through. I don’t think
I’d even read one pregnancy book. With her own expertise and experiences, I think I asked Rosa to be there because in the back of my
mind I was expecting something to go tragically wrong. And when Ollie developed pneumonia on the way down, I suppose it nearly did.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So all in all, the long labour was for me and Ollie super hardcore.
I also explained to Ollie about the water injections we had twice during the 24
hours. Midwives and doctors were called in to hold me down and together they administered
these at least three hellish prongs into my lower back all at the same time. The
concept behind sterile saline injections for pain is ‘gate control theory’. Code
for smash this part of your body as excruciatingly as you can so you forget
about the pain happening in the other part. It was like being stabbed to death by
wasps. With REALLY REALLY bad stingers. I really tensed with these thick needles
in my back and jolted forward out of my body in extreme shock, screaming the
building down. Surely Ollie would have sensed this severe distress.</p>
<p>Did they work? Maybe they helped a little for an hour. But
not even an epidural at the very end could help this nerve pain. Even when I
could feel contractions before the epidural, my nerve/leg/back pain was incurably
way worse.</p>
<p>If the numerous labour traumas weren’t enough stress
for us both, it was clear Ollie was born with neonatal pneumonia. It wasn’t just a
little temperature spike. He had wheezing with the infection on his lungs and
white foam frothing from his little blue tinged mouth.</p>
<p>I was exhausted. I had been awake for 48 hours. I told 7
year old Ollie how I watched in fear through a glass window as the doctors and
nurses tried to poke 1 hour Ollie over and over with a needle. They couldn’t
find a good vein. He was so thirsty. Nobody was holding him. They were all holding
him down to be still, on a cold metal table. I have never ever heard or seen
him cry like he did in that room. A nurse walked over and closed the blind. Eventually
they found one in his head.</p>
<p>I was so scared and so sad. “I cannot believe that grumpy
nurse closed the blind to you Mum,” Ollie was angry as we relived it. He was so
engaged with the whole story. Normally he doesn’t focus.</p>
<p>“The doctors and nurses and antibiotics saved your life,
Ollie. We are so, so grateful. I am so very sorry I let you get sick. This
experience has given us some extra work to do now to build your body up. This
is one of the reasons why you still get sick so much. The antibiotics helped
you in the emergency of when you were born, but you still have some very
important things we need to work on. Since I didn’t know how to help you at the
time, I am going to help you now.”</p>
<p>I finished our little session in the time machine,
confessing to Ollie that he was a complete surprise. That I was scared to be a
Mum, especially with me being very sick as well in many ways. But I assured him
the truth, that he was the most welcome, wanted and loved baby... a very
special precious gift.</p>
<p>“And I’m so sorry I yell at you sometimes Ollie. Sometimes
when Mums feel really scared deep down, they yell. I just want you to be safe
and happy.”</p>
<p>“That’s okay, Mum. I love you.”</p>
<p>We wiped away a few tear drops, beaming with warmth and
gratitude, spontaneous smiles, naturally feeling whatever we needed to. We felt
strangely lighter. More free. We have more work but we hugged tighter than we have
ever hugged before. Ollie NEVER hugs for real or for long. He always pulls away
to go off chasing or throwing something. I have never seen him more physically
present and relaxed (his muscles normally feel so tense to touch) and his heart
was open. He was in the moment. His whole body was there. And he didn’t even
tell me the time.</p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Ollie hates his allergies. Like really hates them. I’m
starting this campaign because we have found proven ways to bring him some
healing.</b><br/></p>
<p>Not that we will ever go back to eating rubbish, but it would be nice
to not have to be so severely allergic and sensitive to the many things Ollie
is. I would love to see him attend one birthday party and not have to leave
before the cake or be excluded because he is allergic to eggs. Just sharing a
toy with someone who is eating egg is enough to make him swell badly. If he
eats it he will throw up constantly for about 24 hours. And not just your average
spewing up, his stomach convulses and spasms over and over until he starts
vomiting water and air for hours. This is horrible for me to watch. And for him
to go through, of course. If he accidentally eats other stuff he is allergic to,
his throat swells up and he will go unconscious. He can die. We have seen him
have an anaphylactic shock a couple of times and it is unspeakably terrifying.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434627331/ujib0uz25pc9czzhlwpw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 474.039px; height: 354px; cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>At the moment, Ollie is also having severe asthma attacks
at least once a day. This happens every Winter. However we know the cold air is
only the secondary trigger. We have him on artificial treatment (that we are
still waiting to kick in) but we hope to help him come off this once we fix the
primary cause.<br/><br/>
<p>At the end of last year we kind of nearly lost Ollie in
another way when he only had ONE platelet and was bruising spontaneously right
over his body. His gums were pouring out with blood by themselves. It turned
out to be an immune attack response to his glandular fever.</p>

issues of my own. Maybe, after hearing only some of the stress stories today,
you will empathise why I now have chronic fatigue. However, Ollie and my
current conditions can be cured. How do I know this?<br/><br/>
<p>I am guided even training with the leading practitioners in the
field of wellness medicine. The testimonies and research speaks for itself. It
is true, some of the work would be oblivious to the majority of doctors. But
there are a growing number of doctors who are choosing the truly effective
approach of integrative medicine.</p>
<p>While I personally believe true healing often won’t happen
until we acknowledge and release repressed emotions and traumas, we also
need the right food and supplements, plus the removal of environmental and
internal stresses. It also usually requires the aid of bodywork like
chiropractic and so on. Healing is about restoring natural balance, according
to our own very unique genome and microbiome. Even restoring balance to our perception
of things in life.</p>
<p><b>My naturopath quoted at a training day, “Without a
particular combination of genetic mutations, heavy metal toxicity, chronic
infections, chronic inflammation and excitotoxin damage, then chronic disease
would not manifest.”</b></p>
<p>I believe her.</p>
<p>Yes, it costs money to get well. The most expensive tests
are usually not covered. But with the results pouring in, we are finally discovering
Ollie and my underlying conditions. Over the years we keep thinking we have
solved the mystery, but now we see how these were just one significant but small pieces of the puzzle.
We are READY to bring ALL our jigsaw together and feel WELL.</p>
<p>Things we know so far: Ollie and I PROBABLY have chronic lyme
disease; we both have some interesting gene mutations some being MTHFR (he is
+/+ C677T), COMT, MAO-A (also known as the ‘Warrior’ gene aka serial killer
gene haha) which basically means with our past environmental contributors we
both have a rough time with dopamine and serotonin (I wish my doctor knew this
when she once put me on an SSRI); Ollie has severe heavy metal toxicity... There
is much more we know and more we need to confirm. Ollie is struggling
at school cognitively and behaviourally and I am really struggling here at home. I
would give anything to feel normal and be able to work. To have the energy to be
the Mum Ollie deserves.</p>
<p>Both pharmaceutical and natural treatments for everything are
expensive. We as a family cater for over a dozen food allergies and sensitivities
that we need to consider for every meal and every snack every day. Shopping for
ingredients gets expensive. Everything is expensive. You get the picture. I don’t
think I will bore you any more than I have...</p>
<p>Basically we need to urgently raise around about $2000 each
($4000) to cover outstanding expenses. As you know Wez only works part time and
has had to pick up the role of cooking due to my fatigue (we are learning how
to batch cook and meal plan so we can free him from this... although it was only
one week ago when we finally found out what we are really allowed to eat. So now
everything is coming together... yay) And I have just started treatment with
the right practitioner for me. We would love love love to afford to have our
beautiful Ollie treated by her as well. Hence the campaign.</p>
<p>If you can afford $5 or $10 to put towards our tests and treatments, we would be absolutely honoured. There is
simply so much I want to accomplish in this world when I am well. This 20+ year journey
for me has not been in vain. We will be serving and empowering others on their own
journey in no time.</p>

selling the house more than we ever have, because we are honestly really ready to get

<br/>
</div></div>","Yesterday, I was at breaking point with Ollie. His physical
health and behaviour, both intertwined, were really challenging me. So I did
something that I’d never done before with him.


I talked about his birth.
You gotta start the healing
somewhere, right?
With utmost sensitivity and honesty (and a slightly
down-played story about tadpoles from Wez and baby eggs in my tummy) I shared
with my 7 year old the highs and lows of loving him in my womb.
I guided him through a deeper lesson on emotions, feelings,
fear, control, trauma... He was ready. (So was I.)
I heartfeltly explained what it’s like to want to leave your
own body behind after going through a seemingly tough experience. Not so much
in a suicidal way, but because you’re too petrified to fully acknowledge the
sadness inside and all that lies beneath.
Sometimes we allow our body/mind to take us further and
further away from those core afraid sensations. In any way we can. Although ironically
often we want to bring resolution/release to our old feelings so we accidentally
make our life repeat circumstances in order to give rise. It’s pretty clever,
really. I’m actually a genius at both of those tricks.
“How do you feel now, Ollie?” I asked at the beginning of
our early morning session.
“Bored.” He checks the time on our clocks. Like he does 150
times a day. “It’s 7:17, Mum.”
“Thanks Ollie. I was pretty sure it was, because you told me
when it was 7:16. Let me share with you some important stories about when you
were born.”
I kept it factual. But I ended up weeping. I shared with him
how my waters broke.
Yep, I went there.
The general hospital in Launceston was short staffed. It was
Tuesday and the week leading up to Easter 2008. 24 hours after I audibly heard
the plug to the bathtub pop, I began contractions. Another, yes another, 24
hours after that, Ollie was born ‘normally’ on Thursday. By then I knew I/we had
endured the extra kind of torture no woman (or newborn) deserves.
Yet that was just going to be the beginning of it.
The contractions were a breeze. It was the shooting pain in
my back and down my leg that got me. Ollie was flipped or posterior or
something. So even though his head was descending he was turned around the
other way. Sunny-side up, when the back of the baby’s head is against the mum’s
spine. And I have a suspicion posterior head circumference measures larger than
anterior head circumference. That thing was huge.
I had Wez and my beautiful friend Rosa Koster with me for
the birth. Rosa, even though she had been through more than her fair share of baby
challenges, was simply unbelievable. Luckily she knew how dysfunctional I was especially
back then (I have a tendency to disassociate myself from... well, pretty much
everything/everyone) and patiently guided me through and through. I don’t think
I’d even read one pregnancy book. With her own expertise and experiences, I think I asked Rosa to be there because in the back of my
mind I was expecting something to go tragically wrong. And when Ollie developed pneumonia on the way down, I suppose it nearly did.

So all in all, the long labour was for me and Ollie super hardcore.
I also explained to Ollie about the water injections we had twice during the 24
hours. Midwives and doctors were called in to hold me down and together they administered
these at least three hellish prongs into my lower back all at the same time. The
concept behind sterile saline injections for pain is ‘gate control theory’. Code
for smash this part of your body as excruciatingly as you can so you forget
about the pain happening in the other part. It was like being stabbed to death by
wasps. With REALLY REALLY bad stingers. I really tensed with these thick needles
in my back and jolted forward out of my body in extreme shock, screaming the
building down. Surely Ollie would have sensed this severe distress.
Did they work? Maybe they helped a little for an hour. But
not even an epidural at the very end could help this nerve pain. Even when I
could feel contractions before the epidural, my nerve/leg/back pain was incurably
way worse.
If the numerous labour traumas weren’t enough stress
for us both, it was clear Ollie was born with neonatal pneumonia. It wasn’t just a
little temperature spike. He had wheezing with the infection on his lungs and
white foam frothing from his little blue tinged mouth.
I was exhausted. I had been awake for 48 hours. I told 7
year old Ollie how I watched in fear through a glass window as the doctors and
nurses tried to poke 1 hour Ollie over and over with a needle. They couldn’t
find a good vein. He was so thirsty. Nobody was holding him. They were all holding
him down to be still, on a cold metal table. I have never ever heard or seen
him cry like he did in that room. A nurse walked over and closed the blind. Eventually
they found one in his head.
I was so scared and so sad. “I cannot believe that grumpy
nurse closed the blind to you Mum,” Ollie was angry as we relived it. He was so
engaged with the whole story. Normally he doesn’t focus.
“The doctors and nurses and antibiotics saved your life,
Ollie. We are so, so grateful. I am so very sorry I let you get sick. This
experience has given us some extra work to do now to build your body up. This
is one of the reasons why you still get sick so much. The antibiotics helped
you in the emergency of when you were born, but you still have some very
important things we need to work on. Since I didn’t know how to help you at the
time, I am going to help you now.”
I finished our little session in the time machine,
confessing to Ollie that he was a complete surprise. That I was scared to be a
Mum, especially with me being very sick as well in many ways. But I assured him
the truth, that he was the most welcome, wanted and loved baby... a very
special precious gift.
“And I’m so sorry I yell at you sometimes Ollie. Sometimes
when Mums feel really scared deep down, they yell. I just want you to be safe
and happy.”
“That’s okay, Mum. I love you.”
We wiped away a few tear drops, beaming with warmth and
gratitude, spontaneous smiles, naturally feeling whatever we needed to. We felt
strangely lighter. More free. We have more work but we hugged tighter than we have
ever hugged before. Ollie NEVER hugs for real or for long. He always pulls away
to go off chasing or throwing something. I have never seen him more physically
present and relaxed (his muscles normally feel so tense to touch) and his heart
was open. He was in the moment. His whole body was there. And he didn’t even
tell me the time.



Ollie hates his allergies. Like really hates them. I’m
starting this campaign because we have found proven ways to bring him some
healing.
Not that we will ever go back to eating rubbish, but it would be nice
to not have to be so severely allergic and sensitive to the many things Ollie
is. I would love to see him attend one birthday party and not have to leave
before the cake or be excluded because he is allergic to eggs. Just sharing a
toy with someone who is eating egg is enough to make him swell badly. If he
eats it he will throw up constantly for about 24 hours. And not just your average
spewing up, his stomach convulses and spasms over and over until he starts
vomiting water and air for hours. This is horrible for me to watch. And for him
to go through, of course. If he accidentally eats other stuff he is allergic to,
his throat swells up and he will go unconscious. He can die. We have seen him
have an anaphylactic shock a couple of times and it is unspeakably terrifying.

At the moment, Ollie is also having severe asthma attacks
at least once a day. This happens every Winter. However we know the cold air is
only the secondary trigger. We have him on artificial treatment (that we are
still waiting to kick in) but we hope to help him come off this once we fix the
primary cause.
At the end of last year we kind of nearly lost Ollie in
another way when he only had ONE platelet and was bruising spontaneously right
over his body. His gums were pouring out with blood by themselves. It turned
out to be an immune attack response to his glandular fever.

For more than 20 years, I have had quite debilitating health
issues of my own. Maybe, after hearing only some of the stress stories today,
you will empathise why I now have chronic fatigue. However, Ollie and my
current conditions can be cured. How do I know this?

are usually not covered. But with the results pouring in, we are finally discovering
Ollie and my underlying conditions. Over the years we keep thinking we have

We are READY to bring ALL our jigsaw together and feel WELL.
Things we know so far: Ollie and I PROBABLY have chronic lyme

<b>History of the club Adrenalin:<br/><br/></b> Climbing club Adrenalin is
 founded back in 1997. because some of the students from Faculty of

and most of all adrenaline sports.<br/> This club was the one of the 
first three made in Serbia, but the real activity of the team Adrenalin 
starts in 2000. when we introduced the city with first assembly 
structure for free climbing in Novi Sad. In summer 2001.  
another structure for free climbing was made, it was on the Novi Sad’s public 
beach “Štrand“. 12 meters high and 4,5 meters wide, metal - wood construction, with black panels, painted to yellow. </div><div>

<br/> In the past 15 years, we have organized more than

prototypes to a functioning production level. 
We have qualified industrial partners ready to begin production.  With your support we can start production in four
months and turn My Health Detective Software App and AMPCoilinto a world-wide success.  And you will be one of the first to benefit
from your own personal wellness transformation.
Now there’s
only one little step left to take – and that is where we need your help.  Your support and contribution will help us
finance:

Wholesale
purchase of production components
Special
tools for production
Legal
and licensing fees

Risks and challenges
We are
innovators and pioneers of this software and have a combined track record of
successfully delivering products to consumers worldwide.  Our team has tested software versions; neuroheadband
and AMPCoil prototypes.  We have been
working with manufacturing partners to mitigate the risks of volume
production.  We have provided the
Kickstarter community with a conservative estimate for when the delivery of the
software AMPcoil can be expected.  We are
committed to keeping you informed of our progress.  Nevertheless, unforeseen challenges and
circumstances can arise as we finalized the software and the AMPcoils’ production
capacity.  We pledge to do our utmost to
minimize any delays in our shipping schedule and dedicate ourselves to provide
you the best opportunity to experience this technology as soon as humanly
possible.",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

</div><p></p><h3>Short Summary</h3><p>I am Pat MacIsaac and I have dedicated the last 30 years to raising money to build, grow and finish St. Andrews Na Creige Golf Course in the stunning Codroy Valley, Newfoundland, Canada.</p><p>This all started, when my Dad (Richard MacIsaac) passed the land down to me in the 90's, which has been in the MacIsaac family since Captain John MacIsaac (my great grandfather) was deeded the land by Queen Victoria herself in 1889. I made a promise to my Dad to do something with it. To create something for our community. To increase tourism and boost Codroy Valley as a must see place to visit in Canada, North America and the world a like.  To develop this land into something where kids can come to play sports, have camps and thrive in athletics.</p><p>In 1994 I began this amazing journey by raising money to start the project.  As anyone could imagine the money quickly ran out, and we were only able to finish the front 9 holes.  Now that I am the full time operator of the course, it is hard to get out there to find investments and financial support. Between mowing greens and fairways to bartending and hosting weddings in my club house, the days seem to end too quickly to add anything else to the plate.</p><p>This is where Indiegogo can save the day! Any contribution to my project would help tremendously! I would be able to fulfill my promise to my Dad, by turning our families land into something the community can use and thrive off of. The back 9  would be finished.  The driving range and work around the clubhouse would be complete.  And finally, we could start on building the baseball diamonds for the kids and building RV hookups and camping areas for visitors. It would be the start of an even larger picture such as housing developments and making St. Andrews into a full resort. The sky really is the limit!</p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We need roughly $2,000,000.00 to finish the project, mainly the back 9 holes and facilities. Once the back 9 holes are complete, it will open up more time and capital for me to continue with development, like the driving range and baseball diamonds. I will be able to hire help, rather then do it all on my own and I will be able to afford the equipment necessary to complete the course. Think of how amazing that will be for the golfers! A brand new back 9 instead of doing our current course twice!</p><p>Whats in it for you?! Besides helping out a cool Newfoundlander and his life's work :) ?!  Any of our contribution levels will have you joining the Legacy of St.Andrews. No matter what level you are able to contribute, you will be a part of our Wall of Fame. You will be a part of our Codroy Valley Family. Our 2nd level contribution will garner you a Square Foot Certificate which gives you the chance to ""own a piece of the rock"", have your name on the Wall of Fame and your first 18 holes free of green fee charges. Each level increases from there and only gets better, including the opportunity to own your very own home on the course!!!  Every single contribution from the smallest to the largest, will not only go to great use, but will absolutely mean the world!</p><p>Now what if we don't reach our goal?! Whatever funds we do get, will go to as much as we can around the course. Staffing, fixing up the club house, paying bills, and general maintenance. This obviously depends on how much we get. $250,000 will get us on our way with the back 9, however $30,000 won't get us very far on that front but will be allocated to many other necessities around the course. Every little bit truly does help!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Newfoundland, for those of you that haven't been lucky enough YET to visit, is a stunning, unforgettable place. Our golf course is a privately owned public 9 hole golf course (Par 35) situated in the beautiful Codroy Valley area of the southern portion of Newfoundland’s west coast. Surrounded by spectacular views of the Long Range Mountains and Little Codroy River, St. Andrews Na Creige offers stunning views to golfers and visitors alike. The property has been in the family for over 125 years, and boasts all of Newfoundland’s charm, beauty, and friendliness. </p><p>Tourism is essential to Newfoundlands economy. By creating St.Andrews Na Creige into a complete 18 hole course with driving range and space for RVs and camping, it will encourage visitors to come and stay and explore the rest of what the beautiful Codroy Valley has to offer. Golfing, fly fishing (2 local salmon rivers and 15 others within a 40 minute drive), bird watching, hiking, canoeing, swimming, and zip lining are just some of the things that you can do while visiting the valley and surrounding areas. </p><p>The Codroy Valley area covers approximately 100 sq. km and encompasses 15 smaller communities and is surrounded by the Long Range Mountains, the Anguille Mountains and the Atlantic Ocean. The Valley has spectacular views throughout of the mountains, waterways, Newfoundland’s rugged coastline and rolling hills. Unspoiled beaches are only minutes from St. Andrews Na Creige Golf Course. There is so much to do in the Valley, including bird watching, atlantic salmon fishing, fly fishing, hiking, swimming, skidooing and cross country skiing.</p><p>By finishing the course, our community will have a stunning finished golf course to call their own. An activity to do to keep active, to visit with friends and family, and to teach the younger generation. Having the completed course and driving range will give pride to the community and give myself and others another thing to be proud of.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>My biggest risk and challenge will be mainly raising enough funds, but also finding the staff to work. </p><p>$2,000,000.00 is a lot of money to raise. I know in my heart that the money will be going to finish an already amazingly beautiful course, but conveying that to you is a bigger challenge. Through photos and videos, I will do my best to show the beauty that is not only St.Andrews Na Creige Golf Course, but also Newfoundland as a whole.</p><p>Being in the Codroy Valley makes staffing difficult.  The population of the area is composed of 15 small towns. As you can imagine, finding staff is not the simplest task. The funding will allow me to reach out further and increase pay which will hopefully increase the amount of eligible employees.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If helping financially isn't in the cards for you at the moment, thats ok!! I would really appreciate if you shared this page to others that you think may be able and willing to help. Someone who loves to travel, someone who loves to golf, someone who loves Newfoundland and its people or someone who loves community involvement may all be interested in this campaign.</p><p>There are so many ways to spread the news and we would be over the moon if you would! </p><p>Check out <a href=""http://standrewsgolfcourse.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://standrewsgolfcourse.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.standrewsgolfcourse.ca</a> for more information</p><p></p></div>","Short SummaryI am Pat MacIsaac and I have dedicated the last 30 years to raising money to build, grow and finish St. Andrews Na Creige Golf Course in the stunning Codroy Valley, Newfoundland, Canada.This all started, when my Dad (Richard MacIsaac) passed the land down to me in the 90's, which has been in the MacIsaac family since Captain John MacIsaac (my great grandfather) was deeded the land by Queen Victoria herself in 1889.

</div><p>When I first lost my eye sight, the first question I asked was ""Now 
what do I do""?  My family and friends looked online for answers to this 
question.  Millions of results came up, some of them relevant,  most of 
them were for window blinds, while others showed me the song Blind.  <br/></p><p>There were a lot of definitions, various pages on social media, and 
treatments.  however, none of these options told me that because I am 
blind, WalMart and my local supermarket give me a personal shopper to 
help me. None of them told me that i get free 411 on my house phone and
 cell phone. None of them told me about what doctors, restaurants, 
software, cell phones, hardware was really accessible and which ones 
were just false advertising without having to test each and every one. <br/></p><p>
It took over two years for me to find out this information. and to learn
 that other disabilities had similar problems finding resources. Parents with children who have autism, juvenile type 2 diabetics, 
various types of cancer, depression, addiction, ADHD, crones, and 
hundreds of others.  So my partner and i created <a href=""http://Imuneek.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Imuneek.com</a>  to help instantly connect people, organizations, doctors, 
support groups, news, events, hash tags, and articles specific to their 
medical condition or disability, physical or mental. Imuneek is your 
virtual online assistant for every type of disability, medical 
condition, etc. We call these Uniqueness's.  So far, Imuneek is one of 
only 2 resources in the country for blind parents and is the only 
 company that has the ability to have a support group in every community
 for type 2 juvenile diabetes. Imuneek is also one of only a handful of
 places a parent can attend an online support group for their children 
with autism.  Imuneek is the only place that has a user generated 
""What To First Guide"" to save people years of their life that would have
 been spent looking for information.  Imuneek not only has its own users
 and information, but acts like a hub so that our users know every option
 available, even though its not on our website.  Imuneek has an RSS 
reader that automatically sorts the information so that our users only 
see articles specific to their uniqueness.  Imuneek understands that a 
uniqueness affects not just the person who has it, but their family 
members as well.  This is why Imuneek has the option for a person to 
sign up because they have a love one  who is affected by a medical 
condition or disability.  A spouse or sibling of a person suffering from
 Alzheimer can speak to other spouses or siblings to ask what is the 
best way to keep their loved one active.  Another great feature of 
Imuneek is that if yo ask a question, with a simple click of a button, 
you can ask not only the Imuneek users, but all of your social media at 
the same time.  No need to post it several times on different sites.  By
 doing this, our users get the most exposure  so their questions can be 
answered.  When someone responds, the comment can be voted up if it is 
relevant and valid so that the posing moves to the top of the 
responses.  If an answer is incorrect, you can vote it down so that it 
travels to the bottom of your responses.  Sometimes you want to ask a 
doctor, and sometimes you want to ask a person in your shoes.  We know 
that no one can know exactly what you are going through.  But Imuneek 
lets you know that you are not alone, and there are  other people who 
are going through something similar.  We spent our life savings 
developing this website.  We need your help to add modules to the site  
that will make life easier for over 1 
billion people in the world.</p><p><b>Community Modules	Price in USD: </b></p><p>A section for our users to include allergies to medications or food or products	$8,000</p><p>Doctor, hospital, organization, etc directory with rating system	$6,000 </p><p>Individual Chat between users in the site	$6,000</p><p>Public message system in groups	$4,000 </p><p>User generated wiki for each category	$4,000</p><p>Add filters to posts (question, tip, only for doctors,etc) $2,000 </p><p>An

<p></p> <div> <h3>Risks</h3>
<p>There are many challenges that can arise from building a website that is
 automated and 508 compliant, (508 compliant is a set of guidelines that
 websites that cater to people with medical condition and disabilities 
must conform to).  Some of the modules that we create might not work as 
efficiently when they are live as they behave during our beta testing on
 our developmental server.  Some modules may require a longer beta 
testing period which may delay the development of certain parts of the 
website. When we are developing the apps for IOS and Android the 
operating systems might get upgraded and change dramatically.  If this 
happens we might have to go back and redevelop the apps to work with the
 new OS.<br/></p>

 been spent looking for information.  Imuneek not only has its own users
 and information, but acts like a hub so that our users know every option
 available, even though its not on our website.  Imuneek has an RSS 
reader that automatically sorts the information so that our users only 
see articles specific to their uniqueness.  Imuneek understands that a 
uniqueness affects not just the person who has it, but their family 
members as well.  This is why Imuneek has the option for a person to 
sign up because they have a love one  who is affected by a medical 
condition or disability.  A spouse or sibling of a person suffering from
 Alzheimer can speak to other spouses or siblings to ask what is the 
best way to keep their loved one active.  Another great feature of 
Imuneek is that if yo ask a question, with a simple click of a button, 
you can ask not only the Imuneek users, but all of your social media at 
the same time.  No need to post it several times on different sites.  By
 doing this, our users get the most exposure  so their questions can be 
answered.  When someone responds, the comment can be voted up if it is 
relevant and valid so that the posing moves to the top of the 
responses.  If an answer is incorrect, you can vote it down so that it 
travels to the bottom of your responses.  Sometimes you want to ask a 
doctor, and sometimes you want to ask a person in your shoes.  We know 
that no one can know exactly what you are going through.  But Imuneek 
lets you know that you are not alone, and there are  other people who 
are going through something similar.  We spent our life savings 
developing this website.  We need your help to add modules to the site  
that will make life easier for over 1 
billion people in the world.Community Modules	Price in USD: A section for our users to include allergies to medications or food or products	$8,000Doctor, hospital, organization, etc directory with rating system	$6,000 Individual Chat between users in the site	$6,000Public message system in groups	$4,000 User generated wiki for each category	$4,000Add filters to posts (question, tip, only for doctors,etc) $2,000 An
 Imuneek Drugs module that is synced with the FDA database to list,

 tele-medicine module so that if a user has a camera they can chat 
directly with a doctor and the doctor can diagnose them, electronically 
send a prescription, and bill the insurance company through the site.

  Risks
There are many challenges that can arise from building a website that is
 automated and 508 compliant, (508 compliant is a set of guidelines that
 websites that cater to people with medical condition and disabilities 
must conform to).  Some of the modules that we create might not work as 
efficiently when they are live as they behave during our beta testing on
 our developmental server.  Some modules may require a longer beta 
testing period which may delay the development of certain parts of the 
website. When we are developing the apps for IOS and Android the 
operating systems might get upgraded and change dramatically.  If this 
happens we might have to go back and redevelop the apps to work with the
 new OS.

Have you ever wondered why sugar compels so many of us to binge eat?  Why you start off planning to eat a couple of Oreo’s, only to wind up eating the whole sleeve?  Why you plan to eat a small dish of ice cream, then scarf down the entire carton?  Have you tried to cut back on sugar only to realize how difficult it is?  That’s because, according to a Princeton study written by Dr. Bart Hoebel, sugar is as addictive as cocaine, heroin, and alcohol!
Sugar addiction is something people don’t think much about, but sugar addiction is real.  There are serious health issues associated with sugar, along with mounting health care costs.  Sugar cravings keep people from losing weight and staying healthy.
That’s why our founders, Robert, Alex, and Matt, created Seynani--to help people struggling with everyday sugar urges.  Seynani is an all natural dietary supplement that empowers consumers to say “No” to sugar and artificial sweeteners, “No” to empty calories and weight gain, “No” to sugar related diseases, and “Hello” to a long healthy life.
What We Need 
Seynani is real.  It has been demonstrated in numerous field studies.  It absolutely, temporarily, blocks the ability to taste sweet.  What we need now is to mass produce Seynani so YOU can get it at your nearest store for the best price possible. We need your help to do that.  We're asking for $20,000 for start-up costs which will cover:

Join the fight against sugar
Sugar has a hold over us–more powerful than we want to admit!  
The average American consumes over 130 lbs of sugar a year.  Sugar is linked to diabetes, obesity, hypertension, depression, headaches and fatigue.  By cutting out added sugar from your diet you would consume 500 fewer calories a day.  500 fewer calories adds up to significant weight loss.  Help people end sugar's hold over them.  Help people move toward living a truly healthy life. 
How Seynani Works
Seynani's herbal blend naturally fills the sweet taste receptor locations on the taste buds on your tongue, thereby preventing their activation by sugar molecules.  Seynani naturally, safely, temporarily, block your ability to taste sweet. 
Seynani is a conditioning tool.  By modulating the taste of sweet we can alter the brain's chemical and behavioral response to sweet.  We take away the craving for sweet by removing the taste of sweet from food naturally and temporarily.  Chocolate without sweet is only bitter.  Soft drinks  without sweet are only fizzy colored water.

Some staggering statistics from the United Nations Environment Programme (get the details &amp; source research at <a href=""http://unep.org/wed/2013/quickfacts/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">at the UNEP site</a>):</p><p></p><ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">30% of all food in the US, worth US$48.3 billion, is thrown away each year. About half of the water used to produce this food also goes to waste, since agriculture is the largest human use of water. Additionally, organic waste is the second highest component of landfills in the US, which are the largest source of methane emissions.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">UK households waste an estimated 6.7 million tons of food every year, around 1/3 of the 21.7 million tons purchased. Most of the food waste (61%) is avoidable and could have been eaten had it been better managed.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">According to Canada’s Value Chain Management Centre, 51% of the country’s CA$27 billion in wasted food ends up in household trash bins. (See <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/most-of-canada-s-wasted-food-dumped-from-homes-1.1132998"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this CBC News story</a> for sources &amp; details)</li>

<p>Sad &amp; Lonely Leftovers gives your past-prime food a personality. Go ahead and feel sorry for it. Then get cooking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our webseries is like TV for your fridge, but humans are encouraged to watch it too. Seriously, when was the last time your fridge actually cooked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each episode features a unique recipe to turn malingering leftovers into something fresh. But these aren’t just recipe videos—each one tells a story full of action, adventure, danger, or just plain drama.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best part: there’s always a happy ending. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And refreshments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For 2.50 (USD) a month (math tip: that's about $30 less than the average American squanders in monthly food waste, <a href=""http://ucce.ucdavis.edu/files/datastore/234-2425.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">based on the average of $1.07/day</a>) subscribers to our series will get 4 to 5 fresh episodes—that’s a new episode every week—and access to our archive of previous episodes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>More importantly, no leftovers will cry. And you won’t be hungry anymore.</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Our Process</b></p>
<p>We started by researching the most popular leftover lookups across the top five English-language search engines to bring you the most relevant recipes possible. We also track grocery sale items across the United States and Canada to make sure those “buy in bulk and save” sales don’t leave you trapped beneath unused food items. We keep a mix of meats, veggies, grains &amp; other items so variety is always on the menu, and we keep our food selections seasonal to ensure each new episode arrives when you need it most.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a leftover is selected, the research begins anew—we check again across popular search engines to see what’s already out there so we can make sure the recipes we give you each week are anything but run-of-the-mill. Special diet info? <a href=""http://www.ravenouscatkitchen.com/faq/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We've got that covered too</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it doesn’t stop there, because these aren’t just cooking videos. Leftovers are more likely to be saved if they’re cute, right? So each one tells a story... that just so happens to end with something new to eat.</p><p>Entertainment + eating. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Like two peas in a pod. Or a whole bunch of leftover peas turned into something fabulous and new (but you’re gonna have to wait a bit for that one... pea season is in July).</span></p>

<p>Great! We’re glad you’re here. Our Indiegogo campaign is raising funds for improving our equipment, promoting the series, and ensuring the production of weekly episodes continues until we grow our subscriber base enough to cover our operating costs. It breaks down like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>$3500 for improved equipment. </p>
<p>Right now, we’re operating on editing hardware and software that can barely keep up, and our storage capacity is filled to bursting. This part of the budget also helps improve our lighting and lets us build a mini studio to improve episode quality dramatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>$2500 for marketing and advertising</p>
<p>That whole growing our subscriber base thing? It takes some doing. We’ve got the guerrilla stuff covered, but a few dollars here and there will sure help it along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>$1500 for general operations</p>
<p>This money helps us keep afloat until the abovementioned marketing and advertising kick in. These costs include music and sound effects licensing along with better sets, props, and costumes for our scrumptious stars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if we don’t reach our complete goal, funds raised here will be channeled into the above categories to boost our production as much as possible as we build our subscription-based funding. However, we may need to scale back production to a new episode every other week if our equipment isn't improved. </p>

Here goes...Every Time You Waste Food, A Kitten CriesOK, that may not be exactly true (kittens are notoriously heartless toward broccoli and brussels sprouts, among other foods) but did you know that in addition to the wasted expense to you, food waste takes a toll on everyone’s environment? Some staggering statistics from the United Nations Environment Programme (get the details & source research at at the UNEP site):
30% of all food in the US, worth US$48.3 billion, is thrown away each year. About half of the water used to produce this food also goes to waste, since agriculture is the largest human use of water. Additionally, organic waste is the second highest component of landfills in the US, which are the largest source of methane emissions.
UK households waste an estimated 6.7 million tons of food every year, around 1/3 of the 21.7 million tons purchased. Most of the food waste (61%) is avoidable and could have been eaten had it been better managed.
According to Canada’s Value Chain Management Centre, 51% of the country’s CA$27 billion in wasted food ends up in household trash bins. (See this CBC News story for sources & details)

Yowch. Now we’re crying.The thing is, people know that wasting food is, well... a waste. And anyone can look up recipes to figure out what to do. But it’s all so... dull. Tedious. Yawn-worthy. A chore. Whatever word you choose, it’s the exact opposite of fun.That’s where we come in.Putting A Face On Food
Sad & Lonely Leftovers gives your past-prime food a personality. Go ahead and feel sorry for it. Then get cooking.

Our webseries is like TV for your fridge, but humans are encouraged to watch it too. Seriously, when was the last time your fridge actually cooked?

Each episode features a unique recipe to turn malingering leftovers into something fresh. But these aren’t just recipe videos—each one tells a story full of action, adventure, danger, or just plain drama.

The best part: there’s always a happy ending. 

And refreshments.

For 2.50 (USD) a month (math tip: that's about $30 less than the average American squanders in monthly food waste, based on the average of $1.07/day) subscribers to our series will get 4 to 5 fresh episodes—that’s a new episode every week—and access to our archive of previous episodes. 

More importantly, no leftovers will cry. And you won’t be hungry anymore.Our Process
We started by researching the most popular leftover lookups across the top five English-language search engines to bring you the most relevant recipes possible. We also track grocery sale items across the United States and Canada to make sure those “buy in bulk and save” sales don’t leave you trapped beneath unused food items. We keep a mix of meats, veggies, grains & other items so variety is always on the menu, and we keep our food selections seasonal to ensure each new episode arrives when you need it most.

Once a leftover is selected, the research begins anew—we check again across popular search engines to see what’s already out there so we can make sure the recipes we give you each week are anything but run-of-the-mill. Special diet info? We've got that covered too.

But it doesn’t stop there, because these aren’t just cooking videos. Leftovers are more likely to be saved if they’re cute, right? So each one tells a story... that just so happens to end with something new to eat.Entertainment + eating. Like two peas in a pod. Or a whole bunch of leftover peas turned into something fabulous and new (but you’re gonna have to wait a bit for that one... pea season is in July).

Ready To Help?
Great! We’re glad you’re here. Our Indiegogo campaign is raising funds for improving our equipment, promoting the series, and ensuring the production of weekly episodes continues until we grow our subscriber base enough to cover our operating costs. It breaks down like this:

$3500 for improved equipment. 
Right now, we’re operating on editing hardware and software that can barely keep up, and our storage capacity is filled to bursting. This part of the budget also helps improve our lighting and lets us build a mini studio to improve episode quality dramatically.

$2500 for marketing and advertising
That whole growing our subscriber base thing? It takes some doing. We’ve got the guerrilla stuff covered, but a few dollars here and there will sure help it along.

$1500 for general operations
This money helps us keep afloat until the abovementioned marketing and advertising kick in. These costs include music and sound effects licensing along with better sets, props, and costumes for our scrumptious stars.

Even if we don’t reach our complete goal, funds raised here will be channeled into the above categories to boost our production as much as possible as we build our subscription-based funding. However, we may need to scale back production to a new episode every other week if our equipment isn't improved. 

Contributor Reward LevelsRemember, any amount helps! These levels just detail specific perks. Anyone who contributes $1 or more will receive our gratitude and a shout-out on our Facebook page.
$25 - A one-year subscription to Sad & Lonely Leftovers plus our undying love and gratitude expressed in a personalized e-card from some of our fave leftovers, the Bad Apples.

$50 - A one-year subscription plus the aforementioned e-card and access to an exclusive outtakes video.
$100 - The above plus a Sad & Lonely Leftovers T-shirt or grocery tote. Your choice.



$500 - A lifetime subscription to Sad & Lonely Leftovers, plus YOU get to pick a leftover, and we’ll create an episode around it, dedicated to you.
$1000 - All of the above, plus a ""virtual walk-on"" role in your dedicated episode. What does that mean? Send us a photo or a description of yourself and we’ll style & name a character (ingredient) in the episode after you. You even get to pick the ingredient!
$2500 for industry pros - If you’re a food company, restaurant owner, or other foodtrepreneur, we’ll work with you to develop recipes to take care of your top three leftovers. Forget throwing good day-olds away; we’ll help you turn them into something fresh your customers will love. And you'll get that lifetime subscription, of course.
$2500 for the rest of us - Three personalized cooking classes via Skype or FaceTime to help you perfect new recipes for three of your favorite leftovers. We’ll work with you via email to develop recipes you’ll love, then videochat our way through a demo so you can get the technique down. Did we mention the lifetime subscription?


Can’t Help Yet?
Don’t start sobbing! We love anyone who can help us boost the signal by sharing this campaign or our website with friends, and we’d love for you to become a subscriber when the series launches on World Environment Day, June 5.Shareable link: https://igg.me/at/sadandlonelyleftovers/x/13778653

Who We AreRavenous Cat Kitchen is Deb Taber, a former professional cook and theater production designer turned writer and editor, and Robert Bland, an independent film producer, publisher, and writer. Somehow, all these skills got stirred together and baked into what you see here. Deb's particular penchant for saving leftovers came from working as a cook at a women's monastery. Reducing waste while providing tasty, healthy, home-cooked meals was a key component of her work, and with a captive dining audience, turning leftovers into something new and unexpected was a crucial part of keeping everyone happy.Rob's years of work on both Hollywood and independent films have given him an eye for shooting and editing our series. Deb stirs up the trouble. Rob makes it look good.Team RavCat also includes Stefanie Batten-Bland, an unending source of creativity and all-around all-star, as our social media and outreach coordinator.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div><span>On the internet, if you look up “Does gum biodegrade?” most sites will say, “Nope, it lasts forever.” The reason why most existing gums do not break down is because they are made from latex, which is the same substance used to make rubber. As anyone who has seen an old spare tire left by the side of the road can attest, rubber does not readily biodegrade, and the same goes for gum. To address this problem, we have invented a gum that uses all natural ingredients along with a food-safe mold. So, it will not only biodegrade, but it will biodegrade faster than competing all natural gums.  While there currently exist a handful of gums on the market made from natural ingredients, none contain an active agent to make the gum compost-friendly.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474840223/Labsamples_e8tt9q.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></span></div>

<p>I am planning a relaunch of my entire line of Clenapure products.  Although Clenapure is currently being sold in local spas, health food and traditional grocery stores, I realize that I need to update my product packaging in order to compete more effectively in the holistic bath and body marketplace.  My new packaging will therefore depict the clean, wholesome, wellness-oriented attributes that characterize Clenapure products, which are made with pure ingredients such as:</p>
<p>Fruit and Nut Oils and Butters (vs. Petroleum-Based Oils)</p>
<p>Pure Essential Oils (vs. Chemically-Based Fragrance Oils)</p>
<p>Coconut Oil-Based Foaming Cleansers (vs. Sulfates)</p>

The temple or the museum?»

These are just a few of the things we say during or after a travel and these are the reasons that have inspired us while designing Travelogr.
What is Travelogr
Travelogr is a project made for people who love traveling and sharing their experience. Using a simple app you can share your travel story, map your movements, take photos, videos and notes in real time and without connection problems and everything is collected in just one web page. 







Connection and signal bars won't be your problem anymore: the app will post to your personal Travelogr page automatically when your smartphone will find a suitable connection.


The web site will collect every traveler's journey log, and will become a repository to browse before your next trip. Of course each user could decide who (if any) can see their trip, their trip details and how.
What Travelogr has that other apps don't have

Travelogr will keep all the info regarding your trip in the natural, chronological order. All of your trips will be stored in just one place, where you (or the people with whom you have decided to share) can read them: a true journal of your travels. 

with Travelogr you will have all the social functions you will need during your journey, in just one convenient app without having to use different apps for mapping, logging, posting pictures, sharing videos etc.. 


network issues, checking if the post uploaded correctly, etc are not your problem anymore: Travelogr will publish your content automatically, keeping the chronological order, whenever there is a good internet connection, optimizing battery and internet usage, while you enjoy your adventure. 







Travelogr will create a vast repository of journeys categorized by destination, mean of transport, time of the year, and many other tags (kids, with animals, weather..) so it will become a reference to browse while planning your next trip




Travelogr is for you if...



if you love traveling slowly (boat, horse, motorcycle, bike, foot, car) and you can't, or won't always have time to ""call home"", with Travelogr your dear ones will always be informed where you are, and what you are doing.


if you like running or cycling over long distance races or trails: family and supporters  can follow you easily on the web site and know exactly where you are and will be so they could be right there and give you water, food, friendly cheers and a shot a nice picture, and also they will be able to know when you will cut the finish line. And what's more with Travelogr it's easier to shot pictures and track the race while running or biking.


if you like traveling following your passion, be it art nouveau architecture, wonderful bookstores, old industrial age factories or just a simple week end walking around a new city, everything can become an itinerary to share with who has the same passion


if you are a parent and your child is doing her first travel alone or with friends: you will always know where she is without having to wait for a text msg or phone call.


What is the campaign forWe have done a rough prototype one year ago and we have used it on the Santiago way, then we have spent some months thinking about the features we would like to have in the app and on the web site.We have some preliminary graphics done by our exceptional designer, and we are ready to write our true first alpha version of the app (just on iOS, to meet the perk deadline) and the web site, but we need your help. this is the project timeline:



15th Novembre 2015: Alpha version of iOS app and web site


15th January 2016: Beta version of iOS app and Alpha version of Android app


15th March 2016: Beta version of web site


July 2016: version 1.0 of iOS app and web site.


By funding more you can help us change the timeline, depending on the funding we reach during the campaign:



8.000 $ (Summer goal): we'll anticipate on the 31st of July the release of a alpha version of the app deciding which OS, among Android or iOS, based on the most funded perk between Passionate Logger and Fervent Logger. 


15.000 $: we’ll also anticipate on the 31st of July the release of the alpha version of the app for the other operating system (see summer goal)


28.000 $ (goal reached): we will have beta version of both Android and iOS apps on the 15th of November


goal exceeded!: timeline is contracted, and releases are anticipated! 


goal exceeded by more than 8.000$: Alpha version of app Windows Phone


Features of Travelogr



alpha version of app: logging, picture and text sharing. Very simple connection/battery optimization


alpha version of web site: very basic website where travel data will be collected and published. Sharing is done by users by sending to friends a private url.


beta version of app: Added social sharing via app, and better connection/battery optimization


beta version of web site: simple user profiling, and simple sharing of travels with friends. Social integration, and tagging. Site is searchable


version 1.0 of app: heavy battery/connection optimization, full social features.


version 1.0 of web site: complete user profiling and travel tagging. Fine grained preferences for sharing (or not sharing) travels with friends. Site is fully searchable




Why flexible funding?We have carefully planned our project so as to be feasible even if we don't reach the final goal.Of course reaching the goal will shorten the development time, and will enable us to distribute the Alpha and Beta version of the app to a committed community of supporters, without having to search for private business angels or other investors. On the other hand, no matter the amount of funding collected on Indiegogo, if you have chosen a perk that includes the Alpha version of the app, you can be sure you will still be a Travelogr, it will just take a little bit more time to release the Alpha version for you to use!",4.0,1,"1 Campaign

My name is Kelly and I am a stay at home mother to two precious little boys and two step sons who are with us on the weekends and most of the summer. We Are trying to raise funds to get saftey and therapy equipment for Matt Matt. Matt Matt has been diagnosed with Autism and has a very bad tendancy to try and wander away and also his instinct is to run when anyone calls to him or tries to pick him up. He also has severe sensory integration problems which can make his daily life very restricted and debilitating to do some of the most simple tasks.
Did you know that the average family will spend almost $60,000 a year to cover costs of raising a child with autism including therapies, tests, safety equipment, therapy equipment and doctors appointments to name a few.  Mathaios is a joy to be around and absolutely captures everyone he meets with his dynamic personality.   Our Main Goals.... Our main goals are to raise funds for a fence around a house to keep him safe from wandering and to attain a therapy preasure roller to help give him the sensory input he needs to stay calm.  We asked for the specific amount of $6550 because the estimate for the fence is just under $6000 and the therapy roller that was recommended is $550.
An example of the roller is here; 
http://www.southpawenterprises.com/Weight/SouthpawsSteamrollerDeluxe.asp If we don't reach our goal or have extra after the fence and roller any funds will be placed into a savings account for Mathaios for his educational expenses or any other safety and therapy equipment recommended by his therapists.z    The Impact Did you know that one in every 68 children is diagnosed with autism, and even worse one in every 42 boys is diagnosed and those numbers grow every year. There is no known specific cause for this mental illness and no cure.   in 2009-2011 the leading cause of accidental deaths in Children with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) is drowning accounting for 91% of deaths. the case of the deaths is typically due to these childrens unintentional wandering. In the properties surrounding our house there are three different ponds that as you can imagine pose an extreme danger for Matt Matt as he loves to try and wander off. With your help we can help keep Matt Matt safe and happy enclosed in the yard where he can play freely without the danger and threat of what lies beyond our home.    
Its ok if you don't have the funds to help!

 I myself understand completely the fact that sometimes you just don't have the funds to help people you want to you could also help Matt Matt by....  sharing this campaign on social media or with your friends or family or a simple prayer or thought for matt matt is always appreciated   Thank you so much for reading and helping!

</div></div>","Here's the problem we've grappled with at BeThere24:  


When we call our aging parents (who live independently) many miles away (we're in NY, they're in FL), we worry if this will be the time they don't answer! Are they okay? Has something happened to them? 




We've said to ourselves there must be something out there to help us keep a long distance eye on our loved ones!  And we are not alone, all of our friends have the same concerns.  So this is what we did..... 


Over the past year, we've worked on coming up with a system that discreetly monitors the activity in our parent's home. If something out of the ordinary happens, we are alerted immediately via text or voice message.  We've also connected our system with a 24/7 monitoring service, so if we're not available, our parents are still in good hands.



And now we know what’s going-on with Mom and Dad!  

Here's the story............. 



Young and old, crave more then ever their independence and active life-styles.



Institutional long term healthcare is a worst case scenario.



Option #1 is to remain in the comfort and familiarity of your own home.

But this scenario has its anxiety-ridden moments:

Mom is not answering
the phone!  Where is she? Has something
happened? What can I do?
What if she fell down and was unable to get up. 



Here’s the solution we came up with:
BeThere24 is creating a smart technology using wireless sensors placed discreetly throughout the home that monitors routines and activities.  
 


Our technology then determines an algorithm of those routines and activities to determine the norm, and that which is outside the norm.
If an event occurs outside the norm, an alert is sent to a 24/7 monitoring service and to care givers.  If an emergency, EMS is automatically dispatched, and you're also immediately informed.

Here's why we're a good investment:
Baby boomers are reaching the senior age of 65+ at a rate of 8000 daily, adding 3 million a year to the 43,000,000 seniors already living in the US. So we have plenty of markets to concentrate our efforts on.  But intend to concentrate on only a few to begin with.






The BeThere24 service includes many types of monitoring, including:

Pill dispenser sensors
Tracking of visitors’ arrivals and departures
Outside fall sensors and GPS location
Nursing aides arrival and departures
Appliances running needlessly
Temperatures and general conditions of the living environment

BeThere24 offers a residential system, and is currently working on perfecting a commercial system to be installed in senior living facilities, nursing homes, and hospitals.
 The BeThere24 system can be installed for as little as $199, and professionally monitored 24/7 for as little as $30 a month.
Install a BeThere24 system and take the stress and worry out of your life knowing your loved ones are okay living happily in their own home.

We founded Magic Arms to bring a life-changing 3D-printed exoskeleton to these children so they can do what was once impossible, like hugging their parents, brushing their teeth, feeding themselves, or just playing a game. This technology works and has changed children’s lives, but it is not yet accessible to many children. We need your help to set up care centers so children can get their own Magic Arms and fulfill our waiting list of over 200 children. Our stretch goals will fund a redesign of our exoskeleton (the “Magic Arms orthotic”), and bring Magic Arms to kids who do not have access to health care.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437584382/ln1vltt55mugqdjqzwxz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>What We're Doing Now</h3><p>We are partnering with leading children’s hospitals to develop care centers to help more children and families worldwide. Working with the top doctors and researchers, we will continue to collect crucial feedback on children’s outcomes with Magic Arms. This will give us the insight we need to improve our product and expand medical reimbursement. </p><p></p><h3>What We Need to Give Kids Magic Arms</h3><p>Our distribution of the Magic Arms orthotic is bottle-necked because there is only one care center and only one trained expert who can fit kids with Magic Arms. Your donation will help us set up regional care centers, train clinicians to fit the device, and create an inventory that can meet the current and growing demand for Magic Arms. </p><p></p><p></p><h3>Our Care Centers</h3><div>

</div><p>After our immediate distribution needs are met, we will begin a redesign of the Magic Arms orthotic to make it less expensive, improved outcomes, and expand health care reimbursement. This is a crucial step in bringing Magic Arms to more than 500,000 children worldwide. Working with expert medical device designers, such as Kablooe Design in Minneapolis, we aim to cut the total cost of the Magic Arms orthotic in half. We will accomplish this by making the device easier to manufacture, assemble, and fit to children. </p>Once we meet our goal of funding care centers and our product redesign, all incremental donations will bring Magic Arms to kids who do not have access to affordable care.

<br/>Broader Impacts</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Supporting Magic Arms will help bring a solution to children with arm muscle disabilities, and it will also forge a new path for treating rare conditions. In the U.S., conditions affecting less than 200,000 people are considered Orphan Medical conditions that receive less support and attention from large medical device manufacturers. Magic Arms uses cutting edge technology to find a solution to address these conditions, demonstrating that human ingenuity and generosity can help children and families live a better life.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>Magic Arms technology is evolving with real time feedback from medical professionals, patients, and families. Over 100 kids have benefited from the Magic Arms orthotic, but we know we can make a much larger impact. First, we need to open centers and study patients to collect outcomes data to improve our product design and reimbursement. We need to provide devices to doctors and researchers at children's hospitals, train them to fit the Magic Arms orthotic to each child, and identify strengths and design challenges of the Magic Arms orthotic.</span></p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<div>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">How does Magic Arms work?</b><br/></p>It supports and balances the weight of a child’s arms using a 3D-printed frame and resistance bands. Precision bearings in all joints of the device allow children to amplify their limited arm strength to participate in the joys of life. As children grow, new parts can be printed or modified to meet each child’s unique needs.<br/>

<div>
<p><b>How much does Magic Arms cost?</b></p>Right now the Magic Arms orthotic is about $7,000, from initial measurements through 3D printing and final fitting. Compared to most medical devices, this is a very reasonable cost. Magic Arms, however, is not currently covered by insurance (though it is a future goal!) and $7,000 is a large out-of-pocket cost for a family to pay. This crowdfunding will help us redesign the Magic Arms orthotic to lower production costs and help extend the “reach” of Magic Arms! One of our stretch goals is to provide Magic Arms to more children without access to health insurance!<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><b>Why does Magic Arms need to be redesigned?</b></p>
<p>The current device costs around $7,000 dollars to manufacture, assemble, and fit to a child. Since this technology is so new, not many health insurance plans reimburse patients, leaving many families paying out of pocket. We hope to reduce the cost of the device by making it simpler to manufacture, assemble, and fit to a child while also improving the comfort and function. We are also working to educate health insurance providers so that the cost of the device can be reimbursed.</p>

</div></div>","If you couldn’t move your arms above your waist, how would you feed yourself? Scratch an itch? Open a door? Lots of kids face these problems every day, that is why we created Magic Arms.
Emma's StoryOur StoryOver 50,000 children in the U.S. and more than 500,000 children worldwide suffer from rare diseases and conditions that prevent them from using their arms. We founded Magic Arms to bring a life-changing 3D-printed exoskeleton to these children so they can do what was once impossible, like hugging their parents, brushing their teeth, feeding themselves, or just playing a game. This technology works and has changed children’s lives, but it is not yet accessible to many children. We need your help to set up care centers so children can get their own Magic Arms and fulfill our waiting list of over 200 children. Our stretch goals will fund a redesign of our exoskeleton (the “Magic Arms orthotic”), and bring Magic Arms to kids who do not have access to health care.What We're Doing NowWe are partnering with leading children’s hospitals to develop care centers to help more children and families worldwide. Working with the top doctors and researchers, we will continue to collect crucial feedback on children’s outcomes with Magic Arms. This will give us the insight we need to improve our product and expand medical reimbursement. What We Need to Give Kids Magic ArmsOur distribution of the Magic Arms orthotic is bottle-necked because there is only one care center and only one trained expert who can fit kids with Magic Arms. Your donation will help us set up regional care centers, train clinicians to fit the device, and create an inventory that can meet the current and growing demand for Magic Arms. Our Care Centers



After our immediate distribution needs are met, we will begin a redesign of the Magic Arms orthotic to make it less expensive, improved outcomes, and expand health care reimbursement. This is a crucial step in bringing Magic Arms to more than 500,000 children worldwide. Working with expert medical device designers, such as Kablooe Design in Minneapolis, we aim to cut the total cost of the Magic Arms orthotic in half. We will accomplish this by making the device easier to manufacture, assemble, and fit to children. Once we meet our goal of funding care centers and our product redesign, all incremental donations will bring Magic Arms to kids who do not have access to affordable care. We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, and all donations are tax deductible.
Our Goals






Our Timeline





Our Team



Broader Impacts

Supporting Magic Arms will help bring a solution to children with arm muscle disabilities, and it will also forge a new path for treating rare conditions. In the U.S., conditions affecting less than 200,000 people are considered Orphan Medical conditions that receive less support and attention from large medical device manufacturers. Magic Arms uses cutting edge technology to find a solution to address these conditions, demonstrating that human ingenuity and generosity can help children and families live a better life.
Risks & Challenges

Magic Arms technology is evolving with real time feedback from medical professionals, patients, and families. Over 100 kids have benefited from the Magic Arms orthotic, but we know we can make a much larger impact. First, we need to open centers and study patients to collect outcomes data to improve our product design and reimbursement. We need to provide devices to doctors and researchers at children's hospitals, train them to fit the Magic Arms orthotic to each child, and identify strengths and design challenges of the Magic Arms orthotic.



Primary Challenges

Diagnosing each child properly to make sure they can benefit from Magic Arms
Making it simple enough to assemble that it can be put on a child properly without much guidance

Shrinking the technology so it is less obstructive but still has the strength needed


We are qualified to overcome these hurdles because:

Our research and analytics team will help us learn what is needed to identify good candidates for Magic Arms and develop a protocol to do a successful assembly and fit
We are using skilled and experienced medical device engineers and designers to redesign the device

Our plan to solve these hurdles:

Develop relationships with leading medical professionals to help us assess child outcomes and incorporate feedback
Focus on these items as priorities in the R&D portion of the project
Use rapid prototyping and testing to improve the designs quickly

<p>Very recently we read a story of a
3-year-old child who was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.  This is the youngest child ever to be
identified as having this very serious condition. Due to poor eating habits and
low activity, this child weighed 70% more than that of a healthy child her age.
With proper nutrition and activity, doctors were able to reverse the condition.
KidShape was borne from the concern that this same scenario is playing out more
and more and will increase if nothing is done to address the problem of
childhood obesity.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Over the years, we have seen the
dramatic effects of obesity on the heart and on children. When we were kids, we
played outside all day long until our parents called us in for dinner. We were
active and we grew up to be healthy adults. </p>
<p><b>In the last 30 years childhood
obesity has more than doubled. </b>That’s a future we need to change. As it stands
now, these children will grow up to have increased heart risk factors,
prediabetes or diabetes, higher risk for stroke and a whole other host of image
problems that are associated with obesity.</p>
<p>Here’s a sobering note: this is the
first generation in the history of our country that is projected to die at an
earlier average age than the previous generation.</p>
<p>That’s not a future we can live with!<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

Very recently we read a story of a
3-year-old child who was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.  This is the youngest child ever to be
identified as having this very serious condition. Due to poor eating habits and
low activity, this child weighed 70% more than that of a healthy child her age.
With proper nutrition and activity, doctors were able to reverse the condition.
KidShape was borne from the concern that this same scenario is playing out more
and more and will increase if nothing is done to address the problem of
childhood obesity.


Over the years, we have seen the
dramatic effects of obesity on the heart and on children. When we were kids, we
played outside all day long until our parents called us in for dinner. We were
active and we grew up to be healthy adults. 
In the last 30 years childhood
obesity has more than doubled. That’s a future we need to change. As it stands
now, these children will grow up to have increased heart risk factors,
prediabetes or diabetes, higher risk for stroke and a whole other host of image
problems that are associated with obesity.
Here’s a sobering note: this is the
first generation in the history of our country that is projected to die at an
earlier average age than the previous generation.
That’s not a future we can live with! 






                                                 
Champions Youth Fitness is targeting
$250,000 for our KidShape program. That money will be used to help make a dent
in the childhood obesity epidemic specifically by:


Improving and redesigning the app for better user experience for kids
Offering healthy products to complement the essential program recommendations and goals.
Creating better tools to assist in tracking and keeping a healthy lifestyle
Adding more options and components to continue improving the overall program and experience.

All of these objectives will add up
to make a stronger impact on this very real and very dangerous problem.

                                       
I’m Paul Bosley. I launched Champions
Youth Fitness 5 years ago to create a solution to our youth obesity crisis. I
believe that our health is our most prized possession and I’ve practiced what I
preach for my entire lifetime. After hearing Michelle Obama talk about the probem
with childhood obesity, I knew something had to be done and I wanted to help.
And I’m Saeb Jannoun. I’ve been in
the health and fitness industry for years and have seen first hand what the
benefits are, both mentally and physically. I’m a father and have children and
I never want to see mine experiencing any of the shaming, health concerns and
mental issues that come with childhood obesity.
Additionally, we have an experienced
and knowledgeable team supporting this effort including:
Christiane Wert Rivard, MPH, RD a
registered dietitian with a Master’s Degree in Public Health and over 15 years
of experience in developing, implementing and evaluating comprehensive
childhood obesity programs.
Beth Braun, PhD who specializes in
children and families dealing with weight issues and has been featured in the
national media, including the Oprah Winfrey show, discussing childhood obesity.
John Rutigliano who has a Masters
Degree with a concentration in Exercise Physiology and doctoral studies in
Applied and his career includes the design, development and distribution of
child/youth exercise equipment with a self published manual for his BEE-FIT
programs. 
Chef Erin Tyler with over 30 years of
culinary education and experience. After graduating from the Culinary Institute
of America in New York, she went on to develop the culinary program for the
nation's first private High School for overweight teens and created the
culinary program for their weight loss camps that are located worldwide. During
that time she was also a culinary educator, teaching over 1,000 young adults
and children essential cooking skills and how to create menus and recipes to
use throughout their lifetime.


The whole team at KidShape takes the
future of children seriously. Please join us in helping to impact their lives
in a way that could vastly improve their future as well as the future of their
families and the many people whose lives they’ll touch. The future of many
depends on the actions we take today. You may not think you can play a part but
every little bit helps and we intend to bring exposure to and address this
issue of childhood obesity.



It would mean a lot to us if
you would spread the word by simply clicking the Facebook and Twitter buttons
on these pages. Just two clicks could make a huge difference!Please forward to friends, family, co-workers…anyone you think might be interested. The more the better!

Hence, the concept of the ASD Gym was born.</p><p>The ASD Gym will provide an environment where teens with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) can visit and participate in a range of physical activities, where they can learn to move, get strong and fit.'Move, Strong, and Fit' are the three elements that help build the physical and mental confidence in everyone. The environment will be designed with three distinct training areas and activities:</p><p></p><ol>

</ol><p></p><p>These activities offer a way to formalise patterns and add structure that many ASD teens find comforting. The Move, Strong, Fit paradigm is one I feel will bring many essentials to the teens as they move from adolescent to young adult. A time when they may feel like they don't belong and possibly find it difficult to accomplish and achieve goals in the mainstream. Being able to Move, be Strong and Fit will give them confidence in themselves and help them to overcome many situations where they may not have the ability to adjust to specific circumstances, they wont be the 'misfits' often associated with ASD children. With a deliberate play on words the MiSFIT name will take pride of place in the Gym. As immortalised by the Apple ""Think Different"" campaign in the late 90's, it will help people appreciate that we are different and inspiring in our own ways.

<p><b>WHAT IS SUPERBETTER?</b></p>
<p><span>SuperBetter is a gameful way of living that increases resilience: the ability to stay strong, motivated, and optimistic even in the face of difficult challenges. Resilience has a powerful effect on health—by boosting physical and emotional well-being. Resilience also helps you achieve your life goals—by strengthening your social support and increasing your stamina, willpower, and focus. <span><span>Every aspect of the game is designed to harness the power of positive emotions and social connection to help you improve your life. </span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>WHO IS SUPERBETTER FOR?</b></p>
<p><span>SuperBetter is for people who want more out of life—who want to feel happier, healthier, and more able to reach their goals. SuperBetter was designed with universal psychological research—meaning anyone can benefit from playing, regardless of age, gender, or location! Anyone over the age of 13 can create an account at SuperBetter.</span></p>
<p><span><b>WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF PLAYING SUPERBETTER?</b></span></p>
<p><span>SuperBetter makes you stronger. It helps you build social, mental, physical and emotional resilience in the face of any illness, injury, or health goal. Building resilience—the ability to stay optimistic, curious, motivated, and connected to others even in the face of an extreme challenge—has been scientifically proven to improve health outcomes of all kinds. Playing SuperBetter makes you more capable of getting through any tough situation—and more likely to achieve the goals that matter most to you.</span></p>

</p>
<p><b>IS THE APP AVAILABLE FOR MY MOBILE DEVICE?</b></p>
<p><span>Yes, the SuperBetter app is available for iPhone &amp; iPads, and Android devices. You can also play it on any web browser by visiting <a href=""http://superbetter.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><b>SuperBetter.com</b></span></a>. </span></p>

<p><span>The mobile apps are a companion to the website, not a full version of it. Some features (like your Secret Lab and your Ally dashboard) are only available on the website version for now. We plan to continually add new features to the mobile apps, so be on the lookout for updates! If you've only played on your phone, you can log in to your account at <a href=""http://www.superbetter.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>SuperBetter.com</b></a> to discover even more ways to get SuperBetter!</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>PLAYING THE GAME</b></p>
<p><b>WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO “PLAY” SUPERBETTER?</b></p>
<p><span>SuperBetter is a gameful way of living your real life—we just help you keep track of it. You can sign up and tell us what challenge you’re trying to tackle, and we’ll recommend Power-ups to help you feel better, Bad Guys to watch out for, and Quests you can do to get closer to your goals. Each time you complete a Quest, activate a Power-up, or battle a Bad Guy, just log into SuperBetter and push the “I DID THIS!” button to record your action. This will increase your personal resilience in real life and also move you forward in your SuperBetter adventure.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>WHAT'S THE MINIMUM I SHOULD DO EACH DAY TO GET SUPERBETTER?</b></p>
<p><span>To get the most out of SuperBetter, we recommend a ""Daily Dose"":</span></p>
<p><i>Activate 3 Power-ups</i></p>
<p><i>Battle 1 Bad Guy</i></p>
<p><i>Complete 3 Quests </i></p>
<p>Your To Do list will automatically keep track of everything you do, so you'll know when your Daily Dose is complete. If you have more time, check in with an Ally, do more Quests, or update the Trackers in your Secret Lab!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>HOW DO I WIN SUPERBETTER?</b></p>
<p><span>You win SuperBetter by achieving your Epic Win, a real-life goal you set for yourself at the start of the game. When you achieve your Epic Win, you can choose a new goal and start a new game!</span></p>
<p>SuperBetter is like life. It's a process, not an outcome. We think that you win every day you show up, face your challenges, and keep aiming for your goals.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>HOW CAN I KEEP A POSITIVE ATTITUDE AND STICK WITH IT?</b></p>
<p><span>If you're struggling to keep a ""never give up"" attitude, here are some tips that might help you along:</span></p>
<p>Focus less on outcomes and goals and more on tiny steps that feel good in the moment.</p>
<p>Enlist plenty of positive social support. This is hands-down the best thing any of us can do to improve our health and attitude towards our health.</p>
<p>Accept that some days will be easy and others will be hard. It's normal and okay. Having a down day (or week even) doesn't mean you're doing anything ""wrong."" Just keep taking your Daily Dose!</p>
<p>Know that sometimes it takes hard work, grit, and determination to transform our challenges. Other times all we can do is witness our situation with neutral attention. Experiment with what works best for you.</p>
<p>Be sure that when you do choose a goal, you're choosing something that is a stretch but still realistic and attainable. Start small!</p>
<p>And most importantly—be good to yourself. Celebrate even tiny successes.</p>

Yes, the SuperBetter app is available for iPhone & iPads, and Android devices. You can also play it on any web browser by visiting SuperBetter.com. 


ARE THE FEATURES THE SAME ON THE MOBILE APP AS THEY ARE ON THE WEBSITE?
The mobile apps are a companion to the website, not a full version of it. Some features (like your Secret Lab and your Ally dashboard) are only available on the website version for now. We plan to continually add new features to the mobile apps, so be on the lookout for updates! If you've only played on your phone, you can log in to your account at SuperBetter.com to discover even more ways to get SuperBetter!


PLAYING THE GAME
WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO “PLAY” SUPERBETTER?
SuperBetter is a gameful way of living your real life—we just help you keep track of it. You can sign up and tell us what challenge you’re trying to tackle, and we’ll recommend Power-ups to help you feel better, Bad Guys to watch out for, and Quests you can do to get closer to your goals. Each time you complete a Quest, activate a Power-up, or battle a Bad Guy, just log into SuperBetter and push the “I DID THIS!” button to record your action. This will increase your personal resilience in real life and also move you forward in your SuperBetter adventure.


WHAT'S THE MINIMUM I SHOULD DO EACH DAY TO GET SUPERBETTER?
To get the most out of SuperBetter, we recommend a ""Daily Dose"":
Activate 3 Power-ups
Battle 1 Bad Guy
Complete 3 Quests 
Your To Do list will automatically keep track of everything you do, so you'll know when your Daily Dose is complete. If you have more time, check in with an Ally, do more Quests, or update the Trackers in your Secret Lab!


HOW DO I WIN SUPERBETTER?
You win SuperBetter by achieving your Epic Win, a real-life goal you set for yourself at the start of the game. When you achieve your Epic Win, you can choose a new goal and start a new game!
SuperBetter is like life. It's a process, not an outcome. We think that you win every day you show up, face your challenges, and keep aiming for your goals.


HOW CAN I KEEP A POSITIVE ATTITUDE AND STICK WITH IT?
If you're struggling to keep a ""never give up"" attitude, here are some tips that might help you along:
Focus less on outcomes and goals and more on tiny steps that feel good in the moment.
Enlist plenty of positive social support. This is hands-down the best thing any of us can do to improve our health and attitude towards our health.
Accept that some days will be easy and others will be hard. It's normal and okay. Having a down day (or week even) doesn't mean you're doing anything ""wrong."" Just keep taking your Daily Dose!
Know that sometimes it takes hard work, grit, and determination to transform our challenges. Other times all we can do is witness our situation with neutral attention. Experiment with what works best for you.
Be sure that when you do choose a goal, you're choosing something that is a stretch but still realistic and attainable. Start small!
And most importantly—be good to yourself. Celebrate even tiny successes.",24.0,2,"1 Campaign

<div>I have been around for more than a decade on the internet. My Nest of Dragons website became the home of the weird airplanes. I tried to explain why some non-conventional designs were made and what were their advantages and disadvantages. I always tried to talk in easy words as i mostly have the men of the street in my mind. Weird and low budget became the main features on my website.<span><br/></span>
</div>
<div>After that decade of just talking about airplanes, i started to construct things. Not always airplane related, but i made some nice stuff in the past. A electric recumbent scooter called the Funbike. Gullwing doors for the Secma F16. A new fairing for the Bi-Swift of our gliding club. A nearly finished project called DragonWing to revive the intellect of the Horten HXc. My findings during my DragonWing tests are being used by NASA with their Prandtl project. </div>

<div>I am not a engineer. But i have friends who are. The team of Predrag Devic did wonderful work. Thanks, guys. My creativity and their knowledge about strength, materials and aerodynamics did lead to a few nice designs. The BirdGlider, the DragonCub (a Flying Flea with metal-alu construction. FAR103) and a third (which i like to keep a secret now)</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438656167/tubzct1tt9cgnpdgqzxl.png"" src="""" style=""""/><span><br/></span><i>DragonCub, my attempt to revive the Flying Flea concept of Henri Mignet.</i></p></div>
<div><h3>What will i gain?</h3></div> <p>Nothing except the fact that a design of me and my team will not become shelved. It will life on. I am sure i will get wet eyes if i ever will see a person getting airborne with my BirdGlider.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What will YOU gain?</h3>Depends on your situation.<span><br/></span><p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you are looking for fun flying, relaxed flying, you may stop your search. This is it. BirdGlider might be the end of YOUr search.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you are using a wheelchair (old hangglider pilot for instance)...it opens possibilities. It might be the perfect, affordable tool to get YOU in the air (again). You might realise (continue) your dream of flight.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you were just afraid of those foot landings with your hangglider, you may stop being afraid. The BirdGlider lands on a wheel. It saves YOUr feet.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words ...YOU gain possibilities ...after the prototype proofed its stability and safe use.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>For a long time i have been following the low budget airplanes. Sadly ...i saw many disappear and not a lot of them being developed. BirdGlider is meant to fill that gap. The gap between YOU standing on the ground and YOU being AIRBORNE.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risks for me are pretty severe.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I apply as test pilot of the BirdGlider. I am just a beginner pilot. But i take the risk. I lost a daughter already. Not going to loose a friend because i made a mistake in the design. I realise if all goes wrong ...i risk my neck. There was talk about some professional test pilot willing to take the test flights. He is the only person i allow to do the test flights if he still want to do it.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If some not-so-noble person finds a gap in my rules, he might make me loose my house in a lawsuit. He will not gain a lot of money, but ...i will loose my future.</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If i need to put more personal money in this project, i loose the change to finish my third project. And that one will be also a good airplane for low budget flying. But this one will make it possible for YOU to travel with your airplane. And i really would hate to loose that adventure.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The risk of the builder of the prototype in USA. </p>
<p></p>
<ul><li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I gave my connection parts of my half finished prototype to a guy in the USA in a attempt to have the prototype ready for Airventure 2015 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA. He sadly had some heart problems, so he cannot build it himself anymore. But he wants now to start building the prototype with students of a technical school. And i am pretty sure he is able to get it done. BirdGlider is really easy to build. It was my first alu bolt and rivet work and i made half of the airplane in 25 hours! The challenge of the young builders will be enormous. They will build a airplane! They don't have a drivers license, but ...they build a airplane. Imagine that!</span><br/>
</li></ul>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What you get in return?</h3> <p>Sorry. But i will not promise any T-shirts or buttons or whatever as a gift after your donation. I don't want you to loose more money than you would like to donate. Doesn't seem fair to me towards you.</p>
<p>All i can say is that YOU win ...the possibility to create YOUr own way to become airborne. The plans are for free. The materials are not that expensive. The build up is not so hard. And ...with the test results of the test flights you will gain the certainty that you are working on a good airplane. A airplane for ...the men of the street.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>If i raise more money?</h3>
<div>The extra money will be spend on the installation of engines on the prototype and to test that configuration of new, reinforced connection parts (to replace the old ones) and the engines. If still some money left over, it will be used for my other low-budget design prototypes. So ...it will all go into aviation development.

</div></div>","BirdGlider The BirdGlider plans are available FOR FREE. Consider it my gift to the aviation world. Go see the video!!It is designed for YOU. It can help YOU to become a pilot. It is easy enough for YOU. And will be at low budget so YOU can afford it.But to build the prototype i need YOU.
I did all to go as far as i could. But i lack the funds to finish the prototype. Without prototype, no test flights. Without test flights, no knowledge about flight behaviour. No knowledge about flight behaviour, no trust in BirdGlider. No trust, no BirdGlider. And ...there are not  a lot of other options that can be as easy to make, easy to use, safe to use as the BirdGlider.
So ...the BirdGlider airplane stands and falls with YOU. It could be my gift to the aviation world or ...it might become shelved. And that last would be a loss. Not for me. But for YOU.   Who am i?
I have been around for more than a decade on the internet. My Nest of Dragons website became the home of the weird airplanes. I tried to explain why some non-conventional designs were made and what were their advantages and disadvantages. I always tried to talk in easy words as i mostly have the men of the street in my mind. Weird and low budget became the main features on my website.

After that decade of just talking about airplanes, i started to construct things. Not always airplane related, but i made some nice stuff in the past. A electric recumbent scooter called the Funbike. Gullwing doors for the Secma F16. A new fairing for the Bi-Swift of our gliding club. A nearly finished project called DragonWing to revive the intellect of the Horten HXc. My findings during my DragonWing tests are being used by NASA with their Prandtl project. 



New fairing for Bi-Swift
I am not a engineer. But i have friends who are. The team of Predrag Devic did wonderful work. Thanks, guys. My creativity and their knowledge about strength, materials and aerodynamics did lead to a few nice designs. The BirdGlider, the DragonCub (a Flying Flea with metal-alu construction. FAR103) and a third (which i like to keep a secret now)
DragonCub, my attempt to revive the Flying Flea concept of Henri Mignet.
What will i gain? Nothing except the fact that a design of me and my team will not become shelved. It will life on. I am sure i will get wet eyes if i ever will see a person getting airborne with my BirdGlider.

What will YOU gain?Depends on your situation.


If you are looking for fun flying, relaxed flying, you may stop your search. This is it. BirdGlider might be the end of YOUr search.


If you are using a wheelchair (old hangglider pilot for instance)...it opens possibilities. It might be the perfect, affordable tool to get YOU in the air (again). You might realise (continue) your dream of flight.


If you were just afraid of those foot landings with your hangglider, you may stop being afraid. The BirdGlider lands on a wheel. It saves YOUr feet.


In other words ...YOU gain possibilities ...after the prototype proofed its stability and safe use.
    The Impact For a long time i have been following the low budget airplanes. Sadly ...i saw many disappear and not a lot of them being developed. BirdGlider is meant to fill that gap. The gap between YOU standing on the ground and YOU being AIRBORNE.
    Risks & Challenges The risks for me are pretty severe.



I apply as test pilot of the BirdGlider. I am just a beginner pilot. But i take the risk. I lost a daughter already. Not going to loose a friend because i made a mistake in the design. I realise if all goes wrong ...i risk my neck. There was talk about some professional test pilot willing to take the test flights. He is the only person i allow to do the test flights if he still want to do it.


If some not-so-noble person finds a gap in my rules, he might make me loose my house in a lawsuit. He will not gain a lot of money, but ...i will loose my future.

If i need to put more personal money in this project, i loose the change to finish my third project. And that one will be also a good airplane for low budget flying. But this one will make it possible for YOU to travel with your airplane. And i really would hate to loose that adventure.

The risk of the builder of the prototype in USA. 


I gave my connection parts of my half finished prototype to a guy in the USA in a attempt to have the prototype ready for Airventure 2015 in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, USA. He sadly had some heart problems, so he cannot build it himself anymore. But he wants now to start building the prototype with students of a technical school. And i am pretty sure he is able to get it done. BirdGlider is really easy to build. It was my first alu bolt and rivet work and i made half of the airplane in 25 hours! The challenge of the young builders will be enormous. They will build a airplane! They don't have a drivers license, but ...they build a airplane. Imagine that!

    What you get in return? Sorry. But i will not promise any T-shirts or buttons or whatever as a gift after your donation. I don't want you to loose more money than you would like to donate. Doesn't seem fair to me towards you.
All i can say is that YOU win ...the possibility to create YOUr own way to become airborne. The plans are for free. The materials are not that expensive. The build up is not so hard. And ...with the test results of the test flights you will gain the certainty that you are working on a good airplane. A airplane for ...the men of the street.

If i raise more money?
The extra money will be spend on the installation of engines on the prototype and to test that configuration of new, reinforced connection parts (to replace the old ones) and the engines. If still some money left over, it will be used for my other low-budget design prototypes. So ...it will all go into aviation development.

So why reinvent the hair dryer?Well, the answer is simple really…The standard hair dryer causes hair chaos and frizz. I have a background in Information Technology and I am accustomed to looking at a problem, assessing the issue, breaking down the requirements, engaging the correct team of resources, creating the solution, and driving to success.With my background and need to win the war on frizz, I have developed and patented a new hair dryer that will remove or substantially reduce frizz from your morning routine. Now everyday can be a great hair day!Let me state that I love hair products,  all hair products. Flat irons, curling irons, hair goop, all of it. However, I have fine, baby-like hair that I keep ""encouraging"" to naturally change color to the blonde that I believe I truly am.  

Benefits of this new hair dryer:
1. Eliminate or substantially reduce hair chaos (frizz)! Really, who doesn't want that? 
2. Faster drying time by using hot air in both directions. 
3. Less damage to the hair follicle by reducing time with other damaging hair tools (ex: flat iron). If you want that poker straight hair you may still have to use a flat iron.
4. Smooth hair, not flat hair - when you use the flat iron (to get rid of frizz) you sometimes end up with flat hair. The Smoothing Hair dryer will not flatten your hair. It will allow body and fullness but still eliminate the hair chaos (frizz).

Where did we start?

Step 1: Define the idea




Step 2: Build a simple proof of concept out of household components






Step 3: File for provisional patent
Step 4: Design prototype that can use a standard hair dryer and a vacuum to establish proof of concept. 



Step 5: Build 3D model prototype to work with existing hair dryer (white attachment on front of hair dryer)





Step 6: Hire an industrial designer 


Step 7: Create a 3D drawing 


Step 8: Create a design for the final product






Step 9 (Where we are now): Funding - We need your help!


Challenges - The Next Phases
Now that we have established the proof of concept and secured the necessary legal documents, we enter the engineering stage of the process. The next couple of phases are critical to ensure that the product can withstand everyday use and achieve the desired results. 
This is where we need your help.


 As you can see in the chart below I have outlined a project plan with a time line of expected dates and estimated costs. As anyone knows, a time line and budget are estimates, and must remain flexible to accommodate unforeseen challenges.  





This product has a 18 month development period but the good new is you will only have 18 months more of hair chaos then you will have the tools to fight this war on hair chaos.

<p></p>
<p>Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, affecting 41 million people, most of them in the world's poorest countries.<b> Children are the most frequently infected</b> by trachoma which, if untreated, causes a painful and irreversible blindness by age 30-40. </p>
<p>Ethiopia is particularly severely affected, making up 30% of trachoma cases in all of Africa. In fact, trachoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the country.</p>
<p>Trachoma is a completely preventable and treatable cause of blindness. Blindness and severe pain can be prevented through a safe, affordable surgical procedure that costs <b>only $40 per patient</b>. Unfortunately, most patients cannot afford the necessary treatments and as a result, many of the <b>1.2 million people who need surgery will go irreversibly blind from this disease</b>. </p>Our mission is to make high quality eye care more accessible to the world's poorest communities and help prevent blindness caused not only by trachoma but by many diseases that affect the eye. You can help us get started by funding the first surgeries performed by our new, state-of-the art eye hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p></p>
<p>Sight for Souls is a Christian non-profit company dedicated to bringing world class eye care to countries in need. Our first project is an eye hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the Discovery Specialized Eye Hospital, which will treat this city of 6 million people, many of whom suffer from acute or chronic Trachoma and need surgery to save their sight. </p>
<ul>
<li>Trachoma surgery is only $40 per person. Our goal is to raise funds to perform 1,000 trachoma surgeries through the Discovery Specialized Eye Hospital.</li>
<li>Your funds will go directly to helping us open the hospital and perform surgeries on affected patients.</li>
<li>Additional funds beyond our goal will fund new equipment to help us perform further trachoma surgeries, pilot our affordable cataract surgery program, and train Ethiopia's new generation of ophthalmologists and eye care professionals.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Trachoma is a leading cause of blindness, particularly in the developing world. Infection spreads from person to person, especially among families and in communities with shortages of water, numerous flies, or over-crowded living conditions (often the poorest communities in the world).</p>
<p>Infection often begins during infancy or childhood and can become chronic. If left untreated, the infection eventually causes the eyelid to turn inwards, which in turn causes the eyelashes to rub on the eyeball, resulting in intense pain and scarring of the front of the eye. This frequently leads to irreversible blindness, typically between 30 and 40 years of age.</p>
<p>Our campaign has the potential to save the vision of 1,000 people in Ethiopia. Our hospital has the potential to save the vision of hundreds of thousands more. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>Who We Are</h3>
<div></div>

</div><p></p></div>","Save the Sight of Someone in Need for only $40 - Fund a Trachoma surgery in Ethiopia 

Trachoma is the leading infectious cause of blindness worldwide, affecting 41 million people, most of them in the world's poorest countries. Children are the most frequently infected by trachoma which, if untreated, causes a painful and irreversible blindness by age 30-40. 
Ethiopia is particularly severely affected, making up 30% of trachoma cases in all of Africa. In fact, trachoma is the second leading cause of blindness in the country.
Trachoma is a completely preventable and treatable cause of blindness. Blindness and severe pain can be prevented through a safe, affordable surgical procedure that costs only $40 per patient. Unfortunately, most patients cannot afford the necessary treatments and as a result, many of the 1.2 million people who need surgery will go irreversibly blind from this disease. Our mission is to make high quality eye care more accessible to the world's poorest communities and help prevent blindness caused not only by trachoma but by many diseases that affect the eye. You can help us get started by funding the first surgeries performed by our new, state-of-the art eye hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.    What We Need 
Sight for Souls is a Christian non-profit company dedicated to bringing world class eye care to countries in need. Our first project is an eye hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the Discovery Specialized Eye Hospital, which will treat this city of 6 million people, many of whom suffer from acute or chronic Trachoma and need surgery to save their sight. 

Trachoma surgery is only $40 per person. Our goal is to raise funds to perform 1,000 trachoma surgeries through the Discovery Specialized Eye Hospital.
Your funds will go directly to helping us open the hospital and perform surgeries on affected patients.
Additional funds beyond our goal will fund new equipment to help us perform further trachoma surgeries, pilot our affordable cataract surgery program, and train Ethiopia's new generation of ophthalmologists and eye care professionals.    The Impact 

Trachoma is a leading cause of blindness, particularly in the developing world. Infection spreads from person to person, especially among families and in communities with shortages of water, numerous flies, or over-crowded living conditions (often the poorest communities in the world).
Infection often begins during infancy or childhood and can become chronic. If left untreated, the infection eventually causes the eyelid to turn inwards, which in turn causes the eyelashes to rub on the eyeball, resulting in intense pain and scarring of the front of the eye. This frequently leads to irreversible blindness, typically between 30 and 40 years of age.
Our campaign has the potential to save the vision of 1,000 people in Ethiopia. Our hospital has the potential to save the vision of hundreds of thousands more.

</div>","Meet Thumby




In a nutshell, Thumby protects 
your secret data from prying eyes and thieves. With the combination of the 
integrated hardware encryption chip, your iPhone’s Touch ID sensor and Bluetooth 
Smart interface, Thumby ensures 
ultimate security and reliability for your private files. Thumby will 
make your busy life more efficient and productive.







 




Thumby For 
Everyone


We believe in privacy. More or less, everyone keep their critical information in 
digital environments, therefore, protecting that information is essential. 
Identity information, bank accounts, credit cards, passwords of all kinds, 
private messages, corporate data, important project files, financial records, 
know-how information, chat logs, secret photos, private videos, sound records, 
etc. You can extend this list easily.


For a brief moment, think of losing your laptop or your hard drive which holds 
all kinds of valuable sensitive data. You would be at the mercy of anyone who 
stumbles through it. Thanks to Thumby, 
there’s no need to worry anymore. Your data remains to be secure even if your 
drive falls into the wrong hands.


 













Easy to Set Up and Use



Thumby is 
designed to replace your standard unsecure external hard drive enclosure. It’s 
not just compact and stylish it’s also extremely easy to set up and use, in just 
a few steps.


Each Thumby pack 
comes with a USB 3.0 cable, a mini screwdriver, an instruction manual and a 
printed unique master key to activate your Thumby.


You simply install your 2.5” SSD or mechanical hard drive into Thumby and 
connect it to your computer through the USB port. Finally, the companion iOS app 
needs to be installed on your iPhone in order to control your Thumby. 
That’s all there is to it! Now you’re ready to safely store your valuable data.  


 








Thumby is designed to give you a wide feature set you turn on and off to suit your needs. Thumby basically has two operation modes that are explained in details below.



Automatic Locking/Unlocking


With this mode enabled, the moment you enter inside the predefined distange range, Thumby will 
automatically unlock your drive. You can directly access your data when you stay 
inside this area. When you’re out, Thumby will 
automatically lock your drive.











 



Unlocking With Your Fingerprint


When you’re demanding extra security, Touch ID mode comes handy. With this mode 
is enabled, Thumby will 
automatically lock your drive when you’re out of the predefined distange range. 
This is much like the previously explained automatic locking/unlocking mode 
except, when you enter inside the predefined range, your drive needs to be 
unlocked with Touch ID authentication. This mode adds an extra layer or 
protection, preventing intruders accessing your drive even if they took your 
iPhone without your permission.













  



Elegant Design


After designing a fair amount of different prototypes, we finally made Thumby that 
is beautifully and minimally designed. It is stylish and lightweight. Thumby will 
be available in five different vibrant colors you can choose from; black, 
silver, blue, pink and gold.


















Technical Specifications



Thumby uses 
Bluetooth Smart (Bluetooth Low Energy) technology in order to communicate with 
your iPhone. This protocol is eco-friendly and consumes very small amount of 
battery power when it’s active. Thumby encrypts 
your data on-the-fly, using a unique master key together with your Touch ID. Thumby uses 
an unparalleled encyption algorithm, 
which is executed by the integrated cryptoprocessor. 
For that reason, encryption/decryption process does not slow down your data 
transfer. Under the hood, Thumby uses 
a specially designed asymmetric encryption algorithm for the bluetooth communication 
which is carried out between your Iphone and Thumby. 
This aforementioned bluetooth signal 
encryption algorithm prevents man-in-the-middle and sniffing attacks. Thumby serves 
maximum data transfer capability when paired with a USB 3.0 drive. 


  



















Compatibility










 



Supported Devices









Unfortunately, there won’t be any support for iPhone 4 and older versions, because those iPhone models don’t have bluetooth smart capability.

<h3><i>this is a growing problem...</i></h3>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>This overeating trend is everywhere, nationally and globally, in youth and adults.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1416992/files/20150426162429-obesity_growth.jpg?1430090669"" src="""" style=""width: 290.43816254417px; height: 206px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It is apparent that an increasingly stressed population is satiating themselves with food.  We consume too much of the wrong food because it temporarily makes us feel 'full', easing the emptiness that leads to unhealthy behavior.  </p>
<p>People are turning to drugs and devices to physically prevent obesity and still are growing larger.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1414249/files/20150425105644-obesity-drug-sales-segment-growth.jpg?1429984604"" src="""" style=""width: 283.116883116883px; height: 218px;""/></p>
<p>Addictive behaviors are emotionally numbing, and this can lead to depression, to a life that is not satisfying.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, 43% of depressed adults are obese.(<a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db167.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db167.htm</a>)</p>
<p>Think of it this way: 2/3 of our country is overweight, often due to being stressed, angry, frustrated, or depressed.  And we all are collectively OK, with this, because we know we can't just quit eating.  So bodies are getting bigger, enthusiasm for life is getting smaller, health conditions are worsening, our sense of separation and aloneness is growing, and the unconscious consumption continues.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">When a friend or colleague or family member is addicted to alcohol, or opiates, or sex, or tobacco, we NOTICE, we know something is wrong.  But everyone has to eat, and with waistlines and shirt sizes growing on all sides of us we have turned a blind eye to this national cry out to be noticed, heard and seen.</span></p>
<h3><i>why yoga is a solution</i></h3>
<p>Obesity is a symptom of a mind and body out of balance, and yoga offers corrective therapy to bring balance back into the body and mind.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1412939/files/20150424175220-yoga-transforms-mind-body-spirit-fb.jpg?1429923140"" src="""" style=""width: 258.883248730964px; height: 136px;""/></p>
<p>An individual with balance in body and mind will learn to treat food as medicine, and not as an escape from discomfort and depression.</p>
<p>At Yoga Farm, our programs for the larger individuals include stretching and physical exercises, but also incorporates mindfulness and meditation, walking in nature, and coaching with effective techniques to clear the mind of stressful thinking that leads to overeating, low-self esteem, guilt, or malaise.</p>
<p>We are the only yoga center with holistic, comprehensive programs to treat the body, mind and spirit of a plus-sized person, including unlimited yoga classes specifically designed for overweight individuals.</p>
<h3><i>why I can present this solution well</i></h3>I am a yoga teacher, a health coach and a wellness pioneer.  I've been studying the mind/body link and tools from the science of yoga and meditation for two decades now.  My passion is in extracting the essence of these tools for healing the body and mind and presenting them in a format that everyone can do.</div><div>

</div><div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Here is a testimonial from a student here:</span></div><blockquote><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">“I’ve been an “Easy, Light and Fun” devotee since finding the studio five months ago.

BRIEFLY STATED
what I want to see
I am Christopher Grant - entrepreneur, yoga teacher and owner of the Yoga Farm.
I want to participate in a world where people are healthy and free to live into their life's purpose.
I want to see a world where all people have the opportunity to thrive and to live a life free of depression, addiction and loneliness.  
Here at Yoga Farm, I help overweight individuals and families return to balance and discover what they are truly hungry for. 
People who are balanced and living their life purpose will have peace of mind, ease in body, and joy in spirit.  


what is the problem

Here in the United States, we have a problem, as 2/3 of our population is overweight or obese according the National Institute for Health.
why is there a problem

The National Institute of Health states: 

""Obesity is a major public health problem and notoriously difficult to treat. There are many parallels between obesity/overeating and addictions to alcohol and drugs.""

Overeating is a particularly challenging addiction, as it roots deeply both in the body, and the mind.  
People over eat, or eat unconsciously because they want to change the way they feel.  This is leading to health problems for adults and children throughout America today.This is the health challenge of our time, and I am here to meet it head on with an open heart, with all of my passion, and with all of my skill as a teacher of yoga and meditation.

why is yoga farm a solution

Yoga is the perfect solution for healing the overweight body and depressed mind.  
Both the body and mind need to be treated, together, to step out of the cycle of a food addiction and restore balance and health.  

I am offering a powerful solution to this social problem that has grown out of personal and professional insight into the nature of addiction.


My Yoga Farm will be in the forefront of the national return to balance, by presenting classes, workshops, teacher trainings, online learning, and inspirational examples of courageous people taking that first step out of being stuck, and into personal wellness.
Yoga Farm is a gorgeous 65-acre farm with waterfalls, forests and fields just outside of Ithaca, NY, and our unique programs incorporate time in nature, daily walks, one on one coaching, along with yoga specifically designed for the overweight.

I'm fundraising today to complete our wellness center at Yoga Farm, to expand the reach of our programs, and to bring my proven yoga and mindfulness solutions for healing the body and mind to a national audience.  
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and people are taking that first step to health here at the Yoga Farm.

Please support this mission today, so I can help thousands of people take that first step on their journey to health, leading to a more peaceful and happy world for ourselves and our children. Thank You.

DETAILS
what can we do, together
A global population who truly cares for each other and our earth can solve any environment and social challenge that we turn our attention to.  
I am working towards to a nation of people who are healthy and working cooperatively together. Once all have equal opportunity and tools for peace of mind, ease in their body and and joy in spirit, then peace in the world will be possible.   

Where there's light in the soul there is beauty in the person             Where there's beauty in the person there is harmony within the homeWhere there's harmony within the home there's order in the nationWhere there's order in the nation there is peace in the world.-- Dr. Joe Marshalla




this is a growing problem...

This overeating trend is everywhere, nationally and globally, in youth and adults.




It is apparent that an increasingly stressed population is satiating themselves with food.  We consume too much of the wrong food because it temporarily makes us feel 'full', easing the emptiness that leads to unhealthy behavior.  
People are turning to drugs and devices to physically prevent obesity and still are growing larger.


Addictive behaviors are emotionally numbing, and this can lead to depression, to a life that is not satisfying.  According to the Centers for Disease Control, 43% of depressed adults are obese.(http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db167.htm)
Think of it this way: 2/3 of our country is overweight, often due to being stressed, angry, frustrated, or depressed.  And we all are collectively OK, with this, because we know we can't just quit eating.  So bodies are getting bigger, enthusiasm for life is getting smaller, health conditions are worsening, our sense of separation and aloneness is growing, and the unconscious consumption continues.

When a friend or colleague or family member is addicted to alcohol, or opiates, or sex, or tobacco, we NOTICE, we know something is wrong.  But everyone has to eat, and with waistlines and shirt sizes growing on all sides of us we have turned a blind eye to this national cry out to be noticed, heard and seen.
why yoga is a solution
Obesity is a symptom of a mind and body out of balance, and yoga offers corrective therapy to bring balance back into the body and mind.  


An individual with balance in body and mind will learn to treat food as medicine, and not as an escape from discomfort and depression.
At Yoga Farm, our programs for the larger individuals include stretching and physical exercises, but also incorporates mindfulness and meditation, walking in nature, and coaching with effective techniques to clear the mind of stressful thinking that leads to overeating, low-self esteem, guilt, or malaise.
We are the only yoga center with holistic, comprehensive programs to treat the body, mind and spirit of a plus-sized person, including unlimited yoga classes specifically designed for overweight individuals.
why I can present this solution wellI am a yoga teacher, a health coach and a wellness pioneer.  I've been studying the mind/body link and tools from the science of yoga and meditation for two decades now.  My passion is in extracting the essence of these tools for healing the body and mind and presenting them in a format that everyone can do.
I am a compassionate person who will not stand by while my family and friends, and your family and friends suffer from a problem that is treatable by the same tools that led me back to stability in body and mind.
Here is a testimonial from a student here:“I’ve been an “Easy, Light and Fun” devotee since finding the studio five months ago. I always look forward to coming to class and enjoy the relaxed peaceful feeling I go home with. The deep stretches and long holds have done an amazing job loosening my stiff joints and aching back. My spine feels so loose, I feel like a slinky! Christopher is an amazing teacher and a gift to Lansing. If you haven’t been to the Yoga Farm yet, I recommend you check it out.” – C.N. Lansing, NY

why I will be successful leading this solution
I am a successful entrepreneur and business leader, having created a technology services firm which I operated in Ithaca for many years.  
I love to bring people together to solve challenging problems. Several years ago, I handed over my technology company's leadership to a successor and turned my full attention to my study and teacher training in the science of yoga.
what is Yoga Farm offering?

I own, live, and teach on a gorgeous farm just outside of Ithaca, NY.  This land is peaceful, my classes are nurturing, and I'm witnessing people wake up, take my hand, and step bravely forward on the path to healing themselves. 
After hundreds of successful yoga sessions taught here I've established my mission, received strong community support, and am taking my first step towards turning this farm into a wellness center for the overweight, out-of-shape, and those that mainstream health and wellness have left behind.  
I'm fundraising today to complete the conversion of an antique barn into our home-base yoga Center, that will serve thousands of people, locally and nationally.  My unique, proven programs include gentle yoga classes, private yoga therapy, walking in the forests and fields, swimming and resting by waterfalls, and coaching work to identify and purge the stressful thinking that leads to overeating.
As 2/3 of our population gains access to mind/body yoga-inspired tools currently used by less than 10% of the population, they will begin to awaken to their own joy, to the potential in their own life.  Their sense of purpose and personal power will inspire others to take that first step on the road to wholeness.  They will start to feel seen by their family and co-workers and friends.  In turn they will shine their light and insights into dark corners of society, solving environmental and political issues, together.
what we need and what you'll get 

I'm creating a broad spectrum wellness enterprise, with Yoga Farm as my home base, for classes, camps, trainings, online learning and outreach.

I have a business plan, a marketing plan, a rock-star board of advisors, and have committed my own savings to bring this vision to life.  I'm bringing high quality teachers who share my mission to offer classes, workshops, teacher trainings and more here at Yoga Farm.

I'm dedicating my life to carrying this solution to the world, and I am giving you an opportunity today to be part of the solution.  I'm raising $25,000 minimally, with a stretch goal of $50,000, to complete the creation of the Yoga Center, and launch the national expansion of the programming that has already been proven here.

Make your contribution today; seize this opportunity to make a difference. I've created many perks specifically for this fundraising, or you may provide funds directly for continued construction so that I can complete Phase 1 of this Center.  Perks include classes, merchandise, programs, membership, private sessions, facility use, recognition on the building itself and much more are available.

For those who don't live near Yoga Farm, your financial support is very welcome! I'll put a 'thank you' plaque with your name by a component of the facility that you pay for: a gorge-view window, the main entrance, or will even dedicate the building to you or a cause close to you for specific contribution levels.  You can also 'pay it forward' and fund one of our programs for an individual who otherwise couldn't afford to participate.
Another perk is first access for my upcoming yoga-for-the-overweight video online learning series, so you can practice and share these powerful tools from the comfort of your own home, and take your first step back to wellness.
Ready to support our mission?  Take a look at the perks on the right. 


funding requirements
Here's our current status: We are half-way through our Center construction project, with a grand opening planned end of June and new programs launching July.  We are converting an antique, well-constructed barn into a 'Yoga Barn', well-lit with spacious windows overlooking the gorge, a hardwood floor in the main studio, a bathroom, and kitchen.  The second level is huge and will remain open for larger gatherings and talks.

About half of the funds have been committed and our construction is well underway. The week before launch of this campaign we completed our framing, roughed in plumbing and electric, and created an inviting entrance into the new Center.
Here are the specifics of what I require funding for by the end of May to launch Yoga Farm and bring our innovative body/ mind healing programs to those who need it this summer:



Heating / Cooling system: $6,000


Develop, print, distribute marketing materials for the new programs and promote summer launch: $2,500


Fixtures for kitchen and bath: $1,500


Insulation on all sides of Center: $10,000

Painting the inside of the studio: $1,500

Double-door main entrance: $2,450
Sustainable Bamboo hardwood floor: $5,000
Ceiling fans: $600

All funds raised in this campaign will go towards our mission of developing a retreat center, starting with completing this barn conversion.
Here is a walk-through of the barn where it is now, about 1/2 done:

</div><p><span><b>Indiegogo campaign for $10,000 Anna’s Oatcakes Start-up fund:</b></span></p><p><span><b>Anna’s Oatcakes are so different from anything else out there and yet the flavor of oats and maple is pleasing and familiar. The texture is usually the biggest surprise and sampling is the best way to overcome the general perception that healthy food has to sacrifice taste and texture.<br/></b></span></p><p>Hello. My name is Anna Jordan. I have over fifteen years of experience in the food and hospitality industry. I've been a server, dishwasher, cook, barista, host, manager, bookkeeper, general manager, business manager, innkeeper and event coordinator. I am currently working towards an Accounting Certificate at Champlain College.</p><p>I’m a Wesleyan graduate, mother of three nearly grown children, artist, animal lover, local food advocate &amp; the creator of this original recipe snack. I developed this recipe at a time when I was busy caring for my young children. I needed a healthy, energizing snack that would go with my morning coffee, keep the kids happy in the car, and give us all a boost any time of day. I used what I had in my kitchen working from an apple crisp recipe to create something simple and delicious.</p><p>The result was something entirely different from anything out there, Anna's Oatcakes, sweetened only with maple syrup. The thing that makes them so unique is the texture. They are more dense than a cookie or muffin, softer than a granola bar, healthier than a doughnut, and the maple flavor is complemented perfectly by carefully selected additions. The recipe is simple, but the process of creating the melt-in-your-mouth, almost creamy, texture is a closely guarded trade secret.<br/></p><p>They were so popular with my family and friends I was encouraged to start selling them to local stores and within three years built a business that was very close to supporting my family. I ran a test market for Anna’s Oatcakes from 2000-2003, gaining and servicing retail accounts throughout Vermont. Some of our most successful accounts were Sugarbush (Mt. Ellen), Hunger Mountain Co-op, Healthy Living, Gillinghams in Woodstock, and Bromley Mountain. The brand was well on its way to becoming a phenomenon, but life with three kids got busy and took us in another direction.</p><p>I’d always planned to come back to the oatcakes and finish what I’d started using some of the lessons learned in those early years, ie. weekly deliveries --driving throughout a rural state in all sorts of harsh weather was not necessarily the most cost-effective way to run the business. I've since come to the conclusion that Anna’s Oatcakes are a good candidate for online sales. I've chosen to reopen my shop on Etsy and start a campaign on Indiegogo to promote Anna’s Oatcakes and make them more widely available.</p><p>My ultimate vision for Anna’s Oatcakes is that they become a snack staple throughout North America. The most important element of this plan is to let as many people as possible try them.  My<span> target market is active people, outdoor sports enthusiasts, busy health conscious mothers, travelers, and coffee drinkers. </span></p><p>The major investment is in product for sampling and the labor required to get out there and sell. Anna’s Oatcakes basically sell themselves once people try them. Sampling is the best way to spread the word and I've built that principle into my business plan. Your contribution will help pay for raw goods, production facility rental fees, labor and packaging throughout the first three months. I intend to make producing and selling Anna’s Oatcakes my full time job for those three months (April-June 2015). After that, I will evaluate their reception and hopefully have the momentum to build the business from there.</p><br/><p><b>Perks!</b></p><ul>

I have found that partnering with associations and products that compliment the oatcakes helps to build the market. As previously stated, the most important element to building this business is to have a presence at events where people can try the product.

</div></div>","Indiegogo campaign for $10,000 Anna’s Oatcakes Start-up fund:Anna’s Oatcakes are so different from anything else out there and yet the flavor of oats and maple is pleasing and familiar. The texture is usually the biggest surprise and sampling is the best way to overcome the general perception that healthy food has to sacrifice taste and texture.Hello. My name is Anna Jordan. I have over fifteen years of experience in the food and hospitality industry. I've been a server, dishwasher, cook, barista, host, manager, bookkeeper, general manager, business manager, innkeeper and event coordinator. I am currently working towards an Accounting Certificate at Champlain College.I’m a Wesleyan graduate, mother of three nearly grown children, artist, animal lover, local food advocate & the creator of this original recipe snack. I developed this recipe at a time when I was busy caring for my young children. I needed a healthy, energizing snack that would go with my morning coffee, keep the kids happy in the car, and give us all a boost any time of day. I used what I had in my kitchen working from an apple crisp recipe to create something simple and delicious.The result was something entirely different from anything out there, Anna's Oatcakes, sweetened only with maple syrup. The thing that makes them so unique is the texture. They are more dense than a cookie or muffin, softer than a granola bar, healthier than a doughnut, and the maple flavor is complemented perfectly by carefully selected additions. The recipe is simple, but the process of creating the melt-in-your-mouth, almost creamy, texture is a closely guarded trade secret.They were so popular with my family and friends I was encouraged to start selling them to local stores and within three years built a business that was very close to supporting my family. I ran a test market for Anna’s Oatcakes from 2000-2003, gaining and servicing retail accounts throughout Vermont. Some of our most successful accounts were Sugarbush (Mt. Ellen), Hunger Mountain Co-op, Healthy Living, Gillinghams in Woodstock, and Bromley Mountain. The brand was well on its way to becoming a phenomenon, but life with three kids got busy and took us in another direction.I’d always planned to come back to the oatcakes and finish what I’d started using some of the lessons learned in those early years, ie. weekly deliveries --driving throughout a rural state in all sorts of harsh weather was not necessarily the most cost-effective way to run the business. I've since come to the conclusion that Anna’s Oatcakes are a good candidate for online sales. I've chosen to reopen my shop on Etsy and start a campaign on Indiegogo to promote Anna’s Oatcakes and make them more widely available.My ultimate vision for Anna’s Oatcakes is that they become a snack staple throughout North America. The most important element of this plan is to let as many people as possible try them.  My target market is active people, outdoor sports enthusiasts, busy health conscious mothers, travelers, and coffee drinkers. The major investment is in product for sampling and the labor required to get out there and sell. Anna’s Oatcakes basically sell themselves once people try them. Sampling is the best way to spread the word and I've built that principle into my business plan. Your contribution will help pay for raw goods, production facility rental fees, labor and packaging throughout the first three months. I intend to make producing and selling Anna’s Oatcakes my full time job for those three months (April-June 2015). After that, I will evaluate their reception and hopefully have the momentum to build the business from there.Perks!

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>
<p>My name is BlackIce Bell and I've done a variety of creative projects over the past decade. I am known mostly for my conceptual photography work and projects. I am also a published author and I serve as Editor-in-Chief of INSPIRE Magazine, which is an art magazine I created six years ago. To date, I have published over 30 issues of my magazine. I am Executive Producer of the INSPIRE Magazine Podcast. We have just launched our fourth season. I am also owner of INSPIRE Studios in Stone Mountain, GA. It is a photography studio where we photograph clients and support their multimedia needs.<br/><br/>Most creators are stuck between two standard options: creating art or living a ""regular"" life. Therefore, many hours are required each week just to make ends meet and sometimes that's not even enough.

</div></div>","Summary
My name is BlackIce Bell and I've done a variety of creative projects over the past decade. I am known mostly for my conceptual photography work and projects. I am also a published author and I serve as Editor-in-Chief of INSPIRE Magazine, which is an art magazine I created six years ago. To date, I have published over 30 issues of my magazine. I am Executive Producer of the INSPIRE Magazine Podcast. We have just launched our fourth season. I am also owner of INSPIRE Studios in Stone Mountain, GA. It is a photography studio where we photograph clients and support their multimedia needs.Most creators are stuck between two standard options: creating art or living a ""regular"" life. Therefore, many hours are required each week just to make ends meet and sometimes that's not even enough. Most creators either don't have time or too drained to work on their craft and innermost desires. So that's why I created NEKKED. A sweet, sexy product that's affordable and also help fellow creatives to empower themselves by earning additional income without needing a business loan.
By supporting NEKKED, you'll be helping me finance dope, creative projects and helping me, help others, which is something I always strived to do with my work. With the successful launch of NEKKED air freshener, we can expand the brand into other aroma-related products such as incense, soaps, and more! Can you just imagine NEKKED bodywash? We can! 
What the Money Will Be Used For:

Launch our website to sell products nationwide
To minimize costs and streamline operations by buying materials in bulk, such as bottles and oils
Labeling and packaging

 
The Impact
I'm really excited about NEKKED, because this is a great opportunity to help others to start their own business for as low as $30 with a 50% profit margin. People love NEKKED, it's a great product!
Pursuing ideas is nothing new to me. I have a proven track record of bringing ideas to life. Within the past ten years alone, I successfully published books, magazines, completed artistic photography projects, produced shows, and more! I love coming up with ideas and bringing them to life! 
 
Risks & Challenges
This project is low risk because I already have a relationship with a distributor and begun selling NEKKED in small batches. After the campaign, contributors can expect a quick turnaround on product. 
Money will be required for marketing, but most of it is done in-house. I created the branding and designed the bottles for NEKKED.

<p><strong>Background:</strong> Neurological disorders affect one billion people worldwide (i.e., 1 in 6 people), 65 million suffer from epilepsy, 24 million from Alzheimer’s and other dementias, 2.5 million from multiple sclerosis, and about 1% of the world population has been diagnosed with autism. Neurological disorders affect people in all countries, irrespective of age, sex, education or income.  A key problem is the lack of patient input in the therapy and device development process.  Neurology Patient Initiative will provide patients with a voice and the ability to direct neuroscience research objectives facilitating more effective therapies to reach patients quicker.  Neurology Patient Initiative will accelerate therapy and device development by offering award incentives to a network of solvers to develop solutions to patient-driven challenges.  Our global, open-innovation platform will securely manage patient entries and solver registrations, and will collate solutions during each competition phase.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491529574/trzwow5gi0uoiobupskx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our goal is to find solutions to neurology patient challenges through a network of professional or aspiring scientists, engineers, programmers, students, and makers.  We use a variety of funding sources including charitable gifts, competitive grants, crowdfunding, private investors, venture philanthropists, and biomedical business partnerships to reward the problem solvers and advance ideas down the development pipeline to patients.  All ideas submitted, be they out of the box, long shots, or unconventional, will be explored because your life and your ideas matter, nothing is off the table (e.g., a smart phone apps, data analytics, wearable tech, biomarkers, assistive devices, or any useful tool/invention to help make life work).  Please fill out a patient proposal and share your ideas (<a href=""http://www.patientinitiative.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.patientinitiative.org</a>).  Together we will bring science up to the speed of life.</p>

<p><strong>Development:</strong> Patients and caregivers are our partners and collaborators at Neurology Patient Initiative, and the benefactors of the NPI open-innovation platform include academics and clinicians, but also innovators outside of academia rich with ideas of how to help treat and improve the lives of people with neurologic disorders but lacking the funding to making their product or treatment a reality. We are currently testing the idea with neurology patient groups in the greater Denver area.  A paramount step towards reaching both the customers and the benefactors of NPI, however, is to build the minimum viable product (i.e., an open-innovation website) and test its efficacy against the solver populations.  Prototype websites will simultaneously be built in collaboration with the Computer Science Department at University of Colorado Boulder and at the Galvanize site in Boulder.  Each prototype will be launched in beta format to local/national neuroscience and technology communities for feedback (i.e., content, features, user-interface) regarding how the product can be improved.  Maintenance of the site will require a staff of Web developers, at least one good database person, and a small group of business personnel (operations, marketing, sales, finance, etc.).  We hope to recruit volunteer scientist reviewers, but may have to offer consultant fees.  Early stage cash flow is dependent on fundraising, grants, and investors/donors. NPI can seek to collaborate with winning submitters, or proceed independently to reduce solution to practice.  Therefore, until we are established, have a consistent donor base, and regular patient-driven challenges, our revenue will depend entirely on fundraising and grant submissions.  Therefore, the $250,000 will be directed towards prototype development, startup, legal costs, and fundraising.  Most importantly, we will use the funds raised here to catalyze patient-driven prize challenges.</p>

<b><br/></b><div>I started Geri G. after years of frustration of not being able to recommend a healthy makeup for my clients.  As a skin expert and makeup artist, I knew there was something missing on the market when it came to protecting women's skin and making makeup less harmful to the skin.  So I decided to try and make a skin care product that would also work with makeup to ensure that the skin was protected and nourished.  What I created was the first ever 4-1 skin supplement that  nourished the skin and instantly transformed makeup once it came in contact with the skin.  Transceutical® Canvas works on all skins and works with all makeup to instantly boost it's performance, making it more blend-able. water resistant and long lasting.  Transceutical Canvas is the only product that can be used both day and night as an anti aging moisturizer as well.</div>

We Make Products That Improve 

I started Geri G. after years of frustration of not being able to recommend a healthy makeup for my clients.  As a skin expert and makeup artist, I knew there was something missing on the market when it came to protecting women's skin and making makeup less harmful to the skin.  So I decided to try and make a skin care product that would also work with makeup to ensure that the skin was protected and nourished.  What I created was the first ever 4-1 skin supplement that  nourished the skin and instantly transformed makeup once it came in contact with the skin.  Transceutical® Canvas works on all skins and works with all makeup to instantly boost it's performance, making it more blend-able. water resistant and long lasting.  Transceutical Canvas is the only product that can be used both day and night as an anti aging moisturizer as well.





Our proprietary ingredient Nanomarine-5® is another exclusive formula the is part of the uniqueness in our products.  Key nutrients found in organic marine and land botanicals slowly feed the skin nourishment.  The extracts are chosen for their ability to maintain natural resources of skin supporting nutrients like Vitamins, A,C and E as well as omega's, proteins and minerals.                            




Our campaign is driven with our passion to make Geri G. available to women everywhere.  Our brand expansion will help bring the signature Geri G. skin therapies and beauty line available to mainstream. We have chosen New York because it is an international city that has the potential for us to reach more people as well as having a retail outlet for those who wish to experience the Geri G. difference first hand.





By helping us reach our goal, you are helping us change lives. There is nothing more gratifying than seeing a smile on a young girl's face after she realizes how beautiful and healthy her skin can become with the right products.  And there is nothing more gratifying than helping women who feel that their skin and body have let them down with age. Geri G. uses scientifically proven treatments and therapies that will be available to those who visit our New York location. We can make a difference and change how women of all ages address taking care of themselves from the inside-out, all under one roof.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<h4>So why do people dream of toilets?</h4>
<h4>What is the impact of making the Toilet Dream come true?</h4>
<p>Could you imagine a day at school or work without a toilet? What about a home without toilet? I've seen these realities behind the happy, easy-going scenes in Ghana. People dream of having a proper toilet, because it offers:</p>
<p>- Health. Different contagious, air- and waterborne diseases (e.g. cholera) can be significantly reduced by using and maintaining a hygienic toilet. Bad sanitation is the second common cause of death after malaria in developing countries.</p>
<p>- Safety and privacy, especially for girls and women who often experience sexual harassment when practicing open defecation or using public toilets.</p>
<p>- Gender equality for education. When girls and boys have safe, separate toilets and the menstrual management for girls is taken into consideration girls have much greater opportunities for education.</p>
<p>- Cost-effective way to reduce poverty. Improved sanitation saves time, increases production and reduces health costs.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">Then why buy only half of a toilet? </span><br/></p>
<p>We believe that by involving the customer to cover half of the toilet cost will create truly sustainable solutions for sanitation. The customers can feel proud and responsible when carrying out their part for their basic needs and common good for their living area. They will use and maintain the facilities with better care, which will extend the lifespan of the toilet.</p>
<p>Generally, this system will also help change ""the getting for free"" attitude. In several cases poor areas get help and donations from many organizations and NGOs and at some point this will not encourage the people to be initiative and responsible to help themselves and improve their lives and living conditions.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">And why composting toilets?</span><br/></p>
<p>Composting toilets fit excellently to the climate conditions of most developing countries.</p>
<p>The composting takes place efficiently and fast.</p>
<p>Our composting toilets run water-free. That's a great advantage in countries where there's water shortage and the sewage systems are undeveloped like Ghana.<br/></p>
<p>Commonly used pit latrines with poor underground structures cause leakage of the waste into water tables and the heavy rains and floods during the raining season spread severe diseases from the open sewers. Such problems have been taken into consideration with our products.
</p>
<p>The underground structures of the composting toilets are waterproof and there's a flood proof solution of one-half meter in most of our models.</p>
<p>When the facility is used and maintained all the waste breaks down into natural compost manure. This is a very affordable and Eco-friendly waste treatment solution. The compost manure collection from our facilities is easy and there's no need for trucks to zigzag on the bad, narrow roads of overpopulated urban areas.</p>
<p>In the capital of Ghana, Accra, 120 trucks of untreated waste is dumped into the Atlantic Ocean every day because of insufficient waste treatment plants for the highly populated city. Instead of creating waste, our toilets provide compost manure as an end product. It is an affordable natural fertilizer to be used by farmers. </p>
<p><br/></p>

- Gender equality for education. When girls and boys have safe, separate toilets and the menstrual management for girls is taken into consideration girls have much greater opportunities for education.
- Cost-effective way to reduce poverty. Improved sanitation saves time, increases production and reduces health costs.
Then why buy only half of a toilet? 
We believe that by involving the customer to cover half of the toilet cost will create truly sustainable solutions for sanitation. The customers can feel proud and responsible when carrying out their part for their basic needs and common good for their living area. They will use and maintain the facilities with better care, which will extend the lifespan of the toilet.
Generally, this system will also help change ""the getting for free"" attitude. In several cases poor areas get help and donations from many organizations and NGOs and at some point this will not encourage the people to be initiative and responsible to help themselves and improve their lives and living conditions.
And why composting toilets?
Composting toilets fit excellently to the climate conditions of most developing countries.
The composting takes place efficiently and fast.
Our composting toilets run water-free. That's a great advantage in countries where there's water shortage and the sewage systems are undeveloped like Ghana.
Commonly used pit latrines with poor underground structures cause leakage of the waste into water tables and the heavy rains and floods during the raining season spread severe diseases from the open sewers. Such problems have been taken into consideration with our products.

The underground structures of the composting toilets are waterproof and there's a flood proof solution of one-half meter in most of our models.
When the facility is used and maintained all the waste breaks down into natural compost manure. This is a very affordable and Eco-friendly waste treatment solution. The compost manure collection from our facilities is easy and there's no need for trucks to zigzag on the bad, narrow roads of overpopulated urban areas.
In the capital of Ghana, Accra, 120 trucks of untreated waste is dumped into the Atlantic Ocean every day because of insufficient waste treatment plants for the highly populated city. Instead of creating waste, our toilets provide compost manure as an end product. It is an affordable natural fertilizer to be used by farmers.

<p>Olive oil is an
essential ingredient of the Greek diet and of the Mediterranean countries’
diet. It has high rates of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), especially oleic
acid, and lower rates of saturated fatty acids (SFA). Studies have shown that
the monounsaturated fatty acids have better antiatherosclerotic effects than
the saturated fatty acids and reduce the cardiovascular risk factors and also
reduces the cholesterol. It can be used in a plethora of foods and it is the
best oil to use while cooking. Best chefs propose Greek olive oil for dressing or cooking due to its superior quality!!</p>
<p>Greek olive oil is
the best olive in the world, 75% of the Greek olive oil is extra virgin olive

<h3>Better Sleep!</h3>
<p>I like to think that I'm your average American with a wife and kids. My primary goal with Cradling Sleeper(TM) is simply to bring better sleep to the world. Too many people in America and the world can't afford a high-end mattress (or a mattress at all), and I'd love to help these people out.</p>
<p>Contributions will help me increase production and inventory, and get the good word out of our work to bring better sleep to the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I'm asking for $20,000 and would certainly accept more to propel Cradling Sleeper(TM) into stores across America and internationally. My product is made by Carpenter Company here in the USA, so sales also help our economy.</p>
<p>With your $39.95+ contribution, I'll send you a Cradling Sleeper(TM) to try out yourself! Any extra is certainly appreciated and will accelerate better sleep for the masses! I can't thank you enough for your trust in me to bring my idea to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any start-up, there is significant risk of my product not catching on. I've recently been slotted to sell on Home Shopping Network (HSN), and looking forward to closing that deal in the coming weeks. I am also working to finish the patent for the Back Cradling Sleeper, bringing us to 90+% coverage of all sleepers! Sorry tummy-sleepers, I haven't figured anything out for you (yet). I have invested $15,000 of my own money into this venture, and with 4 kids in college soon, I'm hesitant to extend myself too much more, so I'm asking for help. I'm hopeful that this campaign along with HSN will give us the capitol to increase production enough to begin sales in the big box stores. Thanks again!</p>

R & R focuses more dramatically on the REPAIR

The formulation creates a multi-level and multi-layered approach for relieving pain and lymph movement.
R & R is a unique formulation of therapeutic grade ingredients that are effective & potent.
Utilizes over nine restorative key botanicals.
It works subtly.
R & R is being manufactured in an FDA approved facility, with FDA sourced ingredients and a FDA registration pending.
Each of our ingredients has a well thought out, focused intent that all work in synergistic combination.  In balance and harmony to create deep long lasting repair.  It has a vanishing scent & non-greasy. It's formulated without parabens, petroleum, propylene glycol, fragrances, or harsh chemicals.  It has never been sourced from or tested on animals. It is made in the USA.We didn't add a long list of ingredients just to make an impressive label, each of our ingredients has a specific function that contributes to R & R's spectacular results.   Other products try the kitchen sink method, where they put in every known ingredient that may relieve pain... Ours focuses on the root cause, not just masking the symptoms for a short time.Our formula is extremely complicated, it utilizes more exotic ingredients and costs more than any other product we've found.  That’s why we need your support to fund our first larger production run, so we can bring this relief to millions of people that suffer from pain.STORYWe have created a one-of-a-kind product designed to provide an effective, alternative route for people looking for a different way to treat pain. Our goal is to develop innovative products using our unique topical delivery platform to meet significant unmet needs and improve quality of life. R & R's key ingredients stimulate improved circulation in the micro-capillary system to nerves, muscles, ligaments and tendons, where most pain is felt. Pain relief is the result of prompting the body's self-healing mechanisms – healing from the inside out. We put love into each batch as if we were making it for ourselves or for our family.  It’s about making every day even better and improving peoples’ everyday lives.  We want them to focus on the fun they will be having from the relief vs. their pain. TEAMCo-Owners Paul Amoroso & Karen DeLuca (picture of Paul & Karen)Paul Amoroso has a 25-year history in business ownership and management and is a Licensed Massotherapist in the state of Ohio and has practiced for 23 years.

The 5 Ingredients Your Regular Coffee is Missing”</strong></h3></div><p> </p><p><strong>Do you start your day with a coffee?</strong> Then, you are like most people out there; you enjoy a warm beverage before you go to work. It’s commonplace, but depending on what you drink it could be causing you more issues than you realize.</p><p>I want to talk about 5 ingredients that will help you achieve your weight loss goals, get rid of fatigue, and improve your mood all at once!</p><p>But first, let’s talk about how your regular coffee is ineffective, unhealthy, and damaging to your body. That might sound scary, but let me explain.</p><p>Let’s face it, you get coffee 1 of 3 ways:</p><p>You run into the gas station to get that $1.50 cup of joe,</p><p>Or you visit a big-name store like Starbucks to get a cup of coffee that ranges from 5,7, sometimes 10 dollars,</p><p>Or you buy your coffee at your local Walmart.</p><p><strong>Here’s the problem…</strong> most of it is junk coffee. Even the top range stuff can be a lot worse for you than you think thanks to add the added extras in there that makes it calorific.</p><p>Unless you’re buying the organic kind, which is okay, but we will get to that soon…since most of us do nothing of the sort, let’s look at what ‘normal’ coffee is doing to us.</p><p>You’d be surprised to learn that most coffee contains an abundant amount of chemicals that affect your health and performance. Worse yet, most commercial coffee originates from multiple sources, increasing the risk and exposure to mold toxins, like ochratoxin A or OTA.</p><p>It is well documented that OTA and other mold toxins are present in coffee at alarming percentages—ranging from 52-58%. In fact, depending on the country, percentages can be even higher than that. Brazil for example, can be as high as 91.7%!</p><p><strong>Terrifying, right?</strong></p><p>This even occurs in roasted coffee because the roasting process, while killing the mold, doesn’t destroy OTA. As much as 52% of OTA can survive the roasting process. Now, why is OTA terrible for your health and performance?</p><p>As  far as studies show, <strong>OTA is associated with</strong>:</p><p>Some forms of cancer</p><p>Brain damage</p><p>Hypertension</p><p>Kidney disease</p><p>Immuno-supression</p><p><strong>Most of the coffee you are consuming is junk, rancid, and moldy. </strong>In essence, it is literally doing more harm than good. That buzz in the morning doesn't quite sound so worth it now, huh?</p><p>And the expensive cup of coffee we talked about… yeah, loaded with tons of sugar and empty calories wreaking havoc on your body’s insulin levels. While it might not be full of the same junk as the above, it’s loaded with extra damaging properties.</p><p>That isn’t good. You’ll cause yourself to:</p><p>Overstress your immune system.</p><p>Send your insulin levels on a rollercoaster ride.</p><p>Consume tons of sugar and empty calories.</p><p>Put in ZERO nutritional value into your body.</p><p><strong>Now what about organic coffee?</strong> Well you are doing better with that. Single origin coffee greatly reduces the chances of consuming high amounts of mold toxins, giving you an advantage.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Single origin coffee derives from a single coffee farmer or group of coffee farmers from the same location. They hand-pick and care for your coffee with microscopic detail; affecting taste and coffee integrity. But it’s only offering you one thing… caffeine.</p><p>Caffeine is pretty amazing in and of itself. Studies show caffeine to:</p><p>Increase serotonin levels to better regulate your mood, happiness, and anxiety.</p><p>Improve physical strength and endurance.</p><p>Reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s.</p><p>Cause alertness and help you stay awake beyond your normal point of tiredness.</p><p>Increase metabolism.</p><p><strong>I know what you’re thinking</strong> - “whoa! That’s awesome!” - but imagine the effectiveness and power of your cup of coffee if it had these 5 ingredients, along with caffeine, from a single origin coffee roast.

We have made it possible to digitally track all your pitches without any interruption to your training. We set an ambitious funding goal of 172.500 euro which equals 500 pre-orders of PitchPerfect sets. Out of 65 million baseball players worldwide, this is just a small start to our bigger plans. With a group of 500 user we create more and more insight into real-life data to increasingly grow the value of data for any baseball pitcher that want to take his game to the next level. Based on the pre-orders, production will start in Febuari 2021 and we aim to deliver worldwide by the end of 2nd quarter of 2020 latest. Given the current travel restrictions due to corona, delivery times may greatly vary between continents.",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Health Conscious</h3>
<p>Have you ever wiped your bottom with such abandon that you are no longer able to sit in a chair? Gone are all of your painful problems by swapping out abrasive toilet paper with a soothing stream of water. You can adjust the pressure for those more heavy duty jobs or lighten it if you just need a refresh. Water is also healthier for your sensitive parts as it contains no harsh chemicals or dyes that can be found in paper. Gross. Let me ask you this…if you fell into a mud puddle, would you clean your face with a dry towel? Probably not. Don’t suffer, Cheeky is the cleaner, friendlier option that will make you and your butt much happier</p>

<p><strong>Story and Team</strong></p>
<p>Cheeky's Founder, Alfred, had a vision for a healthy and environmentally friendly way to clean up on-the-go. Unsatisfied with the average hotel (or worse public) bathroom, he had the sense that there were others like him who saw room for improvement. The result was the first prototype for Cheeky.  Using a pump from a half-gallon yard sprayer with a detachable hose, an idea was born. Realizing a pump was a challenge, a battery powered pump was introduced. Several prototypes later, seeing the need and demand for a real, working product, Namalabs and Cheeky were created.</p>
<p>We've teamed up with <strong><a href=""https://www.maverickpdm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Maverick PDM</a></strong> in California to bring a thoughtfully designed, reliable, safe, and healthy product to your bathroom. Their expertise in industrial design and manufacturing has guided us through the prototype and development process.</p>
<p><i>""When we started working on Cheeky we looked at a number of existing products and were consistently disappointed with the lack of pressure and flow rate.  We knew with Cheeky that we wanted to provide pressure and flow rate comparable to what you can normally get from a regular bidet connected to a house's water supply.  We tried numerous pumps and design to get the most power in the smallest housing until we found the ideal motor and power combination.</i></p>
<p><i>Once we had the internal mechanics figured out, we focused on finding the ideal design that would be both portable and practical.  We ended up selecting a silicone bag to hold the water while still being able to pack up efficiently for travel.  For the base, we wanted a stable platform and the ability to adjust the water pressure to best fit the user's needs.  We ended up with a design that blends a highly portable functionality without any sacrifices in capabilities."" </i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>How long can I use this thing?</strong></p>
<p>Cheeky is re-chargeable! On average we've found you can get around 3 hours of battery life depending on use and pressure setting.  Cheeky recharges in minutes so plug it at the end of each use and you should never run out of juice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can I adjust the temperature?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely! Cheeky is intended to be used at your comfort.  Just adjust the heat at whatever water source you're using to fill the silicone bag and spray away.  This is based on your comfort level, so check the heat (or cool) of the water to make sure it is right for you before using.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Where can Cheeky go?</strong></p>
<p>Pretty much anywhere.  Cheeky is intended to be used on-the-go.  Just use the complimentary dry-bag to keep you and your belongings from getting wet and Cheeky becomes your favorite new travel companion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How often does Cheeky need to be cleaned?</strong></p>
<p>With regular use and clean storage, Cheeky should only need to be cleaned once per month.  If stored for long periods of time between travel or use we advise rinsing with warm water and cycling the system before use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do I really use less toilet paper?</strong></p>
<p>That's up to you, but we've found that when you let Cheeky do the heavy-lifting, you'll find yourself doing a whole lot less pat-pat-patting.</p>

<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p><strong>Newborn babies can’t breathe through their mouth.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly! When they have a cold, they struggle to breathe, eat, and sleep. And it’s no fun for you, either! While there are plenty of nasal aspirators on the market, most are gross, ineffective, and challenging to use. </p>
<p>I'm a parent of three kids and a pediatric ENT. I teamed up with doctoral students, researchers, designers, and families to create the NozeBot, a hospital-quality solution for clearing nasal passages that is easy for parents to use at home and on the go.</p>
<p>As you may already know, upper respiratory infections occur frequently in babies, typically 6-10 times per year and can lead to hospitalization. I know firsthand this is a terrifying experience for parents. Nasal aspirators are meant to help, but those currently on the market are prone to biofilm formation, occupy both hands, and exert poor suction force. And what’s worse, they can potentially cause re-infection AND infect the parent. I created the NozeBot to make life a little easier on children and their parents and to reduce the number of hospitalizations due to infections.</p>
<h3><strong>Here's what you need to know about this product:</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The NozeBot is vacuum-powered, safe, hygienic, and hospital-grade</strong>. The NozeBot is BPA-free to ensure the safety of your child and comes with a reusable filter.</li>
<li>
<strong>The one-of-a-kind, patented nosepiece gives you more use of your hands, so you can comfort and stabilize your child.</strong> If you've ever used any kind of nasal aspirator on your infant or toddler before, you've likely wished you had eight hands. We do crazy things to get our children to cooperate.</li>
<li>
<strong>The product comes with a micro-USB charging cable</strong>, so you can power up your NozeBot and take it on the go.</li>
<li>
<strong>It really sucks (in a good way)</strong>.</li>
