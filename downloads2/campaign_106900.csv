<h3>UPDATE: CAMPAIGN EXTENDED</h3>
<p>We’ve been overwhelmed by the generous donations and lovely messages that have come through so far in support of <i>Life, Camera, Awkward</i>. She and the Others have the BEST fan club going around, so thank you from the entire team for getting us this far. <br/>It's been quite the journey to get here, and we didn't think it would be right to end this without a show-stopping send off. So we've decided to extend this fundraising campaign and throw her the retirement party she deserves, giving you and your friends more time to get involved and spread the word!<br/>So put the date in your diary (April 26) and don’t forget to shout about She and the Others on social media to help us hit our target. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550369818/of2aiv7ndxmt0odyjguz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Who the heck are you?</h3>
<p>We are SHE AND THE OTHERS - a brand-new female-driven production company based in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>We are a community of collaborators, inspiring women to gather, connect and unite and celebrate our collective experience through authentic and humorous storytelling.</p>
<p>There has never been a more important time to share our stories and we recognise the important role that screen content plays in challenging and shaping societal norms.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1551006156/l8k3lwntcqxgwkr3vprm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>So why help us?</h3>
<p>The show will be available free to watch for everyone, and we will make it no matter what. But we want it to be GREAT. </p>
<p>There's something special about sharing comedy. Ever helped a friend move house and shouted ""PIVOT, PIVOT!"" as you sweatily drag their crap up three flights of stairs? Or exclaimed ""Bingpot!"" at just the right moment, causing your little brother to unexpectedly spit his mouthful of chips out and half-choke as the dog cleans up the crumbs at his feet? What about singing ""Bye, Bye, Little Sebastian"" on a train carriage full of strangers and everyone gets their phone torch out? No?</p>
<p>We want to make those moments but, more importantly, we want a community that laughs at our moments. It makes us feel connected, reminds us we are <i>not</i> alone and convinces us that, while we may not be perfect, we may just be a bit of alright. </p>
<p>So why help us? Because you can, and if you've gotten this far already, you probably get it. </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550370485/bygqs0ipaqlnlwwjxusc.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>About <i>Life, Camera, Awkward</i>
</h3>
<p>Life, Camera, Awkward is our debut project, a comedy web series that follows Lily and Millie, two best friends who are new-ish to Melbourne and trying their luck in the 'big city'. Lily is determined to ‘make it’ as an actor while Millie would be happy to simply discover her purpose in life. Witty and intelligent, awkward and uncomfortable, neither of our heroines quite fit the mould. </p>
<p>Millie – keen for a challenge – joins Lily at her acting classes, where we meet an impressive but flawed group of women: the effortlessly beautiful Alicia, warm and generous on the outside with a lust for fame brewing beneath the surface; Charlotte, endlessly curating her life via social media; Jess, over-ambitious, over-educated and over being second-best; and Rachel, the fiercely competitive and self-cast outcast. Throw the hyperactive Anita and her subdued side-kick Ana, along with Lily's socially oblivious housemate Mathilde, into the mix and you'll find something hilarious, anxiety-inducing or awkward to relate to. </p>
<p>This bunch of babes will remind you that you are awesome just as you are and that no-one needs Manolo Blahniks to be breathtakingly brilliant. </p>
<p>We are planning to shoot in winter this year (that's Aussie winter to our north-of-the-equator friends) - which is pretty soon! We have incredible people working with us and would love to have a bunch of our episodes available for your viewing pleasure around Christmas.  </p>
<h3>What will <i>Life, Camera, Awkward </i>be like?</h3>
<p>We love shows like Brooklyn 99, Parks and Recreation and The Marvellous Mrs. Maisel. These are shows with incredible women and while they all have great stories driving them it's the characters and their genuine relationships that keep us wanting more. We love these women. </p>
<p>Physical comedy also makes us happy. There have been countless times when we have fallen into a Kristen Wiig or Lucille Ball YouTube vortex for a few hours, unsure of when we will return to the real world. There are so many outstanding, funny women from Saturday Night Live who can make us laugh-cry the same volume of tears as when Dobby.... well.... you know. We're not ready to talk about it. Old British TV like Fawlty Towers and Only Fools and Horses also inspire us with their great physical comedy. We hope to bring an element of that to Life, Camera, Awkward. </p>
<p>In terms of what the show will look like… well, let’s just say we love colour! Our characters and our city are all very alive so expect to see beautiful visuals similar to Russian Doll. Have you not seen Russian Doll? Why are you still here!? Cancel everything and watch it all RIGHT NOW! (Amy Poehler if you're reading this – we love you.) </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550378432/ehviuwzlajbomvjhdvcy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Making amazing content is expensive... like, really expensive. Even without paying a single member of our incredible company, creative team or production crew who have generously signed their lives over to us for the duration of this project without expecting a cent. (What do we mean? Did you not read the 'Surprise Pie' perk??) Which is just one more reason we need your support to make this show sensational. </p>
<p>We would like a budget of well over a million dollars to make the epic show we really want and realise Jamie's dreams of an enormous, outrageous Austin Powers-style dance scene.</p>
<p>But Georgia says this is unrealistic and what we actually need is a total of $20,000 to realistically, make this show work.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks to the support of our fabulous network in Melbourne and the company members' contributions we are already part of the way there. </strong></p>
<p>We are hoping to raise at least $10,000 via Indiegogo. This is where you can help us.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550780656/o7w99ubork6sitl9jrvi.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>She and the Others is a new artistic venture that draws on the skills our company members have individually developed over the past decade. We have spent the last 12 months planning for this project and have two contingency plans should we not reach our funding goal. Or three if you count running away to hide in the jungles of Borneo. But Georgia says that apparently isn't a viable contingency plan. </p>
<p>You can be sure that your donation will help see this project through to fruition but we sure as heck would love to reach that target (Mama wants a dance scene!).<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1550377682/jea7qtidhx9puxpof0tm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>So what's in it for me?</h3>
<p>If you decide to support this project, not only will you be able to say that you helped make <i>Life, Camera, Awkward </i>possible, but you can also get in on our fabulous perks! </p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Our perks start at just $12 for exclusive digital content. You'll be able to follow us right through our production period and see how we 'Do Funny'. </p>
<p>Want something more personal? For $25 or more you'll receive a one-of-a-kind photo from behind the scenes, posted to you via snail mail.</p>

<p><strong>RootsxWings Digital </strong>is the purpose of two Black womxn who dare to re-imagine how Black teen femmes are represented and to create a space where they can be whoever they want. We are foundationally committed to building a brand that centers the experiences of Black teen femmes through digital storytelling and live events. Our goal is to aggregate the influence of the Black teen femme community to usher their ideas, interests, and musings into mainstream culture where they belong.</p>
<p>Believing in the mission God placed in our hearts, we have built RootsxWings from our own pockets for the last 3 years. We have been blessed to receive the consultancy of very accomplished friends for legal, administrative, and creative operations all on the promise of our drive and an “IOU.” </p>
<p>Betting on ourselves in such a precarious time, we are investing 100% of our talent and time into launching RootsxWings. Our inaugural campaign, <strong>“In Black Girls We Trust,”</strong> will kickoff our flagship talk series <strong>RAW Convos</strong>, a platform for Black teen femmes to share their thoughts and interests unapologetically. </p>
<p><strong>With this fundraiser</strong>, we hope to recoup the costs of the pilot episode, fund the production costs of the following 4 episodes, pay our talented design, media, and strategy teams, cover any necessary tech/software needs, and create revenue-generating merchandise to achieve sustainability. </p>
<p>This has been the most rewarding and challenging experience of our 20+ year professional journey. We have questioned how we’d cover costs to meet our goals and execute on projects, only to have the end results turn out greater than we could have imagined. We have gotten accustomed to the fleeting hope of grant applications, while somehow acquiring top talent for the low! We have had inspired conversations with brilliant young femmes from all over the US, Liberia, Nigeria, and Jamaica. We have conducted shoots and interviews in Brooklyn, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles that capture the essence of our target audience. We are developing a dynamic team of Black and brown business leaders and creatives who prioritize mission alignment and professional development. <strong>With your help, we can continue to build this meaningful platform!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>A lot of love, sweat, and creativity goes into producing each episode. While we operate on a lean strategy, proper funding will help us mitigate tech risks, increase production value, acquire key talent, produce quality products, and ultimately enhance our brand impact. </p>
<p>Here’s a breakdown of the overall campaign costs:</p>

<h2><i>THE PROJECT</i></h2>
<h3><i>Synopsis</i></h3>
<p>We all know what it’s like to live in a world of chaos, but very few of us have the ability escape it entirely through our dreams. In the distant future, our protagonist, Saskia, has recently lost her job as a special agent in law enforcement due her declining mental health. Saskia seems not to have anyone in the world who cares for her, she is always isolated in her small apartment while undergoing the mental health program that is meant to ‘fix’ her. But she is one of the lucky ones. </p>
<p>When Saskia sleeps each night, she is taken to the 21st century in her dreams by an advanced AI program embedded in her subconscious, CHI-98. These dreams show her how much freedom there was in the past and allow her to learn more about herself, they have a surrealism that is exciting and she even meets characters that embody people from her past that she has lost, making it an addictive experience. Yet, she is constantly questioning what CHI-98 is, especially when these dreams start filling in the blanks of her amnesia and revealing a sinister conspiracy that was erased from her memory.</p>
<h3><i>Visual Inspiration</i></h3>
<p>Visually, the entire project will have an eerie thunder cloud of unpredictability hanging over it, partly suspense, partly the unknown as the audience can never guess what is around the next corner. Season 1 will have a visual contrast between the dystopian, cyber punk world that Saskia lives in and the soft, welcoming world of her dreams.<i>The Matrix </i>(1999) and <i>Blade Runner 2049 </i>(2017) will be key visual inspirations for the sci-fi city that Saskia lives in. The neon colours and creative framing choices in those films will reflect the style we will emulate to create the intriguing yet isolating apartment that Saskia seems to be trapped in. The Dream World will juxtapose this, instead being bright and inviting, exuding sunshine and warmth while creating a surreal, other-worldly experience for audiences. The cinematography will be often abstract, reflecting the experience of real dreams and creating psychedelic atmosphere. Sometimes colours will be bold and vibrant  - glowing neons, the rich greens of nature, the ambient lights of a cityscape - and other times they will be more subdued, industrial even, as CHI-98 leads Saskia further away from safety. </p>
<h3><i>The Purpose </i></h3>
<p>Saskia's Dream World aims to bring attention to the importance of mental health in a world driven by technology. The series will act as an escape for audiences, while dually commenting on the potential damages of escapism and exploring themes such as grief, oppression, redemption and love. Though, this series isn't entirely grim, it is a high concept sci-fi that will excite audiences as they get to finally see what their dreams look like while they're awake.</p>
<h2><i>THE ARTISTS</i></h2>
<h3>
<i>Creator/Director </i><b><i>-</i></b>
</h3>
<p><b>Isabella Susigan</b> is a film student who is halfway through her degree at the Australian College of the Arts. Isabella has worked on numerous short films and also has experience directing episodic content and documentaries. She is passionate about her work and in particular loves the joy and memories that come out of collaborating on a production. Saskia's Dream World is Isabella's dream project and she is extremely eager to get it out there for everyone to see. She wrote the series during a time of intense isolation for her due to the COVID-19 pandemic and wishes to explore both the delights and downsides of escapism.</p>
<p>Isabella's favourite film is: <i>Chinatown </i>(1974).</p>
<h3>
<i>Assistant Director -</i><strong><i> </i></strong>
</h3>
<p><b>Jasmine Schultz</b> is an actress and photographer with a keen eye for cinematography. She has been interested in film since she can remember, claiming it was the first thing that really left an impact on her life. Having completed acting courses and participated in several productions, Jasmine will be a key collaborator with Isabella to ensure all aspects of the series reach their maximum potential. Her history in photography, passion for cinema and drive to create means she knows exactly what is needed to make a film production run its best.  </p>
<p>Jasmine's favourite film is: <i>Train to Busan </i>(2016).</p>
<h3><i>Camera Department -</i></h3>
<p><b>Zach Kennedy </b>is a documentarian, animator and cinematographer who is passionate about history and politics. His enjoyment of filmmaking and videography dates back to his primary school days when he began making Youtube videos.  Since then, he has worked creatively on travel documentaries, wedding videography, student films and several more successful Youtube videos. This experience provided Zach with a vast knowledge on cinematography theory as well as the nuances of different editing software, leaving him with a great eye for detail. </p>
<p>Zach's favourite film is: <i>Apocalypse Now</i> (1979).</p>
<p><b>Ayden Cook </b>is a film student studying at Swinburne University of Technology. Ayden, like many, began his career in theatre and photography, having these hobbies slowly guide him to a passion for film. He is confident in cinematography and lighting design, having been the DoP for the films <i>The Curtain Calls </i>and <i>Dies Irae</i> and the gaffer for <i>Blocked Up.</i>  Ayden describes himself as a passionate workhorse, willing to throw himself into any role as he has adequate knowledge and experience across vast areas. He also has experience in sound recording and mixing, so will switch between roles in any area he can lend expertise on this production.</p>
<p>Ayden's favourite film is: <i>The Gentleman </i>(2019).</p>
<h3><i>Sound Department - </i></h3>
<p><b>Luna</b> <b>Atkinson-Ladic </b>is music production student at the Australian College of the Arts. She has been interested in music and sound since she was four years old when she demanded a violin from her parents and has been playing since. Luna is excited to work on scoring a film as she believes music is one of the magic elements that can make a production start from words on a page and transform into a realistic, immersive experience. Her classical training, instrumental knowledge and deep understanding of music theory and sound physics will allow her to create an intricate and mesmerising score for the series, but also assist with sound recording, foley and post-production sound.</p>
<p>Luna's favourite film is: <i>The Nightmare Before Christmas</i> (1993).</p>
<h3><i>Art Department -</i></h3>
<p><b>Killian Peter </b>is a film student halfway through their degree at the Australian College of the Arts. Killian has always wanted to tell stories, starting off in writing and working their way up through photography and theatre. It was in their mid teens that Killian realised that they can combine all of those passions into film and they have since continued being involved in productions, creating short films and improving their screenwriting. Killian is particularly talented in the visual areas of  production (set design, props, lighting and costuming) and will be taking on the role of production designer for this series.</p>
<p>Killian's favourite film is: <i>Beetlejuice </i>(1988).</p>
<h2><i>HOW YOUR DONATION HELPS</i></h2>
</div><div>
<p>The budget needed to create this ambitious production is minimal, as all cast and crew are eagerly volunteering their time in exchange for experience and credit. Yet there are still some things that we need to purchase to make this happen. We need to reach our goal budget of $3000 AUD for Season 1 in order to begin shooting this December. So, this is where we need your help - any donation will count toward this $3000 AUD goal that will bring this exciting web series to fruition. </p>
<p><b>$3000 AUD Budget Breakdown -</b></p>
<p><b>- </b>Equipment: Most equipment will be hired out through the various universities that the crew attend but some purchases still need to be made. A high quality gimbal is an imperative purchase as there are many tracking shots and steady camera movements throughout the series. Other purchases include lighting equipment, data storage drives and sound recording equipment.</p>
<p>- Costumes: Saskia will wear a new outfit in each episode, representing the often strange and contrasting differences between our real dreams, but also playing with colour psychology and symbolism that relates to the meaning of the dream. Secondary characters will also be needing costumes. Some of this money will be for purchasing whole garments and accessories, while the rest will be for purchasing materials to sew original designs for the production.</p>
<p>- Props: There are many props throughout the series, from notecards to weaponry and our goal is to ensure that they look as realistic and effective as possible. </p>
<p>- Production Design: Most of our filming locations are free and convenient, but it is the actual decorating and design of these places that will make them memorable. Simple, yet adequately styled objects like a single bed or a desk and chair will allow us to make a seemingly normal space look as though it is from the distant future. </p>
<p>- Transport: We plan to take advantage of the beautiful state that we are located in (Victoria, Australia), which means travelling far and wide for shooting locations. This area of the budget covers costs such as petrol and public transport fees.</p>
<p>- Catering: Volunteering on any project is rewarding, yet often tiring. We will ensure all cast and crew are well fed and hydrated during the entire shoot. </p>
<p>- COVID-19 Safe: This production is dedicated to adhering to the COVID-19 safety measures and practices put fourth by Work Safe Australia. Therefore, a portion of the budget will be delegated to purchasing hand sanitiser, face masks and other imperative health related items. </p>
<h2><i>THE REWARD</i></h2>
</div><div>
<p>We have plenty of perks to choose from, from heartfelt thank you messages to exclusive behind the scenes footage! But it also should be included how rewarding your donation will be to the Australian film industry, this project: </p>
<p>- Furthers the <b>diverse</b> <b>representation </b>of artists in Australia's film industry. We have several members of the LGBTQ+ community involved in this production, as well as a vast range of people from different socio-economic circumstances and cultural backgrounds.</p>
<p>- Will be <b>free to watch</b> through online distribution via Youtube. We want this web series to be accessible at a high quality for anyone with an internet connection.</p>
<p>- Explores and <b>addresses important issues</b> within our society that aren't often touched on in Australian film &amp; television. </p>
<p>- Supports <b>independent artists</b> who are trying to rebuild the Australian film industry in the post-COVID-19 era.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We created the concept of Eat Austin Eat because we were faced with that daily question, ""Where do ya'll want to eat?""  And in Austin, Texas that's an especially hard question to answer because there are so many amazing places from which to choose.  Since we come from a TV background we didn't just want to tell you about them ... we wanted to show you. </p>

<p>Don’t you hate all the negativity on TV today? Doesn’t it seem like every show about weight loss, transformation, and healthy lifestyle is more set on shaming people than lifting them up? Wouldn’t it be great to see a show that was all about the positive journey and the little changes that you can make that will help you not just survive, but THRIVE!? A show that would make you laugh, and inspire you to be the best you, you can be? I want that too.</p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Sandi Masori and I wear a lot of hats. I’m a mom, a full-time balloon artist, a best-selling author, a book strategist (that is I help other people write/ publish books), a TV personality, and a fluffy serial dieter. A couple of years ago, in the process of trying to heal from my divorce, I got a crazy idea: I wanted to produce a TV show about transformation where the focus was on the journey, not the end result.  As John Lennon says, “Life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans”.</p>
<p>I noticed that all the weight loss shows out there are really about shaming people and making you feel bad. I didn’t want to do that. I wanted to do something light-hearted and uplifting. A show that would leave people with a smile on their face, and the desire to get out and do something.</p>
<p>Around the same time, I accidentally met with a big reality tv show producer and told him about my idea for a show. He loved the idea, but said that since I was an unknown, no one would back a show like that, because they didn’t know if I could carry the show as the talent. But, he said, since I already had a Youtube channel, I should go out and make my show, get 1,000,000 views on each episode, and then come back to him as that would be something that a network would find interesting.</p>
<p>Challenge Accepted! Said I!</p>
<p>So I got some friends to help, hired some other people, and we started shooting videos. Whenever I had a little extra money, I would put it into doing something for the show. For the past 2 years, I’ve been going out of pocket, robbing Peter to pay Paul, so I could keep moving forward with my dream. Basically I jumped in head first with no idea of what I was doing, or what it would take.</p>
<p>So that pretty much brings us to today…</p>
<p>Right now, I have 20 of the first 30 episodes taped, and nothing edited. Editing is expensive and time consuming. It’s not just editing that I need, it’s also production. Who knew that there was so much to know and plan to make a TV show?? I need help, professional help. So, that’s why I’m here.</p>
<p>The money you contribute will go to production costs for the last few episodes, post- production costs to get everything edited, and marketing to get the eyeballs.</p>
<p>I have a few dreams for this show- to get it to TV and to put some quality feel-good broadcasting out there that will lift people up, and help them get out of their own way. The message that I want to get across is “you’re perfect the way you are, but if you’re not happy, or in a rut, try something new, because along the way, when you’re moving out of your comfort zone, life happens!”</p>
<p>This show is everything to me. There is so much junk tv out there, and every time you turn on the news, it’s all bad things. I want to show that life is good, and that there’s no reason not to enjoy yourself while on the way to a healthy lifestyle.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t donate money, you can still help support the cause. Share this fundraiser, when the show debuts on September 18th on the Sandiballoon Youtube channel, watch it, share it, like it and comment on it. There will be a new episode out every Tuesday after that.</p>
<p>And if you can donate money, a little or a lot, I really appreciate it, and your faith in me and my ability to make this come to life. From the bottom of my heart to the tip of my soul, I thank you for helping me make my dream a reality.</p>

<h3>EXT. STORY - PITCH</h3>
<p>Over the past year I developed a  comedy series ""Appropriate Culture"". My goal for the show was to create a platform that brought artists/personalities together behind and in front of the camera. Having a background in TV/film production I've witnessed first hand the lack of creative control we hold when it comes to telling OUR stories.</p>
<p>We produced  first season (5 episodes in total) without a budget which was a testament that it can be done independently through the proper execution.</p>

</div><div>
<p>Our goal is to raise 5,000 USD. Your contributions would cover production costs, promotional services, marketing tools, merch, event spaces,  equipment rentals, locations etc.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges that we've found with producing independent content is the lack of resources/funds. Your contribution would give us leverage in maintaining our independent creative freedom, the ability to build a solid production team and build opportunities for freelance creatives.</p>

<h3>Concept</h3>
<p>Sitting Ducks follows the adventures of five young friends as they attempt to solve a mystery that has been haunting the local area for decades.<br/>Suddenly thrust into a strange world of danger and intrigue, the group must use every resource they have to get to the bottom of a series of shady occurrences within their town before they too become victims of the town’s dark past.<br/>With time against them and terrible forces working unseen to undo their every action, do they have what it takes, or will they too lose themselves in the underworld the town thought was buried all those years ago?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Purpose for Funding</h3>
<p>Funding for Sitting Ducks will go towards many areas, with the aim of the production being of the highest quality and professional standard:</p>
<ul>
<li>To finance camera lens and equipment hire.</li>
<li>To provide professional lighting for outdoor and indoor sets.</li>
<li>To ensure a high level of audio and visual production quality.</li>
<li>To provide catering for cast and crew during long days on set.</li>
<li>To cover transport and logistics costs.</li>
<li>To cover the cost of promotional material.</li>
<li>To provide adequate resources for professional level props, costume and set design.</li>
<li>To cover film festival entry costs.</li>
<li>To ensure high quality colour grading across the entire production. </li>
</ul>
<p>The more funds we have, the better the production quality. We are aiming to spend approximately $2000-$3000 per episode (four episodes in total. If we raise more, we will have a higher budget for each episode).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<p>-  To support and build the local acting and creative community in regional Victoria.</p>
<p>-  To promote the region as both an artistic hub and emphasise the value of its unique environment.</p>
<p>- To create a free web series that is available for all.</p>
<p>- To pitch the series to companies such as Stan, Netflix and local Australian free to air television stations such as SBS or ABC.</p>
<p>- To create a professional, high quality production on a low budget that is something we can all be proud of, including the local community and those involved outside of the core team. </p>
<p>- Give experience for those who are passionate about film and television and looking to enter the industry, and to expand the breadth of their previous experience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Cast</h3>
<p>We have a ridiculously talented young cast who are extremely excited to showcase their craft and bring the world of Sitting Ducks to life. </p>

</div></div>","Concept
Sitting Ducks follows the adventures of five young friends as they attempt to solve a mystery that has been haunting the local area for decades.Suddenly thrust into a strange world of danger and intrigue, the group must use every resource they have to get to the bottom of a series of shady occurrences within their town before they too become victims of the town’s dark past.With time against them and terrible forces working unseen to undo their every action, do they have what it takes, or will they too lose themselves in the underworld the town thought was buried all those years ago?

Purpose for Funding
Funding for Sitting Ducks will go towards many areas, with the aim of the production being of the highest quality and professional standard:

To finance camera lens and equipment hire.
To provide professional lighting for outdoor and indoor sets.
To ensure a high level of audio and visual production quality.
To provide catering for cast and crew during long days on set.
To cover transport and logistics costs.
To cover the cost of promotional material.
To provide adequate resources for professional level props, costume and set design.
To cover film festival entry costs.
To ensure high quality colour grading across the entire production. 

The more funds we have, the better the production quality. We are aiming to spend approximately $2000-$3000 per episode (four episodes in total. If we raise more, we will have a higher budget for each episode).

Our Goals
-  To support and build the local acting and creative community in regional Victoria.
-  To promote the region as both an artistic hub and emphasise the value of its unique environment.
- To create a free web series that is available for all.
- To pitch the series to companies such as Stan, Netflix and local Australian free to air television stations such as SBS or ABC.
- To create a professional, high quality production on a low budget that is something we can all be proud of, including the local community and those involved outside of the core team. 
- Give experience for those who are passionate about film and television and looking to enter the industry, and to expand the breadth of their previous experience.

Cast
We have a ridiculously talented young cast who are extremely excited to showcase their craft and bring the world of Sitting Ducks to life.

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Hey everyone! Elizabeth and Frankie here. We'd like to personally thank you for taking the time to learn more about <strong>#CANCELLED</strong>, our latest artistic endeavor. </p>
<p>We are honored to announce that we've adapted <strong>#CANCELLED</strong>, our hit theatrical production, into a television pilot! The theatrical performance proved to be a major success at the 2019 Hollywood Fringe Festival. The run of the show was nearly sold out, and the production even won an Encore Award! </p>
<p><strong>#CANCELLED</strong> is a new pilot where a comeback-seeking-ex-child-star, her mega-millionaire mogul manager, and their social-media-scheming assistant become the stars of a murderous scandal of their own. Nearly thirty years old and still living at home, former teen icon Ashley Idaho is desperate to re-invent herself in the music industry. With the help of a couple of strangers, she seizes the chance to reclaim her pop princess crown. This gut-curling comedy is sure to keep you laughing, and also simultaneously question how our obsession with social media affects our relationships, our perception of others, and our perceptions of ourselves. Featuring original pop and rap tunes, fresh talent, and unfiltered fun, <strong>#CANCELLED</strong> is a murderously entertaining, killer new pilot.</p>
<p>We plan to pitch the finished pilot to film festivals, production companies, and potential investors to develop <strong>#CANCELLED</strong> into a full-length television series. We are seeking funding to produce creative material of superior quality; with your financial support, we will be one step closer to fulfilling this vision.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Your donations towards our project will help us pay for the cost of production insurance, equipment and location rentals, and compensation for our talented cast and crew members to bring <strong>#CANCELLED</strong> to life.</p>
<p><strong>We are seeking $4,000 to fund the following expenses:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Equipment Rentals-</strong> We are seeking donations to rent state-of-the-art filming equipment to produce a top-quality production. We will submit the finished pilot to film festivals and production companies to develop <strong>#CANCELLED</strong> into a full-length television series. Proper camera equipment is key for producing a top quality pilot for the silver screen-- or just to binge on your laptop.</p>
<p><strong>Location Rentals-</strong> Proper locations help us build the world of <strong>#CANCELLED</strong> to life! We are renting <strong>4</strong> locations to make our pilot.</p>
<p><strong>Production Insurance-</strong> Operating a professional, safe set for our actors and crew is of utmost importance to us, and we will run a set that adheres to top industry standards . We are creating our pilot under a SAG New Media Agreement, where all of our actors will be protected by union stipulations and an insured set.</p>
<p><strong>Talent Payments-</strong> Above all, we are so thrilled that producing <strong>#CANCELLED</strong> allows us to hire our talented friends and colleagues as actors, crew members, and producers. While our SAG New Media Agreement is one of deferred talent payment for our cast, it is important to us to pay our entire cast and crew in a timely fashion for their time and talent.</p>
<p><strong>Festival Submission Fees-</strong> Upon completion of post-production, we will submit <strong>#CANCELLED</strong> to top film festivals and production companies with the intention of developing <strong>#CANCELLED</strong> into a full-length television series. Your donations will help to cover festival submission fees across the world!</p>
<h3><strong>What You’ll Get </strong></h3>

<p><strong>Get #CANCELLED with us- </strong>All of the above, and you'll be credited as a Producer of <strong>#CANCELLED.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>When we first started to write <strong>#CANCELLED,</strong> our main prerogative was to highlight the effect of the digital age on our poor little lives. These days, we live in a world attached to a screen that filters only the latest and greatest of the mundane everyday. Our digital reality in 2020 consists of 8 year-olds sacrificing their childhood for levels of unimaginable YouTube fame, workout gurus starving themselves behind the scenes, and influencers actually convincing us that they got their clear skin from Proactiv. The conclusion? Life online is not what it appears to be. <strong>#CANCELLED </strong>tells a story about women in the music industry, and how their lives and relationships are affected by their viral online presences. Now more than ever, we’re all just one click away from being permanently <strong>#CANCELLED</strong>.</p>

<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help/ Get #CANCELLED with us!</strong></h3>
<p>We get it! Funds can be tight. Sharing this post to socials (ironic, we know) and with your friends is just as appreciated. Follow us on Instagram <strong>@cancelledthepilot !</strong></p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Alice, Danielle, and Kory are in their sophomore year at Douglass University. Having become close friends over the course of their freshman year they’ve formed a tight bond. As it goes with a lot of college students you tend to find lifelong friends as you set out into your first steps of adulthood away from home. Up until this point, the trio has shared a common interest in art, music, and academics which hasn’t left a lot of room for the other side of college, nightlife. This all changes as they set out to have more fun this year. </p>
<p>Being that Douglass University is a predominately white institution or PWI, the black community is small. That means everyone knows everybody as groups begin to form and kickbacks become large social gatherings. Outside of the frat parties, smoke outs, and game nights that make up the black nightlife experience our group also explores the other night experiences the University has to offer. </p>
<p>As Alice, Danielle, and Kory have their first meaningful encounters with sex, drugs, and alcohol, they are left to wonder about their place in all of the chaos. How do they fit in? What are society's norms? What does it mean to have fun in these types of environments?  These are questions best answered with experience. Experiences that lie ahead of them.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Kickback Chronicles is an online streaming series. ​Created by young filmmakers of color, those with disabilities, and women; each episode runs approximately 8-12 minutes. Kickback Chronicles provides an unfiltered look into the social fabrics that define the collegiate nightlife. Through entertainment and style, we aim to start the conversations that needs to be had.<br/>It is often said that comedy is a great way to deal with difficult topics. While Kickback Chronicles is a drama at heart, humorous moments will serve as a vehicle to provide social commentary on today’s young adult's experiences. Drawing inspiration from the likes of Justin Simien, Kenya Barris, Stefani Robinson, and Issa Rae. Kickback Chronicles will also serve as an innovative way to tell the diverse stories of black collegians.</p>
<p>Each episode will have at least one central theme that we believe is relevant to today, especially on the black college scene. Many of the themes that'll be tackled are the over-sexualization of black women’s bodies, masculinity’s role in the sexuality of black men, and police relations, abuse of drugs, and more. With the story taking place during college, we intend to highlight real experiences that may have not been seen on screen in it's rawness. These experiences are black communities at white institutions, fraternity parties, race relations on campus, college nightlife in the Midwest, and much more.</p>
<p>Filmed on location in Springfield &amp; Kansas City, MO, we hope to highlight the Midwest life onscreen. While other shows have shown the ins and outs of nightlife and black culture on the coasts, very few deal with the unique perspective of the country’s central population. With the Mid-west comes artistry. This form of expression will provide a backdrop to the experiences of our characters. Kickback Chronicles will be an immersive online experience where every character, story-line, and scene will remain authentic to what life is like in today’s kickback culture.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It's short and sweet: we got a bunch of amazing actors to help us out while I continue my journey of being a real animator, and not a bump on a log calling myself outrageous nonsense like ""Director"" and ""Executive Producer"". That's right: Keith is actually teaching me how to be useful, and our new show is going to be the centerpiece of that education!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need about $1000 per episode this time around. But Episode 1 is here as proof-of-concept! This will cover the (currently) nominal salaries of the voice actors, and the acquisition of art assets from my good artist friend, Handerson Soares (we call him ""Oshigan"" around the Studio). I'm doing quite a bit of the assets myself, and I have a background artist queued up on DeviantArt who will assist us further. It's a solid team, but I do not intend to pay myself directly. I hope to get YouTube and Patreon to handle that part when we finally acquire ""Partner Status"".</p>
<p>Actors include Carey Means (Frylock of ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force""), Sammi Bold, Loran Bolding, Kaylie Horsley, Joelle Aliana Ferguson, Jenna Sharpe, Julie Shields, Keith Wood, and a bevy of guest stars, like my good friend Clare Halstead, Lec Zorn, Shelby Iacometti and many, many more. All of them incredibly skilled actors who are ready to get to work bringing this to life.</p>
<p>In addition to the acting team and acquiring assets for this episode, I'm hoping to be able to get a slightly upgraded Mac Mini for production purposes. My old 2011 beast is giving up and running three OS's behind!</p>
<p>Since this is a smaller campaign, contributors will get some fun stuff: shoutouts from our live podcast, mentions in the credits, downloadable PDFs of the scripts and more! Large contributors will receive an ""Associate Producer"" credit.</p>
<p>No matter how much we get, it will go into production, and you'll still get your perks*, But this time around, we have a couple physical perks in the form of posters autographed by me and Keith Wood! (Censorship not included on final product ;) )</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As before,I want to learn new skills, but hate the antiseptic environment of a classroom. So Keith is teaching me the needed programs on-the-fly. We already have the first episode completed, and Oshi is creating all new models for some of the characters. But again, 80-90% of this is me. And for YEARS, I've lacked the confidence to do this all on my own. I always felt like an impostor with my art. This is my therapy. And, if I succeed, I can help with production of the vastly more polished and expensive ""Starship Moonhawk"" series so we may actually release more than an episode fragment each year. Seriously, everyone wins here.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk is simply that I won't have the time or finances to make a 6-10 minute episode every month because I'm scrambling to pay for all of it, and somehow maintain our household on Uber and Lyft and the occasional commissions alone. That would be tragic, because did I mention we are working with CAREY MEANS OF AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE? I shoulda led with that...</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.</p>
<p>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>And that's all there is to it.</p>

That would be tragic, because did I mention we are working with CAREY MEANS OF AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE? I shoulda led with that...

<p><strong>Mariah Nonemacher</strong></p>
<p>Mariah Nonnemacher a graduate with a Masters from the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama.

And<strong> La Visita</strong>, a short film LGBTQ thriller shot in Italy about life after coming out, and the trauma one endors even after accepting themselves.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Goal?</h2>
<p>In order to get this series made, we would love your help in raising £11,150. This will cover the pre-production and production of the first series (3 Episodes) of Thick as Thieves. You can see below how this will be spent:</p>

<p>It would be fantastic to reach our goal however if we don’t quite make it any money we raise will first and foremost go towards paying our crew. As filmmakers we believe in paying crew members for their time, feeding our cast and crew and as well as paying for locations. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The impact you can help us make</h3>
<p>As Women of Colour our representation both in front and behind the camera is our passion. This is why Thick as Thieves was developed. We wanted to showcase a story with WOC in the drivers seat with mutli-dimensional characters that are relatable. The industry is slowly changing with how it represents WOC and we are contributing to that.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>With filming there are always risks and challenges. From actors falling sick to the English weather not cooperating, however we have made sure to take in as many factors as possible, when scheduling the film shoot. As a collective we have a wide range of production experience on multiple sets and have had to deal with cancellations of locations, clashes of personalities and unforeseen events on set.  We have overcome them and we are confident we can do the same with the web series- filming it on time and on budget.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other ways you can help</h3>

<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<p>First, I would like to thank you for visiting this site and for considering making a donation.</p>
<p>The Age of Maturity is a web series that was written to shed light on some of the issues that young adults face as we go out into the world and try to make it on our own. I feel that it is important to share these types of stories to let this group of people know that they are not alone. We all have issues dealing with family, relationships, education and finding the right career. I believe this series can be both inspirational and entertaining.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to have quite a few aspiring filmmakers come on board to help bring this vision to life. Now I ask that you help continue the process. A donation of any size would be helpful and all the proceeds would go into the production. The money would be used to post-production (video editing, color correction, sound design, graphic design, etc.) of the first season and pre-production (location scouting, makeup and wardrobe, etc.) for the second season.</p>
<p>If do not have the means to donate, you can also help us out by promoting our campaign to friends and family. We would greatly appreciate anything you can do for us.</p>

<p>We began production on the show in September 2017. Since then, we've shot two and half episodes, plus the awesome promo video you see here. How did we make this happen? We pulled together our resources to assemble a filmmaking team comprised of industry professionals who have years of experience and who just love the project. It's really become a family atmosphere amongst cast and crew (we literally recruited family members). </p>

<h2><strong>FAQ's</strong></h2>
<p><strong><i>What are you raising the money for specifically? </i></strong>The money raised will be used to shoot the Pilot episode. Among the many expenses comes the cost of locations, locations, locations! The Pilot episode has six different locations. </p>
<p><strong><i>Why does the pilot have so many locations? </i></strong>To effectively tell Adriana's story, we have to start from the beginning. That includes sharing her story as a med student and establishing all the locations that will be recurring throughout the series. These locations are essential to the story and believe us when we say, there's a reason why Michelle chose the locations she did. Every location has a purpose and tells a story within this much bigger story.</p>
<p><strong><i>So how many episodes exactly will you be filming?</i></strong> We plan to use money raised to shoot the Pilot episode as well as finish the last two scenes of an episode we began production on. If we exceed our goal, we will re-evaluate our budget so that we can shoot the second episode as well. We just really like making stuff!</p>
<p><strong><i>How many episodes will air in the first season? </i></strong>The first season will be comprised of 10 episodes.Three episodes will be released beginning February 2018. We also have a Halloween Special that was released as a pre-promo to the promo (seriously). You can watch below!</p>
<p><i><strong>Where and when can I watch the show?</strong></i> Kickstarter Backers will have  the opportunity to attend a live screening of the first three episodes. The pilot episode will be available to watch on YouTube and on our website,  <a href=""http://www.hirededucationwebseries.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.hirededucationwebseries.com</a> in February 2018. </p>
<p><strong><i>How long is each episode? </i></strong>Each episode is approximately 8-10 minutes in length. Shorter in the case of ""promo"" and ""specials"" episodes, which are about 4-6 minutes in length.</p>
<p><strong><i>What is your long term plan for the show?</i></strong> Our goal is to continue producing the show for as long as the audience enjoys watching it and the actors love acting in it. It's such a fun dynamic on set and Michelle gets (overly) excited writing every single episode and is constantly developing more episodes on paper every day... in fact, she's probably writing one now as you're reading this. And yes, we would love the series to ""take off"" and be distributed on a larger platform but we cannot promise anything. We CAN be optimistic though. We're good at that! </p>
<p><strong><i>What if you don't meet your funding goal? How do you plan to use the money raised?  </i></strong>Firstly, the money raised will go towards locations. That is our biggest expense and without funding for locations, we will be unable to shoot the pilot episode. At that point, we'll have to re-evaluate our budget and most likely run a second campaign round. And as always, we'll continue to develop new story ideas, particularly for short sketches and mini-episodes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Each individual working on this production was hand-picked because of their talent, merit and work ethic. We've got a great cast and crew, all fueled with passion that's driving this project. We constantly do our homework, plan, and put our best foot forward every day in hopes of making the best thing possible given the resources we have available.</p>
<p>However, all productions face unforeseen obstacles. The more funding we have, the higher quality, more controlled locations we can secure. We can also finish episodes in a more timely manner with a larger post production team. Ultimately, having the proper budget makes the entire process smoother, and the result is a great final product.</p>
<p>We'll communicate to our Backers any updates we have on the filming process, let you know if we're meeting our shooting schedule, what we plan next, make sure you receive your perk(s) by the estimated delivery date, etc. We're always happy to answer any questions you may have about the campaign or show in general. We want to keep our Backers in the loop because our Backers are as much part of the filmmaking process as we are!</p>

<p>WE NEED YOUR HELP raising $22,300 to finish a proof of concept trailer, which will begin principal photography on March 20, 2018. Your contributions will make this happen!</p>
<p>So, what's the show about?</p>
<p><strong>Story Synopsis. </strong>Not much is known about the women of the Old West, not because they weren't prominent, but because their courage, strength, and contributions were largely left out of the history books. Our series is going to change that! You're not only supporting when you <i>buy a perk</i>, but you are contributing to history!   </p>
<p>BADLAND WIVES is not a documentary; it's but a full-fledged, all hands on deck episodic drama; an original, and some are saying ""daring"", program akin to a <i>Desperate Housewives </i>in the Old West. Don't get us wrong, we've done our homework—all of the sets, backgrounds, wardrobe, guns, rifles, ages and character personalities are historical, fit the time period, and match those persons portrayed in the series during a time when ""let's noodlehang 'em"" was more prevalent than ""let's give them a fair trial."" But the women in this town have had enough! They're speaking out and acting out! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509766708/cxfsij3fi2sp4bn2hcz5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><b> </b>The planned series is a female-driven, 1-hr dark drama and contemporary Western set in an Old West town that is ran by sometimes sensible, other times incensed, women. They've got probable cause for their lasso madness... the town is run by a bunch of gold-laudering corrupt businessmen who no longer doff their cowboy hats at passerby women. Didn't wives make a lot of the decisions behind their husbands and what they did back in this era? We're just refocusing the lens and bringing the women upfront and personal. While still ineligible to cast ballots in this venomous town, these wives choose to vote with their guns... and they know how to aim better than the men; they had to shoot fowl and pheasant to feed families!</p>

<p>ABOUT THE WOMEN.</p>
<p>We're sure you want a peek at our main characters. The 5-big personality femme fatale wives living with their outlaw husbands in the Badlands,<i> include:</i></p>
<p><strong>- Zerelda ""Zee"" James </strong>(wife of outlaw Jesse James) —girl gang leader, confident, action-oriented, sensible, street smarts </p>
<p><strong>- Paulita Maxwell</strong> (girlfriend of Billy the Kid) —anxious, hormonal, agile-fighter, precocious &amp; pretentious, book smarts</p>
<p><strong>- Belle Starr </strong>(wife of Cole Younger) —reliable, respect-demanding, feminist, confrontational, starts fights and finishes them</p>
<p><strong>- Marthy ""Calamity"" Jane</strong> (mistress of Wild Bill Hickok) —bi-curious, manly, tenacious, quick to anger, vocal, sharp-shooter, tracker</p>
<p><strong>- Jenny Hardin</strong> (wife to the meanest outlaw, John Wesley Hardin) —sweet as apple pie, honest, clueless but extremely lovable</p>
<p>THESE OUTLAW WIVES refuse to be imprisoned by the shackles of their society. They're women who throw off the chains, pick up the guns, ride the horses, and occupy center stage in a town rifled with danger and intrigue.</p>

WE NEED YOUR HELP raising $22,300 to finish a proof of concept trailer, which will begin principal photography on March 20, 2018. Your contributions will make this happen!
So, what's the show about?
Story Synopsis. Not much is known about the women of the Old West, not because they weren't prominent, but because their courage, strength, and contributions were largely left out of the history books. Our series is going to change that! You're not only supporting when you buy a perk, but you are contributing to history!   
BADLAND WIVES is not a documentary; it's but a full-fledged, all hands on deck episodic drama; an original, and some are saying ""daring"", program akin to a Desperate Housewives in the Old West. Don't get us wrong, we've done our homework—all of the sets, backgrounds, wardrobe, guns, rifles, ages and character personalities are historical, fit the time period, and match those persons portrayed in the series during a time when ""let's noodlehang 'em"" was more prevalent than ""let's give them a fair trial."" But the women in this town have had enough! They're speaking out and acting out! 

 The planned series is a female-driven, 1-hr dark drama and contemporary Western set in an Old West town that is ran by sometimes sensible, other times incensed, women. They've got probable cause for their lasso madness... the town is run by a bunch of gold-laudering corrupt businessmen who no longer doff their cowboy hats at passerby women. Didn't wives make a lot of the decisions behind their husbands and what they did back in this era? We're just refocusing the lens and bringing the women upfront and personal. While still ineligible to cast ballots in this venomous town, these wives choose to vote with their guns... and they know how to aim better than the men; they had to shoot fowl and pheasant to feed families!
_____________________________________________________

ABOUT THE WOMEN.
We're sure you want a peek at our main characters. The 5-big personality femme fatale wives living with their outlaw husbands in the Badlands, include:
- Zerelda ""Zee"" James (wife of outlaw Jesse James) —girl gang leader, confident, action-oriented, sensible, street smarts 
- Paulita Maxwell (girlfriend of Billy the Kid) —anxious, hormonal, agile-fighter, precocious & pretentious, book smarts
- Belle Starr (wife of Cole Younger) —reliable, respect-demanding, feminist, confrontational, starts fights and finishes them
- Marthy ""Calamity"" Jane (mistress of Wild Bill Hickok) —bi-curious, manly, tenacious, quick to anger, vocal, sharp-shooter, tracker
- Jenny Hardin (wife to the meanest outlaw, John Wesley Hardin) —sweet as apple pie, honest, clueless but extremely lovable
THESE OUTLAW WIVES refuse to be imprisoned by the shackles of their society. They're women who throw off the chains, pick up the guns, ride the horses, and occupy center stage in a town rifled with danger and intrigue.

These women were either insane to be married to these outlaws, or they were badass, and YOU ALREADY KNOW what we went with--the Badass version.
_______________________________________________________________
What We're OFFERING—The Perks. We've worked hard on putting together and providing you some awesome perks, prizes and rewards. For pledges ranging from $55-$250.00 we're offering custom screen-printed Badland Wives T-shirts, signed advance copy of the pilot episode, ""Pardon My Bullet."" For more serious backers, we're saving back some of the costume wardrobe to be worn by the Cast, and awarding others a rare opportunity to have their face and likeness planted on WANTED bill posters in an actual scene. One lucky pledger will be flown to L.A. with hotel accommodations and be a Supporting Actor in a scene on the actual set. Wow! All because of one thing:
We'd really like you to become part of the Badland Wives family!
Take a look—


We've taken the best scenes from our completed pilot script, ""Pardon My Bullet,"" and written a kickass Trailer that our onboard Sales & Packaging firm will be shopping the entertainment Industry with; places like HBO, AMC, USA, TNT, Amazon and History Channel.
How You Can Join Our Growing Team: We not only have a badass lineup of characters, but a kickass team of filmmakers, including: Director of Photography Collier Landry, Sound Supervisor Jussi Tegelman (Batman vs Superman, Great & Powerful Oz, Spiderman II & III, Hurt Locker, Poltergeist) and the visual effects team of BFX ImageWorks, Steve and Benni Blasini in Los Angeles.  
Now we need you to JOIN OUR TEAM and help us raise the remainder of funds behind what has been 3 yrs of commitment and mountains of pre-production work.

<h3>More Than Just a Fan Series</h3>
<p><i>Ghostbusters</i> has touched us all. It's one of the most beloved film franchises of all time.  For many years the fans have been starved for a continuation of the original movies in film form, we seek to rectify that problem. Not only that, we want to make something for the fans, by fans, where our audience can contribute to what they would like to see this world to go.</p>
<p>First, a little bit about myself:</p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Christopher J. Tomlinson and I have had over a decade of experience in the film and television broadcast industry.  I have been on countless professional sets, and have had the privilege of writing and/or directing 7 distributed feature length films.  In the midst of all that I have always maintained one foot in the realm of independent filmmaking, where instead of having to wade through countless meetings, bureaucracy, and creative stifling- artists are allowed to examine storytelling in ways they truly want.  I hope to bring all the awesome power a financed studio could bring to the raw talent and passion an indie set has to wield in further episodes of Ghostbusters: Station 6.</li>
<li>Ghostbusters has been in my life as long as I can remember.  One of the first times I ever sat down to write a script I wrote a Ghostbusters one.  I grabbed my dad's VHS camcorder, and trusty Kenner backpack- and any willing souls in my neighborhood.  I was in 7th grade, it was lame- and you will NEVER see it.  My 3rd, 5th, 12th, 18th, 25th, and 30th birthday cakes donned the GB logo- and I plan to see that on my cake many more times.  </li>
<li>This project is my dream project. Almost every Ghostbusters fan thinks, ""man, if only they did this or that with the story,"" but they don't have the resources. We have the ability to create our own stories within the universe and we can help you bring other stories into the universe. We have our plan for how this show will play out - and some of your ideas might even already be incorporated into our plans - but there is room for additional story elements, even scene ideas or Ghostbuster moments you've always wanted to see. For instance, you might think, ""What would happen if some criminal stole a proton pack? How much damage would that cause? What are the insurance ramifications of such things?"" Those are good questions and similar ideas could be submitted to us and might be incorporated into the show!</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you share the same love and the same vision for <i>Ghostbusters</i> that we do. The bottom line is, we want to make something that all of us can enjoy as fans. Now, let's get a little more specific.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Why not use our own money?! Well, we did. It's all in the first episode. We also called in every favor we could from industry professionals to give it as much production value as possible.  We left it ""all on the field"" so to speak.  This of course, is not sustainable for any extended period of time.</p>
<p>The good news is, we can now involve the audience! We know you love <i>Ghostbusters</i> just as much as we do, so we value your contribution. Not only monetarily, but also your feedback. An unsuccessful crowdfunding campaign is pretty indicative that our show did not sit well with the general audience, and saves us the time and embarrassment of playing where we're not wanted.</p>
<p>However, if <i>Ghostbusters: Station 6</i> strikes a chord with fans like we think it will, your ideas and feedback might make it directly into the show! Remember, this is by the fans and for the fans. With the money and resources from this campaign, we'll be able to solicit ideas from hardcore fans, such as yourselves, to make the series appeal to a wider range of Ghostbusters fans (and hopefully beyond). Obviously, from a practicality standpoint, we would not be able to include every idea submitted to us, but we will consider all of them and if we take your idea, we'll include your name in the credits!</p>
<ul>
<li>We're looking to raise $20,000 for episode 2 ONLY. We can only take this on an episode by episode basis for now, but any excess funding is not excess! We will put that money towards future episodes. The larger the contributions, the more efficient we will be in getting you more episodes!</li>
<li>It's important to note that because this is a fan project, <strong>nobody is legally allowed to profit</strong> on this venture. Therefore, all the money donated will end up directly on the screen.</li>
<li>For your contribution, you get some amazing perks in return. All the usual stuff is there - , copies of the finished product, autographs, screen credits, and on set visits... But we also offer stuff unique to this campaign, including customized Ghostbusters uniforms, screen-used props from the show, and for a lucky few... YOUR VERY OWN PROTON SCREEN USED PACK!</li>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The original pilot episode took 2.5 years of pre-production and nearly a year of post production.  This is not only because our entire cast and crew has day jobs in the industry, it is also because our ""budget"" was only for the construction of equipment, costumes, and food for the filming days.  There was absolutely no wiggle room.</p>
<ul>
<li>Luckily, most of pre-production was because we were hand building our equipment and costumes- good news!  They're already built!  That takes care of pre-production, although the more we have contributed the more we can explore incorporating new equipment designs.  What would a proton pack look like if Spengler and Stantz built it in a laboratory with all the parts they could possibly ever need instead of the firehouse garage?  Station 6 has the decrepit hand me down equipment, but would the Los Angeles branch?  We would love to see the creativity of fans who could design this and watch it come to life on screen!</li>
<li>Production worked out great last time!  But we have nearly exhausted all of our free locations we have access to, this will require us to find places who are not only willing to have us, but are also willing to cut us some slack as film permits alone for a single day are upwards of 800 dollars in our area.  We don't exactly have the Mayor asking us, ""What do you need from me?""  Luckily, our producers have extensive experience in stretching a budget, so we could get some cool locations while tightening our belts in other areas and still maintaining high production value. <br/>We shot the original 45 page pilot over the course of 3 days. This is unprecedented for any film set, but it was because that was the only way we could work out locations, actors, and not get fired from our day jobs.  Once we cross the boundary from free locations to paid locations, scheduling becomes much easier.</li>
<li>On the first episode we found out our largest time drain was post-production, specifically special effects.  This is because we were scrounging for free versions of what we could do with more powerful software.  Ghosts were literally us on green screen, or bought for pennies from template CGI sites.  It ""worked"" but that's because we had dedicated volunteers learning programs they had never used to create effects they had never done.  The proton streams were built from scratch, and had to be adjusted frame by frame.  There are plugins and generators, as well as high powered programs we can utilize, are familiar with, but just don't have a copy we could use.  We are also in touch with several puppeteer companies as the goal has always been to mimic the same style of ghosts found in the movies.  </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everybody has the ability to contribute financially. We get it. We've been there. In fact, we're still there! Trust me, if we could fund it all ourselves, we would. But there are other ways you can help!</p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest way to help us out is to use that ""SHARE"" button here on the campaign page and share the campaign with all your Ghostbuster fan friends and family that appreciate what we're trying to do. If you're strapped for cash, but have a rich uncle who loves Ghostbusters, you might be able to see every episode without contributing a cent! Ain't that the life? (DISCLAIMER: If you do have that uncle, please let us know...everyone has three mortgages nowadays.)</li>
<li>Do you have a business where we can shoot? Or Ghostbusters-related props and/or costumes we can borrow? Or do you own a food establishment and wouldn't mind donating food for a relatively small crew for one of three or four shoot days? We can't pay people, but we still have to feed them! Any and all of this helps reduce expenses and therefore stretches our budget a little further, perhaps another episode.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it.  You've seen what we could do with no budget, now see what we can all do together and take this franchise into a direction where we know it has all the potential of being.  Suit up, switch on, and join the team.  These ghosts ain't going to bust themselves.<br/><br/>**If Episode 2 is not fully funded, any perks pertaining to receiving Episode 2 items (digital downloads, screen credits, walk on parts, etc.) will not be fulfilled.  Station 6 crew apologizes, however something special will be given to you.</p></div>","More Than Just a Fan Series
Ghostbusters has touched us all. It's one of the most beloved film franchises of all time.  For many years the fans have been starved for a continuation of the original movies in film form, we seek to rectify that problem. Not only that, we want to make something for the fans, by fans, where our audience can contribute to what they would like to see this world to go.
First, a little bit about myself:

My name is Christopher J. Tomlinson and I have had over a decade of experience in the film and television broadcast industry.  I have been on countless professional sets, and have had the privilege of writing and/or directing 7 distributed feature length films.  In the midst of all that I have always maintained one foot in the realm of independent filmmaking, where instead of having to wade through countless meetings, bureaucracy, and creative stifling- artists are allowed to examine storytelling in ways they truly want.  I hope to bring all the awesome power a financed studio could bring to the raw talent and passion an indie set has to wield in further episodes of Ghostbusters: Station 6.
Ghostbusters has been in my life as long as I can remember.  One of the first times I ever sat down to write a script I wrote a Ghostbusters one.  I grabbed my dad's VHS camcorder, and trusty Kenner backpack- and any willing souls in my neighborhood.  I was in 7th grade, it was lame- and you will NEVER see it.  My 3rd, 5th, 12th, 18th, 25th, and 30th birthday cakes donned the GB logo- and I plan to see that on my cake many more times.  
This project is my dream project. Almost every Ghostbusters fan thinks, ""man, if only they did this or that with the story,"" but they don't have the resources. We have the ability to create our own stories within the universe and we can help you bring other stories into the universe. We have our plan for how this show will play out - and some of your ideas might even already be incorporated into our plans - but there is room for additional story elements, even scene ideas or Ghostbuster moments you've always wanted to see. For instance, you might think, ""What would happen if some criminal stole a proton pack? How much damage would that cause? What are the insurance ramifications of such things?"" Those are good questions and similar ideas could be submitted to us and might be incorporated into the show!

We hope you share the same love and the same vision for Ghostbusters that we do. The bottom line is, we want to make something that all of us can enjoy as fans. Now, let's get a little more specific.

What We Need & What You Get
Why not use our own money?! Well, we did. It's all in the first episode. We also called in every favor we could from industry professionals to give it as much production value as possible.  We left it ""all on the field"" so to speak.  This of course, is not sustainable for any extended period of time.
The good news is, we can now involve the audience! We know you love Ghostbusters just as much as we do, so we value your contribution. Not only monetarily, but also your feedback. An unsuccessful crowdfunding campaign is pretty indicative that our show did not sit well with the general audience, and saves us the time and embarrassment of playing where we're not wanted.
However, if Ghostbusters: Station 6 strikes a chord with fans like we think it will, your ideas and feedback might make it directly into the show! Remember, this is by the fans and for the fans. With the money and resources from this campaign, we'll be able to solicit ideas from hardcore fans, such as yourselves, to make the series appeal to a wider range of Ghostbusters fans (and hopefully beyond). Obviously, from a practicality standpoint, we would not be able to include every idea submitted to us, but we will consider all of them and if we take your idea, we'll include your name in the credits!

We're looking to raise $20,000 for episode 2 ONLY. We can only take this on an episode by episode basis for now, but any excess funding is not excess! We will put that money towards future episodes. The larger the contributions, the more efficient we will be in getting you more episodes!
It's important to note that because this is a fan project, nobody is legally allowed to profit on this venture. Therefore, all the money donated will end up directly on the screen.
For your contribution, you get some amazing perks in return. All the usual stuff is there - , copies of the finished product, autographs, screen credits, and on set visits... But we also offer stuff unique to this campaign, including customized Ghostbusters uniforms, screen-used props from the show, and for a lucky few... YOUR VERY OWN PROTON SCREEN USED PACK!
If we don't reach our goal, we admit our first episode didn't land with fans as we'd hoped and we will stop production of the series. However, the money donated will go to fulfill the perks of those who contributed. Obviously, if we come close to the goal, we will still produce the second episode, but will likely stop after that.

<h3>Why are we GROWING GREEN?</h3>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to raise enough resources to complete a killer Pilot Presentation that's going to ""WOW"" networks -and- streaming services that might be interested in picking it up. From there, we take it to the next level. As a job, it's going to be awesome to work on in every role from actor to cameraman to props master. As a home viewer, it's going to be hilarious and uplifting in it's honest, poignant comedy. At the end of the day, this is about entertaining the masses and providing the very best story and music possible. It's a show where you will want to listen to the soundtrack every week.</p>

I’ve lived in India, England and the US. Growing up in three different countries has it’s side effects. I don't see the world like everyone else and I have always felt like an outsider. Through these experiences, one of the things that i’ve learned was that even though on the outside many things are different, we are more alike than we realize. All of these adventures have helped me in creating deep and interesting characters and the worlds they live in. After graduating from Business school and landing a desk job, I soon realized what I truly wanted to do with my life. I quickly shifted my focus and started learning more about filmmaking. Although I have been writing and creating stories from the age of 8, I never thought I could make a living as a filmmaker. After honing my skills by working on several independent film projects, I wrote and directed my first short film with a $0 budget and minimal crew. Now it’s time to take the next step. After teaming up with my writing partner, Clay Morsey, we believe that we have created an interesting and humorous story that will resonate with anyone who’s ever felt like they’ve been on the outside, or on the inside for that matter.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501422492/kumuacxz2effdecvvit9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Clay Morsey Jr. (Ryan Blake) - Director/ Writer</p><p>My name is Clay Morsey Jr. and I am a writer from Norwalk, Connecticut.

I have had a passion for writing since a young age and always look for ways to push the boundaries of what can be achieved. After working on an independent feature in New York City last summer, I decided to to create a production of my own. Vishnu and I currently have two projects that are in the works. Both revolve around a group of diverse individuals trying to survive when they are forced out of their comfort zones. As a writer, I have a habit of creating characters that are out of their element. As people I believe that we all at one point develop a routine and a comfort zone. It’s only when that routine and comfort disappears that we truly see ourselves for who we really are.

I'm Steven Moskos... Was that not clear?). He--as in me--is to portray the role of Garrett, the alcoholic, failed magician, for the silver screen. Boy can he--as in me--make a beer disapbeer. Disappear! Forgive me, for I, as in Steven Moskos, am a method actor, and I have been preparing most of the night... and day.  Who am i again?Tony Republicano (Mr. Dumas)Tony Republicano is thrilled to be back in front of the camera doing his first love, no, not his sexy The Pointe wife… comedy! His long and so called “career” has included: Plays and Musical Theatre - Sisters Rosensweig, Lend Me a Tenor, Annie, Film - The Adderall Diaries, Amazing Spiderman 2, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Television - The Last Laugh-a comedy pilot for Jimmy Fallon, W.W.E., O.I.T.N.B. and any other New York filmed show that has policemen, prison guards or mafia. Tony brags that he shared a cell on death row with Mike Tyson on Law and Order (sadly his big scene was cut) and that like most of his film and TV credits you can not blink during the show or you’ll miss him. When he’s not performing educational theatre, or playing patients for YALE Medical School he likes to instruct IMPROV comedy workshops. He loves working with the wildly funny cast of The Pointe, and says he doesn’t mind being one of the oldest characters on the show. ""Afterall"", says Tony, “they don’t call me Daddy for nothing!”Justin Campbell- ProducerI'm Justin Campbell and I'm a producer based in Connecticut.  In the last couple of years, I have been involved with producing different pictures including the feature Axis and the short film Dumplings.  I have also been involved in the successful indiegogo project for Code 8 starring Stephen and Robbie Amell.  I hope to bring my experience to the project and make it the next best show.David White- Associate Director & ProducerI’m David White and I’m a self taught screenwriter and cinematographer with an emphasis on Film Directing. I began making short films at 16, and I currently make commercials and promo videos. I studied acting and motion picture editing at the University of Connecticut, where I made my thesis film “Waiting For Nick”. I focus on the complexities and hardships of the human society in my work. Wishing to spark healthy discussions, I often select film topics that have a high level of controversy or social activism. I look forward to working on this show and to collaborate with a fantastic cast and crew.Paulina Simkin (Mrs. Dumas)- Producer/Casting Director My name is Paulina Simkin and I'm an actress, producer and pianist originally from Europe. After getting my Master's in Piano Performance from The Juilliard School I decided to add an acting degree from The Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute and it was the best decision of my life. Ever since that I have been acting in feature films, TV shows, commercials, I produced a couple short films and sometimes I even get to play the piano in my projects. And like Mrs. Dumas, I also like to swing... Being part of The Pointe and making it succeed is a matter very close to my heart! I believe it is a unique and at the same time very relatable story that needs to be told. I love our team and would love for everyone to join our incredible journey.Dani Hanks- ProducerI’m Dani Hanks and I’m a Director/Writer/Producer based in New York City. Since graduating from NYU Tisch Drama in 2015, I have written and directed a handful of short films, as well as music videos in American Sign Language. I have been involved in production on short-form projects, pilots, and indie films. I’m incredibly excited to be producing The Pointe, and is proud to contribute to such a quirky script and work with such a fun team!Dax Maier- Music Supervisor/ScoreDax Maier started at Albright college focusing on background/scoring music and flamenco guitar training. He focused primarily on production both in the electronic music space and the songwriter/scoring aspect of the music world. Dax studied and was mentored by such acts as Chachi (4am), David Grutman (Miami MMG), Nona Hendryx (Labelle), Gary Corbett (Cinderella). Aj Merlino (Albright College Music), Phil Bash (Bash Concepts), and Ryan Shemen (Success with Teamwork). Dax's music has been placed in the east coast comedy crews music, as well on his electronic side made it onto such blogs and radio stations such as THT World productions, Beyond Trance, Electropulse Music, Next Hyype, Flux BPM, CIY Worldwide. WXAC(Albright College Radio). Dax not only specializes in electronic, but also produces and scores background music for film. He also has sponsorships with Next Hyype(music ap) and Night gear co, a rave jewelry company. On the electronic side of his project Dax performs with his duo Dax&Atragun. They went on to play such places as Hammerstein Ballroom, Jewel Yacht, Hudson Terrace, LIV, Story, Lavo, Troy Liquor Bar and Brooklyn Warehouse.  Elizabeth Viggiano - Set Designer/PhotographerMy name is Elizabeth Viggiano and I'm the set designer and photographer for The Pointe. After receiving a BFA in Photography at MassArt in Boston, I started a photography business mostly revolving around weddings and fashion. I approached weddings with cinema in mind, focusing on various narratives that the guests created. To me, it felt like a movie production coming together that I had to make sense of visually.At that, I always had a passion for staging scenes in my images. I grew up in an old Stamford, Connecticut home filled with antiques, art, and confusing design. There were things everywhere and most of my upbringing consisted of restaging rooms constantly to find ""order"" in it all. I like to think of this as the base that stemmed my photography journey. I can't wait for my ""Pointe"" of view to come across in this upcoming series!",18.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>Set in Los Angeles,<strong> Maybe This Was a Bad Idea</strong> is a comedy about society's expectations of women and artists of color: Zee is an Arab-American visual artist who decides to wok on a new project involving semi-nudes of Arab men to ""combat negative stereotypes"". Although she’s not willing to admit it, she's subconsciously motivated by her own frustration with men in general, from her dad to her over-dramatic boyfriend Habib. Naturally things start to fall apart in Zee's world and she realizes she doesn't have it all figured out: Maybe her project isn't as groundbreaking as she thought it was. Maybe her boyfriend is holding her back in many ways. And maybe she doesn't want to be seen as an ""Arab artist"" anymore.</p>
<p>Through the intimate exchanges at her photo studio, Zee starts to realize that maybe the so-called battle of the sexes doesn't have to be a battle after all. But it also brings up new questions which lead to a major plot twist in the last episode that'll have you wanting more (Season 2 is next level!).</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WILL THE EPISODES LOOK LIKE?</strong></p>
<p>We are taking a ""Slice of Life"" approach to this web series: Every episode will introduce a different male character that Zee is photographing, with a glimpse into their lives and scenes from Zee's personal life. The photo session will be filmed from Zee's camera's POV, with her subjects addressing the camera lens, confessional style - giving viewers a more intimate look into these characters' inner worlds. And this series isn't a straight comedy - some moments will be sad, others infuriating, many hilarious... Much like life itself! </p>

<p>With scripts written and some of the cast locked, we need $25,000 to shoot and edit 5 episodes because it really does take a village: From the cinematographer to their assistant, the actors to the make-up artist, sound recordist to the editor and more.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Team Put Down is so happy with the success Season 1 has had and how it was received by all of you. It is because of this support that The Put Down Web Series won numerous awards such as Best Directed Web Series at The Hollywood Florida Film Festival. However, what was the budget you ask? God's grace. This caused many stressful obstacles that almost made Season 1  not be made.  Like seriously, this had no budget and it was by a wing and a prayer and all of your support it was made. It is with this in mind that we want production for Season 2 to be financially easier for the cast and crew. This is the reason we need your support and humbly ask for your donation to help us with the making of Season 2. This will be an awesome way to get help from out wonderful Put Down family! As little as $1 will help tremendously.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Team Put Down is so happy with the success Season 1 has had and how it was received by all of you. It is because of this support that The Put Down Web Series won numerous awards such as Best Directed Web Series at The Hollywood Florida Film Festival. However, what was the budget you ask? God's grace. This caused many stressful obstacles that almost made Season 1  not be made.  Like seriously, this had no budget and it was by a wing and a prayer and all of your support it was made. It is with this in mind that we want production for Season 2 to be financially easier for the cast and crew. This is the reason we need your support and humbly ask for your donation to help us with the making of Season 2. This will be an awesome way to get help from out wonderful Put Down family! As little as $1 will help tremendously.

<h2><strong>STUFF TEASER REEL &amp; GOAL</strong></h2>
<p>We are producing a teaser reel as a marketing tool — sort of like a 3-minute commercial/trailer to help sell the pilot and series to potential industry buyers. We have interest from several producers and production companies, and need to give them an idea what the show is about so they can sell it!</p>
<p>Just think — you can be a part in getting the next new comedy TV series on the air!</p>
<h3><strong>STUFF WE NEED TO PRODUCE THE REEL</strong></h3>
<p>It is amazing how a 3-minute teaser reel to promote a pilot would need expenses to get produced, but it does. Even with the kindness and dedication of many talented people donating their time, there is still a lot of 'stuff' needed to make a professional teaser reel pitch video come to life:</p>
<p>*Equipment  *Location Rentals  *Costumes  *Sound  *Make-up  *Unforeseen Costs * Food</p>
<p>The director, cast and crew are donating their time to make this project happen.</p>

She received her Master of Fine Arts degree from the University of Missouri-Kansas City and had the opportunity to perform with the professional Actors' Equity company, the Kansas City Repertory Theatre. Marie has performed in 100+ staged productions over the years and has appeared in numerous feature films, commercials and television shows; most recently, a recurring role on ""Fresh Off the Boat"" and ""Blunt Talk"" starring Patrick Stewart. During her time in Dallas, Texas, she was very active in the film community and served on the Board of Directors of Women in Film/Dallas for six-years, and the Board of Directors for the Dallas Screenwriters Association for three-years. Her short film, ""The Accident"" was accepted and screened in four  different film festivals. Marie moved to Los Angeles over twelve years ago to take her career to the next level and in 2014 she received the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy at the LAWEBFEST Awards for her series regular role, Belinda Dunn in ""Life with Kat and McKay"", the brain-child of Sandra Payne.

Marilyn’s petiteness and shyness helped in making her aware of others who were treated badly due to differences even if that difference was just popularity. Seeing and hearing of many injustices growing up Marilyn wished there were a way to help, which ﬁts in with her niche “Clashing of Ideologies, Cultures and Belief Systems” where the characters she has portrayed, ﬁghts for the rights of others in many ways. Even if it’s the character she portrays like the one many have grown to love as Veronica in one of the most popular ﬁlms of 1994 the cult classic Clerks. Marilyn continues to be drawn to those kinds of character which is evident in the latest independent ﬁlms such as Starship Rising and most recently Rogue Warrior: Robot Fighter playing a Warlord and saving the planet from invasion Marilyn has played many strong characters with heart and weaknesses in productions before moving to LA in 1998 such as Crimes of the Heart, Same Time Next Year, Wait Until Dark and many more. Since moving to LA, Marilyn produced along with fellow acting students, a theater production titled Bedroom Stories, a series of one act plays with great reviews. Other acting that show diversity in her acting, credits include, short ﬁlms, Bad Hair day, Negotiations which won ofﬁcial selection DGA ﬁrst cut, Roadkill, winning BestFest America 1st place horror/thriller 2007, Dig, Best Director nomination and Marilyn receiving Best Supporting Actress Nomination and Neighbors.

Because being creative is all she knows, Marilyn doesn’t just act, she also has impressed audiences with her hair and makeup skills behind the camera on many a production as well as lending in still photography on set and shooting actors headshots. Marilyn was set to reprise her role loved by so many of the fans as Veronica in Clerks III written and directed by Kevin Smith but is heartbroken the ﬁlm has since been canceled. But not to worry as she will start production on Murder Hill in July 2017 starring along side Tom Proctor, Basil Hoffman and James Russo. After much work Marilyn can ﬁnally add TV credits to her resume with a pilot shot in Albuquerque, NM this past spring tilted End of the Santa Fe Trail.    Marilyn will also be adding Director to her resume with a dramatic piece soon on a project that is very dear to her heart in which she got to do a reading and was well received by the audience.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Faustus and I love good stories.  I have worked for years as a professional stage actor,  I have written a musical that won an OEA award, and I have seen a billion of movies and read almost as many books.  Basically, I love story telling.  I am passionate about it and have assembled a crew and cast that share that passion.</p>
<p>This campaign is to fund the second season  of a web series entitled Stuck.  Stuck was originally a feature film called Stuck on Neal.  It was accepted into film festivals spanning both of US coasts.  We had to cut a lot out of the final film to make it to a more admissible run time for the film festivals.  I decided to turn that film into a web series bringing back all the extra goodies that were unfairly left on the cutting room floor.  Now we are wanting to continue that story in Season 2 and wow, there are tons of twist and turns in this season.  This story is important to me because it deals with themes that are important today including Divorce, Racial struggles, Gender equality, LGBT, Grief, struggles of children growing up in a harsh world and many more.  The show can make you laugh and then make you cry.  The characters are diverse that people shouldn't find it hard to connect with one or more of them.  We would love to give you this expansion of the world created in the first season.</p>
<p>We value and know how important it is for us to receive your support.  We have a cast and crew of over 70 people ready to work hard to make this show come alive for you.  With your support, you help a family of artists that produce an original story for all to enjoy.  Most of us have to balance working on this project with our daily jobs to make it happen, sacrificing our personal time because we believe in this story and characters.</p>

</div></div>","VENUS FLYTRAP! – the FIRST digital scripted series about women in rock. Venus Flytrap is a band of young women intent on grabbing rock and roll by the balls in the land of Trumpistan. It’s “Fearless Girl” staring down “Charging Bull” on Wall Street with guitars. It’s PUSSY GRABS BACK in a queer-centric provocative show whose time has come. The punk feminist VENUS FLYTRAP (VFT) and their various cohorts will disrupt the entertainment status quo with their own unique brand of comedy, anarchy, music and mayhem. We’re totally going for it, lady-balls OUT and ON FIRE!
Have you watched VINYL, FLIGHT OF THE CONCHORDS, THE GET DOWN, ROADIES or THE MIGHTY BOOSH? What is missing in these shows? Why are the women always groupies, roadies, singing girl-group femmes or facilitators to the guys? The missing female musical rebellion that has always been here will rise again through our catalysts – punk rockers TINK(erbelle), JOEY, TASHA and DEE.

<p><strong>Hi! My name is Destiny Muse and I am the creator of Processed <i>Self-Love</i>!</strong></p>
<h3>The Truth</h3>
<p>Processed- Self Love started as a production that was meant to help the audience go deeper into their reality and discover their individual self growth necessary for them to be the best version of themselves. I began the writing process and my motives changed. I started to experience growing pains and a realization of the parts of me that still needed addressing. The entire direction changed and I got selfish. I was hungry for more because I started seeing myself differently as the writing developed. I began to see myself wholly, stitched together and unafraid.  So I got honest and decided the best way to help anyone is through my story. </p>
<p>I realized that the only thing I really had to offer anyone was my truth. Once I realized how important it was for me share my experience the selfishness subsided and the burden set in. I knew I owed it to  the people around me to share my story through my creativity, so I did. I sacrificed so much for this project, time, money, energy, and more because I truly believe the impact this series will have is worth it. I hope that my story can help those who watch it create their own narrative and find their own truth. I am still processing.  I am still growing. I am still discovering self love.</p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p><strong>1. People To Watch it!</strong><br/>I want people to find a deeper love for themselves and for the world around them in a unique way.</p>
<p><strong>2. Traveling Show!</strong><br/>I am in the process of turning Processed Self-Love the web-series into a traveling show.  The night would consist of viewing each episode  accompanied with artistic performances that expresses the same narrative but in a different dialog all while an intimate discussion is going on that is self reflective and challenges the audience to create their own dialog.</p>
<p><strong>3. Creative Self-Love Workshop</strong><br/>I am in the process of developing a creative workshop . The workshop will teach individuals how to explore the dialog in their own unique way. It will also help individuals already experimenting with the arts take things to a deeper level.</p>
<p><strong>4. Publish The Book</strong><br/>I am in the process of writing a book that follows along with the web-series and takes it even deeper! I explore each topic at a deeper level than the 4-7 minute episodes allow me to. The book is intended to get people thinking about their our narrative and the things they do or do not wish to change.</p>
<h3>More Truth</h3>
</div><div>
<p>In order to make each goal happen it requires finances. I have invested every penny I possibly could into this project because I believe in it. I exhausted all of my personal resources before making the decision to reach out for support.  I am committed to reaching each goal and will continue to sacrifice in the areas I can to make it happen but I can not do it alone. Production cost was $2000 and that was without paying the people who made it all possible what they truly deserve. My goal is to raise $7,000 in order to help me continue to pour all of my energy into what I know I am called to do. I am going to do whatever it takes to birth this vision and I would love for you to join me on this process! </p>

<p>My name is Zachary Gallmann. I have been in the strength community, as a competitor, coach, and representative for almost a decade. About a year and a half ago, I started a project called ""Finding Strength"", where I visit training facilities all across the country and try to connect people with the athletes and coaches that are building not only the best possible versions of themselves, but a community that welcomes anyone trying to find strength.</p>
<p>In this new venture, which I have titled, ""Meathead"" I will be raising funds to film a pilot episode for my concept, in which I train with various strength crews, from all aspects of the strength world, and then share food with them at their favorite restaurant. While at the restaurant, I will also highlight the people making the food that these athletes have come to know and love.</p>
<p>Strength sports are rapidly growing in the United States, but they are still a niche because there hasn't been a way to fill the gap between everyday people, and those that like to push themselves to the limits in strength. I believe that the common denominator between all people is food, and a television show that would link the two would generate not only new athletes, but also fans that can see what it's like on the inside of the sports that us competitors love so much. Your donation will help humanize all of us and reach a larger audience across the country, as well as give quality restaurants the recognition they deserve, and have obviously earned by their loyal customers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding something like this isn't easy. Between travel costs, production, and man hours, it costs a lot of money to develop such a project. I am seeking $10,000 or more in donations so I can help create a series that can employ people with an interest in growing the strength world.</p>
<p>All donations will go toward equipment, paying production staff, compensating restaurants, and getting in to talk to the right people to make this all come to fruition.</p>
<p>Any and all contributions are greatly appreciated and welcomed. Here will be a few perks that come along with larger donations.</p>
<p>People donating $30 or more will receive a Meathead t-shirt</p>
<p>Donations over $500 will receive a producer credit on the pilot</p>
<p>Investments over $1000 will receive a full time producer credit if the series gets picked up.</p>
<p>If I can not reach my goal of $10,000, the money I have collected will still be put toward making this happen. We can bootstrap if necessary, but I would like to be able to create a product that I think people can get behind. I want quality to represent the people I film.</p>
<p>I truly believe we are on the precipice of making the strength sports and their athletes household names. I believe that with the current culinary trend, food will be the catalyst that makes that happen. If people can see the best strength athletes in the world relaxing and enjoying food with their crews, we can help show the human side of these athletes.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and I look forward to seeing everyone out on the road!</p>

<p>In the pilot, we follow introverted Dee as she celebrates her birthday with her younger sister, gregarious Cristina. She is confronted with her anxiety when Cristina invites a hundred people to their party. The pilot will introduce her struggle with speaking up for herself, her sexuality and a past relationship. </p>
<p>Throughout the episode we will also give an insight into the individual journeys of Trix and Kat, foreshadowing themes we will be seeing in their episodes: Trix juggling her difficult family life with her social circle; Kat coming to terms with their gender and growing out of old habits.</p>

Creating her own short films and relentlessly working on side-projects during secondary education inspired her to move to London in 2014 to persue a Bachelor's Degree in Film &amp; Television. Passionate about editing since adolescence, she is especially interested in narrative and structure, which she has also explored through acting in high school drama productions. In her free time, she creates elaborate mixtapes and runs a bee blog.</p>

<h3>Diversity In Media</h3>
<p><i>Cake &amp; Candles</i> features a diverse cast in terms of ethnicity, sexuality, and gender. Created by a bisexual Latina and a queer woman of colour, we understand the importance of representation in the media. Since the very beginning of our filmmaking journey, we've been adamant about telling stories that are truly reflective of the world around us. This means that we are very passionate about including and involving as many voices from minority communities as possible, which will be reflected in our cast and crew.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every production has it challenges but we aim to overcome them all! We are shooting this pilot with a low budget but it will be filmed whether we achieve the goal or not, though it would certainly help to raise the full amount. Our core team has worked together previously, so we are confident that we will do the characters justice.</p>

In the pilot, we follow introverted Dee as she celebrates her birthday with her younger sister, gregarious Cristina. She is confronted with her anxiety when Cristina invites a hundred people to their party. The pilot will introduce her struggle with speaking up for herself, her sexuality and a past relationship. 
Throughout the episode we will also give an insight into the individual journeys of Trix and Kat, foreshadowing themes we will be seeing in their episodes: Trix juggling her difficult family life with her social circle; Kat coming to terms with their gender and growing out of old habits.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Alexandra Bender. I'm the creator and writer of Katharina the Supervillain. This is a 30 minute animated action comedy about an angsty teen who wants to live an honest life by pursuing a career path as a supervillain. It deals with independence, family issues and friendship issues with all the comedy and violence you could want in a series. The fact that we had finished animation last year helped us get pitch meetings. We're still passionate about this show, so we're still working on it.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Despite popular belief, artists need to be paid for their labor.</p>
<ul>
<li>We have an amazing storyboard artist who just started working on her part. She's getting paid $750 though she deserves way more.</li>
<li>We also have two animators who are also $750 each. Not to put a price tag on human life, but they're worth their weight in gold.</li>
<li>The total is $2250.</li>
<li>Perks include lots of fun artwork and more hilarious one-liners from me.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3>What is <i>Skeleton Crew?</i>
</h3>
<p>Skeleton Crew is an internationally award-winning gay soap opera (affectionately called a melo-dra-gomedy [or melodramatic tragicomedy]) about a bear couple &amp; their family &amp; friends, &amp; what happens when the fringes of sexuality become the norm.</p>
<p>The series has always looked to present non-mainstream issues, ideas, themes, topics, &amp; even bodies in a mainstream manner, &amp; Season 5 continues to do so. We seek to provide greater opportunities to plus-sized actors, &amp; present facets of the LGBTQ rainbow rarely explored by mainstream and indie creators. Skeleton Crew currently streams on YouTube. This season, we will be tackling themes of communication, revenge, and toxic masculinity in the LGBT world.</p>
<p>In December 2014, the first draft of a play called Skeleton Crew was completed. From the first read thru of this piece, it was clear the potential was there for something more. Since that time, thousands of people have tuned in to watch the adventures of Anthony, Hunter, and the rest of the characters in Skeleton Crew. The series has become a platform for people and ideas on the fringes of society, and will continue to do so as long as the series exists.</p>
<p>Produced by SideKick Productions, whose mission is promoting size-blind casting whenever appropriate and possible, Skeleton Crew has connected with audiences in ways I never imagined. We have been fortunate enough to work with talent from all levels of the industry, including Greg Gunter, star of the <i>Bearcity </i>Trilogy, LGBT and Blues Hall of Fame member Rev. Yolanda, and founder of Troma Studios and father of the Toxic Avenger, Lloyd Kaufman. Beginning with Season Four, we have been fortunate to have <i>The Voice</i>'s Nakia join us behind the scenes creating original music as well as on screen in the role of Sebastian Jupiter.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Season Five</h3>
<p>Every year, we try to improve on what we have done in the past, going bigger and better than before. This is no different with Season Five. We are particularly excited to be making our very first musical episode with 13 original songs by Nakia. </p>
<p>Any donations we receive will go towards making Season Five better than ever. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production of 13 original songs for our first musical episode</li>
<li>Rental of The WayStation, the fabulous bar which serves as our home away from home, MoneyShot$</li>

<p>We are a group of 3rd year students at the University of Greenwich, working on our graduate project. This year we are creating a TV Pilot episode for a Sitcom, exploring the relationship between an elderly person and their carer in a care home. This campaign is important to us because we want to to give recognition to the care workers that work long unsociable hours and give their all to helping our older generations. We hope to shed a much needed new perspective as we explore the heart warming bond between our main characters, Kenny and Veronica, as we follow them ticking off goals from Veronica's bucket list. </p>
<p>With the help of contributors we will be able to build a realistic set, money will go towards buying furniture and essential props which will have a huge impact on the look of our show. Additionally this will go towards paying for actors that will portray these characters stories well on screen. With any money left over, we will be donating this to local care homes for those affected by the issues explored within our television show.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>This story follows the real connection and relationship between Veronica and Kenny, giving a sense of nostalgia.  After the death of her husband, 75 year old Veronica was dumped into a care home by her children. Miserable about her mundane routine that the care home offers. Her devoted yet air headed carer Kenny persuades her to create a bucket list. Failing to take this seriously, Veronica is determined to go to a strip club. When the permission is denied, Kenny calls a stripper to the home however this doesn’t go to plan when her son Michael pays her a visit with news of a new grandchild. She later realises that she should use the bucket list as a way to reconnect with her daughter. </p>

<p>As stated above a big chunk of this money will be going towards building our sets where we will need to buy big furniture such as armchairs, tables, beds etc. also needing to provide costumes for the characters. We are hoping to sauce these from local charity shops and online as a way of saving money, however this could still get expensive. </p>
<p>Additionally, paying our actors for this project will take up a large sum of the funding, as we would like to have experienced and well suited actors this means paying them a fair rate across a filming week. Due to having 2 main characters and 3 side characters this will bump up our costs. However as our story is very character driven, we believe it is important to have those more experienced as a way to illustrate this through actors. </p>
<p>Any remanding money will be donated to our local care homes, specifically one that will be used in our episode, to hopefully go towards helping better their experience in the care homes. </p>
<p>Those who contribute to our project will receive a credit at the end of our episode, with a complimentary gift box which will also include a hard copy of the episode as a thank you for your donation. </p>

<p>""I Met Someone"" follows three friends, Kim, Tara, and Ronnie as they move through emotional turning points in their romantic relationships. </p>
<p>Kim, the mother of the group, is a people pleaser who tries to hold everyone up while forgetting to stand on her pedestal. She finds herself unsatisfied after entering a polyamorous relationship with her boyfriend Mike. </p>
<p>Tara, the baby of the group, comes from a wealthy and loving family. She aspires to find that ""perfect love"" that her parents had and finds herself pressuring her boyfriend into marriage.  </p>
<p>Ronnie is the fun and energetic friend of the group. She loves to live life on her own terms and isn't willing to commit to much because ""it doesn't fit her free spirit."" Ronnie begins a secret relationship with Tara's cousin Ebony, against her friend's wishes. </p>
<p>The girls all try to hide what they're dealing with out of fear of embarrassment. Throughout this journey, they learn the importance of sisterhood, truth, and self-reflection. By meeting one person, they are all forced to see their imperfections and need for growth. </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>""I Met Somone"" tackles many subjects like building trust in friendships, identity crisis, commitment issues, and more. The writing aims to start a conversation about what accountability looks like in our romantic and platonic relationships. As a Black Queer writer and producer, I want to create more stories with social commentary about the plights and beauties of the Black community. </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>Your contributions will be used to pay the cast and crew, rent equipment, secure locations, purchase PPE materials, crafty, props, costumes, and cover some of our post-production costs. </p>

<h3>""Why doesn't that show exist yet?""</h3>
<p>I've been developing the ""Be The Change with Rebecca"" concept for almost two years now. The show came as an answer to many of my own frustrations. I came to realize that community engagement is my only cure for a 21st century news-cycle hangover. But it's not only me: the more I step out into communities across the US, the more I see that it's actually the folks who are tackling local problems head-on who have an easier time sleeping these days. Why is that?</p>
<p>Maybe it's knowing that the world really is full of nice, caring people (and that you're one of them). Maybe it's the genuine human interaction that we miss out on in our age of social media. Maybe it's the priceless reward when selfless efforts pay off.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, I see it everywhere. Now, I want others to see it. And then I want them to feel it.</p>
<p>As soon as I began reaching out to nonprofits, filmmakers, and friends about the idea, most everyone I spoke to was left wondering, ""Why doesn't that show exist yet?""</p>
<p>So, what's the show about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Community organizer Rebecca Kassay dives into dynamic volunteer opportunities at a wide variety of nonprofit organizations while traveling across US in an old RV with her husband and their dog.</li>
<li>While engaged in that day's volunteer work, Rebecca chats up fellow volunteers and serves as an avatar for viewers to explore the whos, whats, whens, wheres, whys, and how-can-I-get-involveds of that nonprofit and volunteer role.</li>
<li>Ranging from tears of laughter to solidarity in a somber silence, the show captures the profound experiences shared by strangers who roll up their sleeves to work together.</li>
<li>""Be The Change with Rebecca"" aims far beyond attracting an ""audience"": its goal is to empower its viewers (yes, that's you!) to realize that they, too, have what it takes to make positive changes in their own communities.</li>
</ul>
<p>The show is inspired by: the format of Dirty Jobs with Mike Rowe; the immersive, raw journalism of Vice News; and the real-people, real-story feel-good vibes of The Ellen DeGeneres Show.</p>
<p>We know we've done our job when an episode ends and you're excited to be connected to a similar opportunity in your region. We will be coordinating with national service organizations to provide you with the best resources for use on your path to your own unique community engagement story. Our hope to help connect more volunteers with the nonprofit organizations that have been waiting for them just down the street, turning our viewers into doers!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>We're Volunteering, Too!</h3>
<p>The Aureate Visuals production team is passionate about the concept and will be donating a ton of their time and equipment for use on the project. Of course, as the host and executive producer, I'll also be donating my time, the use of my RV and motorcycle, and covering many related expenses out of pocket.</p>
<p>That being said, there are still many costs associated with the project, like gas for the RV, hiring local crew-members at each filming location, and feeding the team. This Indigogo campaign helps to raise money for 8 full-length episodes of ""Be The Change with Rebecca"", to premier in Spring 2020. Here's a rough breakdown of our minimum budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3,000 - Travel/lodging</li>
<li>$3,000 - Local Crew Wages</li>
<li>$1,500 - Food/Per diem</li>
<li>$500 - Miscellaneous Expenses</li>
<li>$800 - Indiegogo related fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone has plenty of 'things', so in exchange for your generous donations, we want to offer you something more meaningful than a keychain or a t-shirt. Our perks are all about YOU. (If viewing this on a phone, be sure to click the bold title to read more about the perk.) Has a nonprofit in your community done well by you? Show them some love! Do you want to get more into volunteering but don't know where to start? We can help with that! Want to be on the show? You got it!</p>
<p>The best perk of all? The show being produced!, and passionate people doing cool things makes great TV, so you'll get to brag that you were a part of making this awesome series come to life.</p>
<p>To supplement these funds, in addition to all other budget items (specialized equipment, post production, etc...) we are seeking collaboration with sponsors- to be announced as we get closer to filming! If we don't reach our entire Indiegogo goal, we're still aiming to film this year- I'll just pity my crew if we run low on food funds and I become hangry. Eek.</p>
<p>If (when!) we exceed our goal, we will start planning ways to make production and post-production even greater, and you can be sure that we'll start pulling out the stops on fabulous new perks! (Maybe we'll even bust out some celebratory keychains.) We already have additional production crew-members in mind who we would hire (your dollars going right back into the American economy, and helping to tell volunteers' stories with more technical beauty), and if ya'll are really feeling it, maybe we can film a couple of extra episodes to capture a few more forms of community engagement in this season.</p>
<p>As the funds behind ""Be The Change with Rebecca"" grow, so does our scope of imaginable possibilities. Thank you in advance for giving what you can to assure success as ""Be The Change"" launches into the mediasphere!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We all love Superheros. They stop the bad guy, rescue the hostages, save the day, and get... depressed??? Well, yea. Unfortunately, 1 in 5 adults living in America battle with some form of mental health condition. This includes superheroes like our very own Xerxes Hughes, better known as Captain Zero. That does not mean, however, that they're cr**y or out of their mind.</p>
<p>Media is how we shape the word. It's how we’re informed about what we see, what we talk about and most importantly..<i>how</i> we talk about it. We're creating this show to bridge the gap between perception and reality when it comes to mental health/depression--especially how it's viewed/talked about in communities of color</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Show Content </h3>
<p>Our goal is to tell a unique story that will bring awareness to and eliminate the stigma surrounding social issues like mental health. Episodes primarily revolve around Xerxes and his maturation as a hero. How he deals with his newfound “celebrity” and trying to balance his hero life, social life, and depression. Other episodes follow supporting characters as they navigate through themes of self-discovery, self-acceptance, race, sexuality and more.  </p>
<ul>
<li> 10 Episodes in season one</li>

</div></div>","Summary
We all love Superheros. They stop the bad guy, rescue the hostages, save the day, and get... depressed??? Well, yea. Unfortunately, 1 in 5 adults living in America battle with some form of mental health condition. This includes superheroes like our very own Xerxes Hughes, better known as Captain Zero. That does not mean, however, that they're cr**y or out of their mind.
Media is how we shape the word. It's how we’re informed about what we see, what we talk about and most importantly..how we talk about it. We're creating this show to bridge the gap between perception and reality when it comes to mental health/depression--especially how it's viewed/talked about in communities of color
 
Show Content 
Our goal is to tell a unique story that will bring awareness to and eliminate the stigma surrounding social issues like mental health. Episodes primarily revolve around Xerxes and his maturation as a hero. How he deals with his newfound “celebrity” and trying to balance his hero life, social life, and depression. Other episodes follow supporting characters as they navigate through themes of self-discovery, self-acceptance, race, sexuality and more.  

 10 Episodes in season one
 30 minutes long
 4 seasons outlined 
 Potential for hour-long specials detailing the backstories of characters

 

What We Need
We know what you're thinking. ""Cool idea, but isn't a hundred grand a bit much?"" It is, but we set a big goal because we have big plans. We don't just want to talk about it, we want to create real-world change.

The remaining money will go toward paying staff, covering animation costs, covering the cost of the awesome perks we're giving away, business/legal fees, travel costs, and funding community events that help our cause.

<p>Resonance is a short doc series surrounding music venues in Toronto that no longer exist. We will create 5, four-minute episodes. Each episode will focus on one particular venue and will tell its story through a combination of archival footage as well as interviews with artists who have played at the venue. Our project will focus on venues that have opened and closed between the 1950s and the early 2000s. </p>
<p><strong>The venues that we will focus on are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Maple Leaf Gardens</li>
<li>Riverboat Coffee House</li>
<li>The BamBoo</li>
<li>We'ave</li>
<li>Masonic Temple</li>
</ul>
<p>Resonance is being produced by <strong>Momentum Digital Productions</strong>, which is our group of 4th-year Media Production students from Ryerson University. We began pre-production in February 2018, and have completed a comprehensive, 163-page production plan with original scripts, and an extensive budget. With your support, we are excited to begin production in October so that we can submit our final project by December.</p>

It's the sex-ed and gender studies class you wish you had. We want to include as wide a range of experiences and life personalities as there are women.</p><p>The first season of this mini series follows four episodes, each under 10 minutes. An episode will feature three different women and an individual set of corresponding topics with funky backgrounds.</p><p><strong>Our inclusive conversations have addressed topics such as:</strong></p><ul>

</ul><p> </p><h3>THE CREATORS AND CREW</h3><p>Before I talk about myself and my co-creator, I want to highlight our <u>amazing</u> team. This show would not exist without our crew for the 12 episodes we’ve filmed thus far:</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Cinematographer</strong>: Katherine Hoskins</li>
<li>
<strong>Sound</strong>: Manuel Ermecheo and Cedric Wilson</li>
<li>
<strong>Art Directors</strong>: Celina Arslanian, Perri MacKenzie, and Tabitha Swanson</li>
<li><i>And so much love to everyone who helped with the shoots!</i></li>
</ul><p>So now a little more about us. We are two female creators based in New York City. My name is Dasha Kova and I am the co-creator and producer for Sex Café. My background is primarily in writing and content creation, however I have been a web series fiend for a while and noticed that there was a serious lack of conversations supporting women’s sexuality. I wanted to create a show that would act as an open space to lead and normalize these types of discussions in as candid a way as possible. We decided to include playful sets to make the conversation just as fun as it is important.</p><p>Next, we have the show’s co-creator and co-producer, Goldie Poll. She’s a skilled multimedia journalist and research queen. Her work experience includes both qualitative and quantitative research, management, and lots of academia. One day I asked her if she wanted to work on this project, and two years later we’re still at it and excited to keep going!</p><p> </p><h3>HOW ARE WE DIFFERENT?</h3><p>Sex Café’s bold name does not go unnoticed. Such a provocative title often requires clarification: we are not a sex show, we are a show about sexuality. We do not scare away from taboo topics, we engage the discussions involving them with hope to create a new normal around such themes. We are a production made by women with women in mind. Don’t worry, we include men too! Recently, we filmed our one-off male perspective episode and it was exciting hearing their thoughts on set.</p><p> </p><h3>WHY GET INVOLVED?</h3><p>We are fortunate to have been in graduate school while starting this project: this meant renting equipment and studio space could be done without an extreme budget, however, we’re heading out into the “real world” now and the show cannot keep going without a budget. We have 8 pre-filmed episodes that have yet to be edited in post-production and we need your help to fund the software, equipment, and (wo)man hours it will take to edit the next seasons, as well as keep the show going for future filming!</p><p>We would also love to be able to pay (and feed) our entire team for any work they do going forward. We are dedicated to do the best shoot we can with the budget we have, and from pre-production, production, post-production, editing, equipment, studio, food, and transportation... This entire production takes a lot of time and $$$. We are dreaming of being able to fund and support the project and team.</p><p><strong>In future seasons we are looking to feature topics such as:</strong></p><ul>
<li>Debunking some orgasm myths, and what’s more fun than a good orgasm</li>
<li>Queer Sex</li>

<h3>About this project:</h3>
<p>As the creator and director of this project, I have personally invested my interest in seeing the show succeed. I have 11 years experience in the industry, shooting my first feature film back in 2007-2008. Variety and the Hollywood Reporter, as well as other film related magazines, released articles about my ability to create from nothing and shoot on tight budgets.</p>
<p>This project is set up to succeed! With cast members from popular shows like One Tree Hill and The Vampire Diaries, it will appeal to a wide audience as well as create an entirely new audience of its own.</p>
<p>Your contribution will go a long way in helping the episodes get produced and be the best they can be! We have set up specific perks that will even allow you to be a part of this ground breaking new show by offering walk-on roles, title credits, and many others! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Our Main goal is to hit $30,000. This will cover the cost of production for the remaining 5 episodes. That comes out roughly to around $6,000.00 per episode, and is the bare minimum.</p>
<p>We are looking to expand beyond that, and take our production value even further. On the minimum, we will have everything we need to do the basic shoots, but as we begin to hit our stretch and expanded goals, we will be looking to set up at the sound stages at EUE Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, North Carolina. The most efficient way to shoot our episodes, is to build the sets within the sound stages so that we have the capabilities to shoot on a proper schedule, and have everything available to us to be able to produce quality content.</p>
<p>By choosing a perk that we have offered up, you can help us make a successful show, not only for this first season, but for ongoing seasons. The key thing is we need your help to ensure we meet our goals.</p>
<p>With the first goal being set at $30,000, we should be able to reach that goal quickly. Anyone who has produced a show, knows that it's extremely expensive without the help of large studios. If we do not reach our goal, we will in our best effort, attempt to continue filming and shoot everything we can to try and complete the season based on whatever amount we were able to raise.</p>
<p>The Pilot episode is already shot and completed. We were able to get it done on a minimal budget, and it gave us a sample of what we can do when everyone comes together and pours their passion into a project. It also gave us the confidence to know that we can shoot out an entire episode, quickly, efficiently, and most times under budget. All without sacrificing quality production value.</p>

That is why we created VISIBLE.VISIBLE is a standalone teen drama pilot, set in a Toronto working-class immigrant community. It follows a group of passionate but confused teenagers as they navigate their final year of high school and try to rise above the pressures of family, society, and the systems in control.Set in a working class neighbourhood in Toronto, Sharon, Mustafa and Lee are seniors at Aginview Secondary School. Growing up in immigrant households, they try to navigate their identities and aspirations, all whilst feeling the pressure of high school and their families closing in on them. When someone close to them is targeted and attacked, they decide to seek justice and take on the administration themselves. They soon come to realize that changing the system isn’t as easy as it seems.Our exec team consists of five fourth-year RTA Media Production students at Ryerson University. Coming together at the beginning of 2019, we’ve been hard at work on pre-production for our first major production.Carol Liu - Co-Director & WriterCarol Liu is a Chinese-Canadian visual artist, designer and writer. Born in Shanghai and raised in Toronto, Carol feels a strong connection to the diverse immigrant neighbourhoods of this city. When co-creating the concept for VISIBLE with Maryan, she hoped to accurately portray the experiences of under-represented communities from which they are from.Maryan Haye - Co-Director & WriterMaryan Haye is a Somali-Canadian actor and screenwriter from Toronto, Ontario. Growing up in the Jane and Finch community, being in the media industry was never something that she considered an option until she entered university. Co-creating VISIBLE has allowed her to help bring characters similar to the kids she grew up with to life, and she is excited to produce a pilot that brings fresh voices and representation to youth programming.Levi Linton - Audio & Technical LeadLevi Linton is an African-Scottish Canadian multifaceted artist born and raised in the upper beaches area of Toronto. Levi experienced so many cultural backgrounds from his childhood community and has always felt one with his ethnic roots. As Audio and Technical Lead, Levi hopes to bring the picture to life with a powerful set of diverse artists in Toronto’s music scene.Amreen Kullar - Creative LeadAmreen Kullar is a second gen Indian-Canadian filmmaker and graphic designer. Through her numerous short film productions, surrounding social justice, while featuring commentary on the current digital age, she strives to create tolerance and understanding. She has always been drawn to the visuals of the content she watches and produces, hence, cinematography and art direction is where she is happiest.

<h3>Punch-lining Homophobia</h3>
<p><u>Funny matters. Gay visibility matters. Let's do both.</u></p>
<ul>
<li>People get fatigued by political messaging.</li>
<li>Humans are tribalist. Defenses are up.</li>
<li>We're all disarmed when laughing together.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Fundraising for 2 Initial Videos</strong></h3>
<p><i><strong>Gay-splainer</strong></i> satirically pokes fun at people who treat the queer community like make-over machines and sassy side-kicks. <i>(runtime: 6 minutes)</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Avenue WTF</strong></i> absurdly depicts a counseling session for a man and his hand, literally exploring gay self love. (<i>runtime: 8 minutes)</i></p>
<p><i>Sketches are based on serious, real life experiences, and presented with a laugh-first POV.</i><br/> </p>
<h3><strong>We're Ahead of the Game</strong></h3>
<p>Both sketches were just fully rehearsed and presented live at the People's Improv Theater in May of 2018. <u>We're ready to film right now!</u></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<u>A UNIQUE STORY</u>: Comedy Nerd Trapped in Dancer's Body</h3>
<p>After being an outcast in both the crunchy modern dance landscape and creamy commercial dance scene, it's clear I've been miscast in my own life.</p>
<p>Now that I've indulged in comedy writing and improv classes, I've got a new language to vomit out the funny that's backed up in my system.</p>
<p>Bored with the pretense of hot moves and high art, I'm embracing what I truly am- a comedy spaz.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Donate Because...</h3>
<p>-<strong>Pride season</strong>.</p>
<p>-<strong>You also want something different </strong>from your life.</p>
<p>-<strong>There aren't enough funny gays</strong> telling their stories in the public eye.</p>
<p>-<strong>I'm one of the nicest </strong>(most talented)<strong> people</strong> you know, and I deserve a break.</p>
<p>-<strong>You feel guilty</strong> for not coming to my live shows. <i>Yeah, I see you.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Be Selfish. Contribute For the Perks</h3>
<p>-<strong>Shameless Acknowledgement</strong> of your generous spirit (under $25)</p>
<p>-<strong>Ally</strong> <strong>Status</strong> ($25)</p>
<p>-<strong>Raunchy</strong> <b>Ringtones</b> ($50)</p>
<p>-<strong>Resume Booster</strong> ($75)</p>
<p>-<strong>Immortality</strong> in film ($100)</p>
<p>-<strong>Happiness</strong> (dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin will flood your body upon donating)</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Renting People, Places, and Things</h3>
<p><i><u>PEOPLE ($2000):</u></i> We're paying from $150-$500, based on level of involvement, though it cold be more. That includes the main cast, directors, camera pro, graphics specialist, and a film editor.</p>
<p><u><i>PLACES ($1500):</i></u> We'll be shooting on a couple sound stages at DCTV in downtown Manhattan during July and August of 2018.</p>
<p><u>THINGS ($1500):</u> DCTV has given us a deal on a FS700 camera package that includes a shotgun mic on a boom pole with mixer. We've also reserved two Tungston lighting packages, with additional LED options and gel combos.</p>
<p><strong>This all quickly equals $5000 and could easily be more</strong>. It's a scrappy operation but we're hell-bent on up-ing our production value and paying creatives for their talent.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>With Little Effort on Your Part, You Can...</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Turn this one-man-band into an army</u> of funny, smart people that need you to laugh more.</li>
<li>
<u>Use comedy as a common denominator</u> for diverse audiences to empathize with each other.</li>
<li>
<u>Use video to create new access points</u> for audiences to experience gay people.</li>
<li>
<u>Be credited as a creative</u> and round out that resume of yours.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>You're Investing in a ""Type A"" Gay That Makes Stuff Happen</strong></h3>
<p>Through utter nerdmanship and sheer force of will, I've managed, <u>with no money or pedigree</u>, to...</p>
<p>-Get featured by major publications.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527451682/wkg407lfwg2mhsc3rnhf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>-Receive residencies and commissions from arts organizations.</p>
<p>-Be accepted into international film festivals.</p>
<p><u>Imagine what I can do with even a little bit of your money?</u></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Confronting Possible Objections</h3>
<p><u>Jamie, people have different senses of humor.</u> We attack this like Saturday Night Live does.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i><strong>Gay-splainer</strong></i> is of the Harvard, smarty-pants style of humor.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Avenue WTF </strong></i>is all absurdist, low-brow jokes.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>People may not need this to be an extended series.</u></p>
<ul><li>We won't know until we try a few. And if the people want more, we'll begin a Patreon account for continuous support.</li></ul>
<p><u>I'm a creative type that doesn't have any money.</u></p>
<ul><li>So am I. But, having been a fundraiser for a bunch of arts-based non-profits, I know the art world runs on funding from people just like us. You matter here and we love you for it.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Need for Comedy Greater Than Ever?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Stephen Colbert</u> had most late night viewers last year.</li>
<li>
<u>SNL's 42nd season</u> was the highest watched in 23 years.</li>
<li>
<u>Samantha Bee's</u> ratings jumped 175%, post 2016 election.</li>

Funny matters. Gay visibility matters. Let's do both.

People get fatigued by political messaging.
Humans are tribalist. Defenses are up.
We're all disarmed when laughing together.

 
Fundraising for 2 Initial Videos
Gay-splainer satirically pokes fun at people who treat the queer community like make-over machines and sassy side-kicks. (runtime: 6 minutes)
Avenue WTF absurdly depicts a counseling session for a man and his hand, literally exploring gay self love. (runtime: 8 minutes)
Sketches are based on serious, real life experiences, and presented with a laugh-first POV. 
We're Ahead of the Game
Both sketches were just fully rehearsed and presented live at the People's Improv Theater in May of 2018. We're ready to film right now!
 

A UNIQUE STORY: Comedy Nerd Trapped in Dancer's Body
After being an outcast in both the crunchy modern dance landscape and creamy commercial dance scene, it's clear I've been miscast in my own life.
Now that I've indulged in comedy writing and improv classes, I've got a new language to vomit out the funny that's backed up in my system.
Bored with the pretense of hot moves and high art, I'm embracing what I truly am- a comedy spaz.
 
Donate Because...
-Pride season.
-You also want something different from your life.
-There aren't enough funny gays telling their stories in the public eye.
-I'm one of the nicest (most talented) people you know, and I deserve a break.
-You feel guilty for not coming to my live shows. Yeah, I see you.
 
Be Selfish. Contribute For the Perks
-Shameless Acknowledgement of your generous spirit (under $25)
-Ally Status ($25)
-Raunchy Ringtones ($50)
-Resume Booster ($75)
-Immortality in film ($100)
-Happiness (dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin will flood your body upon donating)
 

Renting People, Places, and Things
PEOPLE ($2000): We're paying from $150-$500, based on level of involvement, though it cold be more. That includes the main cast, directors, camera pro, graphics specialist, and a film editor.
PLACES ($1500): We'll be shooting on a couple sound stages at DCTV in downtown Manhattan during July and August of 2018.
THINGS ($1500): DCTV has given us a deal on a FS700 camera package that includes a shotgun mic on a boom pole with mixer. We've also reserved two Tungston lighting packages, with additional LED options and gel combos.
This all quickly equals $5000 and could easily be more. It's a scrappy operation but we're hell-bent on up-ing our production value and paying creatives for their talent.
 

With Little Effort on Your Part, You Can...


Turn this one-man-band into an army of funny, smart people that need you to laugh more.

Use comedy as a common denominator for diverse audiences to empathize with each other.

Use video to create new access points for audiences to experience gay people.

Be credited as a creative and round out that resume of yours.

 
You're Investing in a ""Type A"" Gay That Makes Stuff Happen
Through utter nerdmanship and sheer force of will, I've managed, with no money or pedigree, to...
-Get featured by major publications.

-Receive residencies and commissions from arts organizations.
-Be accepted into international film festivals.
Imagine what I can do with even a little bit of your money?
 
Confronting Possible Objections
Jamie, people have different senses of humor. We attack this like Saturday Night Live does.


Gay-splainer is of the Harvard, smarty-pants style of humor.

Avenue WTF is all absurdist, low-brow jokes.

People may not need this to be an extended series.
We won't know until we try a few. And if the people want more, we'll begin a Patreon account for continuous support.
I'm a creative type that doesn't have any money.
So am I. But, having been a fundraiser for a bunch of arts-based non-profits, I know the art world runs on funding from people just like us. You matter here and we love you for it.
 
Need for Comedy Greater Than Ever?


Stephen Colbert had most late night viewers last year.

SNL's 42nd season was the highest watched in 23 years.

Samantha Bee's ratings jumped 175%, post 2016 election.

These stats (CNN) show that more people are turning to comedy to ""cope with their angst over the new administration."" (Stephen Battaglio, LA Times)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>All of This Is Yours provides young audiences with the educational tools they need to begin creating the world they want to live in as global citizens through an episodic journey filled with unique cultural experiences and practical lessons that children can use in their everyday lives. The campaign will raise money for a pilot episode which will take Robin to San Jose Costa Rica where she will meet Amanda, a young girl ready to share her life, and her extended family, with the world.</p>
<p>Robin Hancock has been an avid traveler all her life. While working on a doctorate in education, she got the idea to create a series that blended her love for travel with her passion for early childhood ed. Her life's work examines the ways that identifying as a global citizen can empower children to walk in the world with confidence, pride in their communities and awareness of their positions as members of a large and vibrant global community. </p>
<p>This is Robin's passion project and her heart's desire for the last ten years has been to make this series a reality. Your contribution to the creation of the pilot episode will contribute to a field desperately in need of new and exciting voices. No gift is too small (or too big)!!</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>*Did you watch the pilot webisode (rough cut:  pre-final cc/grading, inserts, audio) posted above?*  B-movie magic is what we're aiming for, sorry to the film snobs!  We won't have the legions of advanced ex-machinas, Majors or Nexus 6s, spaceships or huge explosions but we're confident in delivering sheer bodacious entertainment regardless.  The script will deal with familiar and up-coming technologies e.g mixed reality, artificial intelligence, decentralized networks / compute power, blockchain, automation, bio-genetics etc. </p>
<h3><strong>The Show  (<a href=""http://www.elegantscum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.elegantscum.com</a>)</strong></h3>
<p>The story takes place roughly seven to ten years in the future.  Las Vegas Nevada, Sin City is dealing with economic discord, a populous of tinkerers of both old and new tech.  Society is a mosh pit full of usual and unusual suspects; infidels, hackers, criminals, virtual succubus, real high-tech  low lives fighting societal displacement due in part by today's industrial renaissance, AI and automation.  The story has a heavy emphasis on virtual reality and its potential impediments on real world populous and the defilement of human productivity in the physical world. Characters often showcase Freudian slips, pitted against their own demons so to speak as the show's slogan itself explains how  .... ""VR is the Devil's new playground...""</p>
<p>Director | writer JSK and team definitely draw heavy influence from classic cyberpunk vanguards but also have developed the project's own unique look and feel to add to the sub genre.   <strong>(visit <a href=""http://www.elegantscum.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.elegantscum.com</a> for more on the cast and project elements!)</strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Team in progress </strong></h3>
<p><strong>  Our team is a mashup within itself.  Directors, writers, cinematographers, thespians, grip, lights, sound design, beer runners, bar flies, alt coin traders, musicians, software devs you name it!  Core team:  Eli Oberlander, John Robinson, Tony Capil, James Wilhelm, Sam Elbaz, Jesse S Koda, Matt Heck, George Gardner.  <br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492665109/ddmituov2ht65q43srmm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Funding</strong></h3>
<p>*Check out the image gallery above for some of the perks!<br/><br/>Full $28,000 allocation for producing the remaining seven (7) webisodes + revisions for pilot.  (We have most of webisode two filmed already!).  Low budget but we'll make it work!</p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>$5,500 equipment upgrades: We've filmed with a combination of Sony FS5, RED Raven and Panasonic GH4.  For those that understand video production, it is kind of a pain in the ____ to match up footage recorded from different cameras. With proper funding we would switch over to full RED or Black Magic setups, purchasing camera bodies and sound equipment but renting lenses, lights and rigs other accessories.</li>
<li>$4,000+ insurance, permits, locations </li>
<li>$8,000 Priority of resources will be applied towards wardrobe, props, set design and post production.   Sound mixing, proper color/grading and of course VFX to help boost our production value and creative sandbox!  Although our crew has been very creative and efficient with costs, practical effects can run a tab and same goes with sourcing high-quality VFX talent.  We also plan to get some really good indie electro-industrial artists to help score.</li>
<li>$2200-2500 goes to IndieGoGo fees and perks.</li>
<li>$1,500 towards some fundamental marketing material; we plan to have artists and designers like NYC's Ariel ZB (who did our beautiful poster art) create some comic style storyboarding and additional artwork!  </li>
<li>est. $6,500 goes toward feeding and providing some minimal pay for our very talented local cast and crew for what will easily be over 1+ full days of production.  That's about a total of $350-$375 per 8 hour day of filming including both cast/crew.  We pretty much work for shake-shack &amp; beer !</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The support would help enhance our micro-budget project several fold by expanding our production sandbox, post production quality and quite frankly, some rations for our cast/crew!  We are resourceful and viciously dedicated to not wasting a dime outside of production.  We want to create a indie staple not just in the sub-genre of cyberpunk but something that can be enjoyed and shared by all science fiction fans.  </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Risks &amp; Challenges</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>For those that understand, like any creative endeavor there are always challenges in it's finality, meeting expectations etc.  But we are going about this project very pragmatically from the jump and are again fully committed to completing this mini series for the world to enjoy (or roast...)</p>
<ul>
<li>Finishing eight entire episodes.  As you see, we have posted our initial webisode (pilot) and are ready to continue production to finish the series.  But the challenge is again, in budgets.</li>
<li>With your support we can ensure progress continues!</li>

*Did you watch the pilot webisode (rough cut:  pre-final cc/grading, inserts, audio) posted above?*  B-movie magic is what we're aiming for, sorry to the film snobs!  We won't have the legions of advanced ex-machinas, Majors or Nexus 6s, spaceships or huge explosions but we're confident in delivering sheer bodacious entertainment regardless.  The script will deal with familiar and up-coming technologies e.g mixed reality, artificial intelligence, decentralized networks / compute power, blockchain, automation, bio-genetics etc. 
The Show  (www.elegantscum.com)
The story takes place roughly seven to ten years in the future.  Las Vegas Nevada, Sin City is dealing with economic discord, a populous of tinkerers of both old and new tech.  Society is a mosh pit full of usual and unusual suspects; infidels, hackers, criminals, virtual succubus, real high-tech  low lives fighting societal displacement due in part by today's industrial renaissance, AI and automation.  The story has a heavy emphasis on virtual reality and its potential impediments on real world populous and the defilement of human productivity in the physical world. Characters often showcase Freudian slips, pitted against their own demons so to speak as the show's slogan itself explains how  .... ""VR is the Devil's new playground...""
Director | writer JSK and team definitely draw heavy influence from classic cyberpunk vanguards but also have developed the project's own unique look and feel to add to the sub genre.   (visit www.elegantscum.com for more on the cast and project elements!)
The Team in progress 
  Our team is a mashup within itself.  Directors, writers, cinematographers, thespians, grip, lights, sound design, beer runners, bar flies, alt coin traders, musicians, software devs you name it!  Core team:  Eli Oberlander, John Robinson, Tony Capil, James Wilhelm, Sam Elbaz, Jesse S Koda, Matt Heck, George Gardner.  
Funding
*Check out the image gallery above for some of the perks!Full $28,000 allocation for producing the remaining seven (7) webisodes + revisions for pilot.  (We have most of webisode two filmed already!).  Low budget but we'll make it work!

$5,500 equipment upgrades: We've filmed with a combination of Sony FS5, RED Raven and Panasonic GH4.  For those that understand video production, it is kind of a pain in the ____ to match up footage recorded from different cameras. With proper funding we would switch over to full RED or Black Magic setups, purchasing camera bodies and sound equipment but renting lenses, lights and rigs other accessories.
$4,000+ insurance, permits, locations 
$8,000 Priority of resources will be applied towards wardrobe, props, set design and post production.   Sound mixing, proper color/grading and of course VFX to help boost our production value and creative sandbox!  Although our crew has been very creative and efficient with costs, practical effects can run a tab and same goes with sourcing high-quality VFX talent.  We also plan to get some really good indie electro-industrial artists to help score.
$2200-2500 goes to IndieGoGo fees and perks.
$1,500 towards some fundamental marketing material; we plan to have artists and designers like NYC's Ariel ZB (who did our beautiful poster art) create some comic style storyboarding and additional artwork!  
est. $6,500 goes toward feeding and providing some minimal pay for our very talented local cast and crew for what will easily be over 1+ full days of production.  That's about a total of $350-$375 per 8 hour day of filming including both cast/crew.  We pretty much work for shake-shack & beer !

The Impact
The support would help enhance our micro-budget project several fold by expanding our production sandbox, post production quality and quite frankly, some rations for our cast/crew!  We are resourceful and viciously dedicated to not wasting a dime outside of production.  We want to create a indie staple not just in the sub-genre of cyberpunk but something that can be enjoyed and shared by all science fiction fans.  
Risks & Challenges

For those that understand, like any creative endeavor there are always challenges in it's finality, meeting expectations etc.  But we are going about this project very pragmatically from the jump and are again fully committed to completing this mini series for the world to enjoy (or roast...)

Finishing eight entire episodes.  As you see, we have posted our initial webisode (pilot) and are ready to continue production to finish the series.  But the challenge is again, in budgets.
With your support we can ensure progress continues!

<h3>The Road Here</h3>
<p>Hey there. I'm Alyssa... a shy little Ravenclaw who is tremendously bombastic once you get to know me. Promise.</p>
<p>I am the creator and one of the Executive Producers of an apocalyptic-comedy web series called <i>Total Party Kill, </i>about a group of RPG players that livestream the first night of the apocalypse and then find themselves fighting for survival from the confines of a military-enforced quarantine.</p>
<p>My team and I are raising the money needed to finish shooting our first season.</p>
<p>TPK is a hell of a lot of fun (pun intended): there's action, adventure, romance, comedy, drama... it is fantastical while being grounded in human relationship and emotion. It's everything I've been striving to make since I left the walls of the little art college I attended in Philly and trekked out to the sunny streets of LA.</p>
<p>I'm openly queer, identifying as pansexual (and sort of dress like a 13-year-old kid in a snapback, ripped jeans, high tops, and a mix of leather jackets, plaid, and bomber coats. Man, I miss the 90s). I'm also a huge, I mean, HUGE, fangirl.</p>
<p>Exhibit A:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533000588/t2o3w8xosimxdw2bbq3i.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>--Ravenclaw snapback. The nerdiest nerd to ever nerd. </p>
<p>Fanfic? I write it.<br/>My first spec script was for an episode of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>. No, sorry, you can't read it - not because it was terrible (it was, I was like 14) but because I no longer have it (RIP <i>Buffy</i> episode).</p>
<p>I play RPGs. On a livestream. And I adore it.</p>
<p>Basically I wanted to make a show that combined all these things into one cheeky amalgamation of apocalyptic tumult. And thus, here we are, looking to raise the funds needed to finish the first season of TPK. </p>

<p>I could talk all day about how much this project means to me and how much it means that you're even here, scrolling down and reading these words. </p>
<p>I am a tempest of emotion. And those of you that know me, know how much I love tempestuous things.</p>
<p>TPK is queer positive and body positive, not only in front of the camera but behind it as well.</p>
<p>When was the first time you saw yourself represented in the media - whether a film or a show or a commercial, maybe a song... anywhere? Did it bring you a sense of peace? Of feeling seen and understood? Did it connect you to that character in a way you never felt before, and connect you with others that were a fan of that piece of entertainment? Representation <i>matters, </i>it can help us feel like someone out there understands us, like there are people like us, like we're a part of something.</p>
<p>Kat's a curvier character - and she gets to lead the charge, get the girl, and be a (flawed) hero while being curvy, queer, and kicking butt. Jamie gets to be nerdy and brainy and is celebrated for it. Stef and Lacie have the chance to play out the triumphs and tribulations of a long-term relationship in the midst of chaos and gloom and doom. Desiree is a soldier with a warm heart, an openness to this group of people she's known for a short amount of time - and she and Kat get to share some intimacies, fears, joys, and terrors. Brandon proves introverts have real, true power when faced with adversity. And Chase gets to show us all that even if you're a bit of a goof-ball, you can rise up to help save your friends when you need to.</p>

You can find them working a coat check, going on dinner dates to cover grocery costs, and turning their apartment into an escape room.

<strong>Romeo Ortiz</strong> is a Graduate from the first film based High School in the United States, The Cinema School (TCS) and alumni at The Ghetto Film (GFS). Born October 25th in Queens, New York, Romeo’s passion for film emerged before his 4 years at TCS.

Thanks to the unique, rigorous 8-month training from The Ghetto Film School his knowledge was extended even further in the art of filmmaking industry. At GFS Romeo took his first leap into his career in film when writing 2016, GFS Thesis project Genesis. Which was screened at the Paley Center For Media the following year. Romeo now leads with new profound confidence, independently and creatively crosses his comfort zone for the development and success of MAD Gothic Productions. </li></ul>

<h3>The pilot episode:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Above is the link where you may view the pilot episode of Faces In the Wasteland, which our production team made on a literal $0 budget. Our goal is to expand on this world with ten additional episodes, each episode between 15-20 mins focusing on a different individual and their life now in the aftermath of the apocalypse.</p>
<p>The series will be similarly influenced by various stories and forms of media such as The Road, The Last of Us, Fallout, and the first season of The Walking Dead. The production team behind it is a collection of both seasoned and new filmmakers employing the help of various actors across the state of Michigan to fill these roles, our goal to eventually have as diversified and unique of a cast as we can manage. This series is not only easily achievable, as you have seen with the pilot episode having been made for literally nothing, but we are able to finish and turn the series around in what we believe will be an extremely immediate amount of time as we have the majority of production prepared. We have what we feel is a unique collection of stories centered around various aspects of society and these would change in this fictitious world that we feel has not often been discussed before. Even the most minuscule of contributions will have such a great impact on our ability to see this through.</p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we are aiming for is $8,000. This $8,000 will fully cover all additional elements of production as well as increase our production value where we can begin to implement just under $1000 an episode in the series. And as you've seen, we are capable of delivering a more than competent product with literally no money whatsoever at the moment. These funds will be going solely into the production value of the series, which will include set building (marketplaces and towns), equipment rental (various lenses and improved sound equipment), and licensing and fees for arts supply their music. Our goal is just enough where we may still be making the series on a shoe string budget to give the series and appearance of gritty realness, but still simultaneously be able to take care of our cast and crew and provide viewers with an enjoyable and authentic labor of love.</p>
<p>We don't want to look at what we give back to someone for donating as a ""reward"", but as an abundant ""thank you"" with a gift for your aid. This includes digital copies, the chance to have a main character in the series be given your name (or a name of your choosing), or to even be in the series itself (and trust us, it would be more than just a meager ""walk on"" role).</p>
<p>Our plan is to make this series with whatever it is that we receive, so any and all amounts of donations we receive will still be put into the budget we do have for this project. The scope of the dream may just need to narrow some.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We will be pitching this series to various streaming platforms, but money is not our goal. The ability to share and tell these stories, that is what we are hoping most for the chance to do. So if the series, for example, is never acquired for streaming, then we will stream it for free ourselves so that the show may be seen. Our work may be cut out for us and it may pose as a greater challenge, but we won't stop until we can share this experience.</p>
<p>Various members of our production team have not only worked on their own series before, but also written, directed, and distributed feature films as well (some of which can currently be viewed on Amazon, OnDemand, etc.). We are by no means experts, but we aren't just simply getting our feet wet for the first time around.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are innumerable risks when taking on any production, but the most common seen among those who have worked on lower budget productions is often failure of completion. Often teams become discouraged and find themselves unable to meet their goals. As we have shown you with our pilot episode above, we have the ability to finish every single one of these written episodes, and we <strong>will </strong>finish Faces In the Wasteland, even amongst our various productions currently in the process of being finished. We will just merely have to find ways to be creative and circumvent any and all of our obstacles.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, word of mouth is more valuable than you can know. Have a friend who enjoys science fiction or a family members who always starts that ""if the world ended, what I would do is...""? Share this with them. Or tell us what WOULD peak your interest enough into donating, perhaps some stories or aspects of society and how they would change after the collapse of civilation. While the majority of the series is written, if we exceed our goal, we absolutely plan on expanding the universe of the story further. So feel free!</p>

<h3>How did 'Out to Lunch' start?</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Dylan Mask, i'm an actor in the city of Toronto and creator of the comedic Web Series 'Out to Lunch'. Two years ago I wrote episode 1 of the series to help keep me busy and focused while learning a new skill in between jobs. In order to reach your dream in this industry you must constantly be moving forward. Rather than sit around and wait for work I decided to create my own. My main objective with this series wasn't to become rich and famous but rather to create a series that everyone involved could be proud of and truly feel like they made a difference, while growing and learning at the same time.</p>
<p>I decided to self-fund the first 4 episodes in order to show future financial backers (YOU!) that this is more than just an idea. The response so far has been overwhelming, and I couldn't be more thankful to all those who have supported and shared the project thus far. </p>
<p>I've managed to have an amazing cast/crew who is passionate and dedicated to the project. As you can see in episodes 1-4 the quality gets better and better as we grow together as a team. In order to keep the momentum rolling and finish in a timely manner we need your help!</p>
<p>By contributing to this project you're helping make a dream come true, while giving local talent-both in front and behind the camera- the chance to be noticed in an industry where all it takes is that one chance. Help me bring you episodes 5-8 and be a HUGE part of the exciting conclusion of 'Out to Lunch'.    </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Crunching Numbers</h3>
<p>Everyone needs a good laugh, sometimes that comes at a cost. Here is a breakdown of where your money will go:</p>
<p><strong>GOAL: $5,000 (minimum goal)</strong></p>
<p><strong>$1,600- </strong><i>Do you see what I see?</i> This will cover the wage of the camera crew in order to give you the best possible picture for 'Out to Lunch'.</p>
<p><strong>$1,200- </strong><i>Can you hear us? </i>This money goes to paying our very talented Sound Technician, because what good is great visuals when you can't hear what's being said!?</p>
<p><strong>$800- </strong><i>Does this go here</i><i>? </i>These funds go towards paying our newest member to the team. The editor! All the cuts, graphics, and music play a huge role in bringing you a professional and cohesive finished product.</p>
<p><strong>$400- </strong><i>Does this dress make my butt look big? </i>This money goes towards hair, makeup, and wardrobe to make sure our cast looks presentable!</p>
<p><strong>$500- </strong><i>Who's watching? </i>All of this money goes towards promotion and festival submission so we can reach as big an audience as possible!</p>
<p><strong>$500- </strong><i>Are we there yet? I'm starving. </i>This last chunk will help with transportation for actors and crew as well as keep them fed while filming. As Shakespeare once said ""Doth not act good on an empty stomach.""</p>
<p><strong>Above &amp; Beyond:</strong></p>
<p>Now you may have noticed that none of that money goes to pay the actors. That's because the ENTIRE cast is volunteering their time to be a part of this project. That being said here is a quick breakdown of what happens if we surpass our goal or fall short:</p>
<p><strong>Surpass: </strong>Every dollar we raise above our goal will go directly back into the production. First up is our amazing cast! After they are compensated for the time dedicated we can focus more funds on festival submissions and promotion to help 'Out to Lunch' be seen worldwide!</p>
<p><strong>Fall Short: </strong>If we fall short of our goal we will use every cent we did manage to raise to continue production as far as we can. Once the money raised runs out we turn to bake sales, raffles, and bikini car washes to get the rest. *please note, nobody wants to see three grown men washing cars in bikinis.*</p>
<p><strong>PERKS:</strong></p>
<p>We've got some amazing ""Thank You!"" perks for you to claim based on the amount you decide to donate. Any amount is appreciated greatly, but for certain levels of donations you'll get a great gift that's personalized from US to YOU! It can be as simple as a shout-out on our social media pages or as big as a walk on role in the Finale! (some conditions apply on that last one).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Road Less Travelled </h3>
<p>'Out to Lunch' flirts with the run-time of a full length TV series (episode 1: 7 mins, episode 2-4: 10-12 mins). I did this intentionally because I wanted to create something that felt real to the audience. A series that would get you invested in the character and watch the story grow. It's risky because with a lower budget and the main outlet being online you really have to captivate your viewers right off the bat and then keep them engaged. That's especially hard to do in this genre.</p>
<p>Comedy is one of the-if not- toughest genres to write, execute, film, and edit. So many factors are taken into equation when creating one. Almost everyone can relate to being afraid of an axe wielding maniac, and almost everyone can find some form of connection in a love story. With comedy, you're hoping to connect with 50% of your audience. There is something special about being able to make someone laugh. For those few seconds they forget about what's going on around them and just live in that moment. </p>
<h3>Why 'Out to Lunch'?</h3>
<p>A lot of people ask how the series came to be called 'Out to Lunch'. Well the answer is simple. I needed a creative catchy name that would capture the essence of the show itself. The phrase ""Out to lunch..."" is used to describe someone who is: Unaware of or inattentive to present conditions. This relates directly to the main character Dylan Crawford. He lives in a world where negatives don't appear negative and the impossible seems extremely possible. The audience then attributes his personality to being ""out to lunch"" rather than ignorant, or naive. Although sometimes he can be the latter.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Kevin Jackson is a Writer, Director, Animator, Film Producer, and Educator.  Mr. Jackson founded his own production company Nivek Pro.  He has vowed to change the animation and film industries in Jamaica by championing various organizational committees such as Jamaica Animation Nation Network (JANN), Jamaica Design Associate (JDA), and Jamaica Film and Television Association (JAFTA) serving in various leadership roles for each.</p>
<p>Chevonnese Chevers Whyte is a Graphic Designer, Animator, Marketer, and Educator.  She has dedicated herself to make a positive change in Jamaica through her students and the production Abeeku and the maroons.  As the co-founder and marketing manager of Night Vision Media Ltd. it is her hope that Abeeku and the maroons will entertain, educate, and change how we feel about Jamaica.</p>
<p>Adrian Whyte is a Graphic Designer and Educator.  As the other co-founder of Night Vision Media Ltd. he supervises the development of the Abeeku and the maroons game.</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson conceived the story Abeeku and the maroons (originally The Maroons) and connected with Chevonnese Chevers Whyte to assist with producing it.  They recognized that Jamaican people are losing touch with our culture and with their common goal of making a positive change in Jamaica, decided that this production can be one such action to assist in that goal.  </p>
<p>Your assistance will help us to pay for much needed people and equipment to produce the series quickly.  This includes: 1 Graphic Designer; 1 Illustrator; 3 Animators; 1 Motion Graphics/ Video Editor; 8 Interns/ Students; and 1 Office &amp; Research Assistant (all Jamaican grown professionals).  We will also acquire equipment that will assist those professionals to complete their duties in a timely fashion.  If we are able to secure these people and purchase these equipment, we believe we can complete all three seasons within two years.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is aimed at promoting the Jamaican culture.  Bring back our patriotism.  Additionally, we intend to stimulate the Jamaican economy by educating our young people about animation so that eventually they can create their own projects.  Our paid interns can learn and earn as they are being taught about animation and gaining real hands on experience.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have been creating the first episode for a few years and can share why the project has taken us so long to produce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lack of talent.  Jamaica has always had animators but they were few.  It has been recently that there has been a drive to promote animation in Jamaica and so now there are various schools that are offering this course of study.  We are overcoming this problem as there are already students who have graduated from: various HEART institutions, at the CXC level, and coming soon are graduates at the Bachelors level.</li>
<li>Lack of the right talent.  Even though the talent existed we found that we needed to work with the right talent.  Over the years we have developed a hiring style that has worked for us and qualify the right talent to work with us and develop the project.</li>
<li>Money.  At the moment we wholly fund the project.  As we work, we donate money to our own project.  This really slows up the process in purchasing the right equipment, software, and paying people to contribute their talent.  With your help we can overcome that hurdle.</li>

Kevin Jackson is a Writer, Director, Animator, Film Producer, and Educator.  Mr. Jackson founded his own production company Nivek Pro.  He has vowed to change the animation and film industries in Jamaica by championing various organizational committees such as Jamaica Animation Nation Network (JANN), Jamaica Design Associate (JDA), and Jamaica Film and Television Association (JAFTA) serving in various leadership roles for each.
Chevonnese Chevers Whyte is a Graphic Designer, Animator, Marketer, and Educator.  She has dedicated herself to make a positive change in Jamaica through her students and the production Abeeku and the maroons.  As the co-founder and marketing manager of Night Vision Media Ltd. it is her hope that Abeeku and the maroons will entertain, educate, and change how we feel about Jamaica.
Adrian Whyte is a Graphic Designer and Educator.  As the other co-founder of Night Vision Media Ltd. he supervises the development of the Abeeku and the maroons game.
Mr. Jackson conceived the story Abeeku and the maroons (originally The Maroons) and connected with Chevonnese Chevers Whyte to assist with producing it.  They recognized that Jamaican people are losing touch with our culture and with their common goal of making a positive change in Jamaica, decided that this production can be one such action to assist in that goal.  
Your assistance will help us to pay for much needed people and equipment to produce the series quickly.  This includes: 1 Graphic Designer; 1 Illustrator; 3 Animators; 1 Motion Graphics/ Video Editor; 8 Interns/ Students; and 1 Office & Research Assistant (all Jamaican grown professionals).  We will also acquire equipment that will assist those professionals to complete their duties in a timely fashion.  If we are able to secure these people and purchase these equipment, we believe we can complete all three seasons within two years.

We have been creating the first episode for a few years and can share why the project has taken us so long to produce:

Lack of talent.  Jamaica has always had animators but they were few.  It has been recently that there has been a drive to promote animation in Jamaica and so now there are various schools that are offering this course of study.  We are overcoming this problem as there are already students who have graduated from: various HEART institutions, at the CXC level, and coming soon are graduates at the Bachelors level.

In this three-year development and production period, we have managed to finance 85% of these eight chapters. We’ve calculated that we need a minimum goal of $ 35’000 USD for the post-production and the distribution for all 8 chapters. If we get over this amount, we would be able to finish the series earlier with higher-quality work and spread it wider to the public with more marketing & distribution work. This project is unique in its kind, it is the first regional TV series filmed entirely in the city of Valparaíso by an independent company and a very young team. We believe that the series is one of the first expressions of a new generation that has the desire to live in fraternity, which for us is the heart of what Latin America represents: a vibrant culture full of optimism and joy of life. Thanks to the support of the National Television Council of Chile (CNTV), we have been able to film the first eight chapters, but we still need a final step to finish this first season and present it to the world. For this we need our global community to support us and most importantly we need to connect with you.  We want you to be part of the project. We have been searching for ways that you can participate in the creative process, for example, giving us your opinion of the first cut or putting your company logo as a presenter. Our rewards increase the range of participation and integration in the project and our artistic work. All the perks you find on our Indiegogo page are exclusively designed for you and only available during the campaign.NOTE: perks from $25 & up: all previous perks are inclusive, except personal hangouts$10 USD: Digital download of the offical Soundtracks of TDV.$25 USD: Early access to the final version chapter 1-8 (streaming online).$50 USD: Be creative: primal access to first cut chapter 1-8 (streaming online) and give your comments and ideas to the editors.$75 USD: Get the book of the Director ""Asumir la mirada de nuestro cine"" (Spanish, PDF version) + your photo in the credits.$100 USD: Skype hangout with the Director for one hour approx. + get the scripts of TDV (PDF version).$200 USD: Exclusive film guidance from the Director via Skype hangout: consulting of your own film project in three sessions of 1 hour approx.$500 USD: Join the Director and some actors at a VIP dinner party at a special place in Valparaíso (travel & lodging not included).$1’000 USD: You are the Producer of the series!

<h3>FREELANCERS with Bill Gentile</h3>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zr5ZwWrUD5E?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p>My name is Bill Gentile. I'm an independent journalist and documentary filmmaker teaching at American University in Washington, DC. I've been a journalist for the past 40 years -- and I am deeply concerned about the state and the perception of my craft.</p>
<p>I began in 1977 as reporter for the Mexico City News and correspondent for United Press International (UPI) based in Mexico City. I covered the 1979 Sandinista Revolution in Nicaragua. I spent two years as editor on UPI’s Foreign Desk in New York, then moved to Nicaragua and became Newsweek Magazine’s Contract Photographer for Latin America and the Caribbean. I covered the U.S.-backed Contra War in Nicaragua and the Salvadoran Civil War in the 1980s; the U.S. invasion of Panama; the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War and the subsequent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Here's my concern. In recent years mainstream media outlets have cut staff and closed bureaus around the world. Stepping into that void is a new generation of daring, determined and tech-savvy freelance correspondents searching for the truth that we consume every day.</p>
<p>But too many Americans believe that journalism is exclusively about commentators in air-conditioned studios debating current events. Journalism is more than that. Journalism begins on the ground, with dedicated professionals searching for truth.</p>
<p>I'm conducting this campaign to help fund a series of documentaries about freelancers to show the world who these independent journalist are, and how they send us information we need to make crucial decisions about our lives and the countries we live in. In an age when information is power, what can be more important?</p>
<p>But I’m thousands of dollars away from completing the pilot documentary, which is only the first of a global series. A contribution from you would allow me to finish this pilot, and head to Turkey to film Episode 2.</p>
<p>I can’t do any of this without your help. We're all in this together. And the stakes are so high.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My crowdfunding goal is $60,000. The documentary is now in what we call post-production. Editing, music, promotion. All of that, and more, still have to be done.</p>
<p>In return for your support, I'm offering a series of perks. These include personalized, signed copies of photographs from my book, Nicaragua, to actual copies of the book, to Skype sessions with me regarding projects you may be working on.</p>
<p>If this campaign does not reach its objective, I'll just have to dig deeper into my own credit cards to get the pilot documentary finished properly.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm not asking for <u>just</u> a contribution. I’m asking you to be part of a mission to help show the world who these freelance foreign correspondents are, how they do their work, and why they've chosen these lives so far away from the people and the places that they used to call home.</p>
<p>I've been making documentaries for some 20 years now, and this is not only the most ambitious, but also the most important. For me. For journalism. For everyone who sees this documentary.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This endeavor is not without risk. The series takes me -- and some of the assistants who help me -- to places where a lot of people don't want to go. And shouldn't go. I've been going to these places for a long time. As a freelance foreign correspondent, and later for United Press International and Newsweek magazine, I've covered conflict in Central America, the Caribbean, Iraq and Afghanistan. I've also worked across Africa and Asia.</p>

<h3>Hello Family,</h3>
<p>Many of you know me personally others we probably met at a music or entertainment event or even online. I'm Cassandra Bautista  aka Spice the creator of this fun project. This project is on behalf of everyone that has ever experienced heart break, betrayal, and the painful process of divorce. I recently graduated from film school and have educational degrees in various subjects such as law, ethnic studies, and American studies. I also have a background in radio, journalism, and event planning. </p>
<p>In addition to working to fund a docu-series on government housing projects I am currently a divorce party planner. I would love to bring a new comedic talk show to television that covers everything that touches on divorces, heart break, and relationships. My team and I want to not only laugh at the horror stories of dating, marriage, and separation but to capture the fun experience of planning divorce parties and showing the world that there is life after heart break.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project is important to me because if this tv pilot is successful ultimately an entire tv show will be aired and it would be the first television show that focuses on the career of a divorce party planner. It is also important  that this tv pilot is made because it is a show and career that brings smiles and excitement to many families that are saddened or even depressed due to a break up or divorce. Plus the show is also about redemption.  </p>
<p>Contributors your efforts  and backing help many individuals such as myself and my team fulfill our dreams of being a first time television show producer or crew member. You also help give a voice to many that usually feel like that they are alone dealing with a divorce or breakup. Your assistance  helps provide resources to these same populations such as guidance from a divorce attorney or tips from a child support expert. If all of the above does not touch your heart then maybe knowing that you can get a good laugh at people that remind you of one your dreaded  exs as they are blasted on our show . Still not interested then maybe entertainment and escapism is your thing. By funding this tv pilot you will be able to view exciting and luxurious destinations, fabulous performances, fascinating costumes, thrilling activities, and outrageous pranks trustingly this may spark your interest in being the wind beneath the wings of  this tv pilot.   </p>
<p>Our crew and cast needs funds to help secure talent, provide meals for guests and crew, get filming permits, pay for filming locations, pay for our film crew, pay for lighting,sound, editing, advertising, costumes, music, make up, travel and lodging expenses, and camera expenses. We need like 30,000 dollars to get our tv pilot started.But we want to start with the pre-production stage which requires 5,000 dollars.</p>
</div><div>
<p>We are excited that musicians, restaurant owners, business owners, entertainment executives and community leaders believe in our vision and are offering some of their products or services as rewards for our tv show's pilot backers. You can expect some social media shout outs, music cd's, Saucy Lips sauces, media consultant seminars, and other cool items.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contribution to this project helps support people of color, women, people with disabilities, the LGBT community have a presence on television, a platform that traditionally has been ran by wealthy white males.</p>
<p>Your contribution can help you advertise your company, build relationships with people in the tv, music, and film community, gain IMDB credits, producer credits, gain valuable guidance from entertainment leaders, support a local business, enjoy yummy food, take home autographed CD's and get unique perks.  </p>
<p>Your contribution has the potential to support the economy, make thousands of people internationally laugh, and make dreams come true. </p>
<p>I have received over 18 scholarships in college, have a trusted relationships with my community, surrounding community, and globally, and was hand picked by Ava Duvernay to work on <i>A Wrinkle In Time </i>a Walt Disney Studios films. I believe my education, work experience, and  my brilliant team that constantly excels combined with perseverance and  persistence will make this tv pilot successful.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have our tv pilot planned out however, most of us have limited budgets, some of us are single parents, live in California a state where the cost of living is bananas, so we still struggle with finances. The biggest hurdle we have with this project is funding. That is why we are reaching out to backers. On our end we plan to invest some of our own funds, resources, time, and plan fundraising activities such as single events. If everyone contributes at least a dollar you are moving this project one step closer to our goal. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Kandra King.  I've been an actress in the entertainment business for over 20 years.  I wanted to produce shows that the entire family could watch together.  I wanted them to be humorous, intriguing, unique and safe entertainment for the whole family.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have worked tirelessly on this show for 2 years.  I spent a full year in pre-production writing and creating segments that I thought would be special and irresistible for viewers.  So, it actually has been 3 years.</p>
<p>I shot a sizzle reel for this show in October, 2018 and it has been received with enthusiasm and open-arms.  I have a contract that will put this show into millions of homes in 2019.  However, I need your support to raise the funds to shoot, edit and complete the next episodes, so I can deliver finished product to my Network Distributor.  They need to have finished episodes to deliver to all their Networks Nationwide, as well as their streaming partners.  I feel this is an uplifting show,  I hope you agree.  The world needs good, inspirational TV shows and Getaway To Paradise fulfills that need.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You will be part of creating something magical that you can be proud to share with your friends, family and business associates.</p>
<p>The positive impact and the chance to travel vicariously to exotic locations is a real treat for everyone.  And there is a lot of funny segments. Laughter heals the heart and the bones.</p>
<p>5% of all proceeds will go to CARRY, the non-profit I've been blessed to be part of since its inception.  As a board member, I can tell you that we are helping transform the lives of At-Risk and Foster youth in Los Angeles.  I believe this is a worthy proposition. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk will be that the campaign doesn't raise the funds to produce and deliver the next episodes.  Then you would just have the perks.  I do not believe there is any chance of this.  The hardest part is behind us and the TV channels really LOVE this show and are excited to promote and air it on their Network.  This show is God-Inspired.  I am so grateful for your support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You do NOT have to contribute financially to be a huge support.  If you are just willing to SHARE this campaign, you are being a conduit to its success.  You can share this on your social media pages.  Please check out the Indiegogo share tools and make some noise!  Thank you.  I'm incredibly appreciative.  When it airs, you can Shout, ""Hey, I helped make that happen!""</p>

<p><strong>Amortal</strong> is a series following the first clinical test subjects undergoing full nanite conversion. A procedure that over the course of 7 months will convert their entire bodies from organic cells to synthetic nanites, rendering them immortal.</p>
<p>Brought face to face with the physical and psychological effects, the test subjects begin to realize the true cost of becoming <strong>Amortal</strong>. For them, everything is a trade.</p>
<p><strong>Amortal</strong> is the follow up series to the successful Spiderclown project ""Image Killer,"" taking a grounded approach to science fiction. This is a story that we feel will connect with viewers in a way they haven't seen before by illuminating exactly what a person would give up by becoming immortal.</p>

<p>The <strong>Amortal</strong> program was created by Coil Industries, a titan biotech firm that pioneered synthetic organ transplants. While they've helped save countless lives, the company has recently come under scrutiny for claims that they have developed a cure for age and disease, effectively patenting immortality.</p>

</div></div>","Amortal is a series following the first clinical test subjects undergoing full nanite conversion. A procedure that over the course of 7 months will convert their entire bodies from organic cells to synthetic nanites, rendering them immortal.
Brought face to face with the physical and psychological effects, the test subjects begin to realize the true cost of becoming Amortal. For them, everything is a trade.
Amortal is the follow up series to the successful Spiderclown project ""Image Killer,"" taking a grounded approach to science fiction. This is a story that we feel will connect with viewers in a way they haven't seen before by illuminating exactly what a person would give up by becoming immortal.


The Amortal program was created by Coil Industries, a titan biotech firm that pioneered synthetic organ transplants. While they've helped save countless lives, the company has recently come under scrutiny for claims that they have developed a cure for age and disease, effectively patenting immortality.
In light of the backlash from religious and naturalist fanatics, Coil Industries has commissioned this documentary to follow two different subjects and illustrate the full benefits of the Amortal program.
Led by scientist and researcher Dr. Ian Harrow, the Amortal program has accelerated their trial period, and exudes full confidence in their success, flaunting the program with pomp and circumstance.

<h3>Iight, so boom…</h3>
<p>After a devastating break-up, Zoe moves in with her best friend Hazel and tries to focus on doing something with the rest of her 20’s. Hazel, starting her pivotal junior year in college, finds it hard balancing her impeccable GPA, staying on track to an early MBA, getting out of the friend zone with long-time crush, and still finding time to match Zoe’s carefree energy. Hazel suggests to Zoe to start acting, so she could put her dramatics to use.</p>
<p>Now, my girl Zoe gets a little triggered around strangers and whatnot, but actors are the perfect kinda crazy to make her feel right at home. Lead by eccentric acting teacher, Brenda Hunter, Zoe allows herself to open up and deal with her past trauma and move forward in a healthier way. Zoe even meets this dope ass chick, Leah, but Hazel starts to feel left out of their newfound bond. All in all, when struggles get too hard for you to take on by yourself, you can always count on your real friends to help get you through them.</p>
<h3>Unapologetically Dope…</h3>
<p>“Basic Acting” is for ladies of color who struggle with finding their identity in a world that doesn’t let them freely express their individuality and cope with years of trauma. This series will address female friendship dynamics, exploring your sexuality, dealing with mental health concerns (especially as a woman of color), and those wavering times in your twenties when you can’t seem to find the ground under your feet. Now is the time to present the lives and stories that haven’t been represented in mainstream entertainment yet.</p>
<h3>Here's the Plan...</h3>
<p>The scripts are written, and the cast and crew are coming together. We want to get started as soon as possible while everyone is still available. So here is the proposed timeline for the project.</p>
<p>Pre-Production: Completed</p>
<p>Production: January – March 2019</p>
<p>Post-Production: January- March 2019</p>
<p>Promotions: early March 2019</p>
<p>Premiere: March 22, 2019</p>
<p>Although there may be slight hiccups in the schedule as life doesn't always go as planned, the Basic Acting crew is going to work hard to bring you the best production possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Will You Be My Producer?</h3>
<p>What this project needs more than anything is positive vibes. This is my directorial debut, and I couldn’t be more excited to direct something that I’ve also written. I have gathered a team of well-equipped individuals that I have all the confidence in to make this project successful. I’ll be honest, we need funds a teeeeeensy bit more than positive vibes alone. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our starting goal is $7,500. With that money we’ll be able to get proper equipment and software, props and wardrobe, and secure studio space. The chart below breaks down the budget, so you can see where your money will go in production.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544681195/nm9zwqm2mcd1strhge3b.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>On top of the allocation in our production, you get some great perks as a fan to Basic Acting! You’ll see those to the right of you in more detail. If the starting goal is exceeded, our next goal will be $15,000. With the additional funds, we'll be able to get even better equipment, popping props, and even better perks for our Top Contributors. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the goal is not met, we will produce as much of the series as possible. If we can make 50%, we’ll be able to get equipment and make it work!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While we’re waiting for some funding, have fun with the cast and crew on Instagram!</p>
<h3>So You’re the Broke Friend? We can Relate.</h3>
<p>We are looking to get any help that we can, so if money isn’t what you can contribute there are plenty other ways you can help make “Basic Acting” a big success:</p>

<li>I hope that everyone will help get the conversation started on social media sharing the series on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter.</li>

</div></div>","Iight, so boom…
After a devastating break-up, Zoe moves in with her best friend Hazel and tries to focus on doing something with the rest of her 20’s. Hazel, starting her pivotal junior year in college, finds it hard balancing her impeccable GPA, staying on track to an early MBA, getting out of the friend zone with long-time crush, and still finding time to match Zoe’s carefree energy. Hazel suggests to Zoe to start acting, so she could put her dramatics to use.
Now, my girl Zoe gets a little triggered around strangers and whatnot, but actors are the perfect kinda crazy to make her feel right at home. Lead by eccentric acting teacher, Brenda Hunter, Zoe allows herself to open up and deal with her past trauma and move forward in a healthier way. Zoe even meets this dope ass chick, Leah, but Hazel starts to feel left out of their newfound bond. All in all, when struggles get too hard for you to take on by yourself, you can always count on your real friends to help get you through them.
Unapologetically Dope…
“Basic Acting” is for ladies of color who struggle with finding their identity in a world that doesn’t let them freely express their individuality and cope with years of trauma. This series will address female friendship dynamics, exploring your sexuality, dealing with mental health concerns (especially as a woman of color), and those wavering times in your twenties when you can’t seem to find the ground under your feet. Now is the time to present the lives and stories that haven’t been represented in mainstream entertainment yet.
Here's the Plan...
The scripts are written, and the cast and crew are coming together. We want to get started as soon as possible while everyone is still available. So here is the proposed timeline for the project.
Pre-Production: Completed
Production: January – March 2019
Post-Production: January- March 2019
Promotions: early March 2019
Premiere: March 22, 2019
Although there may be slight hiccups in the schedule as life doesn't always go as planned, the Basic Acting crew is going to work hard to bring you the best production possible.
 
Will You Be My Producer?
What this project needs more than anything is positive vibes. This is my directorial debut, and I couldn’t be more excited to direct something that I’ve also written. I have gathered a team of well-equipped individuals that I have all the confidence in to make this project successful. I’ll be honest, we need funds a teeeeeensy bit more than positive vibes alone. 
 
Our starting goal is $7,500. With that money we’ll be able to get proper equipment and software, props and wardrobe, and secure studio space. The chart below breaks down the budget, so you can see where your money will go in production.
 

 
On top of the allocation in our production, you get some great perks as a fan to Basic Acting! You’ll see those to the right of you in more detail. If the starting goal is exceeded, our next goal will be $15,000. With the additional funds, we'll be able to get even better equipment, popping props, and even better perks for our Top Contributors. 
 
If the goal is not met, we will produce as much of the series as possible. If we can make 50%, we’ll be able to get equipment and make it work!
 
While we’re waiting for some funding, have fun with the cast and crew on Instagram!
So You’re the Broke Friend? We can Relate.
We are looking to get any help that we can, so if money isn’t what you can contribute there are plenty other ways you can help make “Basic Acting” a big success:

I hope that everyone will help get the conversation started on social media sharing the series on YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter.

<h3>Here's the Deal</h3>
<p>I've been writing, directing and producing documentary television for close to twenty years. I've been nominated for some awards. A News and Documentary Emmy, a Daytime Emmy, The KASHISH Mumbai International Queer Film Festival (no I did not attend the award ceremony) the Prix SACD from the Avignon Film Festival and an NAACP Image Award. </p>
<p>I was an actor originally before I moved behind the camera. While it has been great fun over the last couple of decades to create innovative documentary programming for outlets such as National Geographic, Discovery, OWN, Showtime and other channels, I really miss working with actors.</p>
<p>With this new project I am realizing that dream. I've assembled a crack team of professionals that are helping me to produce what I think will be a killer hour of TV. Camera people, hair and makeup folks, the actors, even the sound guys are enjoying themselves. Everyone has pitched in to contribute their best to the show. A lot of them are people I have worked with over the years here in Los Angeles. Talented group.</p>
<p>The pilot describes the day to day experiences of a small family living in Los Angeles: A single mother with two sons, one black, one white, one of them adopted and one of them just getting out of prison. It's an intimate look at a slightly non-traditional family. It'll be a crackling good story I promise you that.</p>
<p>With your help, if we pull this off I think we can make an end run around some of the Hollywood gatekeepers and create a TV series that takes a deeper look at the way we live our lives now. Okay, that might be a bit grand, but I DO believe this show has something to say about the current mood in our country. And is saying it in a fresh and provocative fashion. Its gonna be a great ride.</p>
<p>I think we can sell it for sure.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Join Us</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise another 16,000.00 dollars to defray what I am putting up for the project myself. Like I said in my video pitch, my ambition has outstripped my bank account. You start off thinking you can do this for free, that for just a little, and the other thing for a bit more. Then you start adding on collaborators - camera people, actors and so on - and they all have ideas and they all want to make it ""really look good"" and all of a sudden you think...  crap, I'm gonna need more money to finish this thing. </p>
<p>Here's where the money goes. Probably about eight grand would help out on the salaries for some of the crew. And then I've got a couple of big set pieces in the show that require some car shooting and more specialized filming. This kind of stuff takes more money than the scenes I am shooting in my house. (Note to self: Maybe don't do that again...) Plus there is color correction in post production, sound editing, and music. </p>
<p>Bottom line is I am going to finish this thing by hook or crook but it would be a lot easier if I had some contributors join me along the way.</p>
<p>Second bottom line: I really don't know if this show will sell. No one ever does. But over my many years in this business you start to build up some well, instincts, shall we say. And my instincts tell me that there is something here. Actors have wanted to participate, crew members, my colleagues have been especially encouraging - there might be a diamond in the rough here. </p>
<p>Join me. There is a selfish side to all these crowdfunding projects, let's face it, the guy getting the most out of this project is probably me. But I really believe that when we all work together, pulling the boat in the same direction - good stuff happens for everyone on board. Which is kind of the theme of the show actually... </p>

<h3>Long, long ago...</h3>
<p>There was a time, decades ago, when you could gather in front of your television with your entire family to watch a comedian and <strong>everyone </strong>had a great time. You could sit with your mom and dad and kid sister (and even your Grandma) and enjoy an entire evening of laughter without once hearing something dirty or embarrassing. </p>
<p>Comedy like that was smart. You had to be good...and quick...and clean. It was tough to do but worth it. Everybody talks about how those guys were giants in the industry.</p>
<p>We call those days The Good Old Days. We want these days to be The Good Old Days too. </p>
<p>Allow us to introduce ourselves: we are The Fidgets, an improv comedy troupe that has been performing family friendly comedy across the country since 2007. </p>
<p><strong>John D Hollingsworth </strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541121750/wzlduvntnniqdqlt2mfn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>“I’ve been performing comedy all my life—even ask my mom. I learned short form improv in British Columbia at Trinity Western University and have been on stage in <strong>Nashville, Toronto, Charlottetown, Atlanta, London, LA </strong>and all points in between. </p>
<p>I want our comedy to be so good that no one even realizes it’s family friendly until the show is done. ""</p>
<p><b>Chris Reid</b></p>

<p>""I got really <strong>into</strong> comedy in high school.</p>
<p>I love making people laugh. I love working with these two guys, jumping onto the stage in front of hundreds (or thousands) of people that we don't know, getting their ideas and turning them into really awesome entertainment. That's a great legacy.""</p>

<p>""I was more of an actor than a comedian. A family pastor as well. Then I met John and, like everyone else says, 'it was all down hill from there.’</p>
<p>We started performing locally, then we started touring. It seemed like there was a huge vacuum in the world of entertainment--people were hungry for <strong>guilt-free laughter</strong>. </p>
<p>I know it's been a good night when we can provide that--when we can make everyone from kids to seniors have a great night of laughing together. <strong>That kind of thing is hard to find anymore</strong>.""</p>
<p><strong>When you contribute...</strong></p>
<p>When you team up with The Fidgets, you'll be bringing amazing family friendly comedy into the world. We have been performing since 2007 but we don't have any hi def footage. You know, the kind you would need for a DVD, download or Netflix series? (Before you ask---no, we haven't been approached by Netflix but it's always good to be prepared.)</p>
<p>We are going to bring a professional film crew with us during our <strong>Speak No Evil</strong> tour in the spring of 2019. Lots of cameras, mics...um...sound checks...helicopters...etc. And all of this stuff costs money. Plus we have to feed the crew too. And put them up in hotels wherever we travel.</p>
<p><strong>But the end result</strong> will be amazing footage of our tour across Canada. Then we edit that footage into segments made for TV specials, DVDs, downloads and YouTube clips. (And pass out some pretty cool swag along the way!)</p>
<p>You have the opportunity, right now, to say: ""I was a part of that! I remember when they were just starting out and I gave them the boost they needed.""</p>
<p>We appreciate you and we need your help. Good, clean comedy is one donation away and every donation helps.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To produce the high quality show we want (and avoid the ""cheesy family comedy"" look) we have a budget of $11,000 CDN. This includes flight and accommodations for our crew when our <strong>Speak No Evil Tour</strong> starts in British Columbia in February 2019. We will be performing at the Vernon Performing Arts Centre along with 5 other stops along the way until April, 2019. </p>
<p>Not every venue will be perfect so we want to get as much footage as possible, at as many performances as possible to create the best product possible. </p>
<p>We want to have fun through this entire fundraising journey so we created some perks that will let you know how much we love you! They include credit in our videos, donor-exclusive bling--even performances for you and/or a company/charity you designate. </p>
<p>Join us for this adventure, won't you? </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project won't be easy. There are all sorts of logistical challenges to overcome when one wants to move a team of people and expensive equipment across the country. Not all venues are created equal. Some will require <strong>a lot of work</strong> to get the type of content that a streaming service such as Pureflix or Amazon Prime would use. </p>
<p>And if we don't reach our $11,000 budget, we will adjust our budget accordingly in order to make the most of the donations you provide. (But seriously, are your kids really going to need a college education?)</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div></div>","Long, long ago...
There was a time, decades ago, when you could gather in front of your television with your entire family to watch a comedian and everyone had a great time. You could sit with your mom and dad and kid sister (and even your Grandma) and enjoy an entire evening of laughter without once hearing something dirty or embarrassing. 
Comedy like that was smart. You had to be good...and quick...and clean. It was tough to do but worth it. Everybody talks about how those guys were giants in the industry.
We call those days The Good Old Days. We want these days to be The Good Old Days too. 
Allow us to introduce ourselves: we are The Fidgets, an improv comedy troupe that has been performing family friendly comedy across the country since 2007. 
John D Hollingsworth 
“I’ve been performing comedy all my life—even ask my mom. I learned short form improv in British Columbia at Trinity Western University and have been on stage in Nashville, Toronto, Charlottetown, Atlanta, London, LA and all points in between. 
I want our comedy to be so good that no one even realizes it’s family friendly until the show is done. ""
Chris Reid
 
""I got really into comedy in high school.
I love making people laugh. I love working with these two guys, jumping onto the stage in front of hundreds (or thousands) of people that we don't know, getting their ideas and turning them into really awesome entertainment. That's a great legacy.""
Dave Lane

""I was more of an actor than a comedian. A family pastor as well. Then I met John and, like everyone else says, 'it was all down hill from there.’
We started performing locally, then we started touring. It seemed like there was a huge vacuum in the world of entertainment--people were hungry for guilt-free laughter. 
I know it's been a good night when we can provide that--when we can make everyone from kids to seniors have a great night of laughing together. That kind of thing is hard to find anymore.""
When you contribute...
When you team up with The Fidgets, you'll be bringing amazing family friendly comedy into the world. We have been performing since 2007 but we don't have any hi def footage. You know, the kind you would need for a DVD, download or Netflix series? (Before you ask---no, we haven't been approached by Netflix but it's always good to be prepared.)
We are going to bring a professional film crew with us during our Speak No Evil tour in the spring of 2019. Lots of cameras, mics...um...sound checks...helicopters...etc. And all of this stuff costs money. Plus we have to feed the crew too. And put them up in hotels wherever we travel.
But the end result will be amazing footage of our tour across Canada. Then we edit that footage into segments made for TV specials, DVDs, downloads and YouTube clips. (And pass out some pretty cool swag along the way!)
You have the opportunity, right now, to say: ""I was a part of that! I remember when they were just starting out and I gave them the boost they needed.""
We appreciate you and we need your help. Good, clean comedy is one donation away and every donation helps.

What We Need & What You Get
To produce the high quality show we want (and avoid the ""cheesy family comedy"" look) we have a budget of $11,000 CDN. This includes flight and accommodations for our crew when our Speak No Evil Tour starts in British Columbia in February 2019. We will be performing at the Vernon Performing Arts Centre along with 5 other stops along the way until April, 2019. 
Not every venue will be perfect so we want to get as much footage as possible, at as many performances as possible to create the best product possible. 
We want to have fun through this entire fundraising journey so we created some perks that will let you know how much we love you! They include credit in our videos, donor-exclusive bling--even performances for you and/or a company/charity you designate. 
Join us for this adventure, won't you? 
 

Risks & Challenges
This project won't be easy. There are all sorts of logistical challenges to overcome when one wants to move a team of people and expensive equipment across the country. Not all venues are created equal. Some will require a lot of work to get the type of content that a streaming service such as Pureflix or Amazon Prime would use. 
And if we don't reach our $11,000 budget, we will adjust our budget accordingly in order to make the most of the donations you provide. (But seriously, are your kids really going to need a college education?)

<h3><strong>WHO IS <i>AL JO</i> AND WHY IS HE GARDENING IN QUARANTINE?</strong></h3>
<p>Let’s be honest… finding Serenity and Mental Peace has been challenging during the Covid-19 pandemic. I’ve been blessed to be able to work from home since things shut down in March 2020, but when Spring rolled around and I realized this virus wasn’t going away any time soon... anxiety kicked in. I, aL Jo, WASN’T HAVING IT! Bored of being cooped up in the same house and unable to venture out without feeling like I was putting myself at risk, I decided to devote my free time to Gardening. Unexpectedly, this 30-minute-a-day hobby quickly transformed into something much greater. Gardening not only filled my stomach, but it filled my spirit with passion and became a source of therapy during such a grim time in our lives.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608938027/irrfulb1p2kvfryezxnm.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now, I want to pay it forward. The result is a Web Series about making the most out of the little we have. My goal is to inform and inspire during a time of uncertainty and anxiety. Whether you have a massive backyard or just a window in a small apartment, you can grow your own organic food and take control of your diet at a fraction of what you’d pay at the grocery store!</p>
</div><div>
<h2><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES</strong></h2>
<p>“<strong>aLJo’s Quarantine Gardening</strong>” will be a 10-12 episode vlog-style web series set in Growing Zone 6 - New Jersey. I was so inspired by my gardening journey and the impact sharing it can have, that I’ve already shot over 100 hours of footage. Each episode will be dedicated to a different fruit/vegetable or DIY project that walks you through what I’m growing and the process involved. Episodes will include: gardening tips, tutorials, timelapses, cooking montages (with tasty recipes for those looking for new ideas and others who can’t stand the taste of veggies), how to navigate obstacles, and much more!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608885221/scpyvlx0lssmcvvmcrxa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By sharing the knowledge I’ve acquired during my quarantine gardening journey, challenges I’ve faced along the way, and visible evidence of success, this web series will prove that anyone can grow a green thumb, no matter how many times you’ve failed or if you’ve never even gardened before. “<strong>aLJo’s Quarantine Gardening</strong>” will premiere in the Spring of 2021 to align with the growing season and to provide a resource to inspire you to garden along with me!</p>
<p>This is more than a fun web series hoping to go viral – this is the start of a home gardening movement.</p>

<h3><strong>THIS IS MORE THAN JUST A SERIES – <i>IT’S A MOVEMENT</i>!</strong></h3>
<p>The mission of “<strong>aLJo’s Quarantine Gardening</strong>” upon release is to show how easy it is to grow your own food, regardless of where you live. I debunk the “but I don’t have space to grow anything!” myth and show that you don’t need an entire farm - you can grow vegetables right from a balcony or window and use recyclable food/beverage containers as pots/planters! My Web Series will spread the infectious passion I have for gardening and provide knowledge to create your own garden from home.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608886490/tsnegx3cc0xz1awcadxa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u>BUT, This web series goes beyond these 10-12 episodes</u>. “<strong>aLJo’s Quarantine Gardening</strong>” is the first initiative of many in accomplishing my long-term goal of inspiring communities that can greatly benefit from gardening. With your help, I will start the overarching brand “<strong>aLJo Gardening</strong>”, with <u><strong>3 specific goals in mind</strong></u>:</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, I want to help others feel uplifted by sharing how fun, physically rewarding, and mentally gratifying gardening can be. I know 2020 has been extremely difficult and the uncertainty of these times has ignited anxiety and depression for many, including myself. When you grow your own food, you are quite literally bringing something to life. This feeling of accomplishment is extremely gratifying. The act of growing, caring, and harvesting is therapeutic in of itself, and has worked wonders for bringing peace of mind.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608885351/zwdzxak215zwsircr5qq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, as a person of color, I want to raise awareness of underserved communities and provide a solution to bring healthy, nutritious food options to our communities. All across the country, especially in urban areas, many minorities live in “<a href=""https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/what-are-food-deserts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Food Deserts</a>” where access to fresh, affordable produce is either extremely limited or virtually nonexistent.  Because of this, many minority communities are left with a small variety of low-quality veggies and fruits or have to turn to cheaper unhealthy food options due to lack of funds. This pandemic and resulting mass unemployment has only worsened this problem, with Covid hitting black and brown communities the hardest. According to Feeding America, <a href=""https://www.feedingamerica.org/research/coronavirus-hunger-research"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">food insecurity</a> has reached a level we haven’t seen since the Great Depression. <strong>To offset this</strong>, I want to give my fellow people of color the inspiration and tools to grow their own food, start a community garden, and share knowledge amongst each other. Home gardening is an affordable and empowering way to bring better eating options to families suffering from food insecurity and families in Food Deserts, uplifting our communities for generations to come!</p>

<p><strong>Third</strong>, I want to share that any person of any age, race, location, and background can and should garden! As a young Black man, I aim to bust stereotypes that gardening is “soft” or “feminine”. There is nothing that shows strength more than being able to provide healthy food for yourself and your family. With gardening comes the satisfaction of ownership. You are in control of what you're eating and know where it's coming from. Gardening is rewarding and fulfilling for people of all walks of life - and as a Black man I am living proof of that!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608889060/j205qjljfrvlhwlyxzp8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3><strong>I CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT YOUR HELP</strong></h3>
<p>I'm not exaggerating when I tell you I have never been so passionate about a project in my life. I truly believe in the power “<strong>aLJo’s Quarantine Gardening</strong>” has to uplift, inspire, and empower. But the truth is,<strong> </strong><u>I can’t do it alone</u>. I want this project to be <strong>BY US</strong> and our communities, <strong>not just my personal passion project</strong>. I want this to be a joint effort - to grow a community that inspires each other and eats our own delicious home-grown food <strong>TOGETHER</strong>. <strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608885785/wpi0yyxkpprmzeh2m9zs.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>I have poured an abundance of my own time, energy, and money into this project so far to get the gears in motion. <u>BUT</u>, If I want it to be of the absolute best quality and have the best chance to touch the lives of millions, I need help. I've put together a trusted best-in-class team to help me with post-production, strategy, and marketing. <strong>COSTS</strong> for this project include video editing, color correction, graphic and motion design, music licensing and sound mixing, digital marketing, social media management, website creation, and more. See below for a cost breakdown of launching this Web Series:</p>

<p>This web series cannot reach its full potential without some help. And that’s where you come in. Every dollar you give goes directly toward making this dream a reality. <strong>Every donation, no matter how small or big, holds power</strong>. I understand this is an uncertain, financially-difficult time and that the pandemic has been hard on many. This is why I'm calling for assistance. I'm providing the up-front cost and have already been investing in this project… but at the end of the day, every bit helps to make this happen on a bigger scale! Please know that your donation is appreciated beyond words and will play a direct role in sending my message to the world and providing people with skills they will have for life.

</div></div>","MEET THE LADS:

Callum - a care free guy with a care free life. Callum knows what he is, and he just wants to ride out his younger years in style. Sex, booze and the love for the sesh, he just wants everyone, society and responsibility to fuck off and leave him to it.

Isobel (Izzie) - Izzie lives her life the way she see fits. She is at one with God but she makes the rules that determine her life path. God forgives, so she will sin when she can. After a night of tedious sex with Callum and the hullabaloo that follows, Izzie can’t help but be attracted to the man who can’t remember if he wraps his willy before the silly, but given her divine judgement, this can only be a road that will lead to good things.

Rene - you know the guy you just feel sorry for not having a ledge in life? That’s Rene. He doesn’t know what the fuck he is doing, all he knows is he wants to do anything - and I mean anything. Finding his place in life will be hard, especially because of his stepsister Aiobheann...

Aiobheann - Rene’s step sister. We don’t know a lot about her past,  but she’ll jump on Rene’s bandwagon at any moment. Living to survive, meal after borrowed meal, couch after mates floor, like Rene she is just trying to find out what she is in the realm of things.  She’s just not that bothered about when or how she gets there.

Danny - The neighbour with a wanking problem. That is having one, and being a bit of a wanker himself. This mysterious downstairs neighbour keeps out of the way until he makes his problems yours. The only thing we know about him for sure is that he loves Rene. So much so that we don’t know what he will do to get a piece of him.

Jamie - The brute landlord who’s never satisfied with a fight until he gets his c*nt kicked in. Love him or hate him, he will get all about your business, begging for his next fight while at the same time trying to run the main business of being a landlord to multiple tenants. Just how far can these bunch of 20 somethings push Jamie to the point of breaking?

What We Need & What You Get

We have completed principal photography for the pilot episode and are looking to raise finishing funds to help with post production costs such as editing, advertising, distribution and of course...the all important episode 2!

<p>OUR PROJECT</p>
<p>No Rest For The Wicked is a horror thriller series about a young man plagued by the ghosts of his past, returning to hometown where a serial killer ran loose, Kit reconnects with friends and family. Unfortunately his return sparks a new series of killings that patterns the previous Ripper. In order to survive they must uncover the secrets and mysteries of this small town while they are picked off one by one. </p>
<p>ABOUT US AND WHO WE ARE </p>
<p>Still tuning in? Awesome! Glad to still have you here. Little bit of background on who we are, we're a writing duo. Kenneth &amp; James, originally from New York, we met in college, and showed an equal passion in horror films. </p>
<p>What we have here is a lovely horror story, that we all love, which will feature, violence, strong language, adult content and the occasional comedy relief. True it is a horror story, but it is not so much about the people of the town but more so about the dark secrets lurking in the under belly of this town.</p>
<p>But what is horror nowadays? We’ve seen it all from, zombies, aliens, serial killers, vampires, werewolves and killer ghost girls. The purpose of this show is to attempt to break the bounds of those stereotypes and to not necessarily come up with something new, but more so, something interesting.</p>
<p>Our main goal is to take the concept of “Scream” and “Halloween” and sort of blend both those incredible stories, minus the ending into something spectacular. We want to take that movie theater fear, that was on the big screen and introduce that on the small screen. Is it original? Not so much. Creative? We think so, but only time will tell on that front.</p>
<p>We’re writing this show for the inner horror movie geek that resides inside of us. We’re writing this with the intention to show the audiences a sort of mini horror film once a week. We’re also writing this because we want to reintroduce the world to actual horror, and not the torture porn the audiences have come to know nowadays.</p>
<p>Let’s be honest here the horror genre is a dying genre. The tumor is growing, and it’s just waiting for two things, someone to come put a bullet in it’s head, and finally put it out it’s misery or for some lucky bastard to come on by and give it new breath of life.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>Your contributions will enable us to cover the bulk of production and post-production costs for our pilot, such as PPE for Covid safety, meals, costumes, props, set design elements, shooting permits, sound mixing, and special effects. We value your contributions highly, which is we are offering cool perks like, Executive Producer, A signed script from the cast and crew, Producer, and an invitation to the first two episode premiere. And many, many more fun perks!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>OUR PLAN AND ULTIMATE GOAL!</p>
<p>We are currently in pre-production. Production is slated to start in the spring/summer. We aim to finish post-production by the fall, at which point we will screen the finished pilot at our Virtual Premiere Party (see perks).</p>
<p>Next, we will prepare to pitch the series to buyers, with an eye on streaming platforms. If we don't successfully sell our series in 2021, our plan is to enter our pilot into TV festivals like SeriesFest and Catalyst Content Festival, as well as the episodic categories of festivals like Sundance, TIFF, SXSW, and Tribeca, to help it pick up the necessary steam to catch a different buyer's eye or help us finance, shoot, and release the entire No Rest For The Wicked series ourselves.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>If you're interested in No Rest For The Wicked but can't financially contribute at this time, you can still help us by getting the word out; just use Indiegogo's social media share tools, follow us on twitter @trinityproductions, or tell a friend about our campaign.</p>
<p>With every episode also, one or more main character will unfortunately be killed off in a horrific fashion until the finale when there is only one left standing.</p>
<p>So yes, this is basically like a 15-hour horror film about life, about trauma, about love and loss, and some heartbreak, but hopefully you’ll enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and may the force be with you.</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Dreamers' whatlist?</span></h3>
<p>Set in the US in 2004, Dreamers' Playlist Set 1 follows two brothers' inheritance of mysterious spiritual power - chasing their dreams and blazing the path into a new era.</p>
<p>For 26 23-minute installments, the classic Shonen Jump-style formula of character progression through punching (One Piece, My Hero Academia) is remixed into an original series commenting on the nature of power and coming-of-age Black masculinity.</p>
<p>The big fighting tournaments, rivalries, &amp; special moves we know and love are all here, but the story at play goes far deeper than simple homage.

<h3>Like nothing we've ever seen</h3>
<p>After spending decades as a more niche product, anime is finally mainstream in the States and around the globe.

<p><br/>At that, Black art and Black stories are needed now in today’s social climate more than ever.

<p>Dreamers’ Playlist was created for that experience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As much as we love anime as an art form, the creation process behind it is notoriously tumultuous and tedious. Much like blockbuster films, many big-name anime series (Naruto, Sword Art Online) are adapted from pre-existing work. Coming attached to a proven fanbase makes them no-brainers for producers to greenlight. Original works (Cowboy Bebop, Gurren Lagann) have a tendency to become instant favorites with fans but tend to only be trusted in the hands of veteran, visionary directors due to the risk involved.</p>
<p>Dreamers' Playlist falls outside the bounds of either route.</p>
<p>An original series built with the DNA of a long-running franchise, it was constructed in this format to provide as much of the non-animated part of the experience as possible.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share the word. Creators in Japan and around the world have shared their love through their art, inspiring projects just like this one -created to breathe love and inspiration back into the world.

</div></div>","Dreamers' whatlist?
Set in the US in 2004, Dreamers' Playlist Set 1 follows two brothers' inheritance of mysterious spiritual power - chasing their dreams and blazing the path into a new era.
For 26 23-minute installments, the classic Shonen Jump-style formula of character progression through punching (One Piece, My Hero Academia) is remixed into an original series commenting on the nature of power and coming-of-age Black masculinity.
The big fighting tournaments, rivalries, & special moves we know and love are all here, but the story at play goes far deeper than simple homage. Elements both fresh and familiar work in tandem to fully flesh out a distinct, lived-in world through which the characters' narratives are driven. Dreamers' Playlist is an exploration and loving celebration of the visual storytelling form.

<p>""I am Lorenzo Lamas"" is an episode of the show, Bail Out.  Lorenzo is trying to convince my character, Jimmy O'Neill, that he was once a very famous TV star. Yes, it is the real Lorenzo Lamas.  My name is Dennis O'Neill.  Ever since I could remember, I quit everything in my life because of fear.  After quitting High School, I worked at dead-end jobs and was going nowhere fast. One day I finally had enough of losing. I went back to school, received my GED, then an Associate’s degree in Theater Arts, where I found my love for acting and realized that it was my life long career. My tenacity to finishing what I started was and is so strong that I enrolled at UTA, Arlington, again, in 2001for a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. I graduated on December 16, 20016. Yes, it took me fifteen years but quitting was not an option. I realized I could be part of something bigger than me, which is helping to provide jobs for actors and crew, after I began writing my Bail Out TV show idea back in 2007. We filmed a 4-minute sizzle reel in 2009 and started winning award for Best Sizzle Reel.  Sharing my idea with many actors that I worked with over the years, such as Lorenzo Lamas, (Falcon Crest and Renegade) Marshall Teague (Armageddon, Road House, etc.) Terry Kiser (Weekend at Bernie’s-Bernie) Burton Gilliam (Blazing Saddles) and many more all fell in love with it and wanted to help me by being a part of it.  I filmed about fifteen webisodes and won Best Web Series at the Lake Charles Film and Music Festival. This show will allow me to write and act in stories with great actors, crew and with humor making, the audiences feel good about what they just watched. It is also important because it will allow me to continue to work with, and supports, children's hospitals, homeless shelters, Wounded Warrior organizations and more.  My ultimate goal is to get Bail Out on the air as a weekly TV show.   As a contributor, you will be a big part of all these goals and end results. It is not about ""us"", it is about everyone else!</p>
<p>My skin in the project is that I took out a home equity loan to finance the Bail Out project so far. What I need in the short term is $5000 to complete the editing process and get it out there through screenings. I am willing to give walk-on roles and one-liners in a future episode, which I am in the process of writing, called, ""Where is Lou Diamond Phillips?""  In addition, T-Shirts and Coffee Mugs will be given to those who give at least $50 and for a T-Shirt, $100. </p>
<p>I have gained more open doors and connections with TV producers, directors and those in high places, but I need to make sure our product is spot on ready for them to see through their professional eyes and many years of experience. I set the goal low enough to get the ball rolling and since this will not be the last of our episodic, I thought a start always leads to a finish. Like going back to school, and although it took me many years to complete, is how I look at everything I do. I will not give up; I will only give it my all, to the finish! Winners never quit and quitters never win. I did not make that up. I was told that I need to explain what qualifies me to overcome any hurdles. That is why I shared my life from being a quitter to being a finisher. I will not give up on what I set out to do, not just for myself, but mostly for everyone else involved. I have obligated myself to help all those who worked on this project for little or no money at all. I will do the same for those of you who give to this Bail Out project. My tagline is true, “Everybody’s got a Story.”  It is also true that, there are times in life that, Everybody Needs a Bail Out! Thank you for your time and thank you for allowing me to be transparent enough to share a glimpse of my life with you.</p>

In their daily spaces, such as home, workspace, public bathroom, café, restaurant, and social platform, they resist, accept, or contribute to inequality. DIRECTOR'S NOTEIn South Korea, misogyny, homophobia, and hate speech/crime prevail on the daily basis. With doubts, I was convinced to accept the social “norm,” as everyone seemed to do so. When I came to New York in 2013, I was surprised to see how people here are resisting rather than committing.I remember reading an online post about a NYC college student who was facing exactly the same situation as one the characters in our web series. US and Korea might seem substantially different, but people are facing the same issues. I wanted to contribute to the global conversation on women and LGBTQ rights to make our voice heard across the geographical, social, and cultural boundaries. With Ordinary Days and continued conversations around the same issues we face, I hope we stay and stand stronger.- Nabin Park, Director (박나빈, 감독) WHO WE AREWe are New York-based filmmakers, actors, students, political activists, and artists who gathered to stand and speak for women’s and LGBTQ rights.Also, Space Nabi and Sikgaek are supporting Ordinary Days. WHERE THE FUND GOESWe are looking to raise $5,000 from Indiegogo to finalize this project. Post-production:·       Editing·       Sound DesignMaking up the production cost of:·       Equipment rental fee·       Paying / feeding the cast and crew·       Transportation·       Art / set design PRODUCTION TIMELINE WHAT YOU GETWe appreciate any amount of donation, and would like to give you back.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I moved to LA two years ago to do this - create. To bring my humor and insight into reality. To be a part of the most beautiful and collaborative art form of the modern age- television. Shows can only be made when all the painters get to put their mark on the canvas, when all the writers and crew and editors come together in sync for a common vision. This project is my baby and is dedicated to the friends back home I wish I could have brunch with.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need at least $10,000 to get this web series launched. We have an amazing team of talented people who are giving this their all. Every cent will go into the production of this series for your entertainment pleasure. With your donation you will receive a selection of wonderful gifts ranging from social media shout outs to joining us on set for a day with an experience you are sure never to forget.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While the theme might seem frivolous, the subject matter is pretty powerful. Our characters are dealing with things like learning how to embrace their sexual orientation and love themselves after living in a repressed environment. We’ve got someone trying to save the ocean through his documentary about real things that are happening to our environment, while struggling to keep his own life afloat. There are two strong, independant characters who are setting the example of what powerful female friendships can look like when we stop living in competition with each other. These are relationships we can learn from and connect to.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have a full time job, no money, and clinical depression. So it gets hard when people refer to your passion as a hobby. You doubt whether it’s worth it, whether you can even fulfill this dream you have. But you have to preserver, you have to try and possibly fail, you have to forgo sleep to achieve your goals. And when you’re working toward something you love, missing the nights out with friends, or home with your tv aren’t that terrible in the grand scheme of things. I think it’s worth it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please spread the word about BRUNCH SO HARD. Tell your friends, followers, random people on the street. Feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools. Anyway to get the word out helps! We have two great marketing campaigns going on right now through our Instagram and Twitter. #followthebacon is about our mascot, the Bacon Babe, as she travels around LA spreading the joy of brunch. And #brunchspot is where we go to cafes across LA and feature their brunch menu for an entire week to cross promote with businesses. </p>
