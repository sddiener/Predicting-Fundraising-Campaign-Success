<br/><p><b>Why did you come to Casa Xalteva?</b></p>
<p>I started to participate in the program one and a half years ago because my brothers had already been here for a number of years. My mom works all day so it is hard for her to have enough time to look after me. I started to come to Casa Xalteva because my brothers would tell me great things about what they were doing and learning.  After a while I found the courage to ask if I could join. Ever since I have had a second family.  <br/></p>

<p>Loving and sharing with other people.  Casa Xalteva has also helped me with my homework and this has enabled me to get better grades at school. </p>
<p><b>What is your favourite memory of your time here at Casa Xalteva?</b></p>
<p>We took a trip all together in 2015 to place called El Flor de Pochote.  It was an amazing day with all the staff, kids and students together, in which we had time to swim, play, explore and be together as family.</p>

<br/><p><b>How did you get started at Casa Xalteva?</b></p>
<p>I first came to Casa Xalteva when I was nine years old, I was one of the first children to join the program.  A friend of mine who was already here told me what Casa Xalteva offered and how it could help me turn my life around.  I knew right away it was somewhere I wanted to be.  Ken and Gregory gave me the opportunity to be here and that moment changed my life in so many ways.  Casa Xalteva was my home for eight years and it is now my place of work.  If it wasn’t for the chance I had to join the program here, I probably would still be out living on the street.  </p>
<br/><p><b>What has been your most remarkable experience at Casa Xalteva?</b></p>
<p>It's something which most people would consider pretty ordinary. When I first entered the program, we would all have lunch together, the founders, staff and other children.  Those memories are so special to me.  Before I came to Casa Xalteva there was never any food in my house, so just being able to have lunch every day was amazing. Then there was the feeling of eating and being part of a family,  where we were all laughing and sharing stories together. This was so important to me. It is something that still happens in Casa Xalteva every day, and why this place is so very special to all of us.   </p>

<br/><p><b>Who helped you to join Casa Xalteva?</b></p>
<p>I joined Casa Xalteva in 2012.  My Mom works and my Dad is not around.  It was really tough for her to provide the things my sister and I needed to be able to go to school, eat and everything else.  She found out about Casa Xalteva  and after speaking with the staff and teachers, I was offered the opportunity to join the program.</p>
<p><b>How have you personally developed by being at Casa Xalteva?</b></p>
<p>In the four years I have been at Casa Xalteva, I think I have become a better person.  In addition to all the support provided by Casa Xalteva, such as the food, school materials, scholarships and tutoring, they provide classes and workshops about behavior, team-work, cooperation and other areas-- this really helped me develop on a personal level.</p>
<br/><p><b>What are the three most important things you receive at Casa Xalteva?</b></p>

<br/><p><b>When did you start at Casa Xalteva?</b></p>
<p>When I was 12 years old!  The Founders, Ken and Greg, used to stay at the guesthouse where my Mom worked.  They liked her cooking so much that when they set up Casa Xalteva in 1995, they asked her to cook the lunches for the kids.  So Casa Xalteva became my second home ever since I was a teen.  In the year 2000 I became a Spanish teacher and have been working here since.  </p>
<p><b>How has your time at Casa Xalteva changed you?</b></p>
<p>Through Casa Xalteva I have grown both personally and professionally.  As a person I have learned to share with other people and appreciate the company of my colleagues and friends in this very special place.  As a teacher I have worked with wonderful students from so many different countries, and have learned new ways of teaching. I'm trying to become better every single day.  </p>
<p><b>What was your happiest moment at Casa Xalteva?</b></p>
<p>My happiest moment was when my sister, Olma, got married here at Casa Xalteva.  It was a wonderful occasion in which my entire family, along with Ken and Gregory, came to share in a time of utter joy.  Casa Xalteva is such an important place to me and it will always be somewhere that reminds me of this happiness.  </p>

<br/><p><b>In what ways have you developed personally while being at Casa Xalteva?</b></p>
<p>Casa Xalteva has given me the opportunity to focus on my education, has supported me with my school work and helped me get the best grades possible throughout primary and secondary school .</p>
<p>My time here has also helped me understand the values of good citizenship. Sharing and working alongside others and people from different cultures has helped me so much.  At Casa Xalteva we work to create a community environment based on love and respect and I adore being part of that.  </p>
<p><b>Which day at Casa Xalteva do you especially remember?</b></p>
<p>In November 2013 we celebrated a massive milestone for Casa Xalteva, our 18th Anniversary and I will always remember this very special day.  During the morning we had a wonderful celebration with all of the kids, students, staff and volunteers present.  We played games, sang songs and generally had so much fun being all together.  We then all had lunch together and had time to share and reflect on the importance of coming so far as an organization.  </p>

Help us make our house our home. We can, and will, ensure that Casa Xalteva will forever remain dedicated to what we do and who we are.    We have been using the space at Casa Xalteva for 21 years.  It has become our home, but we now stand to lose this building if we do not make it legally ours. We need your help to get us as near as possible to be able to purchase Casa Xalteva's building from the original owner.  As a means to raise these funds, we are offering our services as a language school to you in return for your generosity and, regardless of the outcome, you will be able to redeem your perk. So.... Who Are We?
We are Casa Xalteva. Founded in  1995, we aim to provide at-risk young people with the tools to break away from cycles of poverty and violence. 




And What Do We Do? 

For each child at Casa Xalteva, we provide... 


Two healthy meals every day
Full tuition scholarships to the best schools and universities available
All learning materials and uniforms 
Daily tutoring, English lessons and vocational training 
Support for their families. 
A safe place to engage in sports, games and recreational activities
Love, respect and friendship




And Why Do We Need To Do This?


The level of risk faced by young people in Nicaragua is disproportionately high. Some of the biggest threats facing our youth include: dropping out of school, joining a gang, domestic violence, teenage pregnancy, human trafficking or life on the streets.  These situations are just around the corner for far too many children here in Nicaragua. 


Our work is to ensure that as many children as possible are able to escape that cycle and live happy, healthy and successful lives. 



Our Business Model

Casa Xalteva is not a charity. We are a non-profit, social business.   This allows us to fulfill our duties to the community in the most sustainable way possible, without being dependent on donations.   The services we provide enable us to generate income, thereby fulfilling our mission to improve the lives of at-risk Nicaraguan youth.   


Services we provide: 



High quality Spanish language classes 
Homestay immersion programs

Life-changing volunteering and internship opportunities 

Excursions and cultural activities 
Tailor-made programs for schools and groups 

As a social business, we operate without outside support, however... 



The Next Stage of the Journey for Casa Xalteva




Sometimes we need to ask for help to enable us to do something a bit more than what is normally possible. 


This time, we need to ask for your support in a BIG way.  

For 21  years Casa Xalteva Education and Cultural Center has benefited from its landmark location in the center of the community it has been supporting. This building was originally bought by and still belongs to our founder, Ken Carpenter.  We have been privileged to have been able to continue using the space, but in order to ensure that the ""chavalos/as"" can always call Casa Xalteva home, we now need to raise the funds to purchase and register it as part of the Casa Xalteva Foundation.  

We want to be able to continue our operations at Casa Xalteva and keep our doors open to more and more kids in the future.   By purchasing the building we will be able to do that.  Casa Xalteva will have its own permanent location, which will be part of our legally registered Foundation.    This will allow us to continue our work for Nicaragua's underserved youth, and grow and develop into the future.  Right now, we are at risk of losing our home. 


How will this work?  


We are asking for $100,000.   If we meet this goal we will be able to make a major downpayment for the building and transfer the deed in the name of Casa Xalteva.

The building will cost us more than what we are asking for, so if we manage to go beyond our goal, that will also make a huge difference.  However, we are confident that the continuous growth in operations will allow us to successfully make future payments of the property.

In November 2013 we celebrated a massive milestone for Casa Xalteva, our 18th Anniversary and I will always remember this very special day.  During the morning we had a wonderful celebration with all of the kids, students, staff and volunteers present.  We played games, sang songs and generally had so much fun being all together.  We then all had lunch together and had time to share and reflect on the importance of coming so far as an organization.  
How would you describe the meaning of Casa Xalteva to you in three words?
Family, Happiness, Achievement

<p><b>Was ist Svisa Espero?</b></p>
<p>Svisa Espero ist eine im Frühjahr 2015 lancierte
Halbjahreszeitschrift für Nachhaltigkeit und Sprachpolitik. Sie wird von der
Firma Allsprachendienst Esperanto GmbH in Zusammenarbeit und im Auftrag der
Schweizerischen Esperanto-Gesellschaft herausgegeben und vertrieben. Die
Artikel erscheinen jeweils in einer der drei Schweizer Amtssprachen Deutsch,
Französisch oder Italienisch immer mit einer Übersetzung in Esperanto. Svisa
Espero berichtet über Themen wie Sprachpolitik, Umweltschutz und Energiewende und stellt Projekte, Utopien und Zukunftsvisionen vor. Die Zeitschrift setzt sich einerseits für echte
Mehrsprachigkeit ein und kämpft andererseits gegen sprachliche Diskriminierung
und für die sprachliche Vielfalt. Gleichzeitig soll Svisa Espero einer weltweiten Leserschaft wenig bekannte Gegenden und Teile der Schweiz vorstellen und für einen sanften und ökoverträglichen Tourismus werben und der Welt die Vorzüge des direktdemokratischen politischen Systems der Schweiz aufzeigen und dieses auch als Modell und Vorbild zur Lösung zahlreicher regionaler und globaler Probleme anpreisen. Svisa Espero wird in einer
Auflage von 5000 Exemplaren an Schweizer Politiker und Entscheidungsträger
sowie an die Mitglieder der Schweizer Esperanto-Gesellschaft versandt und kann
einen Monat nach Erscheinen der Printausgabe weltweit als PDF im Internet gelesen und runtergeladen
werden. </p>
<p>Wenn Du noch nie von Esperanto gehört hast: Esperanto ist
die von Ludoviko Lazaro Zamenhof 1887 publizierte Internationale Sprache und
soll dereinst als Zweitsprache aller Menschen die unmittelbare Kommunikation
zwischen Angehörigen aller Völker und Sprachgruppen ermöglichen, ohne dass
dabei einer dem anderen seine Muttersprache aufdrängt. </p>

Svisa Espero ist eine im Frühjahr 2015 lancierte
Halbjahreszeitschrift für Nachhaltigkeit und Sprachpolitik. Sie wird von der
Firma Allsprachendienst Esperanto GmbH in Zusammenarbeit und im Auftrag der
Schweizerischen Esperanto-Gesellschaft herausgegeben und vertrieben. Die
Artikel erscheinen jeweils in einer der drei Schweizer Amtssprachen Deutsch,
Französisch oder Italienisch immer mit einer Übersetzung in Esperanto. Svisa
Espero berichtet über Themen wie Sprachpolitik, Umweltschutz und Energiewende und stellt Projekte, Utopien und Zukunftsvisionen vor. Die Zeitschrift setzt sich einerseits für echte
Mehrsprachigkeit ein und kämpft andererseits gegen sprachliche Diskriminierung
und für die sprachliche Vielfalt. Gleichzeitig soll Svisa Espero einer weltweiten Leserschaft wenig bekannte Gegenden und Teile der Schweiz vorstellen und für einen sanften und ökoverträglichen Tourismus werben und der Welt die Vorzüge des direktdemokratischen politischen Systems der Schweiz aufzeigen und dieses auch als Modell und Vorbild zur Lösung zahlreicher regionaler und globaler Probleme anpreisen. Svisa Espero wird in einer
Auflage von 5000 Exemplaren an Schweizer Politiker und Entscheidungsträger
sowie an die Mitglieder der Schweizer Esperanto-Gesellschaft versandt und kann
einen Monat nach Erscheinen der Printausgabe weltweit als PDF im Internet gelesen und runtergeladen
werden. 
Wenn Du noch nie von Esperanto gehört hast: Esperanto ist
die von Ludoviko Lazaro Zamenhof 1887 publizierte Internationale Sprache und
soll dereinst als Zweitsprache aller Menschen die unmittelbare Kommunikation
zwischen Angehörigen aller Völker und Sprachgruppen ermöglichen, ohne dass
dabei einer dem anderen seine Muttersprache aufdrängt. 
Was gibt’s Du uns und was bekommst Du dafür?

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>HOW</b></p>
<p>Our
team's background is in advanced VR technology and gaming, international
development, and adaptive educational technology.  Through
our team, partners, adviser's, and network of developers we have built the
most advanced virtual reality rendering engine which powers our Human Development Platform. </p>
<p>Our
team has worked for Microsoft, Apple, HP, Boeing, Activision, EA
Games and numerous corporations and foundations.  We
have experience in holding competitions and hackathons as well as rolling
out culturally sensitive on-the-ground solutions for international development.</p>
<p>Our
connections with corporations, individuals, foundations, NGOs, embassies, and
government departments allow us to brand and scale our engine and VR app store
to not only be used for entertainment and gaming but more importantly, human
development (free VR education and employment opportunities).</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Technically speaking…</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Our engine
     can render 200 million polygons before crashing (largest in video game
     history).</li>
<li>Host up to
     10,000 players/users per environment or level meaning early adopters will
     become industry leaders in next-gen VR game development.</li>
<li>Attain a 90
     frame per second VR refresh rate with 500,000 polygons per viewable area.</li>
<li>We are
     working alongside Projects for All, creators of the Hello Hub to
     bring solar-powered internet-ready computer kiosks to off-the-grid
     villages, at risk areas, and refugee camps.  </li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>CAMPAIGN</b></p>
<p>The

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">1) </b>The

<p>Access
to the largest real-time environment in video game history. With a $5 dollar
donation you get early and discounted access to “Zombies vs. Celebrities: in Vegas.”</p>

massive gaming called Terra Prime. Come meet your friends from around the world
to learn, work, travel, play, shop, and catch-up. Learn more at www.gendevcollaborative.com. 

WHAT
Terra
Prime is the
beginning of free global education, access to employment opportunities, and
worldwide prototype collaboration. It is GenDev’s CGI vitrual world where every
user will begin their day to purchase VR modules for personal entertainment,
shopping, education, employment opportunities, intercultural exploration, and
group business collaboration. Join us at www.EnterTerraPrime.com.

TerraVerse is the virtual reality app
store for developers and content providers to upload their AR/VR apps and experiences
to be downloaded by everyday users on any device.  Whether that be a new
course to further your education, new content for virtual travel (i.e., virtual
London, Hong Kong, New York City, etc.), gaming, shopping, or business
meetings.




The
Human Development Prize will gather teams from around the world
to create, compete, and engage in new business creation and rapid prototye development in Terra Prime. Our
Indiegogo campaign will fund our first Human Development Prize.  

WHERE
Terra
Prime exists
in the cloud and will be fully functional on any device—laptop, desktop,
Xbox, PlayStation, tablet, and phone (and yes it is Oculus and Vive compatible). 
While it is VR ready, you do not need to
have a headset or super computer to join our global community! 

WHEN

SEP.
2016: Initial
Terra Prime beta launch and additional content for end-user purchase.

OCT.
2016: First
global press conference and demo in virtual reality. 

DEC.
2016: Terra
Prime 1.0 launch, including expanded content, TerraVerse app store,
and the release of GenDev’s VR-ready Game “Zombies vs. Celebrities: in
Vegas.”

JAN.
2017: Applications
and team registration opens for our first Human Development Prize.

WHY
Every
human being deserves access to education and employment opportunities—EVERYONE.

Terra
Prime and the Human Development Prize provide invaluable access to those that
would otherwise have limited or no access to education, employment, business
creation, and exploration. 
If you
help us during the launch of Terra Prime, you will be a founding supporter of advanced
free education and basic worldwide employment opportunities.

HOW
Our
team's background is in advanced VR technology and gaming, international
development, and adaptive educational technology.  Through
our team, partners, adviser's, and network of developers we have built the
most advanced virtual reality rendering engine which powers our Human Development Platform. 
Our
team has worked for Microsoft, Apple, HP, Boeing, Activision, EA
Games and numerous corporations and foundations.  We
have experience in holding competitions and hackathons as well as rolling
out culturally sensitive on-the-ground solutions for international development.
Our
connections with corporations, individuals, foundations, NGOs, embassies, and
government departments allow us to brand and scale our engine and VR app store
to not only be used for entertainment and gaming but more importantly, human
development (free VR education and employment opportunities).

Technically speaking…

Our engine
     can render 200 million polygons before crashing (largest in video game
     history).
Host up to
     10,000 players/users per environment or level meaning early adopters will
     become industry leaders in next-gen VR game development.
Attain a 90
     frame per second VR refresh rate with 500,000 polygons per viewable area.
We are
     working alongside Projects for All, creators of the Hello Hub to
     bring solar-powered internet-ready computer kiosks to off-the-grid
     villages, at risk areas, and refugee camps.  


CAMPAIGN
The
funding from our Indiegogo campaign will help us launch two
initiatives: 

1) The
Human Development Prize. Teams
from around the world will create and compete in the following
ventures aligned with the UN SDGs: 

Business Creation for Massive
     Employment (ie, VR Docents, Assistants)
VR Business Enterprise App
     Development (VR Email, Marketing, etc)
New VR Business Grants (Free VR
     Headset from GenDev + TerraCredits)


2) Retrofitting two school’s/refugee
camps with Hello Hubs + VR Headsets for access to direct education and employment opportunities that otherwise would not exist.
 
PERKS
Access
to the largest real-time environment in video game history. With a $5 dollar
donation you get early and discounted access to “Zombies vs. Celebrities: in Vegas.”
After
the campaign ends, the game will be for sale for $20, so why not donate $5 to global
education and employment opportunities and get the game as your free
gift?!


Since we want you to
remain connected to our cause please share the campaign (using the Indiegogo
share tools) and spread the word with your friends, family, and networks! Remember to register with us at www.EnterTerraPrime.com.

<p>In the early 1980’s I was young and in college, so doing
stupid things was somewhat expected. One cold winter day my friend Joe and I
had arranged to meet our “gal pal” Mayra at the subway station at 59th Street
and Columbus Circle in Manhattan at 9:00AM in order to go ice skating at
Rockefeller Center. Skating at Rockefeller Center is something of a rite of
passage for New Yorkers so these plans were not strange or odd. What was odd
was the delusion that Joe and I had in our heads that Mayra would show up on
time. Mayra was notoriously late all the time. As Joe and I waited at the bottom
of the escalator off of the street, but not past the point where we would need
to pay another fair, we got colder and colder. To keep warm, we joked around,
danced in place and did all those silly things that college students were want
to do.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually we began to sing. While neither of us was by any means ready for a
solo at nearby Lincoln Center we were not bad, and what we lacked in talent we
made up for in frozen enthusiasm. We got some stares and then eventually we got
a few listeners. Joe who was always bolder than I put his wool hat on the
ground and burst into “Oh what a Beautiful Morning” From Oklahoma. That got us
a few bucks and when I began to croon away to the show’s theme song, with Joe
High Stepping to the beat, we made even more. By the time Mayra finally emerged
from the depths of the subway, Joe and I were singing “I’m just a girl who
can’t say no” at the top of our lungs and had collected nearly fifty dollars,
which was big money in the 80’s.<br/>
<br/>
We had become street beggars. But not as we later justified to Mayra,
panhandlers. We gave the people something that they wanted in exchange they
freely gave us money. We did not set a price; they gave from their hearts.<br/>
<br/>
And now I am once again, at least figuratively,  singing “I’m Just a Girl
who can’t say no” at the top of my lungs, as the crowd funding campaign for
American Made College Fairs launches on Indiegogo<br/>
<br/>
We are not panhandling. There are rewards for the donations, no matter how
minor. I had suggested that I go to the largest donors’ home and sing, but my
partners nixed that idea, my voice has not improved with age. Still the rewards
are fun and interesting: T-shirts from the company, Shirts from your favorite
college, a guest spot on our weekly Blab broadcast, your name in the college
fair program and for our “big shots” a fair named in your honor.<br/>
<br/>
But the rewards go far beyond the material goods and ego boosts that are being
offered. College Fairs, our college fairs, strive to reach students who may
never be given the opportunity to attend college. Never have the chance to meet
with colleges and universities. By donating you give them the opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of weeks ago, I attended an on-line seminar hosted by my colleague Dan
Norris, during the course of the seminar I “meet”, in that on-line way we meet
now a days, a young lady named Janay Sade. Janay runs a company called
mycollegegenie, (<a href=""http://www.mycollegegenie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.mycollegegenie.com</a>)
which helps first generation college students and their families adjust to life
in higher education. As we spoke I mentioned that I had been Director of
Recruitment at Lehman College in the Bronx. She then said she had attended the
High School for American Studies on the campus. Small world. We talked more and
I said that when I left Lehman and was working for a college fair company we
had hosted a college fair for that high school in the Lehman cafeteria. “I
remember that fair” she said. She had attended one of our fairs. Now here she
was helping other young people get ready for college<br/>
<br/>
When you drop some change in our wool cap and make a donation to our college
fair fund. That is  your reward <br/></p>
<p>Your donation will go to change the way college fairs are conducted. Many of us remember being in high school and attending a
college fair. We would march into a gym or conference center and the college
and university representatives would be at tables across the venue, one by one
we would visit each table and fill out the inquiry cards. Then slowly the
boredom would set in and we, the students would simply circle around the room,
like fish in a school.</p>
<p>What may come as a surprise to many of you is that college
fairs have not changed. The same fair you attended in 1980 or 1990 or 2000 is
going on today. American Made College Programs intends to change all that. It
is our goal to take the average college fair and turn it into a firestorm.</p>
<p>For the first time colleges fairs will be linked to social
media and the interactive aspects of the internet. Facebook pages for each fair
will allow students to be in touch with colleges even before the event happens,
live twitter feed from the event will allow our fair staff to direct students
to colleges and universities which meet their interest. Snapchat, Periscope and
live stream from the fairs will grant access to populations previously denied
the ability to attend a college fair</p>
<p>We will launch in Fall of 2016 with three fairs: Harrisburg
PA, Frederick/Hagerstown MD and Allentown PA.  <br/></p>
<p>Are there risks? Yes of course while not a crowded market there is competition, though none of them are using the firestorm of social media to expand the product.  Re-writing the story of college fairs to include the disenfranchised will require explanation and conversation with various colleges and universities.</p>But the rewards  will be great . The reward of opening the doors of
college to someone to whom they may have been closed. Your reward is their
access; your reward is their success.<br/><br/><p> 
Please take a look at our campaign. Please donate. And if you really
want, I can of course come to your house and sing</p>

<p><b><i>My mission is to cross the USA with my tiny house to teach, motivate, and
inspire children and adults to make informed</i></b> <b><i>economic,
environmental and social choices and live healthier, more sustainable
lifestyles.</i></b></p>
<p>I have overcome incredible odds to get where I am today. Five
years ago I was penniless, sick, and without affordable housing.  I had been laid off from a financial position
at the age of 60. I faced financial ruin due to medical bills from several
bouts with cancer and Lyme disease. I was homeless.</p>
<p>Instead of giving up I asked myself a lot of questions. I wondered if I could build an affordable mobile, non-toxic, zero-waste home for under $20,000**? Could I build it myself without
any construction experience? Could I raise all the funds to do it while building? Could I design a lifestyle that would sustain me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a
solution. I sold all my worldly goods, bought an 18’ trailer and built myself a
tiny house on wheels equipped with all renewable energy systems and a small
carbon footprint. </p>

I invested my final savings on two things. The first was education. I attended the executive program in
Sustainability Management from <a href=""http://presidio.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Presidio</a> in San Francisco where I learned about bio-mimicry. The second, I founded <a href=""http://terrabluteams.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TerraBluTeams.org</a>, a 501c3
sustainable education non-profit to begin building the Silver Bullet tiny house to teach
others. 

<p><b><i></i></b></p>
<p><b>I am no
longer sick or homeless. I am stronger, more creative and capable than ever. I
have written a book about my tiny house journey with detailed pictures of my
design based on bio-mimicry. I have become a motivational speaker capable of taking
my story to classrooms, non-profits, sustainability events and tiny house
enthusiasts. </b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Today I
am experiencing the pleasure and joy of inspiring others to live more
sustainably.</b> <b>Our
non-profit is a young start-up and I am seeking funds to sponsor my first cross-country
tour. With your contributions I will influence over 60,000 people in the summer

I have put all my energy, savings, and time into the build of this mobile sustainable education exhibit and want to see my dream of sharing with others succeed. Please see below some of the risk mitigation I have planned.
My mission is to cross the USA with my tiny house to teach, motivate, and
inspire children and adults to make informed economic,
environmental and social choices and live healthier, more sustainable
lifestyles.
I have overcome incredible odds to get where I am today. Five
years ago I was penniless, sick, and without affordable housing.  I had been laid off from a financial position
at the age of 60. I faced financial ruin due to medical bills from several
bouts with cancer and Lyme disease. I was homeless.
Instead of giving up I asked myself a lot of questions. I wondered if I could build an affordable mobile, non-toxic, zero-waste home for under $20,000**? Could I build it myself without
any construction experience? Could I raise all the funds to do it while building? Could I design a lifestyle that would sustain me?

I found a
solution. I sold all my worldly goods, bought an 18’ trailer and built myself a
tiny house on wheels equipped with all renewable energy systems and a small
carbon footprint. 

I invested my final savings on two things. The first was education. I attended the executive program in
Sustainability Management from Presidio in San Francisco where I learned about bio-mimicry. The second, I founded TerraBluTeams.org, a 501c3
sustainable education non-profit to begin building the Silver Bullet tiny house to teach
others. 


I am no
longer sick or homeless. I am stronger, more creative and capable than ever. I
have written a book about my tiny house journey with detailed pictures of my
design based on bio-mimicry. I have become a motivational speaker capable of taking
my story to classrooms, non-profits, sustainability events and tiny house
enthusiasts. 

Today I
am experiencing the pleasure and joy of inspiring others to live more
sustainably. Our
non-profit is a young start-up and I am seeking funds to sponsor my first cross-country
tour. With your contributions I will influence over 60,000 people in the summer
of 2016:• 15,000+ people will see me at tours and workshops• 45,000+ people will see me at the 2nd International Tiny House Jamboree in Colorado Springs on August 5-7, where I will be returning to give a Sustainable Lifestyle Design Workshop.
I need your help. Your
contributions will achieve my dream to show others my low-carbon, zero-waste
living example and help them design their own sustainable lifestyle. Please give.
* To see Deek's full tour of the Silver Bullet Tiny House at 60% completion, go to his RelaxShacks youtube channel, click here! We have added so many new features since then!The Impact of the Silver Bullet Tiny House Tour:
My project is valuable to the world as a model of affordable healthy
housing that meets my particular needs while not impacting the environment.
This is the public opportunity to meet a fellow citizen who accomplished this
in a short time for less than $20,000** using reclaimed, recycled and non-toxic
materials.** That amount includes the value of all sponsored materials, the new trailer, oversight/install by licensed plumber and electrician and a portable solar system.
What has my sustainable
education non-profit TerraBluTeams and the Silver Bullet Tiny House
accomplished so far?
• 52 week sustainability best practices website challenges in 2012 & 2015
• Six
Community Cable shows featuring local sustainability leaders 
• Twenty Sustainability Lifestyle Workshops at Earth Day/Tiny House Festivals
• Four Community Getting to Zero Projects & Reclamation Art Shows • Sixteen Net Zero
Silver Bullet Tiny House construction workshops and tours
Risks & Challenges
In 2013 I started an IndieGoGo campaign to raise $1,800 of framing costs of my tiny house. In the last month I have applied for $5,757. in separate grants to corporations to cover the larger costs of the tour. If the grants are awarded, I will post any awards in weekly updates.I have commitments of free tiny house parking at friends and colleagues locations for 63 of my 90 day tour and I am hoping to lower my RV parking needs by asking others for free parking along my way.  Other Ways You Can Help:
• Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our sustainable
lifestyle tour and the tiny house campaign.
• Please use the Indiegogo share tools!
• Spread the word all around about the workshops, tours and “Pop Up” tours they can
have in there city along our way! Our route from Massachusetts is I-• Offer me parking for one or two nights if its within 20 miles of my route to Colorado Springs. Email taospirit@mac.com to arrange.
I will be
issuing updates every few days. I am personally deeply grateful for all my tiny
house sponsors and funders who have already given energy systems, workshop
scholarship support, construction tools and materials for the Silver Bullet.

<p><b>Dominic</b></p>

<div>
<p>I
 learned Spanish and building when I first moved to Andalusia as a 
teenager. After moving to Germany at age 18 I became a master carpenter 
and ran my own building business for several years.</p>
<p>One of the 
greatest experiences of my life has been helping to build and run a 
large Buddhist Centre in Hamburg St. Pauli. During that time I also 
became a skilled project manager organising Buddhist courses with 
several thousand participants and also big parties.</p>
<p>It has always 
been one of my goals in life to create spaces for people to come 
together, feel good and develop their potential. I believe that giving 
meaning to life through thinking of others and intelligently sharing the
 goodness we have is the only way humans will manage not to destroy each
 other and the planet with them.</p>
</div>Be committed, but don’t take
life too seriously!<p><br/></p>

<p>After finishing my education as an assistant tax adviser I decided to
 follow my love for languages and literature and studied literary 
translation in Düsseldorf. As a translator for Spanish and English, I 
have benefited a lot from places just like The Garden and have a good 
idea of what it takes to create an inspiring work environment that makes
 you feel at home.</p>
<p>For the past ten years, Dominic and I have been
 living in a big Buddhist Centre in Hamburg St. Pauli, sharing life with
 a great community of people. I was involved in planning and organising 
events and felt very lucky to be able to use my accounting and administration skills for something meaningful.<br/></p>
<p>I want to support people dedicated 
to creating art and culture. I see how difficult it is becoming to make a
 living from it and find time and mental space for creative processes. I
 believe we need to slow down and see how rich we already are. <br/>That is 
why I want to build The Garden.</p>

<p>The Garden is a 7 ha organic olive orchard situated in the foothills of 
the Sierra de las Nieves. The river Turón flows along its southern boundary .</p>
<p>Fresh water comes from our own well, olives, figs, almonds, pomegranates, oranges and lemons from our own trees. Electricity and hot water from solar power. With composted leftovers  and filtered used water we will refertilise and irrigate the land.</p>
<p>The Garden will be sustainable, grow it’s own organic food and produce olive oil and other organic products.</p>
<p>The Garden is surrounded by reforested land and olive groves which cannot 
be urbanized. It offers views in almost all directions of 
ruined castles, big lakes, mountain scapes, a romantic Spanish village 
and along a river valley!</p>

<p style=""font-size:2em;line-height:1.4;"">The land and area<br/></p>

The Garden is conveniently situated in the Andalusian mountains only 45 minutes from the city of Málaga, it's international 
airport, and the warm waters of the Mediterranean. The authentic and picturesque
Andalusian village of Ardales is only ten minutes by car (about 30 minutes walking distance).<br/><br/>
The famous trail El Caminito del Rey is just around the corner, as are 
many beautiful places for short or long walks through very diverse 
landscapes, gorges and pine forests, along rivers,
and over mountains.<br/><br/>The Garden commands views of the Sierra de las Nieves to the west, the 
Sierra de Caparaín to the south, in the east are the big reservoirs and 
the mountains around El Chorro, to the north the
historic ruins of Turón Castle.<br/><br/>The Garden is less than an hour’s drive from Ronda, Antequera, Málaga 
and the coast, two hours from Sevilla, Córdoba and Granada, and is 
therefore a convenient base for day trips. It has good
bus connections with Málaga, Ronda and Sevilla. Both Bobadilla railway 
station and Santa Ana (the high-speed train) are half an hour away.<br/><br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469655099/Castle_turon_schmall_640_1_von_1_hv60fq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>View of Castle Turón<br/></p>
<br/><p style=""font-size:2em;line-height:1.4;"">How we will accomplish it</p>
<ul>
<li>We are currently raising the $ 450.000,- for purchasing the property.</li>
<li>With anything above $ 150.000,- we can make a downpayment and this pristine piece of paradise will not go on the open market and be lost to investors.<br/>
</li>
<li>Then we will organise a loan for the building phase, either with a bank or a project friendly investor. <br/>
</li>
<li>The more we raise with your help through crowdfunding the less we need to take on as a loan, enabling us to faster accomplish the main goal of The Garden: Offering people benefiting and enriching society affordable accomodation in a special place.</li>
<li>Starting in  2017, we need three years to build:<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li> A communal house with 6 en suite rooms<br/>
</li>
<li> Nine apartments, each with an open-plan kitchen and living area and   <br/> bathroom<br/>
</li>
<li> A seminar room</li>
<li> A workshop for arts and crafts<br/>
</li>
<li> An artist's studio<br/>
</li>
<li> A bar/social area<br/>
</li>
<li> A big kitchen for coming together and events<br/>
</li>
<li> A meditation room</li>
<li> A workshop for manufacturing organic products like olive oil from the 400 trees</li>
<li> A swimming pool</li>
<li> A sauna (yes, it does get cold in winter ;-) ).<br/>

<b>How has the known universe changed after we have accomplished our goal and The Garden is up and running?</b><br/><br/> <p><i>Ben is a regular guy. He studied economics and joined a consultancy firm</i><i> after university</i><i>. Since a teenager, he has wanted to write a science fiction novel, but with school, sports, university, work, etc. he just never got round to it. Ben supported The Garden with 500 $ simply because he thought even if he couldn't, maybe somebody else would find the time to stay there for a while.</i></p>
<p><i>He received a voucher for a stay in The Garden. Three years later, after he got a message telling him that the building phase was complete and The Garden was running, he booked a flight to Málaga</i><i> on a whim</i><i>, rented a little car, and 45 minutes later arrived in</i> <b>a beautiful resort surrounded by olive groves with views over mountains and castles and a picturesque village, looking down on a small river with pools one can swim in</b>. <i>He checked in and walked in the shadow of trees to his chalet.

The Garden will be a creative, self-sustaining environment in the stunning Andalusian landscape where artists, authors, musicians, scientists, companies, you and anyone else can come and concentrate on their work, become inspired by others and slow down.A workspace where you accomplish more and still feel as if you are on holiday.
We want The Garden to be a win-win project for all: With your support we can secure the property enabling us then to build The Garden, supporting people enriching society. 
Your win is a voucher for a stay at The Garden that is worth more than what you have given us!



Sunrise at The Garden 

The Story behind ... 
Twelve years ago Dominic's father Martin and his wife Diana bought an absolutely beautiful piece of land in Andalusia, planning to build an educational resort for teachers and students. Now they are returning to England and have to sell this jewel of a property. Thanks to their pioneering work the land has water, electricity and the planning permission which fits our project.
On this foundation we can build The Garden. 
Supporting our project, they have offered to postpone putting it on the market, giving us the unique opportunity to raise the necessary funds and fulfill our vision.


A fresh start to the day

What is special about The Garden? The Garden will be an ideal work environment for creative projects. Softly integrated into the landscape, we plan to build comfortable
 apartments with spacious
 verandas and stunning views, plus a wood workshop, an artist's studio, a seminar room and of course a swimming pool. There is even a small river to swim in!We imagine a vivid, dynamic community of people  that might otherwise never meet, 
working on diverse projects from business to arts or science,  
inspiring each other, sharing different ways of looking at the world.A big part of our vision is using the revenue to support people who could otherwise not afford to stay in a place like this. We will offer high reductions for anybody enriching society with their work!


Seminar room, atelier and workshop



What can you do here?
Work on your project, meet others and be inspired by their ideas. 
Stay in solitude in a private chalet or in the communal house.
Give or take part in courses: Art courses, business courses, woodwork or sculpture courses, yoga, language, writing courses …
Simply come and stay for your holiday or use The Garden for a corporate retreat thus supporting the creative work of others.







About us


Dominic


I
 learned Spanish and building when I first moved to Andalusia as a 
teenager. After moving to Germany at age 18 I became a master carpenter 
and ran my own building business for several years.
One of the 
greatest experiences of my life has been helping to build and run a 
large Buddhist Centre in Hamburg St. Pauli. During that time I also 
became a skilled project manager organising Buddhist courses with 
several thousand participants and also big parties.
It has always 
been one of my goals in life to create spaces for people to come 
together, feel good and develop their potential. I believe that giving 
meaning to life through thinking of others and intelligently sharing the
 goodness we have is the only way humans will manage not to destroy each
 other and the planet with them.
Be committed, but don’t take
life too seriously!



Heike

After finishing my education as an assistant tax adviser I decided to
 follow my love for languages and literature and studied literary 
translation in Düsseldorf. As a translator for Spanish and English, I 
have benefited a lot from places just like The Garden and have a good 
idea of what it takes to create an inspiring work environment that makes
 you feel at home.
For the past ten years, Dominic and I have been
 living in a big Buddhist Centre in Hamburg St. Pauli, sharing life with
 a great community of people. I was involved in planning and organising 
events and felt very lucky to be able to use my accounting and administration skills for something meaningful.
I want to support people dedicated 
to creating art and culture. I see how difficult it is becoming to make a
 living from it and find time and mental space for creative processes. I
 believe we need to slow down and see how rich we already are. That is 
why I want to build The Garden.

Sustainability
The Garden is a 7 ha organic olive orchard situated in the foothills of 
the Sierra de las Nieves. The river Turón flows along its southern boundary .
Fresh water comes from our own well, olives, figs, almonds, pomegranates, oranges and lemons from our own trees. Electricity and hot water from solar power. With composted leftovers  and filtered used water we will refertilise and irrigate the land.
The Garden will be sustainable, grow it’s own organic food and produce olive oil and other organic products.
The Garden is surrounded by reforested land and olive groves which cannot 
be urbanized. It offers views in almost all directions of 
ruined castles, big lakes, mountain scapes, a romantic Spanish village 
and along a river valley!


Sustainability in The Garden


The land and area

The Garden is conveniently situated in the Andalusian mountains only 45 minutes from the city of Málaga, it's international 
airport, and the warm waters of the Mediterranean. The authentic and picturesque
Andalusian village of Ardales is only ten minutes by car (about 30 minutes walking distance).
The famous trail El Caminito del Rey is just around the corner, as are 
many beautiful places for short or long walks through very diverse 
landscapes, gorges and pine forests, along rivers,
and over mountains.The Garden commands views of the Sierra de las Nieves to the west, the 
Sierra de Caparaín to the south, in the east are the big reservoirs and 
the mountains around El Chorro, to the north the
historic ruins of Turón Castle.The Garden is less than an hour’s drive from Ronda, Antequera, Málaga 
and the coast, two hours from Sevilla, Córdoba and Granada, and is 
therefore a convenient base for day trips. It has good
bus connections with Málaga, Ronda and Sevilla. Both Bobadilla railway 
station and Santa Ana (the high-speed train) are half an hour away.View of Castle Turón
How we will accomplish it

We are currently raising the $ 450.000,- for purchasing the property.
With anything above $ 150.000,- we can make a downpayment and this pristine piece of paradise will not go on the open market and be lost to investors.

Then we will organise a loan for the building phase, either with a bank or a project friendly investor. 

The more we raise with your help through crowdfunding the less we need to take on as a loan, enabling us to faster accomplish the main goal of The Garden: Offering people benefiting and enriching society affordable accomodation in a special place.
Starting in  2017, we need three years to build:



 A communal house with 6 en suite rooms

 Nine apartments, each with an open-plan kitchen and living area and    bathroom

 A seminar room
 A workshop for arts and crafts

 An artist's studio

 A bar/social area

 A big kitchen for coming together and events

 A meditation room
 A workshop for manufacturing organic products like olive oil from the 400 trees
 A swimming pool
 A sauna (yes, it does get cold in winter ;-) ).

 Do you have any ideas? We would really love to hear them!







  




Perks: We want YOU to have as much joy and benefit from supporting us as we do!







We have thought up a couple of nice ways to say thank you for your support if you join in on our crowdfunding event. Here are some examples: 



Double benefits:

For one
you will have the satisfaction of helping to create a place where people enriching
society can slow down, focus on their work, meet and inspire each other.




You will receive
a voucher for a stay at The Garden. Everybody spends money on holiday accomodation anyway, this time it has a double benefit! And if you can’t come yourself, you are welcome to give somebody else a
beautiful holiday in  Andalusia.

Epilogue (for people with time on their hands)


How has the known universe changed after we have accomplished our goal and The Garden is up and running? Ben is a regular guy. He studied economics and joined a consultancy firm after university. Since a teenager, he has wanted to write a science fiction novel, but with school, sports, university, work, etc. he just never got round to it. Ben supported The Garden with 500 $ simply because he thought even if he couldn't, maybe somebody else would find the time to stay there for a while.
He received a voucher for a stay in The Garden. Three years later, after he got a message telling him that the building phase was complete and The Garden was running, he booked a flight to Málaga on a whim, rented a little car, and 45 minutes later arrived in a beautiful resort surrounded by olive groves with views over mountains and castles and a picturesque village, looking down on a small river with pools one can swim in. He checked in and walked in the shadow of trees to his chalet. The gentle rushing of the river traveled through the summer air and caught his attention, calming him on a deeper level. Just for fun he took his computer with the notes for his novel out of his suitcase and put it on the desk in the open living room/kitchen area of his apartment. The room had an amazing view of the countryside, it gave him a feeling of space. 
A welcome note on the table informed Ben that The Garden was self-sustaining. Fresh drinking water coming from a well and the electricity from solar power. It felt good to be somewhere at one with nature and not against it. Next to the note was a little bottle of  organic olive oil made from the trees growing on the land as a welcome gift. 
After prolonging his stay for two more weeks and finishing the first raw version of his book, Ben returned home feeling totally refreshed and alive.
He told his colleagues about his time there, meeting that jazz musician who'd been composing a piece about his father, and Miriam the painter from Germany who had been staying there for two months, and that he had made so much progress on his book. He told his boss about the possibility of using The Garden for a company retreat, he liked the idea and suggested it to his employees. One year later Ben and 20 of his colleagues landed in Málaga and were picked up by Dominic from The Garden. Spread around the property in their apartments, Ben's colleagues where really glad to have followed his advice. The seminar room was a dream! Wide wooden flooring, the planking cut directly out of a tree trunk, big windows offering a view across the river valley to the forested land opposite. The big veranda in front of the seminar room offered enough space to sit outside in the shade of a canopy. Coming here had been the best idea ever. Without the hustle and distraction of a regular conference hotel and with a deeply satisfying energy of concentration and relaxation at the same time.
The company retreat was so productive that Tom, Bens boss, spontaneously suggested that each year he would sponsor one of his employees to come for a two week retreat to follow their passion.
Toms book never became a bestseller, but it was published and sold a couple of thousand times which was anyway much more than he had ever dreamt of. Miriam the painter visited him later and they still stay in touch. A friend of the jazz musician, a scientist working on his second doctorate who had finished all the research and just needed a good place to write it all up, stayed on at The Garden and later won the Nobel Prize!",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>I’m Sophea, English teacher and director of the Asean International English School in Angkor Borei, 70 km south of Phnom Pehn.</p>
<p>I was born in 1990 into a poor family close to Takeo town. I started my primary school in 1997 and graduated from high school in 2009. Unfortunately my family couldn’t support me so I could start the university just in 2011.</p>
<p>I start studying English in Our Objective Organization, a very valid school. In the meanwhile I began the English Literature course at university just in the week-ends. In 2012 I got my first job as English teacher and interpreter in Hope Agency Organization. I was overworking and doing manual jobs not in my tasks for little money and not enough for paying my studies. So I was obliged to look for another job and after months I found a teaching position in a private school in Angkor Borei. However, soon I realized that the manager didn’t care about the education of the children, neither about paying the bills of the school or the salaries of the teachers. I was exhausted of working for not honest people so I decided to take the control of the situation, I became the new director of the school, I paid all the debts the former manager left by selling the only possession my parents could give me, and I founded the Asean International English School in April 2014. One year later I was graduated from my university.</p>
<p>That’s how our school was born. At the beginning was very difficult and now I’m still paying some of the old debts but I’m positive. This year we have one hundred students from four to sixteen years old. We are an NGO so we don't get any help from the government. The monthly fee for children is based upon the income of their family, if they are very poor we try to get some scholarship for them. At present we have twenty children who doesn't pay anything and we will like to help more families but it is not easy to find external helps. Our school provide for each student English courses three hours per day every day. We have five teachers and they need to be paid as well. The history of our country is not helping us, Cambodia is trying to get up after years of war and a very dark period in the Seventies’. Education doesn't get enough money from the government and to be fluent in English will be an important base in the education of the children. We would like to help much people possible because the highest percentage of poor people is located in the countryside.</p>
<p>For the moment I rent the space where I create the school. There are just three classrooms, soon four, and we really need money for school supplies of any type, new blackboards, a printer, fans, new computers, felt pens, books, notebooks, pencils and intelligent toys for the youngest kids, projectors and many other basic things for a good teaching place. My project now is to make the space more suitable for the kids, I would like to build a library with many books, dictionaries, material for listening course and movies with subtitles. My idea is to construct a playground for the youngest and to provide uniforms for all the students. So far we relied on the volunteers help as well. At present we don’t have much to offer, just one shared room and bathroom and good meals together. Because we count on them, we need to build some rooms or bungalows, and to buy some bicycles in order to make their stay more pleasant.</p>

Ciaschini</a>)</p><h3>So Get This...</h3><p><i>To preface: the opinions here are expressed by me and my like-minded friends who are fans.</i></p><p>If you walk into a crowd at any Supernatural convention, chances are a good portion of said crowd will be female-presenting. But while the audience at conventions is primarily made up of women, there is a lack of female talent at conventions and the portrayal of women on the show remains problematic. Fellow fans who desire the opportunity to interact with our favorite female characters are driven to set a plan in motion that calls for change. We want to meet our “<b>Ladies of SPN</b>,” but don’t have enough opportunity to do so.We want to have a conversation about the roles of women on SPN and support female characters in hopes that they can find their way to stronger and longer story lines. We all desire positive change in the media as a whole. This is a change we hope “<b>Ladies of SPN</b>” can garner.</p><p>We love watching SPN, but many of us pine for more female driven storylines and ideas. Rarely are we given a female character with a recurring role who survived a single episode. We want female hunters that have taken up their jobs because they wanted to and had been interested in it. We want male side characters that would be equal to them instead of bumbling idiots that made the female leads look competent through their own failings. We want female character development instead of repeated cycling through same-ole-same-ole issues, without unnecessary drama and suffering — All of which is well within our SPN Family’s reach, but only if we unite and call for change.</p><p>That’s basically the spark behind “<b>Ladies of SPN Con.</b>” We want the opportunity to talk to all these amazing female actresses: to ask them about their characters, why they chose to play them, how they approached the roles, how they felt about the way the characters ended up, what they hoped to accomplish. Going even further, I found myself wanting to ask questions of the female crew involved with the show as well: what brought them into Supernatural, what kept them there, what they loved about their roles in making the show come alive on screen, what they hoped would improve. In short, we wanted to open a dialogue, not only with the cast and crew of the show we’ve spent the last 10 years fully engrossed in, but with the fan community as a whole. We wanted to give people the opportunity they so obviously craved.</p><p>With all this said, there is a lot of work ahead. We’ve spoken with at least a dozen past and recent actresses, all of whom are eager and anticipating us giving them set-in-stone information. Academic types and crew are also on standby. People have assembled to make this happen and are just as driven as we are. This is going to happen if it’s the last thing we do. Let’s all unite to take this idea and see it flourish. Our favorite female actresses and industry ladies need our support! Tweet about it, tumble about it, tell your facebook friends and your coworkers!</p><p><b>And to quote Kim Manners: let’s kick it in the ass, shall we?</b><br/></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DwiwtO-w_LxY%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FwiwtO-w_LxY&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Ultimately, the money raised will cover the cost of attaining the space, hiring any professional staff for security and tech, as well as paying to get our lovely talent here.  Any and all remaining funds raised will be donated to charity.  Some of the amazing charities we will be supporting as follows:</p><ul>

</div></div>","(photo by Lynda L. Ciaschini)So Get This...To preface: the opinions here are expressed by me and my like-minded friends who are fans.If you walk into a crowd at any Supernatural convention, chances are a good portion of said crowd will be female-presenting. But while the audience at conventions is primarily made up of women, there is a lack of female talent at conventions and the portrayal of women on the show remains problematic. Fellow fans who desire the opportunity to interact with our favorite female characters are driven to set a plan in motion that calls for change. We want to meet our “Ladies of SPN,” but don’t have enough opportunity to do so.We want to have a conversation about the roles of women on SPN and support female characters in hopes that they can find their way to stronger and longer story lines. We all desire positive change in the media as a whole. This is a change we hope “Ladies of SPN” can garner.We love watching SPN, but many of us pine for more female driven storylines and ideas. Rarely are we given a female character with a recurring role who survived a single episode. We want female hunters that have taken up their jobs because they wanted to and had been interested in it. We want male side characters that would be equal to them instead of bumbling idiots that made the female leads look competent through their own failings. We want female character development instead of repeated cycling through same-ole-same-ole issues, without unnecessary drama and suffering — All of which is well within our SPN Family’s reach, but only if we unite and call for change.That’s basically the spark behind “Ladies of SPN Con.” We want the opportunity to talk to all these amazing female actresses: to ask them about their characters, why they chose to play them, how they approached the roles, how they felt about the way the characters ended up, what they hoped to accomplish. Going even further, I found myself wanting to ask questions of the female crew involved with the show as well: what brought them into Supernatural, what kept them there, what they loved about their roles in making the show come alive on screen, what they hoped would improve. In short, we wanted to open a dialogue, not only with the cast and crew of the show we’ve spent the last 10 years fully engrossed in, but with the fan community as a whole. We wanted to give people the opportunity they so obviously craved.With all this said, there is a lot of work ahead. We’ve spoken with at least a dozen past and recent actresses, all of whom are eager and anticipating us giving them set-in-stone information. Academic types and crew are also on standby. People have assembled to make this happen and are just as driven as we are. This is going to happen if it’s the last thing we do. Let’s all unite to take this idea and see it flourish. Our favorite female actresses and industry ladies need our support! Tweet about it, tumble about it, tell your facebook friends and your coworkers!And to quote Kim Manners: let’s kick it in the ass, shall we?What We Need & What You GetUltimately, the money raised will cover the cost of attaining the space, hiring any professional staff for security and tech, as well as paying to get our lovely talent here.  Any and all remaining funds raised will be donated to charity.  Some of the amazing charities we will be supporting as follows:

The Multiple Sclerosis Foundation: Creating A Brighter Tomorrow for individuals coping with multiple sclerosis. Supported by Rachel Miner


School on Wheels: a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to the enhancement of educational opportunities for homeless children k-12th grade. Supported by Nicki Aycox


Thirst Project: a nonprofit organization that educates students about the global water crisis and challenges them to fundraise to build wells. Supported by Madison McLaughlin


AIDS/LifeCycle: co-produced by the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and the Los Angeles LGBT Center and is designed to advance their shared interests to end the pandemic and human suffering caused by AIDS. Supported by Traci Dinwiddle


SoCal Hearts: a free camp experience that connects children who have experienced medical or life trauma, developing necessary skills and building self-esteem as a means to overcome challenges. Supported by Julie McNiven


VH1 Save The Music Foundation: a non-profit organization committed to ensuring that music instruction is a core component to a complete education, giving children the tools and confidence to excel in academics and in life. Supported by the Girls from the 200th Episode! Katie Sarife, Joy Regullano, Vivien Armour, Janina Winkler, Alyssa Lynch, Natalie Sharp, Rachel Warkentin, and Kelli Ogmundson

Homeboy Industries: Helping formerly gang-involved men and women transform their lives with free services, programs and job training in social enterprises. Supported by Lauren Tom


And many more!  
But here's the thing -- these marvelous charities won't get much if we have an empty house.  That's where you come in.  Not only do you get to meet some of your favorite actress and the amazing, talented female crew who work behind the scenes, but you get to do it all while supporting charity!  And you decide whether or not this convention takes place!

Our Goals:
$15,000 — ALL backers get into the Dealers Room 5 minutes early each day!$17,500 — The best kind of karaoke party!  Not only can we get the machine, the speakers, and someone to run it, but we will also have a SING-A-LONG with the 200th episode playing in the background ala Rocky Horror Picture Show. Make sure to bring your pajamas~!$20,000 — Additional pages get added to our Program Book where we will recognize ALL of our Backers. All backers, at any level, may choose to include their name, a nickname, favorite profile name, or remain anonymous, in this special Thank You section.$25,000 — More guests will be invited!  Who would you like to see? As a member, we invite you to tell us, when we send out the survey after the campaign ends.$30,000 — A new feature gets added... A pie social! We can now obtain the needed function space from the hotel, just so that we are able to offer this experience at all. We will complete the plans for this feature as soon as we have guests booked. And, as space for meal events like this is always limited, we will be sure to give all Backers here the first access to the passes once we make them available.We also have a few Stretch Goals triggered by how many people join us during this campaign. These counts are for the number of Adult Memberships selected via the Rewards.
100 MEMBERSHIPS — All Backed Members receive the code and link to book the hotel room 24 hours before we announce it to the world. It is possible that this code will be revealed while the campaign is still going — so keep an eye out for our Updates here.
250 MEMBERSHIPS — We step up from a Basic Program Book to a Deluxe Program Book including full color covers and graphics. This upgrade will be for everyone attending LoSCon!
400 MEMBERSHIPS — This unlocks a reward that benefits more than just you, but the entire planet as well! Instead of a cheap plastic bag, all Backer Members attending LoSCon will get an environmentally-friendly, reusable Tote (like you might use for groceries) for their Goodie Bag that is picked up at the door.
500 MEMBERSHIPS — We will make the whole convention available LIVE on the INTERNET with a special broadcast.  Keep your eyes peeled for information as it develops.

<p>My name is Aliyah and I am a very passionate English teacher! I am a rebellious advocate for adult education. I have run off to Egypt, much to my family's dismay, to teach English to street women so that they can sell their wares to tourists. I have taught academic English skills to the most amazing young Iraqis I have ever met in Syria so that they can secure scholarships at prestigious US universities and ultimately get opportunities they can't safely have in their own war-torn country. I ran off again to teach Syrians English during the war so that they had opportunities to gain residential and academic visas for the UK. I can't stand the thought that Syria (a country I lived in for almost four years) might lose an entire generation's access to education. I BELIEVE EDUCATION IS FREEDOM AND FREEDOM IS THE GREATEST GIFT IN THE WORLD.</p>
<p>When I am not giving my mother a heart attack, I teach English (ESOL) in London in the further education sector. I have over ten years experience with a degree in clinical psychology and a post-graduate certificate (PGCE) in teaching English to speakers of other languages. I feel that I am ready to put all the knowledge I have accumulated over the years into running my own projects to support people, especially female learners, whose needs I have become particularly familiar with in England and abroad. </p>

<div>
<div>
<h2>CREATE A CAFE THAT DOUBLES UP AS AN EDUCATION SERVICE PROVIDER. </h2>
<h2><br/></h2>
<div>THE CAFE WILL:</div>
<div>BE NON-PROFIT</div>
<div>BE COMMUNITY-ORIENTATED</div>
<div>FULFILL THE ROLE OF A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE</div>
<div>IMPLEMENT ACTION RESEARCH METHODS IN ORDER TO CREATE COURSES THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE USING THEM</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>WHY IS THIS PROJECT IMPORTANT?</div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Risk factors promoting poor educational attainment in children are said to be deprivation, poor housing, family conflict, parents with low educational qualifications and low family income.</span><br/></p>
<p>Not surprisingly, these are the same factors that come into play when identifying youth who are at risk of offending and being unemployed in their adult lives. And that's how families and communities get stuck in a cycle of poverty.<br/>So how can we mitigate these risk factors and their effects? <br/>I think we can focus on mothers and women in general. <br/>I want to do this by establishing a cafe premises that doubles up as a classroom on some days and is open to the general public on others. The community can be involved by helping out, buying a coffee and watching their money get put straight back into the educational services that the cafe provides.<br/>If we can educate, integrate and support mothers, with a strong focus on female refugees and asylum seekers, we can create more prosperous, peaceful communities.</p>
<p>I feel that a gender-based approach is important because our diverse society is made up of a lot of different cultures. Some do not encourage women to work or go to school. Sometimes education is not possible in a war torn country. There are many women who are illiterate in their own languages let alone English. Some do not have the English skills necessary to be independent in the UK. I hope to address the needs of these women holistically and to acknowledge them as individuals by first researching what problems they have encountered and how they think these problems can be solved. I am fed up with perpetuating an educational system that tells people what they need rather than involving them. It is time to shake things up a little. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>PROVISION THE CAFE AIMS TO OFFER:</h3>
<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">1. LIFE SKILLS</span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>My vision is to provide hard-to-reach women with the confidence to access local services and educational services. From healthy eating, financial literacy to 'know your rights' workshops, I aim to embody a holistic approach to education. We will liaise with local GPs, other charitable organisations and schools to enable referrals. We will also take groups of women for trips to engage with health providers for instance, to learn what support or care they have access to in London. Many hard-to-reach women are simply not confident enough, misinformed or unable to access this support, mainly due to lack of English. We<em> </em>would concentrate on barrier-removal for women experiencing the issues indicated above or any others they may face, the objective being to integrate these women into the local community and to provide them with opportunities that can improve their day-to-day lives. </p>
<h3>2. EDUCATION</h3>
<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There are many more factors that have been identified as being ‘barriers’ experienced by women who are hard-to-reach or ‘disadvantaged’. These barriers could be anything from stigma of being a refugee or migrant to social isolation to lack of literacy skills. Women unable to read and write are more likely to be homeless than men and more likely to earn less. In response, We </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">will run courses in English as a second language (ESOL), skills for life and literacy. We will also offer pre-entry mother and young child ESOL classes. We understand the importance of parental involvement in a child's academic attainment and we want to give mothers the tools they need to be involved. In addition to our regular courses, we aim to offer 'Do homework with your child' workshops. If a mother can participate in her child's education, that child has a stronger chance of achieving, gaining employment in the future and breaking the family poverty cycle, in turn creating more prosperous communities. </span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>3. EMPLOYABILITY</h3>
<p></p>
</div>
<p></p>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sixty percent of Somali, Turkish, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are economically inactive. In turn, these ethnic groups experience exceptionally high levels of deprivation. Children from these backgrounds also tend to produce lower levels of achievement at school, possibly due to having English as a second language but highly likely to be the result of living in domestic conditions classed as ‘deprived’. My</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> mission is to provide women with a route to paid employment through gaining experience, volunteering in local charity shops. I</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> believe that education and learning occurs not only within the classroom but outside. Furthermore I believe in providing opportunities to break the poverty cycle so many families in the UK are finding themselves stuck in. We will offer CV writing and cover letter writing classes and assist women with applying for jobs. </span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need </span><br/></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div><div> <p>We need about 30,000 pounds to start-up within a London borough. Possibly Islington/Finsbury Park/Waltham Forest. Due to the nature of the project and the people I want to work with, having a regular, stable place to go to for assistance is vital. I had considered pop-ups but this is a community-based venture that will require the involvement and investment of the locals and that can't happen if we are moving all the time. The money will go toward renting a cafe premises, buying resources and materials such as books and an interactive white board for the academic side of things as well as food. I aim to start small, serving hot drinks, cakes and ready-made sandwiches and then possibly work up to meals.  </p>
<p>All expenses and the journey of setting up the cafe will be documented on my blog: <a href=""http://www.educatetoliberate.co.uk/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.educatetoliberate.co.uk/blog/</a> </p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>I am very confident in dealing with the educational aspect of this project and I have a lot of amazing people with experience willing to assist me in the business side of things. We all have to start somewhere and the idea of regretting not trying this scares me more than the idea of failing. </p>
<p>If I don't manage to raise enough money, any donation you make will go towards the people of Syria in some form. Whether it will be donated to refugees or fund a smaller project, I will of course keep you informed. </p>
<p>If more money is raised it will all go toward the cafe. </p>

I feel that I am ready to put all the knowledge I have accumulated over the years into running my own projects to support people, especially female learners, whose needs I have become particularly familiar with in England and abroad. 





MISSION: 


CREATE A CAFE THAT DOUBLES UP AS AN EDUCATION SERVICE PROVIDER. 

THE CAFE WILL:
BE NON-PROFIT
BE COMMUNITY-ORIENTATED
FULFILL THE ROLE OF A SOCIAL ENTERPRISE
IMPLEMENT ACTION RESEARCH METHODS IN ORDER TO CREATE COURSES THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE USING THEM

WHY IS THIS PROJECT IMPORTANT?
Risk factors promoting poor educational attainment in children are said to be deprivation, poor housing, family conflict, parents with low educational qualifications and low family income.
Not surprisingly, these are the same factors that come into play when identifying youth who are at risk of offending and being unemployed in their adult lives. And that's how families and communities get stuck in a cycle of poverty.So how can we mitigate these risk factors and their effects? I think we can focus on mothers and women in general. I want to do this by establishing a cafe premises that doubles up as a classroom on some days and is open to the general public on others. The community can be involved by helping out, buying a coffee and watching their money get put straight back into the educational services that the cafe provides.If we can educate, integrate and support mothers, with a strong focus on female refugees and asylum seekers, we can create more prosperous, peaceful communities.
I feel that a gender-based approach is important because our diverse society is made up of a lot of different cultures. Some do not encourage women to work or go to school. Sometimes education is not possible in a war torn country. There are many women who are illiterate in their own languages let alone English. Some do not have the English skills necessary to be independent in the UK. I hope to address the needs of these women holistically and to acknowledge them as individuals by first researching what problems they have encountered and how they think these problems can be solved. I am fed up with perpetuating an educational system that tells people what they need rather than involving them. It is time to shake things up a little. 
PROVISION THE CAFE AIMS TO OFFER:




1. LIFE SKILLS


My vision is to provide hard-to-reach women with the confidence to access local services and educational services. From healthy eating, financial literacy to 'know your rights' workshops, I aim to embody a holistic approach to education. We will liaise with local GPs, other charitable organisations and schools to enable referrals. We will also take groups of women for trips to engage with health providers for instance, to learn what support or care they have access to in London. Many hard-to-reach women are simply not confident enough, misinformed or unable to access this support, mainly due to lack of English. We would concentrate on barrier-removal for women experiencing the issues indicated above or any others they may face, the objective being to integrate these women into the local community and to provide them with opportunities that can improve their day-to-day lives. 
2. EDUCATION




There are many more factors that have been identified as being ‘barriers’ experienced by women who are hard-to-reach or ‘disadvantaged’. These barriers could be anything from stigma of being a refugee or migrant to social isolation to lack of literacy skills. Women unable to read and write are more likely to be homeless than men and more likely to earn less. In response, We will run courses in English as a second language (ESOL), skills for life and literacy. We will also offer pre-entry mother and young child ESOL classes. We understand the importance of parental involvement in a child's academic attainment and we want to give mothers the tools they need to be involved. In addition to our regular courses, we aim to offer 'Do homework with your child' workshops. If a mother can participate in her child's education, that child has a stronger chance of achieving, gaining employment in the future and breaking the family poverty cycle, in turn creating more prosperous communities. 


3. EMPLOYABILITY




Sixty percent of Somali, Turkish, Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are economically inactive. In turn, these ethnic groups experience exceptionally high levels of deprivation. Children from these backgrounds also tend to produce lower levels of achievement at school, possibly due to having English as a second language but highly likely to be the result of living in domestic conditions classed as ‘deprived’. My mission is to provide women with a route to paid employment through gaining experience, volunteering in local charity shops. I believe that education and learning occurs not only within the classroom but outside. Furthermore I believe in providing opportunities to break the poverty cycle so many families in the UK are finding themselves stuck in. We will offer CV writing and cover letter writing classes and assist women with applying for jobs. 



What We Need 



 We need about 30,000 pounds to start-up within a London borough. Possibly Islington/Finsbury Park/Waltham Forest. Due to the nature of the project and the people I want to work with, having a regular, stable place to go to for assistance is vital. I had considered pop-ups but this is a community-based venture that will require the involvement and investment of the locals and that can't happen if we are moving all the time. The money will go toward renting a cafe premises, buying resources and materials such as books and an interactive white board for the academic side of things as well as food. I aim to start small, serving hot drinks, cakes and ready-made sandwiches and then possibly work up to meals.  
All expenses and the journey of setting up the cafe will be documented on my blog: http://www.educatetoliberate.co.uk/blog/ 
Risks & Challenges
 I am very confident in dealing with the educational aspect of this project and I have a lot of amazing people with experience willing to assist me in the business side of things. We all have to start somewhere and the idea of regretting not trying this scares me more than the idea of failing. 
If I don't manage to raise enough money, any donation you make will go towards the people of Syria in some form. Whether it will be donated to refugees or fund a smaller project, I will of course keep you informed. 
If more money is raised it will all go toward the cafe.

<div>
<p>Our students have been able to <i><b>reduce their stress levels</b></i>, return to <i><b>normal sleeping patterns</b></i>, heal, transform, reduce blood pressure and <i><b>empower themselves</b></i>. As a result of the training they have an extra protection from some of the worst effects of stress; cancer, heart disease, <i><b>depression</b></i> and nervous breakdowns. Some have even saved their marriages. <i><b>Everybody who does the course repeatedly scores us 10/10</b></i>. <br/></p>
<p>Lots of our students are <i><b>nurses</b></i> and they have learned a life skill through learning LTE mindfulness meditation to protect them from; stress, burnout and compassion fatigue.</p>
<p>We have been studied by an independent researcher at The University of Galway for one year. They saw that <i><b>our training programs significantly reduce stress levels and significantly increase compassion</b></i>. This is a unique evidence based European study. <br/></p>

We have now trained more people than Google in mindfulness meditation. To train many more we need your support to reach our goal of 10,000 people, families & people in crisis. 

Our students have been able to reduce their stress levels, return to normal sleeping patterns, heal, transform, reduce blood pressure and empower themselves. As a result of the training they have an extra protection from some of the worst effects of stress; cancer, heart disease, depression and nervous breakdowns. Some have even saved their marriages. Everybody who does the course repeatedly scores us 10/10. 
Lots of our students are nurses and they have learned a life skill through learning LTE mindfulness meditation to protect them from; stress, burnout and compassion fatigue.
We have been studied by an independent researcher at The University of Galway for one year. They saw that our training programs significantly reduce stress levels and significantly increase compassion. This is a unique evidence based European study. 
Mindfulness meditation is being shown more and more to have a positive benefit on all areas of society where its practised and implemented; healthcare, education, leadership and many, many workplaces.

We have four social aims in the work we do with mindfulness;

improve standards of mindfulness practice

increase compassion, self compassion and self esteem in society


enhance relationship experience & quality of life


effect profound healings and transformations

Looking at the feedback forms from our clients we can tell you we are well on our way to achieving all of the above. Check out testimonials click here Learning to Exhale Testimonials - Mindfulness 
""The course has helped make sense
 of the numbness I was   feeling - understand that I was shutting myself
 off from loved ones and   life. I realized how critical I am of myself

improving, keen to keep walking on."" - Sharon""Wonderful experience, feel light!"" - Geraldine

what I have."" - Anne Marie

<br/><p><b>Brief History of SKIFF:</b></p>
<p>The Salaam Kivu International Film Festival (SKIFF) was founded in 2005, when the war in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo was escalating and the region, as defined by international press outlets, was exclusively a place of violence and despair. To combat both the frustration of the local community and the misrepresentation of the international media, internationally acclaimed filmmaker and activist Petna Ndaliko Katondolo launched SKIFF, the first international film festival in the DRC. Since its inception, SKIFF has been a vehicle for peace, positive socio-political transformation, and has provided the wider world with an increasingly diverse vision of the east of Congo, one that includes exceptional talent, beauty, and joy despite the challenges of the region.</p>
<p>After nearly a decade of steady growth, SKIFF now regularly brings together more than 15,000 people from around the world, who want to participate in a meaningful event that,time and again, confirms the power of art and culture to change the world for the better.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433136686/hord8ve2omj0cbjwecir.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When SKIFF began in 2005, it was the first event of its kind in many ways. Not only was it the first venue that brought a diverse selection of international films and videos to Congo, it was also the first time the local community gathered together with force around their artistic talents. Despite the backdrop of soldiers and tanks moving through the streets as rebel troops advanced within 5 kilometers of the city, even at the first edition of SKIFF thousands of people came together in a non-violent demonstration calling for peace. The collective effect of this gathering was a growing awareness among the community that art is central to the practice of peace. With this knowledge, the community has become increasingly empowered to speak out about social problems and advocate positive solutions.</p>
<p><b>Brief History of Yole!Africa:</b></p>
<p>Yole!Africa, founded in 2000 by internationally acclaimed Congolese filmmaker and activist Petna Ndaliko, is a center for creativity and cultural exchange based in Goma, in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Yole!Africa is based on the belief that offering local populations – and youth in particular – tools of non-violent self-expression and critical thought will allow them to participate actively in shaping their own realities.</p>
<p>The center’s mission is to promote peace through art and culture as well as to operate as a platform for exchange where young people from different backgrounds and social status can come together to express themselves through their talents.</p>

<p>Yolé!Africa is neither a political nor a denominational organization, through its programs it promotes and encourages value and respect for all human beings (regardless of race, origin, religion, ethnicity or gender), and stands against all forms of exploitation or violation of human rights. As an organization, Yole!Africa seeks to promote and encourage art. It supports artists and offers them a place conducive to creativity. It also links the community and its artists in order to strengthen the common culture and identity. Through trainings, workshops and community events, Yole!Africa promotes dialogue and respect for others and, through debate and reflection on current social and political issues, generates the awareness that everyone is an actor of her/his life and of the society in which she/he lives and has the right and duty to make of it a better place.</p>

While this is the total that we'll need to reach our goal. Obviously, if we don't, we'll use what we have to continue to build on the core elements of our lab. Depending on our total funding, we'll prioritize camera's and editing equipment as those are both essential components for the youth to get started.

Remember what Gaius Kowene says in the video ""SKIFF is a necessity for young people here in the region…
for me [the festival] is an inspiration showing that we can do something great.” Let's work together to make this possible for more youth in the region.


    The Challenges
Yole!Africa has an outstanding reputation in the area and is at the heart of the community. Yet In a region where 8 million people have died in the last 25 years poverty and constant displacement are an issue security can at times be an issue. We have had one incident of theft in the past five years, yet we were able to recover majority of the equipment stolen. While theft is always an impending threat, by and large the organization has taken significant steps to prevent a second breach of security on the premises. We taken measures to prevent a recurrence  by heightening our security measures and hiring a guard to stay on the premises at all times. Additionally, the system for renting out equipment is more rigorous and requires more strict identification now than it did before. All of this helps us to control (without hindering youth from access) who is on the premises at all times.   Other Ways You Can Help What are the chances you read all of this and felt so inspired you went to open your wallet only to remember there isn't much green inside? Well not to worry! We are always looking for in-kind donations and all sorts of different contributions.

 (formally and informally) up until the age of about eight.  It has become a prevalent public policy issue
in many places in the world, as municipal, state, and federal lawmakers
consider funding for preschool and pre-k. ECE focus on five developmental
domains of childhood development which include: Physical, emotional, language,
and cognitive skills. But Most of the children in the world who live in slums
do not have access to education due to many reasons. <br/><br/><br/>The
education system there can sometimes be unfair, challenging, and brutal for
children who are not enough prepared to compete; children who are not given the
proper support as well as attention from their parents and families. The main
reasons behind that is political instability, poverty, environmental disaster
and many other reasons that we may not be aware of, regardless of what reasons

important?
Early
childhood education is a branch of education theory which relates to the teaching of young children
 (formally and informally) up until the age of about eight.  It has become a prevalent public policy issue
in many places in the world, as municipal, state, and federal lawmakers
consider funding for preschool and pre-k. ECE focus on five developmental
domains of childhood development which include: Physical, emotional, language,
and cognitive skills. But Most of the children in the world who live in slums
do not have access to education due to many reasons. The
education system there can sometimes be unfair, challenging, and brutal for
children who are not enough prepared to compete; children who are not given the
proper support as well as attention from their parents and families. The main
reasons behind that is political instability, poverty, environmental disaster
and many other reasons that we may not be aware of, regardless of what reasons
there are to it, the result most likely isn't in the favor of the child or the
community.""  political instability ""This Picture taken In Gaza-Palestine by Media Town.""  political instability ""This Picture taken In Gaza-Palestine by Media Town.

We, as SEED,
a team consisting of college students who are living in a historic conflict
zone called Palestine. Many of the children in here are victims of trauma,
violence, war, blockade, poverty and many unthinkable horrors that children
shouldn't be subject to, which is the case in many other places around the
world like Syria, Yamen, Nigeria, Sudan .. etc. Having access to ECE is
sometimes easy, but healing the scars in the souls of the children can be a
challenge in many of these regions. We represent
the power of change, the youth, the future leaders in those societies and we
want to make a change that we ask you take part of. 
Our
objectives:  


· 
Enforce holistic, effective and affordable pre-school programs, which
is accessible by everyone.


· 
Involve other children or members of the family where possible – this
could generate important spillovers.


· 
Close the gap in school achievement
that often exists between poor and minority children and their middle-class
friends.


· 
Share the goal of enhancing early learning
and development through cognitively stimulating activities.


· 
Having positive impacts on children’s
cognitive skills and/or school outcomes, with the largest effects reported from
some state pre-K programs.


Why do we care? Why should you
care?


· 
Measures of brain activity show that
during the second half of a child's first year, the prefrontal cortex, the seat
of forethought and logic forms synapses at such a rate, that it consumes twice
as much energy as an adult brain. That furious pace continues for the child's
first decade of life.


· 
During the first month of life, the
number of connections or synapses, dramatically increases from 50 trillion to 1
quadrillion. If an infant's body grew at a comparable rate, his weight would
increase from 8.5 pounds at birth to 170 pounds at one month old.


· 
90% of brain growth happens by age 5.


· 
At cost of 50,000-100,000$ per year
quality childcare is just not affordable and accessible for many parents.


What are we going to do
about it?
Creating a
nongovernmental, nonprofit program with partners from the local community as well
as international partners, and private companies that understand the need for a
safe, stable, developing community.
The star
players of our team are college students who are looking to make a change.
Hence the program will run in partnership with universities that understand the
need to invest in ECE, which in return will increase the number of students
seeking higher education. How can that help solve the problem?  


· 
Motivated students with skills and qualifications will
be selected by the university system to take part in the program.


· 
Following the selection process, each student will be
trained by different specialized parties on several levels. 


· 
A list of existing local day-cares and informal
kindergartens will be at hand. Based on their skills and place of residence
each student will be provided with a timetable and a list of activities which
he must carry out in one of the day-cares as part of the program.

 Each student
will have a profile on our website, where he will be evaluated by the
supervisors, parents, and our partners. Based on this evaluation students will

Buy school supplies for 20 students –

Why should you support us? 
Our team was never permitted a visa to the UAE due to the
situation in our home town Gaza, which was never a reason for us to give up.
We had no resources to work with, no sponsors or partners who
were willing to provide any sort of help or mentoring. 
We really want to make a holistic change, not only for the
children but also for the youth and housewives in every underprivileged. Sponsored Institutions:

<p>Hello! We are
Sarah and Melanie, the founders of Cleveland Tutors. We are asking for your
help to provide high-quality tutoring for low-income students in the Cleveland
metropolitan area through the Cleveland Tutors Scholarship Fund. But first,
we’d like to tell you a bit about who we are and why we’re running this
campaign now.</p>
<div align=""center"">
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431042755/y3bwcph1cvqjnxsu0nqs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>Sarah and Melanie
both grew up in Shaker Heights, OH, a historic suburb of Cleveland, OH.
However, they didn’t know each other until the summer of 2013 when Sarah moved
back to Cleveland after over 15 years away, including time spent in Colorado,
England, and Germany, while she was completing her MA<span></span> and Ph.D. in International Relations and
teaching at the university level in her field. After her Ph.D., she worked in
social services in Seattle, WA, but decided to return to teaching in her
hometown. Starting in the fall of 2013, she divided her time among part-time
university teaching in the Cleveland area, substitute teaching for the
Cleveland Heights-University Heights School District, and independent tutoring. Sarah saw there was a huge demand for tutoring, but not everyone could afford it.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431804351/viondybbrxpkd6efri0m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<div align=""center"">
<p></p>
</div>
<p>At the same time, Melanie was working for the Cleveland Metropolitan School
District in Human Resources supporting principals’, students’, and the central
office’s blend of personnel and technological needs for substitute teachers. As
she had for much of the last 14 years, she found she was happiest when teaching
and training others. As she coached youth ice hockey in Cleveland Heights, she realized that teaching was her passion, especially helping players one on one and in small groups. While she was helping the school district, Melanie also
began taking Master’s level education classes, eventually adding a part-time
job tutoring 5<sup>th</sup>-7<sup>th</sup> grade students in another local
suburb.<span> Melanie recognized that many students needed extra support to get tutoring, but their families didn't have the financial resources to help.<br/></span></p>
<p>Between Sarah’s extensive teaching and tutoring career and Melanie’s business
and education background, it only made sense for both to be tutors and to work
together to build a tutoring company.</p>
<p></p>So, in March of
2015 they founded Cleveland Tutors.

</div>
<p>There
are lots of companies out there that provide a marketplace to connect tutors
and students. Sarah was working with one of those companies before. <br/>Why start a
new one?</p>
<p>Here are three
important reasons:</p>
<p><span>1)<span> 
</span></span><i>Not
all of these competing “tutor-student marketplace” sites verify their tutors’
educational qualifications.</i> Instead, some create their own “certifications” or quizzes
to assess whether someone is qualified to tutor. These arbitrary
“certifications” lead to …</p>
<p><span>2)<span> 
</span></span><i>Lack
of transparency and accountability</i>. Who chooses the content of these tests?
What research shows that a quiz is an accurate measurement of subject and
teaching knowledge?<span>  If you take the SAT,
you know that the College Board is behind it. But if you take XYZ Tutoring
Company’s test about geology, how do you know that someone qualified in
assessment and in the field in question wrote it?</span></p>
<p><span>3)<span> 
</span></span><i>Personal
relationships matter</i>. Yes, big tutoring ""marketplaces"" have customer service
staff. But, do they know their tutors and their students personally?</p>
<div align=""center"">
<br/><p align=""center""><b><span></span></b></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1432254/files/20150501070238-Tutoring_5_1_15.jpg?1430488958"" src="""" style=""width: 331.017px; height: 248px;""/></b></p>

<b></b><p></p>
</div>


So, Melanie and Sarah personally interview every tutor and verify their
transcripts to make sure every candidate is qualified to tutor. Since different
people want various levels of support finding a tutor, Sarah and Melanie created <a href=""http://www.clevelandtutors.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.clevelandtutors.com</a> themselves to
help students find a tutor and schedule a meeting in seconds or communicate directly
with them so students can find the right fit with a tutor. Beyond making the
match between tutors and students, they also provide continuing, available support
for the tutor-student relationship. Building relationships this way is also an
important means for them to be able to make a positive contribution to the
community.<br/><br/>

Since
March, Melanie and Sarah have done more than build a website. They have been
hard at work networking in the community, designing marketing materials, and,
of course, tutoring. They also brought on two additional tutors, Margaret
Richardson, Ph.D. and T.J. Kohlrust, MA. Now, they could offer tutoring in over 20 subjects. The community’s responses to Cleveland Tutors have been
positive. However, they are still a new company, and becoming known takes time.
From the very beginning, Sarah and Melanie were dedicated to serving the
community. When they think of the community, it means all people, not just
people who can easily afford a tutor’s services.<span>  People who can’t easily pay for a tutor should
have the same access to a tutor that wealthy people do.<br/><br/></span>
<p>In
order to serve the community sooner and more effectively, they decided to run
this campaign for the Cleveland Tutors Scholarship Fund.</p>

<p></p>Melanie
and Sarah’s combined tutoring, teaching, and coaching experience totals over 12
years. They have guided people from all walks of life, from youth ice hockey
players to graduate and professional students. The diversity among the students
is striking, including various ages, experiences, and income levels. Because
Melanie and Sarah have worked with such a variety of students, they agree
that tutoring is for everyone. Everyone should have the opportunity to work
with a tutor if they need one—regardless of their ability to pay.<br/><br/><p>We’re running
this campaign so that we can provide free, high-quality tutoring to the
community this summer. For many students, summer is a time when they need
tutoring the most in order to catch up and/or prepare to retake tests they may
not have passed the first time. Tutoring also provides a much needed diversion
for students who may not have many other activities on their schedules. </p>

<div align=""left"">Students
at Title I schools (schools where all or the majority of students qualify for

which would be renewable on the basis of need and the availability of funds.

<p align=""center""></p>
</div>
<p></p>Several
reasons. The data on Title I schools is readily available. There is consensus
among economists and government agencies that this is an indication of low
income status. Further, it preserves the dignity of the scholarship applicants
and their families by not asking them to reveal details about their personal
financial situation.<br/><br/><p></p><div align=""center""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432224336/ujepcojplgdwnp0gqnit.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></div>Hold on a minute! Why are tutors being paid $40/hour? If a non-profit 
were running this campaign, they would be able to serve many more people
 because their tutors would be volunteers or paid much less. Well, low 
pay is a problem we want to address. How can we raise funds to serve a 
population who wouldn't be able to afford to work with a tutor on one 
hand, while paying tutors low wages that mean they can't afford to live?
 $40/hour is a fair living wage for a self-employed tutor. A tutor 
making $40/hour is accepting a mid-range wage for the field (tutoring 
rates range from $15-$120/hour, depending on experience, location, and 
subject tutored). And remember, a self-employed person pays higher 
taxes. Finally, hourly rates acknowledge that a tutor isn't just working
 when he or she is with a student; tutors must prepare for each session 
and stay up to date on their fields.

</div>

For
the sake of fairness, allocating scholarships of 10 hours or less ensures that
as many students as possible get a chance to receive tutoring. If funds are
still available, students may apply to renew their 10 hour scholarships. We
will notify students if this becomes possible.<br/><p></p>

Now, we've heard people say, ""Cleveland Tutors isn't a non-profit, so I can't give to your scholarship fund."" Here's the thing, though: non-profits pay their employees, too. They don't magically convert 100% of the money they receive into serving the needs of others. They can't. Non-profits have overhead: salaries, utility bills, office space. By contrast, Cleveland Tutors has nothing to pay but the cost of a few materials and postage for some donors' thank you gifts. The rest of the funds go directly to tutors' rates. And since tutoring is the service we're providing to meet the needs of others, that means that nearly all of the funds raised go towards directly serving the population in need. Your donations make it possible for tutors to give their time, energy, and expertise to students who need them.<br/><br/><div align=""center"">

help to provide high-quality tutoring for low-income students in the Cleveland

we’d like to tell you a bit about who we are and why we’re running this

Sarah and Melanie

<h3>Why is Classroom Champions important to kids and schools?</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Classroom Champions is an innovator in social and emotional education across the continent. Our unique method sees thousands of students' lives changed on a yearly basis at a fraction of the cost of traditional programs that see similar results. Social and emotional learning is so important that the renowned Brookings Institute recently said social and emotional development is the next school reform frontier and quoted that:</span></p>
<p><b><i>""...for every dollar invested in Social and Emotional Learning programs, there is a return of eleven dollars, a rate of economic return that would be the envy even of hedge funds.""</i></b></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""><b><i>- Brookings Institute</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A University of Alberta study highlighted the program of engagement in Canadian schools in 2011. They found that up to 66% of Canadian students are considered disengaged in school. They state that bored, restless, disruptive, and disengaged students in the short term have clearly documented negative impacts on students, teachers, schools, and communities - and that students could be graduating incapable of or unprepared for a productive and healthy life.</p>
<p>Well, 100% of Classroom Champions teachers say being a part of the program INCREASED ENGAGEMENT in their classrooms. If you were engaged, would you be more likely to attend work or school? Would you be better at what you do?</p>
<p>For the past five years Classroom Champions has been partnering with teachers in the schools that need our help the most to change the lives of the kids they teach.

<h3>Why Admiring</h3></span><p>
</p>
<p>Smartphones are capable of doing much more than just making phone calls now, with the capabilities &amp; convenience they also bring vulnerabilities. Since we <span>often came across sensitive, personal information through various mobile applications, security &amp; privacy are extremely important.</span></p>
<p><span>Passwords, keys, and fingerprints are the conventional method we use to protect our smartphones. Yet, these can be copied &amp; reproduced. We need something that is unique &amp; cannot be duplicated to improve the safety level.</span></p>
<p><span>With the expertise of our team, we created ""</span><b>Admiring</b><span>"". A patent approved, batteryless, waterproof wearable device that helps us to protect the information on our smartphone by our choice. </span></p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><span>Q: My skin is allergic to nickel, does the material of Admiring contain
nickel?<br/>
<span>A: No, Admiring is made of nickel-free, aircraft grade titanium.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Q: What mobile operating system does Admiring
Application Support? <br/>
A: Admiring currently supports Android operating system. A Windows Phone
applications will follow.

</span></p>
<p><span>Q: What are the requirements on my phone to use
Admiring?<br/>
A: The only requirement is that your phone supports NFC. If your phone
does not support NFC, you can still use Admiring for opening the NFC
doors. Our designers will appreciate you for choosing to wear it purely for the
stylish design!

</span></p>
<p><span>Q: Does Admiring work with iPhone?<br/>
A: Because iPhone doesn’t support NFC, so you cannot use it with Admiring.
However, if you still want to use both of them, you can consider buying an NFC

<p>When acting and movement coach, Elaine Hall’s (Founder of
The Miracle Project) son was diagnosed with autism, at age two, traditional
therapies did not work for him.  She
discovered that she could reach him through music, movement and theater.  She then trained her creative friends,
musicians, dancers, actors how to understand autism from the inside out and
join her sons isolated world. Slowly her son emerged into our world. Elaine
developed these methods into the 'seven keys to unlock autism' and created The
Miracle Project, a theater and film program for all abilities and disabilities.
</p>
<p>Since then, hundreds of children and young adults have
participated in The Miracle Project, developing meaningful friendships, easing
anxiety, while creating and performing in an original musical theater
production. Performers with disabilities find their voice and express
themselves with confidence.  Non-disabled

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>My name is Jacques Sebisaho and I'm the founder and CEO of Amani Global Works, a non-profit that works in public health on the island of Idjwi in the DRC. I grew up on Idwji Island and when I went back to visit as an adult, I could no longer stand by and watch an entire community struggle and suffer due to the lack of basic public health services. In only 5 years, I founded Amani Global Works and we have since built a fully equipped hospital on the island, staffed with qualified local doctors and nurses, began an agricultural community program, a daily nutrition program where local children could come twice a day to receive a free nutrient-rich porridge to supplement their normal diet and ensure that the children could escape the vicious cycle of malnourishment and disease, and a family planning program to confront the exponential population growth in Idjwi. </p>
<p>However, shortly after beginning the nutrition program we encountered a problem. Because it was often a long journey from the children's homes to our hospital, many children dropped out of school, came to the hospital in the morning for the morning porridge, then simply waited around the hospital grounds until the afternoon for their second porridge. Of course we couldn't allow all the children on Idjwi Island to drop out of school for health's sake, so we decided to start a small school on the hospital grounds. What we discovered was that the rate of girls not attending school on the island was much higher than that of boys not attending school, so because we had very limited resources and couldn't accept all the children, we decided to open our school to the girls of Idjwi. </p>
<p>Since the opening, we have had 140 girls enroll, but we still do not even have a school building for them! We have been meeting in an old church building with dirt floors and old, dilapidated walls that is not a suitable space for a school. We have hired qualified teachers, and direct some of our budget from the hospital to buy school supplies for them, but we are making plans to build a fully equipped school for the girls with enough room to accommodate 400 students!</p>

<h3>The Project </h3>
<ul>
<li>Our budget to build the school is $100,000. This cost will include the building materials, labor costs, and furnishing the school. At Amani Global Works we believe in paying our workers a fair wage, and we operate in good faith in partnership with the community. The quoted price reflects those attitudes in our construction. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Experience</h3>
<p>Amani Global Works has been working with the community on Idjwi Island officially since 2005. However, our founder grew up on the island and has had strong community ties there all his life. In 2012 we began construction on a hospital in Idjwi that we completed in 2014. That hospital is now fully functional and fully staffed and proves our experience on Idjwi Island and our ability to drive projects to completion. Our close connection with the community allows us to complete projects more easily and quickly than many non-profit organizations. </p>
<ul>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What are the risks?</h3>
<p>The only risk we anticipate is the project taking longer than envisioned due to a lack of funding or various other delays. However, we have decided and are fully committed to building a school, so the only eventuality to consider is the time frame and funds available (which dictates how fast we can build). </p>

</div></div>","Who We Are
My name is Jacques Sebisaho and I'm the founder and CEO of Amani Global Works, a non-profit that works in public health on the island of Idjwi in the DRC. I grew up on Idwji Island and when I went back to visit as an adult, I could no longer stand by and watch an entire community struggle and suffer due to the lack of basic public health services. In only 5 years, I founded Amani Global Works and we have since built a fully equipped hospital on the island, staffed with qualified local doctors and nurses, began an agricultural community program, a daily nutrition program where local children could come twice a day to receive a free nutrient-rich porridge to supplement their normal diet and ensure that the children could escape the vicious cycle of malnourishment and disease, and a family planning program to confront the exponential population growth in Idjwi. 
However, shortly after beginning the nutrition program we encountered a problem. Because it was often a long journey from the children's homes to our hospital, many children dropped out of school, came to the hospital in the morning for the morning porridge, then simply waited around the hospital grounds until the afternoon for their second porridge. Of course we couldn't allow all the children on Idjwi Island to drop out of school for health's sake, so we decided to start a small school on the hospital grounds. What we discovered was that the rate of girls not attending school on the island was much higher than that of boys not attending school, so because we had very limited resources and couldn't accept all the children, we decided to open our school to the girls of Idjwi. 
Since the opening, we have had 140 girls enroll, but we still do not even have a school building for them! We have been meeting in an old church building with dirt floors and old, dilapidated walls that is not a suitable space for a school. We have hired qualified teachers, and direct some of our budget from the hospital to buy school supplies for them, but we are making plans to build a fully equipped school for the girls with enough room to accommodate 400 students!
From UNESCO:











Educated women are less likely to die in childbirth: 






If all mothers completed primary education, maternal deaths would be reduced by two-thirds, saving 98,000 lives 
In sub-Saharan Africa, if all women completed primary education, maternal deaths would be reduced by 70%, saving almost 50,000 lives. 

Educating girls can save millions of lives: 
If all women had a primary education, there would be 15% fewer child deaths. 
If all women had a secondary education, child deaths would be cut in half, saving 3 million lives. 



Mothers’ education improves child nutrition 
If all women had a primary education, 1.7 million children would be saved from stunting from malnutrition. 
If all women had a secondary education, 12 million children would be saved from stunting from malnutrition

Girls with higher levels of education are less likely to have children at an early age 
         10% fewer girls would become pregnant under 17 years in sub-Saharan Africa            and South and West Asia if they all had a primary education 
         Almost 60% fewer girls would become pregnant under 17 years in sub-Saharan          Africa and South and West Asia if they all had a secondary education. 


Educating girls is a key factor in hastening the demographic transition to lower birth rates. 
         In sub-Saharan Africa, women with no education have 6.7 births, on average.              The figure falls to 5.8 for those with primary education and more than halves,              to 3.9, for those with secondary education. 



Girls with higher levels of education are less likely to get married at an early age 
         If all girls had a primary education, there would be 14% fewer child marriages 
         If all girls had a secondary education, there would be two-thirds fewer child                  marriages 


Education narrows pay gaps between men and women 
         In Pakistan, women with a primary education earn 51% what men earn. With a            secondary education, they earn 70% what men earn 
         In Jordan, women with a primary education earn 53% what men earn. With a              secondary education, they earn 67% what men earn 


Educated women are more likely to find work: 
         In Brazil, only 37% of women with less than primary education are in work. This          rises to 50% if they have a primary education, and 60% with a secondary                      education

At Amani Global Works we believe in paying our workers a fair wage, and we operate in good faith in partnership with the community. The quoted price reflects those attitudes in our construction.

Amani Global Works has been working with the community on Idjwi Island officially since 2005. However, our founder grew up on the island and has had strong community ties there all his life.

<p> I am here because I want to ask for your support on my path of achieving  my dream to study Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation at one of the world's best universities- Copenhagen University  Denmark.</p>
<p> I was studying Geography but 4 years ago I took one of the best decisions in my life. I decided to leave Romania and go study Environmental Science in one of the most green, innovative  and progressive countries in the world . A decision that completely changed my life and I am very happy for that. The idea behind my class was that students from many different countries live together and study to become agents of change in the field of Sustainability and Climate Change.</p>
<p>After 4 years I find myself facing another decision that is going to change my life. I recently got offered a place in the Master of Science in Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation by the University of Copenhagen  . I was keeping my eyes on this master programme in the last 3 years and of course that I am  very happy to see the acceptance letter knowing that there were over 300 applicants on 60 available places.  It was not easy to get in but competition is always good !</p>
<p>I believe that Climate Change is one of the biggest challenges that humanity has to face and it is going to affect people, plants and animals and the way we are used with living on the planet. It is maybe the greatest moral, economic and social challenge of our time.  It is therefore important to understand the processes and the dynamics of the change in order to find the best way of mitigating and adapting to the problems that we are going to face altogether.  </p>
<p>The best way of dealing with the climate change is to invest in education and raise environmental awareness.</p>
<p>Copenhagen is one of the most expensive cities in the world and the rent in some of the student dorms can go up to 1000 $. It is actually the most expensive city in EU and  this is why I decided to ask you for help.  I was lucky to get room in one of the cheapest dorms that will cost me only 6000 $ per year.</p>
<p>My parents passed away and I have nobody to support me. Being in such a difficult position, I had no choice but to work every weekend in the last couple of years in order to pay for my studies.</p>
<p>By doing this campaign I will not have to work during weekends anymore and I in this way will have more time to invest in my studies. The money from this campaign will be used to pay for my accommodation for the next 2 years and I will try to cover the rest of my expenses from my own savings or by working during summer time. If I don't reach my goal, there will be no option but to work in the nights and in weekends knowing that this is going to affect my studies.</p>
<p>I was worried about how could I make it real until one friend gave me the idea of trying to crowdfund it. It is not easy for me to ask for personal support from other people as I like to be independent just like everybody else. It always felt a bit embarrassing and it requires a lot of courage  but at the same time I believe that there are a lot of people that care about climate change and even more people that would support someone’s education.</p>
<p>By supporting me you are giving me the possibility to have more free time that I could allocate to my studies. My commitment to you is that I will do my best !</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How can you help </p>
<p>1. Make a donation.  The good news is that I don't have to pay tuition fee. For my expenses, a donation of $50 could make all the difference. In fact, we will reach our fundraising goal if 240 people give $50 each !</p>
<p>2. Spread the word. If this isn’t the right time for you to give money, you can still support my studies by telling your friends about this campaign. Just emailing this video to 10 friends, reposting on your Facebook page, or Tweeting about it could make a significant difference.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings. Thank you for stopping by.</p>
<p>My name is Chido Musasiwa-Gutu and I am the founder of LET THEM TRUST – a child-oriented creative, educational and cultural initiative that is a platform for young Zimbabweans to develop and showcase artistic talent and learn who they are along the way.</p>
<p>Founded in 2010, LET THEM TRUST was conceived to preserve traditional and cultural heritage through Ngano (traditional storytelling) plays in schools, but has now evolved into a thriving and diverse kids-centred arts organization.<br/><br/>Zimbabwe is a culturally rich nation with proud and valuable traditions and heritage. But, the reality of the modern world sees our youth increasingly look elsewhere for stimulation, role models, answers … We don’t object to this per se, we simply attempt to redress the balance.</p>
<p>Incorporating workshops and discussion, LET THEM TRUST gives our participants a voice, we lend an ear, and we provide options for how young people can navigate the specific issues that affect them as Zimbabweans in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. We address HIV/AIDS, child labour, sex (and sex for exchange), teenage pregnancy, loneliness, children’s rights, peer pressure, physical and mental abuse, substance abuse, environmental education, culture, heritage and so much more. </p>
<p>LET THEM TRUST currently carries out the following activities:</p>
<p>1. Annual school arts festival<br/>2. Arts workshops in schools<br/>3. Capacity-building workshops in schools<br/>4. Training in artistic disciplines<br/>5. Career pathways</p>
<p>So far, LET THEM TRUST has conducted music, theatre, dance, poetry, fashion and heritage workshops in over 300 schools, impacting the lives of more than 180,000 students. Our flagship event is the LET THEM FESTIVAL – 2017 will be our fifth anniversary. The LET THEM FESTIVAL is the only one of its kind, attracting schools from around the country to share in our ideals and share the fun. What we have achieved so far has been with the help of government and corporate partners. But, we are neither political nor corporate. Instead, we are hopeful. The LET THEM TRUST VILLAGE will enable us to become a self-sustaining enterprise built on the finance of hope – our hope for Zimbabwe, our hope for our future, our hope for our children.</p>
<p><strong>LET THEM TRUST VILLAGE</strong></p>
<p>We have a 40-acre site on the outskirts of Harare in the beautiful Mazowe Hills, perfectly suited for the LET THEM TRUST VILLAGE. The construction will include administration block, dining hall (and indoor performance space), dormitories for 200 kids, music and visual arts studios, and professional kitchen. The LET THEM TRUST VILLAGE will offer the following activities to schools, youth visitors and tour groups:</p>
<p>* Music workshops</p>
<p>* Theatre workshops</p>
<p>* Poetry workshops</p>
<p>* Heritage tours in Gomba Intangible Heritage Landscape</p>
<p>* Visits to Tengenenge Sculpture Village</p>
<p>* Recording facilities</p>
<p>* Ngano (storytelling) workshops</p>
<p>* Hiking and mountain biking in the hills</p>
<p>* Fishing in nearby dams</p>
<p><strong>WE NEED YOU </strong></p>
<p>The need is obvious, the vision is clear, the site is ours. But, we can’t do this alone. We need you. We need your money. We need to build a dream that will change realities. We need to make the Mazowe hills echo with children’s voices. Because it takes a village to raise a child …  </p>
<p><strong>FINANCES</strong></p>
<p>We are looking for US$450,000 to construct the LET THEM VILLAGE:</p>
<ul>
<li>Architectural plans                             US$2,600</li>
<li>Engineering plan                                  US$6,000</li>
<li>Ground levelling                                  US$5,000</li>

</ul>
<p>We have already started our local fundraising campaign alongside Indiegogo. If we do not reach our Indiegogo target, we will commence construction of the LET THEM TRUST VILLAGE nonetheless. However long it takes, we will make this happen.</p>
<p><strong>IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>The impact of your contribution will be felt in years to come, but also into the past … because you are not just helping develop Zimbabwean children’s hope in where they’re heading, but also their pride in where they come from. What’s more, the LET THEM VILLAGE will enable us to open our programmes beyond Zimbabwe and invite the participation of international schools and youth groups to experience and celebrate our rich and unique cultural heritage.  </p>
<p>LET THEM TRUST’s contribution to arts and heritage and in the lives of Zimbabwe’s children has already been recognized by our many partners, including – the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education, the Culture Fund, Shoko Festival, the Zimbabwe Agricultural Society, the EU, Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe, ZiFm Stereo, SOS Childrens Village, Africad, Brands Africa, Dendairy, Code Teens, Ster Kinekor, Spar Community Benefit and Bakers Inn.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR HELP</strong></p>
<p>Any financial support you can offer the LET THEM VILLAGE, large or small, is greatly appreciated. We also value any efforts you make to help us get the word out. Please share this page with your electronic networks – on E-mail, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. We need to be noticed.</p>
<p>Here in Zimbabwe, we have a saying: “<i>Kupa kuturika</i>” – “To give is to bank”. I am asking you to invest in our future. Wherever you are in the world, it is OUR future – yours and mine. Because, these days it takes a global village to raise a child …</p>

<h3>Who is <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/chefpv/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ChefPV</a>?</h3>
<p>Culinary thought leader Don Peavy—also known professionally as “ChefPV”—is transforming what we eat and what we think about what we eat.  His is a platform of sustainability, Entomophagy (the consumption of insects), and social and political awareness.  As a full-spectrum chef, and progressive voice in the food industry, Peavy is making profound change more digestible and delicious for everyone.</p>
<h3>Why Entomophagy?</h3>
<p>Don Peavy first learned about Entomophagy near the end of 2014 when his pal GOOGLE showed him <a href=""http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3253e/i3253e.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the United Nations FAO-sanctioned report <i><strong>Edible insects: Future prospects for food and feed security</strong></i></a>.  This 201-page document paints a bleak picture of how strained global food systems are:</p>
<ul><li><p><a href=""http://www.fao.org/edible-insects/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Trends towards 2050 predict a steady population increase to 9 billion people, forcing an increased food/feed output from available agro-ecosystems resulting in an even greater pressure on the environment. Scarcities of agricultural land, water, forest, fishery and biodiversity resources, as well as nutrients and non-renewable energy are foreseen.</i></a></p></li></ul>
<p>and recommends the promotion and support of edible bugs to help tackle these pressing issues:</p>
<ul><li><a href=""http://www.fao.org/edible-insects/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Edible insects contain high quality protein, vitamins and amino acids for humans. Insects have a high food conversion rate, e.g. crickets need six times less feed than cattle, four times less than sheep, and twice less than pigs and broiler chickens to produce the same amount of protein. Besides, they emit less greenhouse gases and ammonia than conventional livestock. Insects can be grown on organic waste. Therefore, insects are a potential source for conventional production (mini-livestock) of protein, either for direct human consumption, or indirectly in recomposed foods (with extracted protein from insects); and as a protein source into feedstock mixtures.</i></a></li></ul>
<p>ChefPV was instantly activated towards the U.N.'s call seeking help promoting Entomophagy from food industry professionals.  Days after reading the report, he was in communications with key figures in Entomophagy and started a personal journey into the exciting world of eating bugs.  Almost 4 months later, ChefPV passionately laid out the Entomophagy Saga to Director Justin Noto which led to a one-year journey producing <strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVUN8OElsggywmPoUalWLIA"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Buggin'Out w/ChefPV</i></a></strong>, a new educational series dedicated to the art and science of eating bugs<font>. </font></p>
<p><font>The series is a fun way to get people on the Entomophagy bandwagon, however few opportunities exist for the students of America to engage with edible bugs and ChefPV recognizes the positive impact eating bugs can have for present and future food security so he's taking his message to the people to let them know eating bugs are fun and delicious :)</font></p>
<p><font>With your help, ChefPV will tour America's schools and engage grades 5th - 12th in a discussion about Entomophagy while providing hands-on-experience preparing bug dishes culminating in the most awesomely delicious edible bugs taste test EVER.</font></p>

<p><strong>About me</strong><br/>Hi, my name is Weiwen. I'm a Singaporean food and wine journalist with 10 years of journalism experience. I’m always looking out for great food, top wines and the ultimate bowl of ramen.</p>
<p><strong>How the book idea began</strong><br/>The first Japanese wine I had tried was a bottle of Koshu from Katsunuma winery—I had bought it from a wine shop in Tokyo Station in 2009. It was an easy-drinking wine. It wasn’t love at first sip but it was appealing enough to make me buy a couple of bottles whenever I was in Tokyo.<br/><br/>The seed for this book idea, however, was planted—rather unconsciously—in November 2015. I was at the Hong Kong International Wine &amp; Spirits Fair, attending as a journalist. The Japanese wine exhibitors drew curious visitors, myself included. Some of their wines were decent, some had me going for seconds, and others tasted too fruity for my palate. I felt there was a story idea worth exploring there. But I filed the idea into my mental KIV box.</p>
<p>Two weeks later, I was in Japan for my yearly holiday in the country. I was in a pensive mood. I had been thinking of how to combine my love for Japan with my profession. I knew I’d like to write a book about Japanese food but I didn’t want to do one about sushi or sake—there are already hundreds of such books out there, written by authors who are more knowledgeable than me. What aspect of Japanese culture or food has not been published into a book yet? What’s <i>new</i>?</p>
<p>In between bowls of ramen, showers of autumn leaves, and glasses of beer and wine, the book idea crystallised.<i> Japanese wines. Why not?  </i>I started doing my research…</p>
<p>Fast forward to early August 2016. I had left my job as editor of Wine&amp;Dine magazine and was busy preparing for my two-month (mid-August to mid-October 2016) trip across Japan. My plan was to visit 30 wineries in Nagano, Yamanashi, Kyushu and Hokkaido, interviewing the winemakers at each stop.</p>
<p>I ended up visiting 36 wineries. Along the way, I was lucky to miss a few typhoons and escape some severe weather. In all, it was a great field trip.</p>

<p><strong>What will the book be like?</strong><br/>This isn’t going to be a coffee table book, neither will it be a totally geeky book that delves into the molecular structures of malic and lactic acids. It will be part travel narrative, part educational wine book, with wineries grouped into their respective regions. It is my hope that this book will inform and entertain not just oenophiles but also those who are interested in Japan.</p>
<p>This will also be the very first English book on Japanese wines in the world of wine books! Your funds will help create a little history.</p>
<p>Book specifications: 13.97cm X 21.59cm, soft cover, approx. 200 pages* with text and full colour photographs.</p>
<p>The next five months will be spent transcribing hundreds of hours of interviews and writing the book. I will be self-publishing this book via Amazon’s CreateSpace publishing service. CreateSpace prints on demand, a method that keeps their printing costs low.</p>
<p>This book will be published by April or May 2017.**</p>

<p>2) The costs already incurred for my flights, accommodation and intercity rail transport during the two-month trip. (Approx. US$5,280 (S$7,300) was spent. This figure does not include my meals).</p>

<p><i>(En español más abajo , detrás del texto en inglés</i><i>)</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi! My name is Jose Ramón Espinosa Muñoz.</p>
<p>More than 10 years ago, when I was a music language teacher, I noticed that something was changing in the students. <i><strong> The old ways of teaching music no longer worked. </strong></i>They needed a more imaginative side: <strong><i>To live the musical language with more passion</i></strong> . For that reason, I remembered the old <i>Pythian Games</i> <i><strong>and decided to adapt the musical contents to athletic tests. </strong></i></p>
<p>Everything was class games, paper results and chocolate medals.My work was exciting again  . A few days ago, talking to an old student, he told me that he missed the time. I do also.</p>
<p>This project, Solfegic Games, will be the natural evolution of that old project:  More music teachers involved, more realism with a 3D gaming platform,  more passion with an international competition of musical language students.  <i><strong>Will you join us?</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/V69Fs3doeKU?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>This project is <i><strong>designed by music teachers</strong></i> and can be <i><strong>used only by students of those teachers and music schools</strong></i> that collaborate with Solfegic Games. <i><strong>It will not be a platform open to everybody</strong></i>. There are many ways to collaborate with the project (translations, adapting methodologies, sharing content and others.) but the most important one right now is to collaborate in this crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Rescuing cherubim...</h3>
<p><i><strong>Solfegic Games wants to be a fair project and to give greater capacity of decision in the project to those who collaborate more.</strong></i> For this we have invented a ""measure"" of collaboration: <i><strong>The Cherubim (Q)</strong></i>. And why the Cherubin? Because ""<i>Solfegic Games intends to save from the Solfeggio Purgatory to all those cherubim who have suffered their torment for centuries</i>"" (That's a joke that circulates among collaborators) The more Q's,  the more decisions can be influenced. That's why we added Q's to each perk.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496796207/n75gizoq8hi7ufaaafrv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Let's go deeper into the project</h2>
<h3><i><strong>2018 Solfegic Games</strong></i></h3>
</div>
<p>...will be the first annual competition among students of musical language.  </p>
<p>The final phase will take place in July 2018, but starting April of that same year classification tests will be carried out, first in the music schools and later in each country or zone.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rjzosas91fQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Thanks to the 3D gaming platform, participants will not have to be physically together. From the ""cloud"", they will be able to compete from very far away as if they were next to each other.</p>
<p>We want this event to be a <i><strong>music festival, with streaming connections with all participants, awards ceremony, etc</strong></i>. Our students deserve it after so much effort.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i><strong>The 3D gaming platform</strong></i></h3>
</div>
<p>Solfegic Games is also a 3D gaming platform that makes music language classes more fun as well as supporting teachers.  This platform also serves as the referee in the annual competitions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/YAsFr2UAicI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Being a 3D gaming platform, we wanted the musical teaching to look like a video game. Here is an example of <i><strong>reading a simple music staff</strong></i>:<br/> </p>
</div><p> </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zSSFvMc3I3g?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><div>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other musical contents that we already have adapted to Solfegic games are <i><strong>""reading music with accents""</strong></i> (100 metres hurdles ), <i><strong>""reading music in Bass Clef""</strong></i> (Swimming), or <i><strong>""intonation of intervals""</strong></i> (Archery), like this example: </p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Cy819gQPi0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The realism of the graphics will be improved, also the power and its adaptation to all the existing devices. But all these is the goal of phases 2 and 3 of the project (Phases for which we ask for help in this campaign).</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In addition, <i><strong>Solfegic Games is also a support platform for teachers</strong></i>. The student plays, but the teacher obtains quantitative results of that game. Here are some examples of these features:</div>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><i><strong>The Team</strong></i></h3>
<div>
<p>The team that forms Solfegic Games grows every day because, being a collaborative project, everyone interested in music education has a voice in it. There are currently people from more than 25 countries involved in one way or another. For the moment, and to make the first project decisions easier, we have differentiated the initial collaborators from those who are joining each day.</p>
<p>All those who collaborate in this campaign will become collaborators and therefore will have decision capacity in the future afairs about Solfegic Games. The project will grow with all of us.</p>

<h3>What we need. </h3>
<p> This campaign is a Flexible goal campaign.  This means that, even if we do not reach the proposed objective, we will use the proceeds for the project. The difference will be in the time it will take to complete it. Higher amount collected, less time. Less amount collected, more time. As explained in the following video:</p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xIDUXqDSfcI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>The campaign budget has been divided in two. 65% for the conclusion of the platform and 35% for the celebration of the 2018 Solfegic Games.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Everything in our world is being digitized at high speed. But that does not ensure quality in human activities. This project tries to modernize the strategies of musical learning, to carry it as we know it to the next decade.</span></p>

<p>Hola, mi nombre es Jose Ramón Espinosa Muñoz.</p>
<p>Hace más de 10 años, cuando era profesor de Lenguaje Musical, advertí que algo estaba cambiando en los alumnos.<i><strong> Las viejas formas de enseñar música no funcionaban. </strong></i>Se necesitaba un lado más imaginativo. Por eso, recordando los antiguos Juegos Píticos, decidí adaptar los contenidos musicales a pruebas atléticas como si fuera una olimpiada.<i><strong> </strong></i></p>
<p>Todo eran juegos de clase, clasificaciones en papel, medallas de chocolate, etc. Hace unos días, hablando con un antiguo alumno, me dijo que echaba de menos esos años. Yo también. </p>
<p>Este proyecto Solfegic Games será la evolución natural de aquel antiguo proyecto: Más profesores de música implicados, más realismo con una plataforma de juego 3D, más ilusión gracias a una competición internacional de carácter anual. <strong>¿Te unes a nosotros?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/u5nBb9aezO8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>Este proyecto está <i><strong>diseñado por profesores de música</strong></i> y <i><strong>puede ser usado sólo por estudiantes de aquellos profesores o escuelas de música</strong></i> que colaboran con Solfegic Games. No será una plataforma abierta a todo el mundo. Hay muchas formas de colaborar con el proyecto (traducciones, adaptación de metodologías, compartir contenidos de Solfegic Games, etc.) pero la más importante ahora es colaborar en esta campaña de crowdfunding.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Salvando querubines...</h3>
<p><i><strong>Solfegic Games quiere ser un proyecto justo y dotar de mayor capacidad de decisión en el proyecto a aquellos que más colaboran.</strong></i> Para ello hemos inventado una ""medida"" de la colaboración: <i><strong>El Querubín (Q)</strong></i>. ¿Y por qué el Querubin? Porque <i>""Solfegic Games pretende salvar del purgatorio del Solfeo a todos aquellos querubines que sufren su tormento desde hace siglos"" </i>(Es un chiste que circula entre los colaboradores a raíz de una de las promos que hay al principio de esta Historia) A más Q, en más decisiones se puede influir. Por eso hemos añadido las Q en cada recompensa.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1496806521/gvreaj6i1dogf9ei8cnk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h2>Vamos a profundizar en el proyecto</h2>
<h3><i><strong>Solfegic Games 2018</strong></i></h3>
</div>
<p>Será la primera competición anual entre alumnos de Lenguaje Musical.  </p>
<p>La fase final tendrá lugar en Julio de 2018, pero dese Abril de ese mismo año, se irán celebrando las pruebas de clasificación, primero en las escuelas de música y después en cada país o zona geográfica.</p>

<h3><i><strong>La plataforma de juego  3D </strong></i></h3>

<p>Siendo como es una plataforma de juego 3D, queríamos que la enseñanza musical se pareciera a un videojuego.  He aquí un ejemplo de <i><strong>Lectura de un pentagrama sencillo.</strong></i></p>

Hi! My name is Jose Ramón Espinosa Muñoz.
More than 10 years ago, when I was a music language teacher, I noticed that something was changing in the students.  The old ways of teaching music no longer worked. They needed a more imaginative side: To live the musical language with more passion . For that reason, I remembered the old Pythian Games and decided to adapt the musical contents to athletic tests. 
Everything was class games, paper results and chocolate medals.My work was exciting again  . A few days ago, talking to an old student, he told me that he missed the time. I do also.
This project, Solfegic Games, will be the natural evolution of that old project:  More music teachers involved, more realism with a 3D gaming platform,  more passion with an international competition of musical language students.  Will you join us?
 



 
This project is designed by music teachers and can be used only by students of those teachers and music schools that collaborate with Solfegic Games. It will not be a platform open to everybody. There are many ways to collaborate with the project (translations, adapting methodologies, sharing content and others.) but the most important one right now is to collaborate in this crowdfunding campaign.
 
 
Rescuing cherubim...
Solfegic Games wants to be a fair project and to give greater capacity of decision in the project to those who collaborate more. For this we have invented a ""measure"" of collaboration: The Cherubim (Q). And why the Cherubin? Because ""Solfegic Games intends to save from the Solfeggio Purgatory to all those cherubim who have suffered their torment for centuries"" (That's a joke that circulates among collaborators) The more Q's,  the more decisions can be influenced. That's why we added Q's to each perk.

 
 
Let's go deeper into the project
2018 Solfegic Games

...will be the first annual competition among students of musical language.  
The final phase will take place in July 2018, but starting April of that same year classification tests will be carried out, first in the music schools and later in each country or zone.
 

 
Thanks to the 3D gaming platform, participants will not have to be physically together. From the ""cloud"", they will be able to compete from very far away as if they were next to each other.
We want this event to be a music festival, with streaming connections with all participants, awards ceremony, etc. Our students deserve it after so much effort.
 
The 3D gaming platform

Solfegic Games is also a 3D gaming platform that makes music language classes more fun as well as supporting teachers.  This platform also serves as the referee in the annual competitions.
 

 
 
Being a 3D gaming platform, we wanted the musical teaching to look like a video game. Here is an example of reading a simple music staff: 
 
 
 
Other musical contents that we already have adapted to Solfegic games are ""reading music with accents"" (100 metres hurdles ), ""reading music in Bass Clef"" (Swimming), or ""intonation of intervals"" (Archery), like this example: 
 

 
 
The realism of the graphics will be improved, also the power and its adaptation to all the existing devices. But all these is the goal of phases 2 and 3 of the project (Phases for which we ask for help in this campaign).
 
 
In addition, Solfegic Games is also a support platform for teachers. The student plays, but the teacher obtains quantitative results of that game. Here are some examples of these features:

The Team

The team that forms Solfegic Games grows every day because, being a collaborative project, everyone interested in music education has a voice in it. There are currently people from more than 25 countries involved in one way or another. For the moment, and to make the first project decisions easier, we have differentiated the initial collaborators from those who are joining each day.
All those who collaborate in this campaign will become collaborators and therefore will have decision capacity in the future afairs about Solfegic Games. The project will grow with all of us.

What we need. 
 This campaign is a Flexible goal campaign.  This means that, even if we do not reach the proposed objective, we will use the proceeds for the project. The difference will be in the time it will take to complete it. Higher amount collected, less time. Less amount collected, more time. As explained in the following video:
 

 
The campaign budget has been divided in two. 65% for the conclusion of the platform and 35% for the celebration of the 2018 Solfegic Games.
 

 
If you can not see the budget clearly, you can see it directly on Youtube through this link:

Risks and challenges
Everything in our world is being digitized at high speed. But that does not ensure quality in human activities. This project tries to modernize the strategies of musical learning, to carry it as we know it to the next decade.
Look at this link and you understand it:    https://youtu.be/AJQdQgI1EC0


 
 

Other ways to collaborate with Solfegic Games

Hola, mi nombre es Jose Ramón Espinosa Muñoz.
Hace más de 10 años, cuando era profesor de Lenguaje Musical, advertí que algo estaba cambiando en los alumnos. Las viejas formas de enseñar música no funcionaban. Se necesitaba un lado más imaginativo. Por eso, recordando los antiguos Juegos Píticos, decidí adaptar los contenidos musicales a pruebas atléticas como si fuera una olimpiada. 
Todo eran juegos de clase, clasificaciones en papel, medallas de chocolate, etc. Hace unos días, hablando con un antiguo alumno, me dijo que echaba de menos esos años. Yo también. 
Este proyecto Solfegic Games será la evolución natural de aquel antiguo proyecto: Más profesores de música implicados, más realismo con una plataforma de juego 3D, más ilusión gracias a una competición internacional de carácter anual. ¿Te unes a nosotros?
 

 
Este proyecto está diseñado por profesores de música y puede ser usado sólo por estudiantes de aquellos profesores o escuelas de música que colaboran con Solfegic Games. No será una plataforma abierta a todo el mundo. Hay muchas formas de colaborar con el proyecto (traducciones, adaptación de metodologías, compartir contenidos de Solfegic Games, etc.) pero la más importante ahora es colaborar en esta campaña de crowdfunding.
 
Salvando querubines...
Solfegic Games quiere ser un proyecto justo y dotar de mayor capacidad de decisión en el proyecto a aquellos que más colaboran. Para ello hemos inventado una ""medida"" de la colaboración: El Querubín (Q). ¿Y por qué el Querubin? Porque ""Solfegic Games pretende salvar del purgatorio del Solfeo a todos aquellos querubines que sufren su tormento desde hace siglos"" (Es un chiste que circula entre los colaboradores a raíz de una de las promos que hay al principio de esta Historia) A más Q, en más decisiones se puede influir. Por eso hemos añadido las Q en cada recompensa.
 

 
 

Vamos a profundizar en el proyecto
Solfegic Games 2018

Será la primera competición anual entre alumnos de Lenguaje Musical.  
La fase final tendrá lugar en Julio de 2018, pero dese Abril de ese mismo año, se irán celebrando las pruebas de clasificación, primero en las escuelas de música y después en cada país o zona geográfica.
 

 

Gracias a la plataforma de juego 3D, los participantes no tendrán que estar físicamente juntos. Desde la nube, serán capaces de competir a gran distancia como si estuvieran juntos.
Queremos que este evento sea una fiesta de la música, con conexiones en directo via streaming con los participantes, ceremonia de entrega de premios, etc. Nuestros alumnos se lo merecen después de tanto esfuerzo. 
 
La plataforma de juego  3D 

Solfegic Games es también una plataforma de juego 3D que hace que las classe de Lenguaje Musical sean más divertidas y también de apoyo en la docencia a los profesores. Esta plataforma  también sirve como árbitro en las competiciones anuales. 
 

 
Siendo como es una plataforma de juego 3D, queríamos que la enseñanza musical se pareciera a un videojuego.  He aquí un ejemplo de Lectura de un pentagrama sencillo.

<p><b>Nu är det
dags för De Vita Bussarna igen. Men vi får ta sjövägen.</b></p>
<p>Vid 2:a
världskrigets slutskede utförde många en fantastisk insats för att hjälpa
människor, inte bara de som direkt var på flykt utan även dem, som av olika
skäl satt fast i en omöjlig situation. De Vita Bussarna blev världsberömda
genom att ge människor en rask och säker transport till räddningen från
koncentrationslägrens helvete. Det var ett regeringsinitiativ, som förmedlades
genom Röda Korset. Tusentals människors liv kunde därmed räddas.<br/>
Idag finns inte något sådant initiativ från vår regering.</p>
<p>De Vita
Båtarna ska göra det för flyktingar som De Vita Bussarna gjorde för 70 år
sedan. När beslutsfattare är passiva, tvingas privatpersoner ta saken i egna
händer för att hjälpa dem som tvingats fly från krig och politiskt våld. Vi
startar nu en insamling för att ordna direkt sjöförbindelse med östra
Medelhavet därför att varken Sverige eller EU står upp för flyktingar i
dagsläget.</p>
<p><b>Från säkra
platser i Europa ska fartyg gå med förnödenheter och personal till de människor
och organisationer i Grekland som är i akut behov av mat, värme, sjukvård och
skydd.</b></p>
<p><b>På vägen
tillbaka tar vi med syriska flyktingar som avser att söka asyl i Sverige, men
som idag är strandsatta utanför EU:s yttre gräns. </b></p>
<p>För mer info: <a href=""http://www.vitabatarna.se"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.vitabatarna.se</span></a></p><p><span><b>OBS! Insamlingen kommer inte att avbrytas efter 30 dagar.</b></span><br/>
<br/>
Vi har budgeterat med en kostnad av 1 miljon kronor för att köpa eller chartra
ett fartyg till den första färden. Ambitionen är dock att fortsätta så länge
det behövs och därför kommer insamlingen att fortsätta även efter att de första
30 dagarna har passerat. Det är insamlingsplattformen Indiegogos regler som gör
att vi måste sätta en initial tidsgräns.<br/>
<br/>
<span>Om vi misslyckas med att nå våra insamlingsmål eller om projektet av någon anledning blir onödigt, kommer alla kvarvarande medel som donerats, att skänkas till FN-organisationer som arbetar i flyktingläger i Libanon. Libanon, som har 4,5 miljoner invånare, har tagit cirka 2 miljoner flyktingar sedan kriget i Syrien började.</span></p><p><span><b>Detta projekt drivs helt på volontärsbasis.

and no one involved will claim a salary with raised funds. We are an initiative
of private citizens from Sweden with the support of Refugees Welcome Sweden. ___________________________________________________________________________Andra sätt att bidraBankgiro: 5042-9166 (Uppdaterat saldo: 6200 SEK)
Nu är det
dags för De Vita Bussarna igen. Men vi får ta sjövägen.
Vid 2:a
världskrigets slutskede utförde många en fantastisk insats för att hjälpa
människor, inte bara de som direkt var på flykt utan även dem, som av olika
skäl satt fast i en omöjlig situation. De Vita Bussarna blev världsberömda
genom att ge människor en rask och säker transport till räddningen från
koncentrationslägrens helvete. Det var ett regeringsinitiativ, som förmedlades
genom Röda Korset. Tusentals människors liv kunde därmed räddas.
Idag finns inte något sådant initiativ från vår regering.
De Vita
Båtarna ska göra det för flyktingar som De Vita Bussarna gjorde för 70 år
sedan. När beslutsfattare är passiva, tvingas privatpersoner ta saken i egna
händer för att hjälpa dem som tvingats fly från krig och politiskt våld. Vi
startar nu en insamling för att ordna direkt sjöförbindelse med östra
Medelhavet därför att varken Sverige eller EU står upp för flyktingar i
dagsläget.
Från säkra
platser i Europa ska fartyg gå med förnödenheter och personal till de människor
och organisationer i Grekland som är i akut behov av mat, värme, sjukvård och
skydd.
På vägen
tillbaka tar vi med syriska flyktingar som avser att söka asyl i Sverige, men
som idag är strandsatta utanför EU:s yttre gräns. 
För mer info: www.vitabatarna.seOBS! Insamlingen kommer inte att avbrytas efter 30 dagar.

Vi har budgeterat med en kostnad av 1 miljon kronor för att köpa eller chartra
ett fartyg till den första färden. Ambitionen är dock att fortsätta så länge
det behövs och därför kommer insamlingen att fortsätta även efter att de första
30 dagarna har passerat. Det är insamlingsplattformen Indiegogos regler som gör
att vi måste sätta en initial tidsgräns.

Om vi misslyckas med att nå våra insamlingsmål eller om projektet av någon anledning blir onödigt, kommer alla kvarvarande medel som donerats, att skänkas till FN-organisationer som arbetar i flyktingläger i Libanon. Libanon, som har 4,5 miljoner invånare, har tagit cirka 2 miljoner flyktingar sedan kriget i Syrien började.Detta projekt drivs helt på volontärsbasis. Inga inblandade i projektet kommer att få betalt för sin medverkan genom insamlade medel.Vi är ett initiativ av privatpersoner med stöd av Refugees Welcome Sweden.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<span><span>On the laboratory tables, instead of beakers and Bunsen burners, there are cutting boards and induction cooktops. Students huddle in groups of three, chopping, mixing, tasting and discussing the best method for preparing carrot top pesto as part of their unit on food waste. The classroom is a purposeful buzz as carrot tops fly. Food journals are being filled with sketches and notes. The instructor floats from group to group, answering questions, making occasional suggestions, and reminding students to reflect in their journals in preparation for their culminating Mindful Meal project. The students hurry to complete their pesto before settling down for a long-distance chat over Skype with a farmer or chef about food waste and culinary creativity.</span></span> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>About Mobile Kitchen Classroom</h3> <p></p>
<span><p><span>A program of Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture in collaboration with SHFT, Mobile Kitchen Classroom empowers a generation of Food Citizens – individuals who understand that their food choices have a meaningful impact and are empowered to advocate for change. Mobile Kitchen Classroom engages high school students, who are soon to be independent decision makers, by making connections between food and issues that they care about – culture, power, the environment.

</div><br/></div>","Imagine an 11th grade science classroom ...
 
On the laboratory tables, instead of beakers and Bunsen burners, there are cutting boards and induction cooktops. Students huddle in groups of three, chopping, mixing, tasting and discussing the best method for preparing carrot top pesto as part of their unit on food waste. The classroom is a purposeful buzz as carrot tops fly. Food journals are being filled with sketches and notes. The instructor floats from group to group, answering questions, making occasional suggestions, and reminding students to reflect in their journals in preparation for their culminating Mindful Meal project. The students hurry to complete their pesto before settling down for a long-distance chat over Skype with a farmer or chef about food waste and culinary creativity.   
About Mobile Kitchen Classroom 
A program of Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture in collaboration with SHFT, Mobile Kitchen Classroom empowers a generation of Food Citizens – individuals who understand that their food choices have a meaningful impact and are empowered to advocate for change. Mobile Kitchen Classroom engages high school students, who are soon to be independent decision makers, by making connections between food and issues that they care about – culture, power, the environment. Hands-on cooking lessons connect ingredients to ideas and give students the skills they need to prepare fresh farm-driven food. Students who have participated in Mobile Kitchen Classroom find themselves transformed from passive consumers to confident and activated Food Citizens – the program is life changing.

We've all received and even given this advice before. The thing that I am very good at is explaining things. I can take a very complex concept and make it very easy to understand.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">At the end of my college career, I came up with an idea that I needed to share with as many people as possible. Unfortunately, the idea described Everything and, as you'd imagine, it's hard to explain everything in a short amount of time. I thought to write a book but remembered how many people, like myself, are not verbal learners. Many of us need people to explain things and pictures to look at when learning new concepts: cue the 21st century! We now have the internet and a new medium for exchanging ideas; this is how I will share my idea with you. Plus, the internet allows me to have videos within videos: <i>videoception!</i></span><br/></p>

<p><u>The basics:</u></p>
<p>-Videos with speaker, visuals and word bank linking videos together in a web<br/>-Ability to save videos for later, good for reference or marking your favorites<br/>-Separate questions and comments sections for each video<br/>-Concept map indicating efficient paths to follow in your exploration</p>
<p><u>Topics to be covered:</u></p>
<p>-The Big Bang and formation of all matter in the universe<br/>-The formation of the stars, planets, galaxies and the elements<br/>-The origin of life and how basic processes mixed with competition gave rise to all the life that has ever existed<br/>-The specific events that led to our ancestors path toward building society<br/>-The changes within the society that have accelerated progress (i.e. industrialization, internet, etc.)</p>

Every time I think about the theory, I forget everything else and my eyes grow wide with excitement!

</div><div> <p>As you are probably aware, sometimes you have a thought that takes some time to put into words in order to communicate it. I'm the same way, only the thought I'm trying to put into words contains A LOT of information.

Each of the term bubbles were examples of videos that will be in this series.</p>

<p>If you watched the video, you might be able to tell that I created it using animations in PowerPoint and a screen recording program. It took a long time to create despite the short duration. The main purpose of the funding will be to speed up the process and improve the quality of the videos that will be on the website.</p>
<p>I have given the initial price of $10,000 as a rough estimate of how much I will need in order to make a fun and effective teaching tool. If, however, you decide to give more then the additional money will all go toward improved quality of the videos and website interface. (Nobody likes a clunky web platform!) I am currently working full time on this project so funding will also be used to support myself (food/rent).</p>
<p>This website will be specifically designed to be an educational exploration tool. The videos will be <b>relatively short</b> (<i>6 min average</i>) and the entire website will be entirely FREE to all users. Since I'm offering a free product, I don't have any goods to give you as perks, though I am happy to offer social media shout outs and a Contributor's Wall on the website with ranked names of how much each of you donated.</p>
<p>I have been doing this fully on my own for some time now so any suggestions for additional perks would be very appreciated. Also, feel free to ask any questions about the project; I absolutely love talking about it in all contexts!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary ""Find what it is you're good at and do that."" We've all received and even given this advice before. The thing that I am very good at is explaining things. I can take a very complex concept and make it very easy to understand.
At the end of my college career, I came up with an idea that I needed to share with as many people as possible. Unfortunately, the idea described Everything and, as you'd imagine, it's hard to explain everything in a short amount of time. I thought to write a book but remembered how many people, like myself, are not verbal learners. Many of us need people to explain things and pictures to look at when learning new concepts: cue the 21st century! We now have the internet and a new medium for exchanging ideas; this is how I will share my idea with you. Plus, the internet allows me to have videos within videos: videoception!


The basics:
-Videos with speaker, visuals and word bank linking videos together in a web-Ability to save videos for later, good for reference or marking your favorites-Separate questions and comments sections for each video-Concept map indicating efficient paths to follow in your exploration
Topics to be covered:
-The Big Bang and formation of all matter in the universe-The formation of the stars, planets, galaxies and the elements-The origin of life and how basic processes mixed with competition gave rise to all the life that has ever existed-The specific events that led to our ancestors path toward building society-The changes within the society that have accelerated progress (i.e. industrialization, internet, etc.)
You will also be able to gain insight into your body and brain as you will learn that both are just machines that work in an understandable way.
You'll be able to answer questions like:
-How do my muscles work?

-Why do we have emotions?-How can we hear?-Why can we think?

-Why do we like music?-Why do we feel the need to argue?-and many, many more (it's a Theory of Everything, after all; it should answer everything) 
I could talk all day about this idea and never get sick of it. This is not an idea that I just want to share, I NEED to share it with you. I feel as though I'm sitting on some very ""hot"" information and I really have to pass it along to you. Every time I think about the theory, I forget everything else and my eyes grow wide with excitement! The only thing I can really compare the feeling to is being in love or high; but the source of it is my thoughts alone!
I believe that simply understanding where we come from and how your world works is enough to have this feeling and discover a plausible way to change your circumstances to improve your life. After all, if you understand your place within a system, you can alter your place
What We Need & What You Get
 As you are probably aware, sometimes you have a thought that takes some time to put into words in order to communicate it. I'm the same way, only the thought I'm trying to put into words contains A LOT of information. I have already written scripts (or have verbal notes) for each of the >140 videos that will be included in the website. Each of the term bubbles were examples of videos that will be in this series.


If you watched the video, you might be able to tell that I created it using animations in PowerPoint and a screen recording program. It took a long time to create despite the short duration. The main purpose of the funding will be to speed up the process and improve the quality of the videos that will be on the website.
I have given the initial price of $10,000 as a rough estimate of how much I will need in order to make a fun and effective teaching tool. If, however, you decide to give more then the additional money will all go toward improved quality of the videos and website interface. (Nobody likes a clunky web platform!) I am currently working full time on this project so funding will also be used to support myself (food/rent).
This website will be specifically designed to be an educational exploration tool. The videos will be relatively short (6 min average) and the entire website will be entirely FREE to all users. Since I'm offering a free product, I don't have any goods to give you as perks, though I am happy to offer social media shout outs and a Contributor's Wall on the website with ranked names of how much each of you donated.
I have been doing this fully on my own for some time now so any suggestions for additional perks would be very appreciated. Also, feel free to ask any questions about the project; I absolutely love talking about it in all contexts!
    The Impact In order to explain the impact I want to make, I'll need to first define a term:
Enlightenment - to be aware of your position within a greater context/system.

The context could be your friend group (are you the flustered one?), your workplace (maybe you always pick up the coffee), or your society (how do strangers see you?). In each of these scenarios, you are better able to navigate within the context when you know exactly what role you play.
This video series will inform you of the role you play within ALL contexts. You are made up of cells which perform specific functions to make you work. You are a member of the most intelligent species that has ever existed on our planet. You are made up of mostly carbon atoms and water and must eventually give that carbon back to the Earth. Just to name a few.
In short, I want to enlighten the world. You are all capable of understanding the context and you are all curious enough to discover the role you play within all of it!
    Risks & Challenges I am currently working on writing scripts for the >140 videos that will be featured within the website. I will be updating this campaign page frequently as I continue to make progress writing more scripts.
The biggest challenge currently is time. Each of the scripts and videos have proven to take a huge amount of time and require me to delve into it full-time. If I am fully funded, I can hopefully be able to have the entire website ready for launch by April 2016!
I also have a spreadsheet listing my progress on the various sections. The spreadsheet only has the titles of sections but if that is of interest to you, I am happy to share it with you!
    Other Ways You Can Help If you aren't able or willing to make a monetary donation, all I ask is that you share the campaign with everyone you know, either by social media or in person. It is a theory of Everything, so I assume you know at least one person who is interested in some part of this.
Truly, word of mouth (and internet, by extension) is the most powerful tool when it comes to education. The purpose of this is the make a smarter world, one that knows the truth of how it works and where we come from. I am counting on your innate curiosity and generosity to make this a reality!

We have pledged to give them the tools to save more lives. This is also the pledge of those who support the Lesbos Fund.</p><p>We noticed that volunteers often are faced with lack of resources that could be resolved with access to quick funding. However, fundraising requires effort and time, something that they cannot spare, especially when the amounts they are looking for are small and represent essential but humble items: socks and shoes when stocks run low, a new pair of night-vision goggles, printing expenses to put up signs, a few tents…</p><p>These might sound trivial but they immediately make a difference to many.</p><br/><p>This is why we are launching the Lesbos Fund, the first peer-to-peer micro-grant tool for emergency zones.</p><p>The Lesbos Fund ensures the ability to adapt quickly to the changing nature of saving lives on Lesbos and means:</p><ul>

<li><p>First Contact: <a href=""http://www.first-contact.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.First-Contact.org</a> launched in August and was the first information website for persons  arriving in Europe. It  launched in Samos 4 days and today used by 14,000 people per week.</p></li>
<li><p>Migration Hub: Migration Hub Network (w<a href=""http://www.migrationhub.eu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ww.migrationhub.eu</a>) growing across Germany, Greece and more that provide physical and virtual spaces that leverage the expertise of the local tech community and synergizes with the talented newcomer community to create viable solutions for the pressing challenges of mass migration. </p></li>
<li><p>2 Ongoing Startupboat Mobile Hackathons to critical frontline areas, including Samos &amp; Lesbos: Bringing startuppers, techies and innovators to the field to raise their awareness of the crisis and engage them in building in-situ, viable solutions for logistics, coordination, information dissemination, environment with a growing partner network including  the University o Cambridge, the Lufthansa Innovation Hub, McKinsey, Stanford University and startups such as Blablacar.</p></li>
<li><p>We have just launched our latest project, MarhaCar (Marhacar.com), the first carpooling community for volunteers who work in crisis regions in cooperation with the International Organisation for Migration, shuttling aid deliveries where it’s critical. In our first three days, we helped 4000 people, and the service is growing from Greece to France.</p></li>
</ul><br/><p>Being closer to the reality of Lesbos, we have seen the work that is being done, what works and should be supported -- and taken further. </p><p>By supporting the Lesbos Fund, you, like us, pledge to understand and support efficient, sustainable, and scalable ways to resolve the challenges these teams are facing, and the critical importance of cutting down any red tape when thousands of lives are at stake. </p><br/><p>Join us in our promise: </p><ul>
<li><p>fast distribution of funds to immediately overcome roadblocks</p></li>
<li><p>quick evaluation of the proposed micro-grant amount</p></li>
<li><p>complete transparency with online publication of micro-grants and proof of purchases</p></li>

On the other side, we have seen the beauty of humanity illustrated by the sleepless watches, constant effort and dedication of the civil society taking matters into their hands.The people opening their arms to welcome the refugees and migrants have not been officials or authorities. The first hug, warm blanket and meal have come from the hands, hard work and effort of volunteers and locals.These are the people Startupboat wants to support. We believe in new ways of facing crisis and the self-organised communities of volunteers finding solutions to the constantly shifting challenges have inspired us. We have pledged to give them the tools to save more lives. This is also the pledge of those who support the Lesbos Fund.We noticed that volunteers often are faced with lack of resources that could be resolved with access to quick funding. However, fundraising requires effort and time, something that they cannot spare, especially when the amounts they are looking for are small and represent essential but humble items: socks and shoes when stocks run low, a new pair of night-vision goggles, printing expenses to put up signs, a few tents…These might sound trivial but they immediately make a difference to many.This is why we are launching the Lesbos Fund, the first peer-to-peer micro-grant tool for emergency zones.The Lesbos Fund ensures the ability to adapt quickly to the changing nature of saving lives on Lesbos and means:
All funds go directly to the volunteer organisations who understand the critical needs their community faces;
Enable them to immediately make purchases of equipment without having to wait for donations to come through;
By-pass the effort and time required to fundraiseWhy Us?Startupboat has been on the frontline of the crisis since August 2015, identifying patterns of crucial shared problems and working to collaboratively create infrastructure through tech & startup solutions. We aim to overcome unnecessary barriers to support the people on the frontline.We focus on highlighting what works around the world and applying these ideas to make smart solutions scalable in regions affected by mass migration. We have launched
First Contact: www.First-Contact.org launched in August and was the first information website for persons  arriving in Europe. It  launched in Samos 4 days and today used by 14,000 people per week.
Migration Hub: Migration Hub Network (www.migrationhub.eu) growing across Germany, Greece and more that provide physical and virtual spaces that leverage the expertise of the local tech community and synergizes with the talented newcomer community to create viable solutions for the pressing challenges of mass migration. 
2 Ongoing Startupboat Mobile Hackathons to critical frontline areas, including Samos & Lesbos: Bringing startuppers, techies and innovators to the field to raise their awareness of the crisis and engage them in building in-situ, viable solutions for logistics, coordination, information dissemination, environment with a growing partner network including  the University o Cambridge, the Lufthansa Innovation Hub, McKinsey, Stanford University and startups such as Blablacar.
We have just launched our latest project, MarhaCar (Marhacar.com), the first carpooling community for volunteers who work in crisis regions in cooperation with the International Organisation for Migration, shuttling aid deliveries where it’s critical. In our first three days, we helped 4000 people, and the service is growing from Greece to France.
Being closer to the reality of Lesbos, we have seen the work that is being done, what works and should be supported -- and taken further. By supporting the Lesbos Fund, you, like us, pledge to understand and support efficient, sustainable, and scalable ways to resolve the challenges these teams are facing, and the critical importance of cutting down any red tape when thousands of lives are at stake. Join us in our promise: 
fast distribution of funds to immediately overcome roadblocks
quick evaluation of the proposed micro-grant amount
complete transparency with online publication of micro-grants and proof of purchases
We will act as a guarantor that these funds are spent only to help the helpers, simplify process and make sure they can focus their energy on helping refugees.Help us help them! Donate today!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

An extremely intense sound is the key to acoustic levitation -- the transducers in many acoustic or ultrasonic levitation systems can produce sounds in excess of 150 decibels (dB). Ordinary conversation is about 60 dB, a loud nightclub is closer to 110 dB and a jet engine can reach sound pressure levels over 120dB.  Each 3dB increase represents a doubling of the sound level.  While the sound wave pressure is intense, it doesn't travel very far through the air.  </p><h3>Find out more at: <a href=""http://www.soniclevitation.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">soniclevitation.com</a>

</div></div>","USING SOUND FOR LEVITATIONOrdinary sound waves can be powerful enough to cause dust to collect in a pattern corresponding to the acoustic wave's nodes. A stereo speaker in a room can cause objects to vibrate and sometimes break. These feats are nothing compared to the power of sonic levitation. It takes far less effort to influence where dust settles or to shatter a glass than it takes to make objects defy the laws of gravity.  Increasing the amplitude of an acoustic wave causes the sound to be louder, but it doesn't affect the shape of the waveform or cause it to be more powerful.CREATE AN ANTI-GRAVITY FIELD THAT WOWs!Levitating objects with sound can be done by aiming an ultrasonic sound beam at a reflector.  With a little adjustment, the desired standing wave as shown in the illustration can be achieved.  Ultrasonic levitation is a fascinating phenomenon that is fun and educational to explore.LOUDER THAN A JET ENGINE BUT YOU BARELY HEAR ITPrecautions need to be taken when working with ultrasonic devices powerful enough for levitation.  They can produce ear shattering pressure waves beyond the range of human hearing.  Limiting long term exposure to the pressure wave or wearing earplugs is recommended.  It is because of this high power acoustic radiation that the sound pressure can become strong enough to overcome the pull of earth's gravity. An extremely intense sound is the key to acoustic levitation -- the transducers in many acoustic or ultrasonic levitation systems can produce sounds in excess of 150 decibels (dB). Ordinary conversation is about 60 dB, a loud nightclub is closer to 110 dB and a jet engine can reach sound pressure levels over 120dB.  Each 3dB increase represents a doubling of the sound level.  While the sound wave pressure is intense, it doesn't travel very far through the air.  Find out more at: soniclevitation.com
Sonic Levitation Machine Deluxe Lab Kit includes LCD power output display.This Sonic Levitation Machine produces an ultrasonic wave of 28,000 cycles per second with a wavelength of 12.14286 millimeters.  Both the basic and deluxe versions produce enough power to generate an intense sound wave powerful enough to levitate objects.  The good news is that bulk the pressure wave only travels about 300mm-450mm (12-18 inches) from the transducer when in air so you and your pets are perfectly safe around the Sonic Levitation Machine.  As extra precaution, be sure to wear ear plugs when you are experimenting with this device for long periods of time.ANTI-GRAVITY ON EARTHOn Earth where the air is dense, the high-pressure areas just below the ultrasonic signal's node must be large enough to support the floating object.  The object being levitated should measure between one third and half of the wavelength of the sound. The ultrasonic field isn't big enough to support objects larger than half the wavelength or around 6mm of diameter in the case of our Sonic Levitation Machine.  The higher the frequency of the sound, the shorter the wavelength and therefore smaller the diameter of the object that can be levitated.Basic Sonic Levitator Kit - includes 120/240 VAC power supply, 28kHz transducer, assembled basic 50 watt sonic generator PCB and reflector stand.Deluxe Sonic Levitator Kit - includes 120/240 VAC power supply, 28kHz transducer, assembled deluxe 70 watt sonic generator PCB with power output meter and reflector stand.
NEW AND IMPROVED DESIGN

Following up on our original crowd funded Sonic Levitation Machine, this project offers a new improved Deluxe Kit with LCD power display. This upgraded ultrasonic driver board can run for long periods of time without overheating and has a power level adjustment for maximum efficiency.

Vibrant colors and a playful tone amp up the fun factor that's sure to ignite the imaginations of children and adults alike.  Written by Stephen Nawotniak, illustrated by Jeffrey Scott Perdziak and published by People Ink Press, Mubu the Morph is suitable for children in grades K to 3 and the people who love them. THE PURPOSEMubu the Morph is about understanding and acceptance. As a Moms Choice Award-winning author, I have made a name for myself in the world of children’s literature as someone who is able to connect with young people and get positive messages across to them. With my book series Mubu the Morph, I have taught all sorts of lessons about understanding, acceptance, and independence, while at the same time supporting the Museum of disABILITY History whose mission is to advance the understanding, acceptance, and independence of people with disabilities.  (http://museumofdisability.org). SUPPORTING THE MUSEUM OF disABILITYCurrently 100% of proceeds from every book sold from this campaign goes to support the Museum of disAbility and is broken down as follows: 33% directly to the Museum and 64% for further promotions, website development and advertising campaigns making this project self sustainable.  Established in 1998 by Dr. James M. Boles, president and CEO of People Inc. (Western New York’s leading non-profit human services agency) the Museum of disABILITY History has steadily expanded over the years and, in late 2010, moved to a brand new location (pictured above).The Museum of disABILITY History is dedicated to advancing the understanding, acceptance and independence of people with disabilities. The Museum’s exhibits, collections, archives and educational programs create awareness and a platform for dialogue and discovery.  The museum has been developed with the generous support of People Inc. and the B. Thomas Golisano Foundation. We are truly thankful for their participation in this worthwhile effort.This is the only Museum of its kind in the USA, perhaps the world.  Below is a clip about one of the museum’s recent exhibits.The Lives they Left Behind ExhibitThe Museum of disABILITY History is proud to host The Lives They Left Behind: Suitcases from a State Hospital Attic as a special exhibit open to the public. The exhibit honors the memories of those who packed the suitcases and hopes to inspire dialogue about the treatment of those with mental illness. PERKS AND REWARDSCheck out the perks section for a detailed list of perks but the featured perks are the signed copies of the books for $25 each.  Mubu the MorphGo on a rhyming adventure with Mubu as he learns through trial and error the secret to being his best self. Vibrant colors and a playful tone amp up the fun factor in Stephen Nawotniak's engaging story that's sure to ignite the imaginations of children and adults alike. Illustrated by Jeffrey Scott Perdziak and published by People Ink Press, Mubu the Morph is suitable for children in grades K to 3 and the people who love them.Mubu's ChristmasMubu and his friend Kookoo-ah-choo live out their values of friendship and sharing talents with others in this holiday tale. Kookoo uses her gift of song to lift the spirits of people around the town. Mubu earnestly advocates for Kookoo with Santa. This story speaks to the spirit of Christmas and how we can spread it to others.Blue MubuThe third book in the Mubu the Morph series, Blue Mubu is a heartwarming children's book on emotions. The message is how gratitude and thankfulness help how we feel, even when we are sad. Blue Mubu encourages conversations on emotions between children and their parents, as well as teachers and caregivers. ABOUT THE AUTHOR AND ILLUSTRATORAuthor, Stephen Nawotniak, is a licensed occupational therapist and author of the books Handbook for Healthy Living with a Mood Disorder and Mubu the Morph.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I’m raising money for supplies and travel for students in  the Morehouse College Makerspace, a program to help college and other students from the Atlanta community, fuel their imagination and learn about engineering. </p>
<p><strong> But first, I want to tell you my story, and how my uncle Troy Davis inspired me to give back.</strong></p>
<p>When I was little, I always watched Dexter’s Laboratory and built things with Legos – I was fascinated with how stuff works. My mom would quiz me – how does a VCR work? What about a blender? My uncle Troy would help me with my math homework. I didn’t realize they were molding me into an engineer.</p>
<p>I started entering science fairs in kindergarten, and I won every science competition from the third through seventh grades. In third grade I wrote a report on sleep apnea. In fifth grade I made a presentation about the effects of tobacco smoke. In seventh grade I presented on germs in public places.</p>
<p>Eighth grade was the first year that I didn’t enter a science competition. I entered a social science competition instead.</p>
<h3>My presentation was a report about my uncle Troy, titled “Justice and the Georgia death penalty.”</h3>
<p>My uncle Troy was on death row. He had been arrested and sentenced in 1989 for a crime that he claimed he never committed. There were inconsistent statements from eyewitnesses. No gun or DNA evidence was ever found. Since the trial, nearly every prosecution witness has recanted their testimony.</p>
<p>Even though Uncle Troy was behind bars, with a national movement called #TooMuchDoubt building around his case, he still helped me with my homework. Even after they stopped allowing him to have a pen, he would still critique me on my presentations and encourage me. I visited him twice a month at least.</p>
<h3>I started at Morehouse in 2013, as a double major in engineering and physics. In sophomore year my friend Tyvone Boykins and I teamed up to create the Morehouse College Makerspace Exploration Center.</h3>
<p>The Makerspace is a cooperative laboratory workspace where students and faculty can make things, conduct research and collaborate. There are 3D printers, computers and other hands-on supplies (check out the video!). Here, students gain practical hands-on experience with new technologies, learning through building.</p>
<p>We teach students, and during summers we run summer programs for sixth, seventh and eighth graders from Atlanta. We give them the same lessons we give the college students. Sure, it’s rigorous, but they always end up learning how to do what we teach them.</p>
<h3>I learned from my uncle to always live with a “Reach one, teach one” mentality – I make sure to give back since so many people helped me get to where I am.</h3>
<p>Now I’m asking for your help to keep the opportunities in the Makerspace going.</p>
<p>I just started senior year at Morehouse, and I want to make sure the Makerspace is going strong when I leave. I would like to raise $20,000 to go toward supplies, trips to engineering conferences (like the NASA Space App Challenge), and more summer programs for kids from Atlanta.This will go a long way in giving students a chance to experience what I have in the Makerspace.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact is simple but powerful because this space is created to directly help young black engineers along with other science and math majors, to become as strong as possible in the hands on aspect of engineering and project creation. The larger the program is the more students can learn the adequate skills needed to prepare them for a strong engineering careers in the future.</p>

<p>I have been an Independent voter since I was 18 and a Libertarian since I started voting. Since 2006, I have been involved in Oklahomans For Ballot Access Reform fighting Oklahoma's legislature to reform our repressive ballot access laws. This effort lead me to run for the Oklahoma House with ballot access reform as a chief issue. Through this, I also got involved in the Oklahoma Libertarian Party and became their Secretary in 2012. </p>
<p>For the first time in over 30 years, the Oklahoma Legislature reduced the ballot access laws and thanks to that, the Libertarian Party is an official party in Oklahoma for the first time in 16 years.

<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>End all military conflicts</b> that are not in direct defense of the US. This includes reducing the military budget by ending boondoggle programs and graft that plagues our budget.</li>
<li>
<b>End The War On Drugs</b> and all parts of it including mandatory minimums, bans on industrial hemp, civil asset forfeiture, and more.</li>
<li>
<b>Balance the Budget</b> by shutting down all Federal Programs and Agencies that are not directly authorized by the US Constitution.</li>
<li>
<b>End The Federal Income Tax</b> by eliminating unconstitutional programs and agencies, reducing the military industrial complex and more, we can eliminate the income tax and return that money to the American people.</li>
<li>
<b>End The War On Terror</b> by revoking the PATRIOT Act and all other programs that violate the constitution and the rights, privacy, and liberty of the American People.</li>
<li>
<b>Bring US Law Into The Digital Age</b> by establishing and expanding fair use of copyrights, trademarks and patents, eliminating cronyism in copyright, trademark and patent law, and getting the US out of treaties that lock us into these unjust laws.</li>
<li>
<b>And So Much More</b>.</li>
</ul>

</div><p><strong>The benefits of empathy and compassion</strong></p><div>
</div><p>There is growing scientific evidence that empathy and compassion for oneself and others are important sources of happiness and psychological well-being. By cultivating these qualities we build resilience and stability of mind, equipping us with skilful tools to face the difficulties of daily life.</p><div>
</div><p>Research has found that: </p><div>
</div><ul>
<li>training in compassion improves physical health and makes people more resilient to stress: it lowers stress hormones in the blood and strengthens the immune response</li>
<li>compassion makes better friends: studies of college friendships show that when one friend sets the goal to support the other compassionately, both friends experience greater satisfaction and growth in the relationship</li>
<li>compassion enhances creativity at the workplace and in school</li>
</ul><div>

</div><p><em><em><em><u>We believe it is important for every young adult to explore the qualities of compassion and empathy and that such exploration is an essential component of personal development.</u></em></em></em></p><div>
</div><p>Objective #1 Connect young people with like-minded peers.</p><div>
</div><p>Objective #2 Encourage reflection and discussion on fundamental questions.</p><div>
</div><p>Objective #3 Inspire young people by introducing them to new perspectives and giving them the chance to meet respected scientists, policy makers and other change makers.</p><div>

</div></div>","When you were young, what kind of changes were you looking for in your life? 

Give young people the chance to start exploring already early in life who they are and who they want to be. Our youth gatherings have helped hundreds of young adults to get to know themselves a little bit better. Can you help us to reach even more?The project: DARE to CARE Youth GatheringMy name is Yara Vrolijks and I'm the coordinator of the DARE to CARE Youth gathering. This project is an initiative by the Tenzin Gyatso Institute. We are honoured that our speakers are willing to speak for free to the youth: Stanford University neurosurgeon James Doty, Professor of Clinical Psychology Paul Gilbert, President of 'Courage for Care Coalition' Brooke Lavelle and international peace-maker Scilla Elworthy. They believe it is worthwhile to invest in young people, in the form of education that  not only educates the mind but also the heart.
As students we are often given the message that life is all about money and good looks. We're told that success depends on having a career and a great social network. Is this really what it's all about? Or is there more? 
Most of us ask ourselves these questions, but often we’re not given the space to fully explore them. We learn about mathematics, grammar and economics, but the basic questions about our fundamental search for meaning often go unaddressed. Why not reflect on this early in life, as part of our formal education?
The benefits of empathy and compassion
There is growing scientific evidence that empathy and compassion for oneself and others are important sources of happiness and psychological well-being. By cultivating these qualities we build resilience and stability of mind, equipping us with skilful tools to face the difficulties of daily life.
Research has found that: 

training in compassion improves physical health and makes people more resilient to stress: it lowers stress hormones in the blood and strengthens the immune response
compassion makes better friends: studies of college friendships show that when one friend sets the goal to support the other compassionately, both friends experience greater satisfaction and growth in the relationship
compassion enhances creativity at the workplace and in school

Goals and Objectives
We believe it is important for every young adult to explore the qualities of compassion and empathy and that such exploration is an essential component of personal development.
Objective #1 Connect young people with like-minded peers.
Objective #2 Encourage reflection and discussion on fundamental questions.
Objective #3 Inspire young people by introducing them to new perspectives and giving them the chance to meet respected scientists, policy makers and other change makers.
Objective #4 Inspire teachers to focus more on the development of empathy and compassion in the school environment.
The DARE to CARE Youth Gathering: Its Success and Benefit
Since 2012, revered scientists and other change makers volunteer to speak with young people about the role of empathy and compassion in society at the ""DARE to CARE"" Youth Gathering. The Youth Gathering provides young people with tools to find their own perspectives, develop the courage to choose their own path in life, and ultimately to better realize their potential. 
Over the past four years, we have reached more than 700 young people from the UK and the USA. This year we want to expand our reach even further. For the first time, we are streaming the event around the world for FREE.
To do this, we need your support!
We need to raise only 2800 dollars (2500 euros) to make the web streaming of ""DARE to CARE"" available to universities and schools across the globe. Your support can make it possible for us to offer this streaming for FREE so that thousands of young people can join and, ultimately,  be a catalyst for change in the world. 
The funds will cover the organisation of the streaming of the event. 
Even if you cannot support us financially, we would love to have your support via Twitter (#DaretoCareyouth) and Facebook. Help us spread the word to everyone around the globe! May we inspire a movement of kindness and care among young people, educators and the broader global community! Meet the Team!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Dr. Eve Ekman. I'm a researcher and emotional trainer. I'm here to ask for your support in funding an Atlas of Emotions designed specifically for children.</p>
<p>In 2016, my father, Dr. Paul Ekman, and I worked with a team of design experts to create an online Atlas of Emotions to help society become more aware of their emotions. This free, online tool lets visitors explore the inner workings of emotions: how they are triggered, what they feel like, and how we respond to them. This atlas, funded by the Office of H.H. the Dalai Lama, currently receives over 35,000 hits per week and is available in both English and Spanish. (Please feel free to check it out here: <a href=""http://www.atlasofemotions.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.atlasofemotions.org</a>)<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526501344/vsay2zxzxvtcccie9e1l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Extending the wishes of H. H. the Dalai Lama, we would now like to create an Atlas of Emotions for Children! The goal of this project would be to create a free, online interactive tool to educate children and parents about their emotions and how to work with them. We feel confident that this atlas of emotions will be effective in helping children (and the young at heart) feel more understood and capable of expressing themselves in peaceful, constructive ways.</p>
<h3>Why an Atlas for Children?</h3>

<p>The Children's Atlas of Emotions  will focus primarily on the social and emotional learning needs of children from ages 8-12 years old. This age range is a precious time in development of connection and relationships- where the fundamentals of emotional communication can be formed for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Our current Atlas of Emotions has reached hundreds of thousands of people and we hope our Children's Atlas will exceed even these numbers. To maximize our impact, we are developing partnerships with universities and educational institutions to provide the greatest reach and breadth for this project.  </p>
<p>This Atlas for Kids will be fundamentally different from the adult Atlas in two ways.</p>
<p>1. This Atlas will be an interactive and engaging platform where in addition to learning new emotion vocabulary kids can safely share emotional experiences to build empathy and connection. For example, if a kid using the Atlas is feeling worried about starting a new school year or excited about a family trip they can share this and see how many others are feeling the same this day or week or month represented in visually engaging info maps.</p>
<p>2. The Atlas of Emotion for Kids will include relational activities for kids to use with peers,  and parents. This pair activity will show us the differences in how we share and interpret the emotions of those around us. Sometimes we misread emotion signals, or are missing them all together, the atlas provides a language for expressing emotions and activities to decode what they mean.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Six years ago we launched our first Indiegogo campaign to raise funds to start one of the first, kids-focused maker labs in North America.

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have some great perks at amazing discounts whether it is our popular STEM/STEAM spring and summer camp, our PD days or in-school programs. We will be using funds raised to further develop out our project kits and a digital maker software platform. We will also be using 10% of funds raised to contribute towards our Access2Innovate foundation that help kids who face various barriers to accessing quality technology programs.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>More than 5000 students have participated in our maker programs and we are proud to see kids that were just eight or nine years old when we started blossom into amazing inventors, creators, artists, engineers and entrepreneurs in their teenage years.

<p>10 years after its inception, it’s time for the <a href=""http://www.keefaktheapp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Keefak</strong></a> mobile application to grow up and go beyond what we can do as a benevolent unfunded team. This has been thoroughly analyzed over the course of this year; here's what motivates it and the roadmap ahead. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Say Hi to project <strong>#Keefak2020</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>As you may know, we developed <strong>Keefak</strong> as a solution to a desire felt by Lebanese abroad, like myself, to preserve and transmit our dialect to our children and companions. I had the idea when my first daughter was born in 2009. The project was then brought to life in 2012 thanks to my brother Joseph El Khoury and an awesome benevolent crew mainly composed of: Pascale Aoudé, Tony Asmar, Antoine Fleyfel and Rawad Rahmé who spent countless hours and days on the project; without forgetting all those who helped and assisted here and there, in one way or another, along the road.</p>
<p><strong>Keefak</strong> allows for French, English, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese translation into Lebanese and it works through phonetic transliteration with no need to know the Arabic script. For example, the word <i>Keefak?</i> is the translation of ‘How are you?’ and is written in Latin letters.</p>
<p>The hundreds of testimonials we’ve been getting from our users tell an ever growing story of a solid bridge being built between Lebanon and its diaspora around the world: “<strong>My grandfather came from Lebanon to Brazil and I’m rescuing my roots by learning Arabic</strong>”, “<i><strong>Mes séjours réguliers à Beyrouth seront encore mieux grâce à vous</strong></i>”,  “<i><strong>Une super appli pour que les enfants n’ayant pas grandi au Liban comprennent la langue maternelle de leur maman ou papa</strong></i>”, and many more.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563719658/zlvaqwatmlmvt6kajyor.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Along the way, we discovered that <strong>Keefak</strong> has also been used as a ‘language passport’ by foreign expats working in the Middle East. We have a lot of American, European and South Asian testimonials showing how much <strong>Keefak</strong> helped them integrate and enhance their career advancement in the GCC countries. In fact, Lebanese is a dialect largely understood in the Arab world.</p>
<p>We also were approached to derive a <strong>Keefak</strong> version for migrant domestic workers in Lebanon. By bridging the language barrier, we believe that the employer-employee relationship gets healthier.</p>
<p><strong>Keefak</strong>, which now counts more than 100 000 downloads worldwide, is totally free and shall remain free of charge on all platforms, namely the <a href=""https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/keefak/id490516744"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Apple App Store</a> and the <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keefak"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Google Play Store</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Keefak</strong> has always been bootstrapped and supported by its ever-growing worldwide users. We have never had any external support whatsoever.</p>
<p>The excellent feedback we’ve been getting from our users along the fair expectations they’ve been expressing: more content, more multimedia, more supported languages, addition of Arabic script, ... brought us to decide to reach out to Lebanon lovers out there and raise up to <strong>100 000 €</strong> through crowdfunding.</p>

<p>We particularly love this funding channel because it’s inclusive, it has a worldwide reach and it’s tailor made to each individual’s or organization’s financial capabilities.</p>
<p>The collected funds will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add new content and courses to the app, along with their translation into French, English, Spanish, Portuguese and German</li>
<li>Add multimedia to the different courses, thus enhancing the learning experience</li>
<li>Rethink the application’s front end and back end</li>
<li>Make the app kid-friendly</li>
<li>Develop a social media “chatbot” to make the learning experience even more interactive</li>
<li>Launch a global and sustainable marketing campaign to reach new potential users worldwide.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re a Lebanon lover, if you share our aim to bring the Lebanese diaspora closer to the homeland, if you want to preserve and transmit our Levantine dialect to the upcoming generation, if you simply want to put “Lebanity” in one single app, please share the word and support our campaign.</p>
<p>Thank you from the heart!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Katalin and have a PhD in cartography. I spent more than 5 years in research of 3D cartographic representation methods and how to create 3D interactive maps.</p>
<p>I think I have nice results, but it is not used in everyday life. After university I couldn't continue my research, and create real products out of my maps. It makes me sad, that many years of hard work was for nothing and could not be used for any purposes.</p>
<p>Therefore I decided to create my own project, a mobile application. I can accomplish here the results of my research and I'm motivated so much now.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need 30,000 USD to create the project without compromise. With this money I can create all maps of the 6 continents: North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. All the maps will have many thematic layers. </p>
<p>I created the demo application myself, but I'm not a developer. I have to pay for an experienced programmer to create a bug free and good working application for IOS and Android. I'd like to pay for the design to my cousin, as right now he is working for me but for free. </p>
<p>The user have to download the maps and print them to use the app. All the maps can be downloaded from a website, so I need a website too. I have to pay for IOS store, and for the tracking SDK Vuforia</p>
<p>I guarantee the domain for 5 years of the website and the stores, and the updates if its needed..</p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, I still make the application. I pay for obligatory costs even if nothing will be left for me. This project is important to me, I want to create it. It is a big help if I don't have to pay the costs on my own.</p>
<p><i>If my project is over-funded I will create more thematic layers, and all the maps will be avaiable  at Elsa""s website with interactive layers and create a globe map with thematic layers.</i></p>
<p><i>You support is really important for me, because the app will be free to use. I won't make any money on it later. This project is pre-funded.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>These maps can be used for educational purposes. Nowadays it's really hard for teachers to attract children’s attention. My interactive maps will help to teachers at school but they will be able to be used at home too.</p>
<p>My maps are supporting expanded learning, they are interactive which is a better form of learning than frontal education.</p>
<p>Knowing the world, the continents, the geography is the base of environmentally conscious thinking. I think I can help with my maps.</p>
<p>The app would be available worldwide, also in 3rd world countries, where the quality of digital curriculum is low. This app makes equal circumstances of learning for all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have the knowledge to create the apps. I know the developer who has experience in AR application and ready to work with me. We have all the knowledge, we only need help with the funding.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I'm really thankful if you can share my project. You can share indiegogo project, but you can find also in facebook (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/elsa3dmap"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/elsa3dmap</a>) </p>

My maps are supporting expanded learning, they are interactive which is a better form of learning than frontal education.
Knowing the world, the continents, the geography is the base of environmentally conscious thinking. I think I can help with my maps.
The app would be available worldwide, also in 3rd world countries, where the quality of digital curriculum is low. This app makes equal circumstances of learning for all.

Risks & Challenges
I have the knowledge to create the apps. I know the developer who has experience in AR application and ready to work with me. We have all the knowledge, we only need help with the funding.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Teodoro Rios Jr has been in healthcare for 16 years.  During his career in healthcare Teodoro has on boarded and trained many professionals. One consistent issue he observed was that many times individuals were inadequately trained during their initial coursework. This led to a need to retrain the healthcare professionals on the basics and department specific regulations and tasks.</p>
<p>During his time in healthcare academia, he realized the probable cause to the lack of knowledge by healthcare professionals was due to the outdated approach to teaching and learning. Subsequently, Teodoro wanted to open his own organization focusing on the quality and need of qualified healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>The campaign is to gain startup capital for Rios Health Academy, LLC. This will be a vocational school specializing on providing quality education to healthcare professions. Individuals who contribute to the campaign will assist in developing a more innovative way to educate quality healthcare professionals to improve overall healthcare needs in Pennsylvania. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will need a total of $65,000 for startup costs. These funds will go to working capital to allow for the organization to purchase supplies, equipment or obtain necessary instructional software. We will provide any contributor with a discount on our programs when they attend the Academy. Individuals that contribute $500 will receive a 5% discount on the tuition of any program. Individuals that contribute $1000 will receive a 10% discount on the tuition of any program. Individuals that contribute $5000 will receive 25% discount on the tuition of any program.</p>
<p>If the campaign does not reach its entire goal we will be utilizing the funds that are received for working capital still. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Individuals who contribute to the campaign will allow for the Academy to begin its work in Pennsylvania. Teodoro has instructed students in his career focusing on quality of education. During his career he has successfully run a program that has resulted in a 95% pass rate on certification exams, and 95% employment rate for graduates. Teodoro will be bringing this same effort and mindset to Rios Health Academy as its owner &amp; CEO building each program from the ground up focusing on the quality of education to provide quality healthcare professionals to health care faculties throughout the state.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If the campaign does not obtain the necessary funds it will be limited in the programs it will be able to provide. Other risks are limited supplies, equipment, and reference materials for students. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>For those individuals who are unable to contribute to the campaign please feel free to speak about it to your friends, families, and coworkers. Please put the word out and direct them to use Indiegogo. When spreading the word to others please ensure you use the Indiegogo share tools.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>We believe that science should be taught the way it actually happens - as a set of questions and unknowns that people are working to understand. Science is a process, not a set of facts, and getting this across is vital when trying to inspire the next generation of scientists. The UK curriculum (key stage 4) even states that: </span></p>
<blockquote><span>""Pupils should be taught ... that there are some questions that science cannot currently answer, and some that science cannot address"" </span></blockquote>
<p>We want to give teachers a way of covering this element of the curriculum whilst still building on knowledge and understanding in other areas of their subject. To achieve this, we will create a set of interrelated but stand alone lesson plans, to help teachers to approach the topic of climate change in different subject areas. They will link into topics specified in the curriculum, and build on this knowledge. This gives teachers maximum flexibility to use a single lesson, or several as an interdisciplinary series spanning multiple subjects.</p>
<p>We believe that these lesson plans will allow students to think about both climate change and science in a new way. By covering the topic in several different subjects, they will realise that the different branches of science are interconnected, understand the importance of collaboration, and the practical applications of science. They will also begin to understand that scientists don’t always have all the answers to a problem, and that the point of science is to continue to ask questions and seek evidence. We hope that by humanising the process of science we will encourage young people to become more engaged in the subject, and inspire more of them to consider a career in science, technology, engineering or maths (STEM).</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p><span></span></p>
<p><span>At Things We Don’t Know, we don’t shy away from taking a risk. Climate change is a contentious topic in some circles, and one some teachers may find difficult to approach. We mitigate these risks as much as possible by taking a strictly neutral approach to the subject material, explaining the phenomena but placing no blame and pointing no fingers, and by working closely with teachers to ensure our materials are as useful as possible by matching the content of the syllabus that they need to teach.</span></p>
<p>It’s possible we won’t reach our goal, but the modular nature of our plan means we can cut down on the number of topics we cover without sacrificing quality of those we do. If we don't reach our goal, then we’ll have some tough decisions to make about which topics we can’t afford to cover, but it won’t stop us entirely.</p>It’s also possible we’ll smash our goal, and we have a list of extra topics for us to cover if this should happen. With the extra cash we’ll also be able to add more supplementary materials (like videos) to accompany the lesson plans.<br/><p></p>

Climate change is something that will affect all of us over our lifetimes, so it is important that young people understand not only what we do know about the subject, but also what our limitations are in understanding it.  *Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths

In February 2002, scientists watched 3,250 square kilometers of ice sheet disintegrate within the space of a month. We still don't understand exactly why or how it happened - you can read more about research into the collapse here.

 What We Need & What You Get Unless you're a teacher, you probably won't want to download our lesson plans. But since we're giving them away for free, it wouldn't make much sense for us to ask you to pay for them as rewards! So instead, we have some unique offers for you.


No crowdfunding campaign is complete without a t-shirt.
Besides the obligatory campaign T-shirt featuring the poor bears in our campaign image, we've teamed up with some amazing people who wanted to support our campaign.
The TWDK team will be creating an hour-long audiobook about ongoing research into climate change, which will be available to download and as physical media (on CD). We've teamed up with UK CD printing company Direct CDs to ensure we can offer a quality product worthy of your shelf space, again featuring Frank's wonderful artwork.

Concept image of our CD perk, which will be sent in a clear clamshell case.
Frank Stark is the graphic artist responsible for creating those poor bears and spearing the Earth with a stick. He's awesome, and promises no bears were forced to learn differential equations for our project. He hasn’t apologised for freezing and stabbing our beautiful planet, though.
We’re also working with Agnes Becker from We Are Stardust to create a unique greetings card designed exclusively for this campaign. We are stardust is an online shop for the curious-minded, specialising in handmade cards inspired by scientific discovery and the mysteries of nature. All items are made from sustainable materials: The cards are Forestry Stewardship Council certified, so you can be sure you are not contributing to the destruction of the world’s forests, the envelopes are made from recycled paper and the cellos are biodegradable. Here's a preview of the artwork:



The card from We Are Stardust

Thomas Egense is a mathematician with an ""evil fractal laboratory"", in which he creates stunning artworks using mathematical (fractal) equations and prints them onto canvas or glass. He's given us permission to offer a number of his biology-themed Fractal Flames prints at a significant discount from their retail price. Each piece is visually stunning, and a powerful reminder of the link between mathematics and nature.


Be sure to tell us which image you want. Names from left to right (top row): seaweed, seahorse, jellyfish, (bottom row): turtle, trilobyte, octopus.

We're looking for 2,000 of your finest Sterling pounds, which we shall use to finance our evil volcano lair safe from the rising flood waters pay our team for the necessary research and writing expenses (everybody needs to eat, after all), plus the costs of the artwork.

    The Impact 
We believe that science should be taught the way it actually happens - as a set of questions and unknowns that people are working to understand. Science is a process, not a set of facts, and getting this across is vital when trying to inspire the next generation of scientists. The UK curriculum (key stage 4) even states that: 
""Pupils should be taught ... that there are some questions that science cannot currently answer, and some that science cannot address"" 
We want to give teachers a way of covering this element of the curriculum whilst still building on knowledge and understanding in other areas of their subject. To achieve this, we will create a set of interrelated but stand alone lesson plans, to help teachers to approach the topic of climate change in different subject areas. They will link into topics specified in the curriculum, and build on this knowledge. This gives teachers maximum flexibility to use a single lesson, or several as an interdisciplinary series spanning multiple subjects.
We believe that these lesson plans will allow students to think about both climate change and science in a new way. By covering the topic in several different subjects, they will realise that the different branches of science are interconnected, understand the importance of collaboration, and the practical applications of science. They will also begin to understand that scientists don’t always have all the answers to a problem, and that the point of science is to continue to ask questions and seek evidence. We hope that by humanising the process of science we will encourage young people to become more engaged in the subject, and inspire more of them to consider a career in science, technology, engineering or maths (STEM).
   Risks & Challenges 
At Things We Don’t Know, we don’t shy away from taking a risk. Climate change is a contentious topic in some circles, and one some teachers may find difficult to approach. We mitigate these risks as much as possible by taking a strictly neutral approach to the subject material, explaining the phenomena but placing no blame and pointing no fingers, and by working closely with teachers to ensure our materials are as useful as possible by matching the content of the syllabus that they need to teach.
It’s possible we won’t reach our goal, but the modular nature of our plan means we can cut down on the number of topics we cover without sacrificing quality of those we do. If we don't reach our goal, then we’ll have some tough decisions to make about which topics we can’t afford to cover, but it won’t stop us entirely.It’s also possible we’ll smash our goal, and we have a list of extra topics for us to cover if this should happen. With the extra cash we’ll also be able to add more supplementary materials (like videos) to accompany the lesson plans.
    
Other Ways You Can Help 
We understand that not everyone is in a position to donate money to make this project happen, but there are other ways you can support us;

If you are a pupil or parent who would love to see our lessons taught in your school, please do let your teachers know about them - remember they are completely free!


Share share share! Even if you can’t contribute, people you know may be able to. Sharing our page on social media will really help raise our profile and give us the best chance of making this project a reality.


If you have a blog, website, or YouTube page and would like to produce some supporting material to go with our lesson plans, please do get in touch - we would be more than happy to collaborate!

If you ever buy stuff online, and you're in the UK, you can help support us by selecting us at your cause over at easyfundraising! We even have a search engine that will earn us 1p for every search you make online (and no, we can't see your search history).
If you have other skills you think we could make use of, and would like to volunteer your time, we would love to hear from you.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Ghana's educational system is in crisis and this is why Teach For Ghana was formed.We are a group of dedicated Ghanaians who believe in the power of every single child to learn and make a difference if provided with the chance to achieve regardless of their socioeconomic background. Our Solution: The Teach For Ghana model provides a holistic solution to the current educational challenge in Ghana. Our solution starts with capable young Ghanaians who are passionate about educational reform.  We recruit recent college graduates, train and place them in classrooms in deprived rural communities for two years with on-going support to effect sustainable change in the form of:Increased number of committed teachers in rural areas
Quality teaching because our fellows will be fully accountable for their classroomsBetter community involvement because our fellows will live in the communities they serve
Our solution engages all major Ghanaian stakeholders and provides the motivation to build long-term solutions to the problem of educational inequity in the country. This comprehensive approach will ensure that challenges facing Ghanaians are addressed sustainably.The image below paints a picture of how our fellows will enact and champion change in Ghana. 
Our Impact:Our goal is to expand our presence to more than 105 schools impacting 15,000 students by the year 2021. Figure 2 below shows our expansion plan for the next three years.In 20 years, a prospering Teach For Ghana will have established an effective program that directly impacts the rural poor while transforming the national educational landscape.  Figure 3 below depicts how the Teach For Ghana fellows will be instrumental in that journey.Fundraising Goal:

<p></p></div>","United For Kids International is a 501 (c) 3
organization that is carrying out its missionary work in several places in
Latin America.
Our mission is to increase self-sufficiency by
providing food, clothing, school and medical supplies to children and their
families without regard to political affiliation, religious belief, or ethnic
identity. 
OUR MISSION
In our ongoing effort to promote education, this month
we traveled to Payita in Nagua, Dominican Republic, we will organize a three-day two-night visit. We will be renting a car and will reduce overall fees by staying at a volunteer’s house and pay for our own bags. 
Located on the north of the Samana Peninsula, Nagua is
a small town that lies on the highway leading from Puerto Plata to the city of Samaná in the north coast of Dominican Republic.
During our current visit we had the opportunity to meet with
officials and group of parents and we were able to understand their needs and how
we can help.
In Payita, approximately 85 children between
ages of 5 and 13 years old are currently going to different schools around
the town.

As there are 1500 refugees in the 3 different camps, we will be needing more funds to sustain them indefinitely. As we will not know when the situation will get better for them and they are able to return home. As such, we are starting with a target of $10,000 for this trip.    The Impact This campaign will help elevate the misery of the refugees as well as provide the road to recovery. We are looking at sustainable farming that will help the refugees to grow their own food as well as providing basic education for the children. 
    Risks & Challenges Our challenge is to see that the project is sustainable and able to continue as long as the refugees are in need of help and support to get them back on their feet. We will look at other programs and work with local NGOs such as Ruman Aceh to ensure that help and support is provided for them. 
    Other Ways You Can Help We are also looking at volunteers who are able to support us in medical mission, therapy for the children as well as expereicne humanitarians who are willing to share their expertise.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our family has been supporting some families in Uganda, through Africa Family Rescue (AFR), for about a year. AFR shares Jesus with families in extreme poverty, through providing hope and dignity in the form of sponsorships that provide for health care, education, and the development of small businesses.</p>
<p>As we've become close friends with the founders of AFR (Ben and Melody Pahlow), we've become more and more convinced that our resources are going to the most worthy of causes. We have the opportunity to receive letters regularly from the families we sponsor, and their stories are so moving! Now, this June, Eden and I have the opportunity to go to Uganda, with the Pahlow's, and spend time with these precious families in person! There will be time to work with them, play with their kids, bring needed supplies, go to church with them...share life with them!</p>
<p>At the bottom of this page is a video from AFR, that I highly recommend. Their work, that we get to partner in (<i>and <b>you </b>can too by donating for this trip</i>), impacts some of the most desperate and impoverished of our fellow human beings on the planet. AFR works with villages where not a single other relief organization operates - none of these starving children are on the radar of Compassion International or World Vision. None of these abused and forgotten women have another shelter reaching out to them. Helping them into a better situation, that they can sustain, fits right into the core of the ministry of Christ;</p>

<p><b>Why we are asking for support?</b></p>
<p>Uplift Comics was founded six years ago with the mission to encourage children to do their best in school, to be “Winners” that reach their potential, practice healthy lifestyles of nutrition and exercise free from drugs and other harmful substances and activities, and to “Be a Buddy and Not a Bully” to encourage children to refrain from hurtful words and actions and to report instances of bullying. Our educational programs have reached thousands of children in Texas and in the last two years we have extended our reach into Southern California. </p>
<p>Uplift Comics is a children’s entertainment and educational company that provides live interactive shows with Live-Action Mascots: The Baby Isaac Crew. These characters perform 30-60 minute shows of dancing, singing, and dialogue that cover a variety of themes including elementary basics conforming with Common Core Standards in Math, Language Arts, and Creative Arts, doing your best in school, anti-bullying, test preparation, business sense, self-esteem, anti-drugs and more. Each show is tailored to the needs of the school or organization and are currently being developed into DVD’s and on-air production.</p>
<p>With measured success in the elementary schools we have expanded our program to middle and high school students. We provide assembly programs for the older grades to talk about entrepreneurship and hidden opportunities in technology and the performing arts. We also provide a  3 month apprenticeship program where students learn all aspects of creation to production including drawing original sketches, vectorizing artwork, scriptwriting, creating characters, music production and show production, filming and editing. </p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<p>We are Sofia, 20, and Elin, 23. Project leaders for the genius project GeniusRAP - rapchoirs to strengthen girls. GeniusRAP is a community and movement with 3 different alignments. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This is a project created and is being led by young people - for young people. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are creating the global platform needed to give girls the opportunity to meet each other and use music as the transformative tool. We cross boarders and through intercultural meetings we eliminate all preconceptions we have against each other. We believe that differences reinforces the similarities and perspectives complement our view of the world. The more perspectives, the stronger the message. We just completed our first rapchoir in Stockholm and the inquiry is larger than we could ever imagine and to meet these needs we need financial support to give more girls the opportunity to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What will we actually be doing?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are passionate for girls rights, well being and have for as long as we can remember </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">dreamt of international cooperations based on GeniusRAP’s values. We believe in the power of </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">changing the society through music as a young woman.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>1. We will have 10 week courses where we inspire young girls to take the place they need to grow in their potential, learn how to rap regardless previous experience and afterwards have the courage to raise their voices in a male-dominated music industry. The course contains freestyle, songwriting, rapping in a choir, dialogues for example about highs and lows of the past week, inspiring workshops with well known artists.</b></p>
<p><b>2. Rapquiors open for all people who define themselves as women in every city, not only in Sweden but all over the world. We learn how to rap, stick together as women and have a blast together. </b></p>
<p><b>3. We, Sofia &amp; Elin, are often asked to lead workshops and lectures at schools to share our experiences regarding <b>how we've always been thinking outside the box, how we can challenge ourselves and pursue our dreams, be proud of ourselves and the responsibility we all have in the way we act.</b></b></p>
<p><b><b><br/></b></b></p>
<h3>Why help us?</h3>
<p>It is hard as a young and non-proft worker to fullfil our visions, due to the limitations of our wallets <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and circle of contacts abroad. We have to be in immidiate contact and create genuine relationships </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">to be able to develop long-lasting cooperations. We all have to work together nationwide, since it is </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">in those contexts we all will develop our approach towards women in the musicindustry and make </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the real change. The more perpectives the stronger the message. The more girls who dare to take </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">more place, the stronger and bigger the ripple effect will be.</span></p>
<p>We want to raise girls creativity, perspectives and experiences to be able to write girls stories <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">together. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We use music, rap in particular, to lift girls creativity, perspectives and experiences to write girls story together. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p><h3>What about your money? - Every penny counts</h3><p>If we would receive money from You, you would help us with our preparation costs and travels during 6 months. </p><p><b>1. We want to create a standard course plan in cooperation with very talented artists and it will give us the chance to start more choirs out there and make it easy for anyone to lead a GeniusRAP choir. We provide the tools and they provide energy and music to their choir.  </b></p><p><b>2. Pay the people who leads the choirs and the 10 week courses. </b></p><p><b>3. We will also have more time preparing our workshops and reach out to schools who need to give their students the extra energy-push and see the future with new eyes. </b></p><p><b>4. We would have money to take the train and a place to rest our heads while going to new cities to help them getting started with the choir.</b></p><p>To accomplish this, we need time. Time does not exist without money and without money GeniusRAP will never reach its full potential. There is so much worth to society getting young girls to feel confident in themselves despite all the pressures of today's society about how to be, act and look like. Imagine that freedom... We’re working so hard for this and we get answers such as ""wait till next year”, ”apply next year”. We can not wait until next year. </p><p></p><p>More
young girls than the 10 that participated in our rapchoir this spring should
have the opportunity to grow in themselves, spend time in a safe environment,
learn how to rap in a choir and express themselves through rap. </p>
<p>Give young girls this opportunity

<p><br/></p></div>","Short Summary

We are Sofia, 20, and Elin, 23. Project leaders for the genius project GeniusRAP - rapchoirs to strengthen girls. GeniusRAP is a community and movement with 3 different alignments. This is a project created and is being led by young people - for young people. 
We are creating the global platform needed to give girls the opportunity to meet each other and use music as the transformative tool. We cross boarders and through intercultural meetings we eliminate all preconceptions we have against each other. We believe that differences reinforces the similarities and perspectives complement our view of the world. The more perspectives, the stronger the message. We just completed our first rapchoir in Stockholm and the inquiry is larger than we could ever imagine and to meet these needs we need financial support to give more girls the opportunity to grow.


What will we actually be doing?

We are passionate for girls rights, well being and have for as long as we can remember dreamt of international cooperations based on GeniusRAP’s values. We believe in the power of changing the society through music as a young woman.

1. We will have 10 week courses where we inspire young girls to take the place they need to grow in their potential, learn how to rap regardless previous experience and afterwards have the courage to raise their voices in a male-dominated music industry. The course contains freestyle, songwriting, rapping in a choir, dialogues for example about highs and lows of the past week, inspiring workshops with well known artists.
2. Rapquiors open for all people who define themselves as women in every city, not only in Sweden but all over the world. We learn how to rap, stick together as women and have a blast together. 
3. We, Sofia & Elin, are often asked to lead workshops and lectures at schools to share our experiences regarding how we've always been thinking outside the box, how we can challenge ourselves and pursue our dreams, be proud of ourselves and the responsibility we all have in the way we act.

Why help us?
It is hard as a young and non-proft worker to fullfil our visions, due to the limitations of our wallets and circle of contacts abroad. We have to be in immidiate contact and create genuine relationships to be able to develop long-lasting cooperations. We all have to work together nationwide, since it is in those contexts we all will develop our approach towards women in the musicindustry and make the real change. The more perpectives the stronger the message. The more girls who dare to take more place, the stronger and bigger the ripple effect will be.
We want to raise girls creativity, perspectives and experiences to be able to write girls stories together. We use music, rap in particular, to lift girls creativity, perspectives and experiences to write girls story together. 

What about your money? - Every penny countsIf we would receive money from You, you would help us with our preparation costs and travels during 6 months. 1. We want to create a standard course plan in cooperation with very talented artists and it will give us the chance to start more choirs out there and make it easy for anyone to lead a GeniusRAP choir. We provide the tools and they provide energy and music to their choir.  2. Pay the people who leads the choirs and the 10 week courses. 3. We will also have more time preparing our workshops and reach out to schools who need to give their students the extra energy-push and see the future with new eyes. 4. We would have money to take the train and a place to rest our heads while going to new cities to help them getting started with the choir.To accomplish this, we need time. Time does not exist without money and without money GeniusRAP will never reach its full potential. There is so much worth to society getting young girls to feel confident in themselves despite all the pressures of today's society about how to be, act and look like. Imagine that freedom... We’re working so hard for this and we get answers such as ""wait till next year”, ”apply next year”. We can not wait until next year. More
young girls than the 10 that participated in our rapchoir this spring should
have the opportunity to grow in themselves, spend time in a safe environment,
learn how to rap in a choir and express themselves through rap. 
Give young girls this opportunity
by helping us in any way you can to connect us with the right people who does
not expect millions in profits in 3 years, but people who think that
everyone has the right to take part in a platform where one can grow through
rap regardless previous experience, changing a male-dominated music industry
and approaching the future and dreams with a new energy. Share this and make
this reality for all young girls out there! We are here waiting for you. Hugs!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

However, this year is different because we will be spltting into two groups, half of us going to Cambodia and the other half going to Nanning, China.

In this rehabilitation village, the villagers are put under social stigma by the government, the public, and even their own families. People are unaware that after you have been cured from leprosy, you're cured. It's gone and you're fully cleared of it, but because of the deformations that leprosy has caused to your body, people are afraid of them. Our school will be going to the village, interacting with the villagers, following them around in their day-to-day lives, showing them love and care, and helping to repair/improve the facilities that they have in the village since they don't get any funding from the government, but most importantly, we are there to reduce the social stigma between them and the rest of the country, in order to unite them with neighbouring villages and make them feel more a part of where they are.</p></div>

the work of Y-Apply will be complete. </p>
<p><b>What We Need</b></p>
<p>We need to
raise $50,000 to fund the production costs of our programs this fall. Your
tax-deductible contribution will help us encourage bright and talented students to
pursue their dreams and apply to the America’s top colleges and universities
with the full support of their families.</p>
<p>Due to the intimate and interactive nature of our program, the number of
student participants is limited to twenty in each city. Each student is allowed to invite only one parent/guardian to attend with them. A gift of $250 will
cover the cost of one program participant.</p>
<p>Sadly, the lack of
information, encouragement and support provided by programs like Y-Apply can
make all the difference in the future of these promising, young minds. If we are
unable to reach our fundraising goal, the opportunity to help a gifted student
successfully apply to the college of his or her dreams may be lost…</p>

raise $50,000 to fund the production costs of our programs this fall. Your
tax-deductible contribution will help us encourage bright and talented students to
pursue their dreams and apply to the America’s top colleges and universities
with the full support of their families.
Due to the intimate and interactive nature of our program, the number of
student participants is limited to twenty in each city. Each student is allowed to invite only one parent/guardian to attend with them. A gift of $250 will
cover the cost of one program participant.
Sadly, the lack of
information, encouragement and support provided by programs like Y-Apply can
make all the difference in the future of these promising, young minds. If we are
unable to reach our fundraising goal, the opportunity to help a gifted student
successfully apply to the college of his or her dreams may be lost…
Other Ways You
Can Help
While we are
grateful for any and all financial contributions made, if you are
unable to make a contribution at this time, there are other ways you can help:

word out!  Use your social media or Indiegogo share tools to tell your

On behalf of
our board and the students and families we serve and will continue to serve,
