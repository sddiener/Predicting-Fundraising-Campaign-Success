I wanted to develop something revolutionary that would change the world – keeping in mind that I wanted my product to always be on demand. As a result, I began to think about the shoe industry for women. I realized that all women like shoes, and they will keep wanting more until the end of time. I found that women worried more about the appearance of a shoe, rather than its comfort. Although with every shoe that they bought, they would never be satisfied because there was always something wrong with them. As a result, I decided to find out what these underlying “somethings” were. After analyzing my close friends and family members, they all agreed on the following three negative characteristics of shoes:</p><ul>
<li>Comfort: After a matter of minutes, the heels made their feet tired and hurt.</li>
<li>Quality: After using the shoes a handful of times, they all noticed that the shoes were deteriorating and ultimately falling apart.</li>

Using leather will solve the problem of shoe deterioration because it does not degrade easily. As far as comfort, we came up with a special enhancement in the insole of the shoe where we combine semi-orthopedic comfort with a surrounding smooth leather. Ultimately, I wanted to create a product so women did not have to worry about taking off their high heels after an hour of wearing them. I want them to feel as though they are wearing regular flat shoes, while wearing high heels.</p><p>When coming up with the best business model, I realized that my shoes needed to be attainable to every woman. By attainable, I mean having an affordable price. I needed a price in which women would not even slightly hesitate about purchasing the shoes. The shoes that I have created are beautiful in appearance and extremely comfortable – which is why having a great price is a major attribute that would make my product be even more desirable. From the ideas stated above, my business emerged, along with its three pillars:</p><ol>
<li>Exclusive designs</li>
<li>Dreamed comfort</li>
<li>Incomparable price</li>

My goal, as of now, is to expand my company into the United States, although I am short of the capital and channel support I need to accomplish this goal. As a result, I developed strategies that I would like to install:</p><ul>
<li>Start an Indiegogo campaign to promote awareness and obtain funding for Bella Comodità’s expansion</li>
<li>Create an ecommerce business, where I can display the quality and beauty of my shoes</li>
<li>Create a nationwide catalog where a group of people will personally go out and sell the shoes in different cities throughout the United States</li>
<li>Sell Bella Comodità shoes to boutiques and small businesses, meanwhile the brand becomes known</li>
<li>Open Bella Comodità stores worldwide in the long run</li>
</ul><p><strong>Risk &amp; challenges</strong></p><p>A challenge that may arise is the conversion of the United States shoe sizes into Colombian sizes. Since the units of shoe length are different, there may be confusion when choosing the correct measure. Although this scenario is not too probable, it can be easily fixed just by contacting us.</p><p>There could be a risk in shipping delays. Since the shoes will be shipped directly from the factory in Colombia to your home, a shipping delay may happen due to unforeseen circumstances.

Create an ecommerce business, where I can display the quality and beauty of my shoes
Create a nationwide catalog where a group of people will personally go out and sell the shoes in different cities throughout the United States
Sell Bella Comodità shoes to boutiques and small businesses, meanwhile the brand becomes known
Open Bella Comodità stores worldwide in the long run
Risk & challengesA challenge that may arise is the conversion of the United States shoe sizes into Colombian sizes. Since the units of shoe length are different, there may be confusion when choosing the correct measure. Although this scenario is not too probable, it can be easily fixed just by contacting us.There could be a risk in shipping delays. Since the shoes will be shipped directly from the factory in Colombia to your home, a shipping delay may happen due to unforeseen circumstances. But do not worry, you will receive your shoes!If you have any questions, feel free to contact us. SIZING SCALE FOR YOUR SHOESWE ONLY OFFER SIZES FROM SIZE 5 (35) TO SIZE 9 (40).

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> Ich heiße Franziska Frericks und startete den ersten ernsthaften Versuch von meiner Arbeit als Kreativschaffende zu leben vor knapp zehn Jahren, erst mit Ausstellungen in Räumen zur Zwischennutzung und später für zwei Jahre in einem eigenen Laden. So lange wechseln sich die Phasen zwischen Jobs zum Geld Verdienen und ein neues Projekt beginnen miteinander ab und genau das würde ich jetzt gerne ändern</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> Anfang Januar 2013 hab ich ein Konzept geschrieben und mich auf den Weg gemacht. Ganz oben auf der Liste dieses Konzeptes steht meine diesjährige Teilnahme am DMY-Festival vom 5-9.Juni 2013.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> Seit Februar 2013 bin ich angemeldet und werde am Festival meine „Schaumwelt“-Serie vorstellen.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> Die Serie heißt deshalb Schaumwelt weil der Werkstoff aus dem die Objekte entstehen geschäumtes Polystyrol, besser bekannt unter dem Markennamen Styropor ist. Das faszinierende für mich an diesem simplen Dämmmaterial ist, dass es, übereinander gelegt, Schatten erzeugt und zusätzlich Farben durchlässt. Die Streuung der eingesetzten Lichtquelle (eine Leuchtstofflampe wahlweise mit kalter oder warmer Fabtemperatur) ist sowohl atmosphärisch als auch hell. Der Lichteffekt ist vergleichbar mit Mondlicht je nach Farbtemperatur während verschiedener Phasen der Nacht.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> Jeder einzelne Sonnenauf- und Untergang den ich erlebe löst eine erbsengroße Emotion des Glücks darüber in mir aus, auf der Welt zu sein. Der eigenen Emotion von Glück und anderen Gefühlen eine Form zu geben, sie in ein Objekt zu „packen“, sie mit Farbmischungen aus zukleiden und dann zum Leuchten zu bringen bezeichne ich deshalb als Leitfaden durch meine Arbeit.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> Zwei weitere elementare Punkte des Konzeptes sind sind der Aufbau eines eigenen Online-Shops und mein Anschluss an ein Netzwerk welches zu mir und meiner Arbeit passt.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0cm;""> <em><strong>My name ist Franziska Frericks, originally from Switzerland and I live in Berlin for 21 years, 18 of those with my daughter. The first time I startet my independence was ten years ago. During this time I made my approach in Lighting Design. In the course of this ten years I lalternated between doing jobs for earn money and realize my projects. Now, with the help of Indiegogo and in this sense with the help of you I hope that I can reach stability for my creative business by following a concept. The plan is that I will be part of the DMY-Festival in this summer in Berlin and present there my objects called „foamworld.“It is called „foamworld“ because the objects are made of styrofoam. I love this material because for me it is the perfect way to create a design of shades, reflexions and colors in the same time. More goals for my business are to build an online-shop and for me to be stable part of a network for creative working people. </strong></em></p>

<p> </p></div>","Liebe Besucher meiner Kampagne, liebe Indiegogo Community
 Ich heiße Franziska Frericks und startete den ersten ernsthaften Versuch von meiner Arbeit als Kreativschaffende zu leben vor knapp zehn Jahren, erst mit Ausstellungen in Räumen zur Zwischennutzung und später für zwei Jahre in einem eigenen Laden. So lange wechseln sich die Phasen zwischen Jobs zum Geld Verdienen und ein neues Projekt beginnen miteinander ab und genau das würde ich jetzt gerne ändern
 Anfang Januar 2013 hab ich ein Konzept geschrieben und mich auf den Weg gemacht. Ganz oben auf der Liste dieses Konzeptes steht meine diesjährige Teilnahme am DMY-Festival vom 5-9.Juni 2013.
 Seit Februar 2013 bin ich angemeldet und werde am Festival meine „Schaumwelt“-Serie vorstellen.
 Die Serie heißt deshalb Schaumwelt weil der Werkstoff aus dem die Objekte entstehen geschäumtes Polystyrol, besser bekannt unter dem Markennamen Styropor ist. Das faszinierende für mich an diesem simplen Dämmmaterial ist, dass es, übereinander gelegt, Schatten erzeugt und zusätzlich Farben durchlässt. Die Streuung der eingesetzten Lichtquelle (eine Leuchtstofflampe wahlweise mit kalter oder warmer Fabtemperatur) ist sowohl atmosphärisch als auch hell. Der Lichteffekt ist vergleichbar mit Mondlicht je nach Farbtemperatur während verschiedener Phasen der Nacht.
 Jeder einzelne Sonnenauf- und Untergang den ich erlebe löst eine erbsengroße Emotion des Glücks darüber in mir aus, auf der Welt zu sein. Der eigenen Emotion von Glück und anderen Gefühlen eine Form zu geben, sie in ein Objekt zu „packen“, sie mit Farbmischungen aus zukleiden und dann zum Leuchten zu bringen bezeichne ich deshalb als Leitfaden durch meine Arbeit.
 Zwei weitere elementare Punkte des Konzeptes sind sind der Aufbau eines eigenen Online-Shops und mein Anschluss an ein Netzwerk welches zu mir und meiner Arbeit passt.
 My name ist Franziska Frericks, originally from Switzerland and I live in Berlin for 21 years, 18 of those with my daughter. The first time I startet my independence was ten years ago. During this time I made my approach in Lighting Design. In the course of this ten years I lalternated between doing jobs for earn money and realize my projects. Now, with the help of Indiegogo and in this sense with the help of you I hope that I can reach stability for my creative business by following a concept. The plan is that I will be part of the DMY-Festival in this summer in Berlin and present there my objects called „foamworld.“It is called „foamworld“ because the objects are made of styrofoam. I love this material because for me it is the perfect way to create a design of shades, reflexions and colors in the same time. More goals for my business are to build an online-shop and for me to be stable part of a network for creative working people. 
 
 
 
 
 An dieser Stelle hier möchte ich mich namentlich bei den Menschen bedanken, die es möglich gemacht haben, dass ich mein Konzept bis hierhin umsetzen konnte – in der Reihenfolge ihres Erscheines The following people have made possible the implementation of my concept until now

<br/><h3>A Little About US</h3> <p></p>
<p>We demand success and work hard to make things happen. Here's a quick review of the kind of success we've experienced:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>In 2007</b> - we started our custom gloves series with just a small amount of money we had saved (we'll give you a hint ... it was less than what we're asking for here).  We only had money for product. We had $0 marketing budget and relied solely on word of mouth.</li>
<li>
<b>By 2009 </b>- one of our gloves appeared on the cover of ESPN Rise.</li>
<li>
<b>By 2010</b> - w<span>e had clients in the minors and majors. Our gloves began appearing all over the world - from individual players to major teams (the national teams for Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Australia, Germany, and Cuba for example)</span>
</li>
<li><span><b>By 2012</b> - our gloves appeared on broadcasts of ESPN, The World Baseball Classic, and The Next Knuckler. </span></li>
</ul>
<div>Now it's 2014. We're ready to grow and start some limited edition lines of our gloves. What you see offered here is just a glimpse at all the glove and product ideas we have. We'll have to start small at first, of course, but we made our custom glove business grow and we'll do the same with our limited editions.</div>
<p>This is just the start for us. We have the quality, the talent, and the drive. We just need your help to move to the next level!</p>

<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <p>Starting a line of gloves takes investment. We have to buy leathers and models, set aside time to develop glove designs, market our products, redesign our website, and more. We're asking for a minimum of $4,000 so we can move forward. Obviously, the more money we raise, the faster we will grow! Here's a breakdown of our plan for funds raised:</p> <ul>
<li>
<b>67%</b> - <b>Product Design and Creation</b> <br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">By far most of our funds go into purchasing leather, but this portion also includes details like models, threads, dyes, boxes, glove bags, and time to create the gloves. Because we will purchase a certain quantity of leather, we will have extra material left over to make gloves that will remain in our inventory for future online sales. </span>
</li>
<li>
<b>17%</b> <b>- Marketing<br/></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We intend to use our social media pages (over 10,000 followers between Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, etc) as well as branch into some local advertising. </span>
</li>
<li>
<b>17%</b> <b>- Website Design<br/></b>We create our own websites, so this will cover the amount of time it will take as well as any necessary software upgrades.</li>

</div><strong>
</strong><p>Hi I’m Ann-Marie, a graphic
designer. Like many of you, I was tired of the typical twee greeting cards
available in shops and through mainstream internet sellers. (And the lack of
good old fashioned swearing!) I started creating cards for my friends and
family that were more my style: my sense of humour, saying what I wanted
to...no matter how close to the bone or sweary! I loved sending them and people
were genuinely delighted to receive them!</p><p></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884815/files/20140926125206-077.JPG?1411761126"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p></p>
<p>Soon, friends and family were asking
me to make cards for them to give too. It began to snowball and it didn't take
much for me to be persuaded to start selling my cards to friends of friends and
it was at that point that 'Phuckadoodledoo' was born!</p>
<p>From the start, I knew that I
wanted Phuckadoodledoo cards to be fun, honest and irreverent, but quality was
also of the utmost importance.  Instead
of a flat, digital print – like so much of what you can buy now – I wanted to
return to the old art of letterpress so since June 2014 I have been partnered
with Beau Monde, a fabulous printing studio in the UK, to letterpress my card
designs which I sell online. I was amazed and delighted that so many of you liked
my work and shared my views on cards and what I wanted to say in them (swears
and all!)</p><p></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884822/files/20140926125903-080.JPG?1411761543"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p>
<p>I am very passionate about giving
people special cards and presents whatever the occasion. I hate having to
choose something emotionless and not really that funny! And I definitely
don't want something that has been mass-produced – I want my gifts to be a talking
point, something quirky, showing a bit of thought and a personal touch.</p><p></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884814/files/20140926124935-tote_bag1.jpg?1411760975"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p></p>
<p>Having breathed fresh, sweary air
into greetings cards, I now want to do the same with gifts.  I’ve decided to combine my cheeky, sweary
designs with other printable gifts: mugs, T-shirts, notebooks and bags. These
will be offered with original Phuckadoodledoo designs or I’ll work with you to
produce bespoke artwork for your unique printing. Now I need your help to make
this a reality and share them with the world.</p><p></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/884781/files/20140926123033-notebook1.jpg?1411759833"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p>
<p>I’m looking to raise £3,000. This
is to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Limited Edition rewards for
Indiegogo such as mugs, bags and notebooks</p></li>
<li><p>Equipment for future mug and
cloth printing</p></li>
<li><p>Initial start up blank stock mugs,
bags and notebooks ready for printing</p></li>
<li><p>Shipping and handling for rewards</p></li>
</ul><p>If I reach £5,000 I will increase
the range of products to include T-shirts, coasters, towels, aprons, key rings
and soft toys...</p>
<p><b>Let the Phucking world know!</b></p>
<p>You may love this idea and want
to get some of our products in the future, but can’t contribute to this
campaign now. That’s not a problem. All I ask is that you share this project -
tell the world about it! The more people like us that want it and can help out,
the more chance we have of making that printed, sweary baby bib a reality!!</p>

me to make cards for them to give too. It began to snowball and it didn't take
much for me to be persuaded to start selling my cards to friends of friends and
it was at that point that 'Phuckadoodledoo' was born!
From the start, I knew that I
wanted Phuckadoodledoo cards to be fun, honest and irreverent, but quality was
also of the utmost importance.  Instead
of a flat, digital print – like so much of what you can buy now – I wanted to
return to the old art of letterpress so since June 2014 I have been partnered
with Beau Monde, a fabulous printing studio in the UK, to letterpress my card
designs which I sell online. I was amazed and delighted that so many of you liked
my work and shared my views on cards and what I wanted to say in them (swears
and all!)
I am very passionate about giving
people special cards and presents whatever the occasion. I hate having to
choose something emotionless and not really that funny! And I definitely
don't want something that has been mass-produced – I want my gifts to be a talking
point, something quirky, showing a bit of thought and a personal touch.
Having breathed fresh, sweary air
into greetings cards, I now want to do the same with gifts.  I’ve decided to combine my cheeky, sweary
designs with other printable gifts: mugs, T-shirts, notebooks and bags. These
will be offered with original Phuckadoodledoo designs or I’ll work with you to
produce bespoke artwork for your unique printing. Now I need your help to make
this a reality and share them with the world.
I’m looking to raise £3,000. This
is to cover:

Limited Edition rewards for
Indiegogo such as mugs, bags and notebooks
Equipment for future mug and
cloth printing
Initial start up blank stock mugs,
bags and notebooks ready for printing
Shipping and handling for rewards
If I reach £5,000 I will increase
the range of products to include T-shirts, coasters, towels, aprons, key rings
and soft toys...
Let the Phucking world know!
You may love this idea and want
to get some of our products in the future, but can’t contribute to this
campaign now. That’s not a problem. All I ask is that you share this project -
tell the world about it! The more people like us that want it and can help out,
the more chance we have of making that printed, sweary baby bib a reality!!

<p>Hello! We are GDM – Glyndwr
Designer Makers.</p>
<p>Our project is to raise enough
money for our little team to exhibit our graduate collection at New Designers
2014 in London this June.</p>
<p>As our team this year is so
small the cost for each student to exhibit is very high, and like most students
spare cash is not something we have in abundance.</p>
<p>Exhibiting at New Designers
will provide a professional platform for us all to find work, placements and
commissions.</p>
<p>For many of us this is the last
chance we will have to exhibit as graduates at this prestigious event. </p>
<p><b>Why we need your
help!</b></p>
<p>To exhibit at New Designers
this year we need to raise a monster £4000! (and that is just for the stand)</p>
<p>On top of the costs for the
stand, we have travel and accommodation costs for six people to stay in London
for the duration of the exhibition.</p>
<p>We are all working overtime to
raise the funds but we still need your help…</p>
<p><b>What You Get!</b></p>
<p>Of course we want to give back
to those who support us and we have a few perks that we can offer in order to
say Thank You!</p>
<p>We will be offering a number of
invitations to New Designers, a number of invitations to the awards evening and
the opportunity for some lucky supporters to own a beautiful piece of hand
crafted design work from a designer of your choice within the team.</p>
<p>Business owners who may wish to
sponsor the stand will be credited on the stand and in our promotional
literature…Great exposure to an estimated 16,000 visitors.</p>

<p>Your contribution could
have a massive impact on our future as working designers.</p>

Yes, it was the „king“ himself who gave the spark for the idea. In his video „Always On My Mind“ you can see a watch that is huge on his
wrist!"" We noticed it, we liked it, we made our own! ""
Since then, we have worked on our own design and
prototype for two long years, getting to know it by wearing it and improving
it-making it more comfortable. ""And now YOU can have it! ""Read our review on Watchuseek
The very FIRST Estonian wrist watch!

Estonia is a small European country known for Skype, Ewert And The Two Dragons,
the great sumo wrestler Baruto Kaido Höövelson etc.  Estonia is also known for combining innovation and high technology and that´s what we have done with Aegaon watches.There would be no greater
honor, than to take our small nation to the world map with another great thing -AEGAON watches! 
How it´s made and what´s our goal? 
We need to raise 20 000 USD to get the production going. It is expensive to produce this watch in small quantities. We would have to get only one greater line in production to get us started.
Our casings are made by a high technology CNC cuting machine that is actually used for airplane parts on everyday basis by our Estonian partners.
Every casing is carefully polished in a specific machine we need to invest in.
All AEGAON watches are assembled in Estonia by professionals.

Every single contributor will get an AEGAON watch, wether we reach our goal or not!
We have many more great ideas and designs waiting to be seen. Our main goal is to release a whole line of AEGAON watches!A watch for every contribution!
 Our main goal is to get our watches out there and thats how we have set up our campaign!  
You will get a watch for every  contribution!
 The first 50 Aegaon watches will be given out for 350 EUR/ 477 USD
 The rest  will be given out for 450 EUR/ 612 USD
""Aegaon Special"" will be given for 800EUR/1089USD

The first 50 contributors will get their watches a month after the campaign.
The next 300 will get their watches 2 moths after the campaign.

  We have minimized all risks in the line of producing the watches. It may become a challange to get all the watches assembled in a reasonable amount of time IF we get more orders than we bargained for.

<p><b>Mission</b></p>
<p>It will always be about inspiration and influence. We’re passionate about creating products that envelope the concepts of leadership. Our goal is to make the wearers of our products feel confident about their style and to perpetually strive for greatness. We want people to conceive the idea of being positive leaders that inspire and influence.</p>
<p>As Meisters we realize our responsibility…  Through our passion we will cultivate leaders; turn Prodigys to Icons, our work is never done. MSTR exists to provide validation to the individuals of each generation who are deemed “influencers.” We aspire to inspire, one accessory at a time.</p>
<p><b>Meister</b></p>
<p>“Meister” is a translation from the German word for  “Master” - who is a revered leader and artisan qualified to teach others. A Meister is known as a superior taste maker who inspires others and paves the path into the future. This timepiece series was created to push the boundaries of contemporary fashion without compromising traditional craftsmanship. Meister watches feature multi-pieced designs that blend various materials such as carbon fiber, stainless steel, and an assortment of rare leathers into a bold collection of functional timepieces.</p>

<p>Meister (MSTR) is an independently owned and operated company based out of Los Angeles, California that was founded in June 2009 by Kingson Tse &amp; Ryan Pietersz.  Being fashion connoisseurs themselves, they realized the absence of a designer accessory brand that offers quality watches at an affordable price.  With the growing number of fashion conscious consumers in mind, MSTR was created to fill that void. Although headquartered in Southern California, MSTR’s designs reflect styles found from all around the world. Kingson and Ryan have been fortunate enough to travel to various global destinations that have inspired them to create unique timepieces that showcase the world’s taste in wrist fashion. <i><strong>They understood that building a successful brand does not happen overnight and although many unforeseen factors came into play that hindered their growth, they knew that with dedication, integrity, and passion - success would follow.</strong></i></p>

</div></div>","PURPOSE  MSTR is proud and excited to finally release our Automatic watches!!!Since we started MSTR 7 years ago, we’ve had numerous request for automatic watches, but could not create affordable models that maintain our standards of quality through the traditional retail business model. Thanks to the rise of crowdfunding, we're now able to raise funds and exclusively sell direct-to-consumers to cut out the middle-man and keep our prices down. We're excited to finally give our loyal and supportive fans what they've been asking for!  DELIVERING ON OUR PROMISEAs experienced watchmakers, we have already began production on our Early Bird watches.  These will be ready for delivery as soon as the campaign ends in November.  The rest of the watches will still deliver in time for the holidays! 
DESIGN & CRAFTSMANSHIP Designed in California with worldwide influences... There are a couple of features that make an automatic watch so special. First no battery is required for the movement... it creates and stores kinetic energy from your wrist.  When you move the mechanics of the watch will spin and generate energy to power the watch. The movement is composed of many more gears and components than a traditional quartz battery operated watches. The other feature is that the second hand no longer ticks, instead it sweeps seamlessly.For this campaign there are two different automatic watches to choose from; the Noble and the Speedster THE AUTOMATIC WATCHES 
The NOBLE The Noble is the simpler design with subtle features that draw out its beauty. We took elements from our flagship Ambassador watch and simplified it. The case and bezel are not only buff, but intricate, with precision cuts, hexagon bolts, and a polished bezel. The carbon fiber dial face is overlaid with polished 3D indicators and a sweeping second hand to create depth. It’s protected with a tough sapphire crystal lens that’s been further improved with an anti-reflective coating.The Noble is constructed of premium materials and parts to ensure lasting durability. It’s made of NASA grade 316L stainless steel with a screw down crown to secure the adjustment knob. The workings of the 21 jewel automatic Miyota 821A movement can be viewed under the back case.Great design doesn’t sacrifice function. A dual layer gasket along with the screw down crown give the Noble 10 ATM of water resistance. The mechanical movement can store almost 2 days of power and includes a date window. Luminescent hands give night time visibility. The full stainless steel band is held together with a quick-release two-button butterfly clasp. The band can be swapped to a leather or silicon/rubber strap. This versatility allows you to easily change up the look and feel of the watch.  The Noble will be available in Rose Gold, Champagne Gold, Silver, or Black.
 
 The SPEEDSTER

The Speedster is our over-sized watch with a racecar inspired design. It features a larger 45mm, multi-piece bolt down case and a layered bezel cut to resemble an engine piston. The numerical hour indicators and minute hash marks overlay a carbon fiber dial face with sub-dials to emulate the gauge clusters of popular race cars. The spinning gears of the automatic movement are exposed to showcase the ""engine"" that drives the watch. A sapphire lens with an anti-reflective coating also protects the watch.The Speedster is premium built to ensure lasting quality. It’s also made of NASA grade 316L stainless steel with a screw down crown to secure the adjustment knob. It features a 21 jewel automatic Miyota 82S7 movement that shows the seconds on a subdial. The backcase has an exhibition window to show off the movement under a MSTR lens.The design of any true racecar must also be functional. The Speedster also has 10 ATM of water resistance, 45 hours of power, luminescent hands, and a quick-release two-button butterfly clasp. It features an additional 24-hour subdial clock.  The Speedster will be available in Rose Gold, Silver, or Black.
 
      




TESTIMONIALS Featuring Ben Chung & Mike Song of the Kinjaz and US Olympic medalist Will Claye. Each person got the chance to try on our newest samples and give their thoughts. 
    MOVEMENTSelecting a movement was tough, the goal of this project is to design a great looking automatic watches at an affordable price. After much research, we found 21-jewel Japanese Miyota movements that met our needs for quality and price.    Packaging

Meister
“Meister” is a translation from the German word for  “Master” - who is a revered leader and artisan qualified to teach others. A Meister is known as a superior taste maker who inspires others and paves the path into the future. This timepiece series was created to push the boundaries of contemporary fashion without compromising traditional craftsmanship. Meister watches feature multi-pieced designs that blend various materials such as carbon fiber, stainless steel, and an assortment of rare leathers into a bold collection of functional timepieces.
 
OUR HISTORY
 
Ryan & Kingson - Interview on The HUNDREDS blog
Meister (MSTR) is an independently owned and operated company based out of Los Angeles, California that was founded in June 2009 by Kingson Tse & Ryan Pietersz.  Being fashion connoisseurs themselves, they realized the absence of a designer accessory brand that offers quality watches at an affordable price.  With the growing number of fashion conscious consumers in mind, MSTR was created to fill that void. Although headquartered in Southern California, MSTR’s designs reflect styles found from all around the world. Kingson and Ryan have been fortunate enough to travel to various global destinations that have inspired them to create unique timepieces that showcase the world’s taste in wrist fashion. They understood that building a successful brand does not happen overnight and although many unforeseen factors came into play that hindered their growth, they knew that with dedication, integrity, and passion - success would follow.

We're a new Dutch watch brand focusing on great products with a sustainable heart.</p><p>In May we started our crowdfunding campaign and successfully funded our Gyre SeaCleaner on Kickstarter. A tremendous rush and it was very fulfilling to see the project being brought to life by almost 300 backers. After that we kept receiving many requests to pre-order the watch and also repeatedly got the question of when we would add a blue color option. We are now in production for the first edition and want to use Indiegogo InDemand to keep accepting these pre-orders and also offer the blue version of the Gyre SeaCleaner in a limited edition.</p><p>We see it as a perfect step before we launch our webshop. As you can see, the watch is production ready. Actually it is in production already and have been covered extensively in the media, which you can see below. We're very proud of that and hope you will part of our mission to raise awareness and battle the problem of plastic waste in our oceans and on our coastlines.</p><p>● Dutch sports watch made out of recycled fishing nets from the ocean.</p><p>● Own design - from case to dial - 42mm with sapphire glass and solar powered movement.</p><p>● Every watch sold supports local fishermen and 5% of our turnover will be donated to The Ocean Cleanup foundation.*</p><p>● Creating a community that commits itself to cleaning the oceans and keeping them  clean, one watch at a time.</p><p>● GYRE - ˈjī(-ə)r’ - A circular or spiral motion or form / a giant circular oceanic surface current.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593536608/anxjscg23o71kcwsbnkg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>*We are not affiliated with The Ocean Cleanup.

After the Indiegogo campaign we will communicate to all of our backers when we made the donation and the exact amount.</p><p>Although all kinds of plastic are found in the world’s oceans, fishing nets are the biggest concern. A recent survey done by The Ocean Cleanup, states that at least 46 percent of the plastic found in the ‘Great Pacific Garbage Patch’ - a floating plastic gyre the size of France, Germany and Spain combined - comes from fishing nets.  A massive 640.000 tonnes of these ‘ghost fishing nets’ are left in the seas every year. This adds greatly to the pollution, but also damages coral reefs and traps vast numbers of sea creatures.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594117324/zxrjg2yn7zw7uhi2lbdu.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We started Gyre to protect a place that is dear to us: the Ocean.

We're a new Dutch watch brand focusing on great products with a sustainable heart.In May we started our crowdfunding campaign and successfully funded our Gyre SeaCleaner on Kickstarter. A tremendous rush and it was very fulfilling to see the project being brought to life by almost 300 backers. After that we kept receiving many requests to pre-order the watch and also repeatedly got the question of when we would add a blue color option. We are now in production for the first edition and want to use Indiegogo InDemand to keep accepting these pre-orders and also offer the blue version of the Gyre SeaCleaner in a limited edition.We see it as a perfect step before we launch our webshop. As you can see, the watch is production ready. Actually it is in production already and have been covered extensively in the media, which you can see below. We're very proud of that and hope you will part of our mission to raise awareness and battle the problem of plastic waste in our oceans and on our coastlines.● Dutch sports watch made out of recycled fishing nets from the ocean.● Own design - from case to dial - 42mm with sapphire glass and solar powered movement.● Every watch sold supports local fishermen and 5% of our turnover will be donated to The Ocean Cleanup foundation.*● Creating a community that commits itself to cleaning the oceans and keeping them  clean, one watch at a time.● GYRE - ˈjī(-ə)r’ - A circular or spiral motion or form / a giant circular oceanic surface current.  *We are not affiliated with The Ocean Cleanup. The foundation is one of our inspirations and stands for what we want to achieve. So we chose them to contribute to with a donation of a percentage of our sales. After the Indiegogo campaign we will communicate to all of our backers when we made the donation and the exact amount.Although all kinds of plastic are found in the world’s oceans, fishing nets are the biggest concern. A recent survey done by The Ocean Cleanup, states that at least 46 percent of the plastic found in the ‘Great Pacific Garbage Patch’ - a floating plastic gyre the size of France, Germany and Spain combined - comes from fishing nets.  A massive 640.000 tonnes of these ‘ghost fishing nets’ are left in the seas every year. This adds greatly to the pollution, but also damages coral reefs and traps vast numbers of sea creatures.We started Gyre to protect a place that is dear to us: the Ocean. Three years ago the raising concern about ocean plastic triggered us to do something. The project started in a cafe in the Dutch coastal city of The Hague. What to do and how? Our combined interest in watches made our contribution an easy choice; a watch made out of recycled ocean plastic.But where to start? Working in the media and writing about watches we knew the watch industry like the back of our hand. Making a good watch - without losing sight of sustainability and innovation - proved to be a hefty challenge. We persevered and almost three years and countless challenging moments later we are ready to make a change and hope you will join us as ambassadors for a clean ocean. We're extremely proud to present to you the Gyre SeaCleaner. A watch that started as a wild idea. A worthwhile contribution for good and of course - great to wear. In addition to using the recycled plastic and making a great watch out of it, another important pillar is raising awareness. We will aim to do this through supporting events and programs that will battle the problem at its core.  An example will be that 5% of our turnover will go towards The Ocean Cleanup*. We aim to contribute to their mission in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch and their work in our rivers. A sustainable and eco-friendly product does not have to lose out on style and comfort. Together with our French designer Serge Cosenza, our goal was to make the watch sustainable and stylish. Our assembly will take place in The Netherlands, by highly experienced watchmakers with years of experience.With Indiegogo InDemand we offer the original SeaCleaner watch with green color accents on either an all black or black with green stripe recycled NATO-strap. And also the blue SeaCleaner on either an all black or black with blue stripe recycled NATO-strap. The strap is completely made out of recycled PET bottles.To keep it ‘green’, Gyre sticks with a 42mm black case. As this is the original color of the recycled material and the only possible way to make everything as sustainable as possible. We want to be 100% transparent and do not want to make anything better than it seems.The case - Local fishermen collect the ghost nets from the sea and deliver it to our recycler. For this they receive a fee, so we also contribute to the local economy. The nets are then cleaned and made into pellets. Those pellets are used in a mold for the 42mm case with a height of only 11.5mm (including the glass). With a 316L stainless steel case back for comfortable wear and protection.The strap - We are currently working on the last steps to produce a strap made out of fishing nets. The same material as the case. The strap is currently being made entirely out of recycled plastic bottles. Non-toxic dyes are used.The movement - A high quality Japanese solar movement, so you won’t have to worry about wasting batteries or getting it serviced. Make sure the dial gets three hours of sun and you are good for six months of power without recharging. Water Resistance - The watch is water resistant up to 100 meters or 10 bar. So you can wear it in water, free of care.The Glass - A high quality anti-reflective scratch-proof sapphire crystal.Luminous Material - For the hands and the 12, 3, 6 and 9 indices we use high-quality Super-LumiNova. So you can tell the time under any light condition.Design - Our designer Serge Cosenza designed a streamlined and elegant case. One with a style that harkens back to the heyday of French explorer and marine biologist Jacques Cousteau and the dive watches of the Seventies. Packaging - It doesn’t end with the watch. Our packaging is entirely made out of recycled material and is FSC-certified. Our name ‘Gyre’ comes from the five major gyres, which are large systems of rotating ocean currents. The oceans churn up various types of currents. Together, these larger and more permanent currents make up the systems of currents known as gyres. There are five major gyres: the North and South Pacific subtropical gyres, the North and South Atlantic subtropical gyres, and the Indian Ocean subtropical gyre. Nowadays the term gyre is used to refer to the collections of plastic waste and other debris found in high concentrations in certain parts of these gyres. We are here to stay. So if you want to buy the successor to the SeaCleaner and you can't find a good home for your former Gyre watch, we are working on a solution to 'recycle the recycled'.To make sure each Gyre watch will be recycled properly and doesn’t end up as waste. Our goal is to offer you the chance to send us your old watch (if registered beforehand) and we’ll make sure every piece will be used in one of our future products. As a ‘thank you’ we’ll give you a discount on your next watch and an honorable mention on our website. Picking a colorBut first things first. With Indiegogo InDemand we offer the original SeaCleaner watch with green color accents on either an all black or black with green stripe recycled NATO-strap. The strap is completely made out of recycled PET bottles. We now also offer the blue version on either a black or black with blue stripe NATO-strap. Risks and challengesWe’ve chosen our suppliers for their trustworthy delivery worldwide.

<h4>Capturing the Flexible Thin Film Advantage</h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced cost with roll-2-roll, high volume manufacturing process.</li>
<li>Durable - no glass to shatter. Better hail impact resistance.</li>
<li>Lightweight - No structural roof reinforcement required.</li>
<li>Easily integrated with roofing material. PV array removal is not required when re-roofing.</li>
<li>Superior performance in high heat, rooftop conditions.</li>
<li>Superior performance in low light conditions.</li>
<li>Can be installed on multiple slopes facing multiple directions. This will open up more roof space for energy production.</li>
<li>Low Embodied Energy Cost. Quicker payback, less upfront expense.</li>
<li>Superior Full Spectrum Performance.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p> <b>Superior Full Spectrum Performance in High Heat and in Low Light Conditions.</b></p>
<p>Flexible Thin Film Laminate modules have up to 20% better performance on a hot roof environment and up to 12% better performance in Low and Diffuse Light conditions when compared to equally rated Crystalline Silicone Panels. Bird droppings, leaves, water puddling and dirt can shade parts of a PV panel.<b> Shading just 3% of a Crystalline Silicone Panel can reduce output by more than 50 %. With Flexible Thin Film Panels that same 3 % shading, reduces output by only 3 % due to their built-in Bypass Diodes.</b></p>
<h4>Crystalline Silicone Rooftop PV Modules</h4>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Glass modules can break and are heavy.</li>
<li>High Cost per square foot.</li>
<li>Racks and roof flashing's are expensive, heavy and prone to roof leaks.</li>
<li>Electrical cable and conduit are exposed.</li>
<li>Modules detract from building appearance.</li>
<li>Due to excessive weight of modules and racks, engineering reports are required and structural support improvements to the roof may be necessary.</li>
<li>Your asphalt roof will wear out before your PV modules do. Has PV array removal and replacement cost been factored into current cost.</li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Have your String Inverter replacement cost been factored in. They will need to be replaced every 10 - 15 years.</span></li>

<br/><h3>The Next Major Breakthrough in PhotoVoltaic Power is that of the MICRO-INVERTER</h3>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/33241/files/20130825172227-images_21.jpg?1377476547"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<i>Micro-Inverters are great for Affordability and Efficiency</i><p></p>
<p>Inverters are an essential piece of a solar power system. An inverter takes the power that comes from the panels, which is direct current ( DC ) and changes it to alternating current ( AC ). AC is what we have in the outlets in our homes and at work. String inverters are large, expensive and inefficient. Just a little shading of just one part, of just one module can severely compromise the performance of the whole array system. They generate large amounts of heat and have a short life span as evidenced by typical warranty period of just 5 years. They also require high-voltage DC wiring which is dangerous when damaged or installed improperly. Micro-Inverters use low voltage AC wiring and significantly reduce the risk of fire or injury. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe border=""0"" height=""326"" src=""https://media.embed.ly/1/frame?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DoWvM1PP5Lt8&amp;width=580&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;height=326&amp;secure=true"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Micro-Inverters have changed everything. </span></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Instead of modules being wired together to create high voltage DC that is sent to an inverter near your main service panel, now each PV Module can be equipped with it's own micro-inverter. The power is converted to 240 volts AC right at the module. This makes the system more efficient and the solar system design more flexible.</p>
<p>With micro-inverters, modules of different ratings can be tied together and they can now be installed on different slopes of different irradiance levels with out having to buy another expensive string inverter. Micro-Inverters also eliminate module mismatch losses and improve system uptime. If one micro-inverter fails you lose the performance of only one module, not the entire string performance. </p>
<p>The AC wiring from the micro-inverters can be connected in parallel for up to 15 units. They plug into each other like extension cords, they are then fed into the buildings main load center where it back-feeds a 30 amp breaker. A micro-inverter system is real simple to install, it's pretty much <b>"" Plug &amp; Play "".</b> MIcro-inverters also eliminate the need for other balance-of-system components and lengthy installation times by a DC Certified Electrician. Again, saving money.</p>

<i><b>You can't EXPECT, from what you can't INSPECT.</b></i><p></p>
<p>With this new technology, each micro-inverter can report it's performance to a Communications Gateway via the AC wiring and your internet router. The gateway then sends the data to the website to track the performance of each panel / micro-inverter pair. You are able to view this performance data from any where, on any PC, Tablet or Smartphone. Long gone are the days of <b>"" false performance promises "".</b></p>

<h3>CROWD FUNDING</h3>
<p>We are seeking your help to buy the necessary equipment to set up a light manufacturing facility to assemble the Affordable Power Panel. Our major expense will be for the roll forming machine. This machine is similar to a steel siding roll forming machine, only it will bend a heavier gauge metal to the shape shown in the CAD drawing below.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/34537/files/20130826081942-images_61.jpg?1377530382"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><i>Our machine will look like this. Approximate dimensions are W. 33.5"" X H. 45"" X L. 138"". To be manufactured by Eastside Machine Co. Inc. of Fargo, ND.</i></p>
<p>This panel is unique. Drawn to our patent pending design and specifications. The design and fabrication of most all the components of this machine are unique to this machine, most everything begins from scratch. We have specified to the manufacturer that the rollers of this machine be adjustable so the panel width can be adjusted to conform to the various width's that the Thin Film Module suppliers provide to us ( 15.5"" - 20.5"" ).</p>
<p></p>

<i>CAD representation of our patent pending panel.</i><p></p>
<p>Panel lengths are field adjusted with a multi-profile guillotine, cut-on-the-fly system, to accommodate the lengths of multiple wattage modules to be available. This machine has the capacity to produce six ( 6 ), ten foot panels per minute. </p>
<p>Since shade tolerance of flexible thin film modules are not as dependent on the use of micro-inverters ( due to their built in by-pass diodes ), we will specify to our micro-inverter suppliers to build units that connect 2 &amp; 3 panels together. This will further reduce system cost.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $ 193,000.00. With this funding we will be able to:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Acquire costume roll forming machinery and necessary support equipment.</li>
<li>Acquire initial inventory of flexible thin film modules made to our specifications to maximize Power Density.</li>
<li>Acquire initial inventory of micro-inverters.</li>
<li>Initial order of 140,000 lbs. of .032 mil aluminum coil stock. Initially only aluminum will be available &amp; in brown only.</li>
<li>Build a working 4-5 kW. prototype system, for instructional photographs and instructional videos.</li>
<li>Further develop marketing and distribution strategies.</li>
</ul>This all requires minimum orders and up front cash commitments to our suppliers.<p></p>
<h3>STRETCH GOAL</h3>
<p>Initially production will be in St. Louis, Mo. STL being centrally located with access to rail, river barge, trucking, and air freight, forms of transportation, I believe is an ideal location. We have patent pending ( patent information available upon request ) status on a unique product with in an industry that experienced $ 19 BILLION in sales last year alone. The more money we have available to invest in good people, good policy and the skills to communicate that policy, the faster we become successful.</p>
<h3>RISK and CHALLENGES</h3>
<p>The Affordable Power Panel is a Mounting Platform for equipment that has already been developed, manufactured and guaranteed by others.

The Affordable Power Panel.
This innovative mounting system reduces PV Solar Panel installation cost by 75%. 

It is lightweight, more safe, easy to install, guaranteed not to leak and gives a quicker Return on Investment ( ROI ).

       
Do-it-Yourself? ( For Some people ) 
 Plug & Play? ( Almost )
This is an innovative Mounting System to attach Flexible Thin Film Laminate PV Solar Modules to asphalt shingle roofs, as found on 85% of Americas homes and businesses.
The Affordable Power Panel is an easy to install, durable, lightweight, less expensive, leak free way to install photovoltaic power to your asphalt shingle roof in Affordable Increments. 
Flexible thin film "" Peal & Stick "" PhotoVoltaic Modules as invented and developed Stanford Ovshinsky in the 1970's have recently made significant gains in overall efficiency making it now watt for watt competitive with crystalline silicone solar modules. 


Two things had to happen in order to make Flexible Thin Film PV Modules feasible for application to residential and commercial asphalt shingle roofs.
FIRST:  Efficiency levels had to reach parity with polycrystalline silicone modules. Residential roof space facing the correct direction is important and limited. The watt density / sq. foot for flexible thin film modules had to catch up to that of the silicone modules currently in use.   THEY RECENTLY HAVE!
SECOND:  A way had to be developed to mount the laminate backing of a flexible thin film module to the rough, irregular, granulated surface of an asphalt shingle roof.         WE JUST DID! 



Crystalline Silicone PV Modules have glass surfaces, are framed in metal, & attached to metal racks. All adding to the array weight, making structural engineering reports and sometimes structural improvements necessary.



Flexible Thin Film Laminated PV Modules are durable ( no glass to break ), have superior hail impact resistance, are light weight, & easily applied to flat, smooth surfaces.




Installing Flexible Thin Film Laminated PV Modules to the flat, smooth surfaced portion of this Standing Seam Metal Roof.



Flexible Thin Film Laminated PV Module being applied to the flat, smooth surfaced, TPO Single Ply Roofing Material. 



Due to FM I-90 Requirements, installing a Flexible Thin Film Laminated PV Module to the irregular, granulated surface of this asphalt shingle roof, is not permissible.

1. MATCHING EFFICIENCY  LEVELS: The table below indicates that the efficiency level of CIGS Flexible Thin Film PV Solar Modules have finally caught up to that of polycrystalline Silicone PV Modules.  source: Photovoltaic Systems, James Dunlop, third edition.


2. NEW RACKING / INSTALLATION OPTIONS: Most people would be surprised to learn that at least 25% of the equipment cost and 75% of the labor cost of rooftop installed solar kits go's into the racking system that hold the solar panels to the the roof. This technology hasn't changed much in 50 years. This process of mounting bolts through the roof surface, rails to hold the panels and wiring plus grounding systems are time consuming, (600 volt DC) dangerous and expensive.




 These are two demonstration / sample panels. Actual panels to be from 7.5 - 20 feet long.

THE PANEL: 24 gauge, KYNAR Coated Steel Coil (.957 lbs. / sq. foot ) similar to whats used on high end standing seam metal roof systems. As an option for more weight sensitive applications, a .032 mil Aluminum Coil stock (.432 lbs. / sq. foot ) is available, also factory coated with KYNAR. The total panel weight is less than 1 lb. / sq. ft. ( + / - 5% ) when using aluminum. That's less than half the weight of a second asphalt roof layer and two layers of asphalt roofing are allowed by every municipal building code in the country. Therefore no structural engineering report or structural improvements will be needed to install this system. Reducing soft cost even more.
Our patent pending design applies specifically to the mounting system, however The Affordable Power Panel combines all the technologies referenced below into one, easy to install, inexpensive, lightweight, horizontally interlocking, expandable roof solar system that most anyone can install. Then call an electrician to wire it up if you need too. It's now possible to start with a single panel, at an affordable price and easily grow into the system you eventually want. Let the first panel buy the second panel and so on.

Each panel has an identical profile:
First Picture:  Shows two separate panels. First the starter strip shown at the lower left is mechanically attached the the roof rafter through the roof and roof decking. The lower edge of the bottom panel locks into the starter strip securing it to the roof. The starter strip and the deck screws are now out-of-sight and water tight. The fastener slot at the top of the panel is now secured to the rafter, through the roof.
Second Picture:  Shows the second panel locked into the first now covering the screws of the first panel making them watertight. The second panel is then fastened to the roof. The installation continues in this manner to the last panel. All screws are covered and watertight. 
Third Picture:  The screws of the last panel are covered with the head flashing that clips to the top lock. The head flashing is flashed to the roof using standard roofing practices as shown in the installation manual. The microinverters and electrical lines on the left are shielded with a raceway cover. There are no exposed fasteners, This system will not leak! 
Capturing the Flexible Thin Film Advantage


Reduced cost with roll-2-roll, high volume manufacturing process.
Durable - no glass to shatter. Better hail impact resistance.
Lightweight - No structural roof reinforcement required.
Easily integrated with roofing material. PV array removal is not required when re-roofing.
Superior performance in high heat, rooftop conditions.
Superior performance in low light conditions.
Can be installed on multiple slopes facing multiple directions. This will open up more roof space for energy production.
Low Embodied Energy Cost. Quicker payback, less upfront expense.
Superior Full Spectrum Performance.


 Superior Full Spectrum Performance in High Heat and in Low Light Conditions.
Flexible Thin Film Laminate modules have up to 20% better performance on a hot roof environment and up to 12% better performance in Low and Diffuse Light conditions when compared to equally rated Crystalline Silicone Panels. Bird droppings, leaves, water puddling and dirt can shade parts of a PV panel. Shading just 3% of a Crystalline Silicone Panel can reduce output by more than 50 %. With Flexible Thin Film Panels that same 3 % shading, reduces output by only 3 % due to their built-in Bypass Diodes.
Crystalline Silicone Rooftop PV Modules


Glass modules can break and are heavy.
High Cost per square foot.
Racks and roof flashing's are expensive, heavy and prone to roof leaks.
Electrical cable and conduit are exposed.
Modules detract from building appearance.
Due to excessive weight of modules and racks, engineering reports are required and structural support improvements to the roof may be necessary.
Your asphalt roof will wear out before your PV modules do. Has PV array removal and replacement cost been factored into current cost.
Have your String Inverter replacement cost been factored in. They will need to be replaced every 10 - 15 years.

The Next Major Breakthrough in PhotoVoltaic Power is that of the MICRO-INVERTER


Micro-Inverters are great for Affordability and Efficiency
Inverters are an essential piece of a solar power system. An inverter takes the power that comes from the panels, which is direct current ( DC ) and changes it to alternating current ( AC ). AC is what we have in the outlets in our homes and at work. String inverters are large, expensive and inefficient. Just a little shading of just one part, of just one module can severely compromise the performance of the whole array system. They generate large amounts of heat and have a short life span as evidenced by typical warranty period of just 5 years. They also require high-voltage DC wiring which is dangerous when damaged or installed improperly. Micro-Inverters use low voltage AC wiring and significantly reduce the risk of fire or injury. 


Micro-Inverters have changed everything. 

Instead of modules being wired together to create high voltage DC that is sent to an inverter near your main service panel, now each PV Module can be equipped with it's own micro-inverter. The power is converted to 240 volts AC right at the module. This makes the system more efficient and the solar system design more flexible.
With micro-inverters, modules of different ratings can be tied together and they can now be installed on different slopes of different irradiance levels with out having to buy another expensive string inverter. Micro-Inverters also eliminate module mismatch losses and improve system uptime. If one micro-inverter fails you lose the performance of only one module, not the entire string performance. 
The AC wiring from the micro-inverters can be connected in parallel for up to 15 units. They plug into each other like extension cords, they are then fed into the buildings main load center where it back-feeds a 30 amp breaker. A micro-inverter system is real simple to install, it's pretty much "" Plug & Play "". MIcro-inverters also eliminate the need for other balance-of-system components and lengthy installation times by a DC Certified Electrician. Again, saving money.


You can't EXPECT, from what you can't INSPECT.
With this new technology, each micro-inverter can report it's performance to a Communications Gateway via the AC wiring and your internet router. The gateway then sends the data to the website to track the performance of each panel / micro-inverter pair. You are able to view this performance data from any where, on any PC, Tablet or Smartphone. Long gone are the days of "" false performance promises "".
YOU / WE Can: 


Verify system health and performance at a glance.
View energy production by month, day or hour.
Analyze Performance against historical weather data.
Share System Performance with friends on Facebook, Twitter...
Compare the performance of your CIGS - Flexible Thin Film PV Module Array System to that of their antiquated crystalline silicone system.

<p>LTD. optics started because we are outdoor enthusiasts and wear sunglasses pretty much all the time. Having bought several pairs of sunglasses over the years we began to notice that there was a huge gap in the sunglass market. It seemed that our only choices for buying sunglasses were to either go to the local big box store and grab a pair of low quality shades for under $20, or go to the store in the mall or local skate shop and pick up a pair of higher quality ones for over a $100 to start. The other thing that began to trouble us was that several of the companies in this higher price bracket were charging up to $40 to add polarized lens! So we decided that there had to be a way to bridge this gap and produce high quality sunglasses that come standard with polarized lenses for well under $100.</p>

<h1>The models</h1>
<p><strong>The Dean</strong>, our first model, is made of the same high quality Italian acetate as those big sunglass companies that are sold in the mall. Also, this model has stainless steel hinges for extra durability and 7-layer resin polarized lenses with UV400 protection. Aside from the superior materials that these sunglasses are made of, they also look great and are made to stay on your face whether you're skating a bowl, riding your bike to school, hiking to your favorite spot, or just driving around town.</p>
<p><strong>The Woodrow</strong> is our second model and is made using only the highest quality bamboo available. Bamboo is great for making sunglasses because it is eco-friendly and sustainable considering it can grow 10 feet or more in a year and can be grown in almost any wet climate. Another cool feature about bamboo frames is that untreated bamboo floats, so if you are into water sports a pair of natural bamboo shades might be a good choice.

</div></div>","How this started
LTD. optics started because we are outdoor enthusiasts and wear sunglasses pretty much all the time. Having bought several pairs of sunglasses over the years we began to notice that there was a huge gap in the sunglass market. It seemed that our only choices for buying sunglasses were to either go to the local big box store and grab a pair of low quality shades for under $20, or go to the store in the mall or local skate shop and pick up a pair of higher quality ones for over a $100 to start. The other thing that began to trouble us was that several of the companies in this higher price bracket were charging up to $40 to add polarized lens! So we decided that there had to be a way to bridge this gap and produce high quality sunglasses that come standard with polarized lenses for well under $100.

What we've created
After several months working with designers and manufactures we've realized our dream. We have partnered up with the best manufacturers available to bring you superior quality eyewear at a great price. Now, we feel that we have a product that everyone can use at a price that smashes the competition.

The models
The Dean, our first model, is made of the same high quality Italian acetate as those big sunglass companies that are sold in the mall. Also, this model has stainless steel hinges for extra durability and 7-layer resin polarized lenses with UV400 protection. Aside from the superior materials that these sunglasses are made of, they also look great and are made to stay on your face whether you're skating a bowl, riding your bike to school, hiking to your favorite spot, or just driving around town.
The Woodrow is our second model and is made using only the highest quality bamboo available. Bamboo is great for making sunglasses because it is eco-friendly and sustainable considering it can grow 10 feet or more in a year and can be grown in almost any wet climate. Another cool feature about bamboo frames is that untreated bamboo floats, so if you are into water sports a pair of natural bamboo shades might be a good choice. These sunglasses feature stainless steel hinges and 7-layer resin polarized lenses with UV400 protection as well and have a great classic Wayfarer style.

<h2><strong>Who We Are</strong></h2>
<p>We are Belgian and we have started this small business with big ideas because we believe we can make a difference. We’re located in a small city called Mechelen, in the Flanders region. We are extremely passionate about traveling, experiencing new cultures and meeting new people.</p>
<p>Millions of people are traveling every day and we are convinced that most of them are open to meet new people and share experiences. Maybe they even want to chat about the weather conditions or the ridiculous price of a latte macchiato. Still, even though we’re all connected, we hesitate to really communicate with each other.</p>
<p>With A Perfect Stranger, we’re reaching out to you and giving nine cards to help you make that initial introduction easier. As a perfect stranger, you can use a card to pay a compliment or give a greeting to another stranger. This perfect stranger exchange will leave both of you with a warm and joyful feeling as each of you carry on your way.</p>
<p>Additionally, we’re creating a super website on which each card can be registered. This will allow you to communicate through text and pictures with everyone else who ever registered that very card. You’ll also be able to track each card that has passed through your hands. Each card it will have its own page on which a map will show you where the card has been to and where it is going to next.</p>

<h2><strong>Why Is It Important for Us?</strong></h2>
<p>What started as a fun idea got completely out of hand!</p>
<p>OUR GOAL IS TO SPREAD HAPPINESS AND MAKE THE WORLD A KINDER PLACE.</p>
<p>We want people to be nice and kind to all strangers...not only the pretty girl or the cute guy. Therefore, intentionally we will only print cards with compliments and greeting phrases that are applicable to anyone to avoid any misinterpretation.</p>
<p>Of course, we’re not oblivious about all the cruel, destructive, unethical and basically bad things that are happening on this planet, but isn’t that just another reason to be kind to <em>thy</em> stranger?</p>
<p>And maybe you’re right, not ALL strangers may be open to the idea and some of them might be genuine ***** (feel free to use any insult you prefer).</p>
<p>The good news is: you’re still reading, so you’re not one of them!</p>
<h2><strong>Supporting Good Causes</strong></h2>
<p>For every pack of cards or T-shirt we sell, we will donate EURO 1 (US$ 1,32) to a good cause. Every few months, we’ll change the cause we’re supporting.</p>
<p>We make that commitment now and <strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">we’ll stick to it for as long as we exist!</span></strong></p>

Therefore, we’re crossing all our fingers and toes, burning candles day and night and we keep on staring at a dried 4 leaf clover, hoping to reach our financial goal mentioned at the top of this page.

Among the belongings were a pair of woven leather shoes. Oskar was more than a bit disappointed to note that the shoes were several sizes too small. Viggo tried them on, reluctantly admitting that it was a perfect fit.</p><p>When summer came, Viggo was falling in love with the shoes. He used them more and more often. They were simply the most comfortable shoes he ever wore.</p><p>Time passed, and with increasing envy, Oskar saw Viggos love for his inherited shoes. He also noted how well they worked with all kinds of outfits. Big feet isn’t always a plus. To calm his feelings, Oskar decided to buy a pair for himself.</p><p>Years passed while roaming stores and the internet for the perfect woven leather shoe. Oskar was devastated to conclude he was decades too late. Meanwhile, Viggo had walked many miles in the already worn shoes. Now they were barely holding up, with no replacement to be seen.</p><p>This brings us to today. It didn’t feel right that such an iconic shoe as this, should just pass into oblivion. Besides, we could hardly be the only ones with a beating heart for this sleek woven leather shoe. So, we set out to produce it. The last year we have worked hard to source a factory that can help us make a remade version of this gentleman’s shoe.</p><p>Now, we are two brothers, united and passionate to revive the shoe of our grandad. In loving memory, we will call it Einar after our grandfather. The shoe is ready for production.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533375099/blsjhe8i49ua36fsggy4.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Why we LOVE it</strong></p><p>Ever since we got our grandpa’s old pair, we’ve been astonished at how easy the shoe is to combine with different outfits. Never too casual and never too elegant. And it’s super comfortable.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533375127/niyei6d2yzzenp9hwrjv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>The SHOE</strong></p><p>Einar is a luxury product made in Europe. It's a handcrafted leather derby with a soft, woven leather upper. It features a thin and very flexible leather sole. The upper and outer sole are stitched together using a special method for maximum comfort and durability.</p><p>Most shoes with similar features cost more than 4500 SEK (500 USD) in stores. Our goal is to match the price of a luxury sneaker, and we aim for a retail price of 3600 SEK (400 USD), without compromising the quality. However, during our crowdfunding period, we will offer you a far superior price, which we’ll never be able to match again.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533375166/aqeuiyzr4de1s1iemg5o.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Why leather in the summer?</strong></p><p>Leather keeps your feet dryer. By using woven leather, there is more surface for the moisture to evaporate. Kind of like a heat sink. Moist leather wears more easily. Woven leather increases the strength of the material while still being really soft. A full leather shoe doesn’t get as smelly as a sneaker full of textiles. </p><p><strong>Production</strong></p><p>We have chosen an excellent Portuguese factory, capable of delivering handwoven leather, to produce our shoe. Using the best Italian leather, we believe this is an outstanding combination of skilled craftsmanship and fine materials.</p><p><strong>What sets us apart?</strong></p><p>There are many woven leather shoes out there. What sets us apart is STYLE, QUALITY, and COMFORT. We’ve been searching for a shoe like ours for years, that's why we decided to produce it ourselves. We never found a shoe that really looks the way we want it to. What we’ve seen is that many woven shoes of high quality, are actually hard as wood. Their uppers are even more rigid than a non-woven shoe, and the soles are really stiff. Our shoe has a super soft upper and a flexible sole. They are comfortable from day one. Other woven shoes are falling apart after just a few days of wearing. Our shoe is handcrafted from high-quality leather, and the stitched sole makes sure it holds together. There are of course beautiful exceptions, but they often cost twice as much.</p><p><strong>Size information</strong></p><p>We are using European sizes for our shoes. Please note that all sizes below are men's sizes, but everyone can wear our shoes. If you are unsure, please, measure your foot from heel to toe. The soft construction adapts really well to your foot as long as you select the right length.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533390303/mxyogfa6jn4e2fu4wyga.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Delivery</strong></p><p>For our Indiegogo backers, we'll  start shipping the shoes in November 2018.</p><p>For backers in the US: FREE SHIPPING applies to all preorders. No US import duty or fees on orders below 800 USD.</p><p>For backers in EU: FREE SHIPPING applies to all preorders. VAT is included in your pledge.</p><p>For INTERNATIONAL backers: Shipping is 15€, duties and local taxes will be charged by the appropriate authority at the destination country and are paid by the recipient.</p><p>Due to our limited margins, we will have to charge exchange shipping both ways for any exchanges that need to be made. This applies to all backers, US, Sweden, EU and international.</p><p><strong>New to crowdfunding?</strong></p><p>Here's a short introduction; Crowdfunding makes it possible for people and businesses to finance new products or projects by letting everyone who wants to, contribute financially and get a reward in return.</p><p>Since we're in a pre-market stage, we don't need to consider the markups required by retailers.

Among the belongings were a pair of woven leather shoes. Oskar was more than a bit disappointed to note that the shoes were several sizes too small. Viggo tried them on, reluctantly admitting that it was a perfect fit.When summer came, Viggo was falling in love with the shoes. He used them more and more often. They were simply the most comfortable shoes he ever wore.Time passed, and with increasing envy, Oskar saw Viggos love for his inherited shoes. He also noted how well they worked with all kinds of outfits. Big feet isn’t always a plus. To calm his feelings, Oskar decided to buy a pair for himself.Years passed while roaming stores and the internet for the perfect woven leather shoe. Oskar was devastated to conclude he was decades too late. Meanwhile, Viggo had walked many miles in the already worn shoes. Now they were barely holding up, with no replacement to be seen.This brings us to today. It didn’t feel right that such an iconic shoe as this, should just pass into oblivion. Besides, we could hardly be the only ones with a beating heart for this sleek woven leather shoe. So, we set out to produce it. The last year we have worked hard to source a factory that can help us make a remade version of this gentleman’s shoe.Now, we are two brothers, united and passionate to revive the shoe of our grandad. In loving memory, we will call it Einar after our grandfather. The shoe is ready for production.Why we LOVE itEver since we got our grandpa’s old pair, we’ve been astonished at how easy the shoe is to combine with different outfits. Never too casual and never too elegant. And it’s super comfortable.The SHOEEinar is a luxury product made in Europe. It's a handcrafted leather derby with a soft, woven leather upper. It features a thin and very flexible leather sole. The upper and outer sole are stitched together using a special method for maximum comfort and durability.Most shoes with similar features cost more than 4500 SEK (500 USD) in stores. Our goal is to match the price of a luxury sneaker, and we aim for a retail price of 3600 SEK (400 USD), without compromising the quality. However, during our crowdfunding period, we will offer you a far superior price, which we’ll never be able to match again.Why leather in the summer?Leather keeps your feet dryer. By using woven leather, there is more surface for the moisture to evaporate. Kind of like a heat sink. Moist leather wears more easily. Woven leather increases the strength of the material while still being really soft. A full leather shoe doesn’t get as smelly as a sneaker full of textiles. ProductionWe have chosen an excellent Portuguese factory, capable of delivering handwoven leather, to produce our shoe. Using the best Italian leather, we believe this is an outstanding combination of skilled craftsmanship and fine materials.What sets us apart?There are many woven leather shoes out there. What sets us apart is STYLE, QUALITY, and COMFORT. We’ve been searching for a shoe like ours for years, that's why we decided to produce it ourselves. We never found a shoe that really looks the way we want it to. What we’ve seen is that many woven shoes of high quality, are actually hard as wood. Their uppers are even more rigid than a non-woven shoe, and the soles are really stiff. Our shoe has a super soft upper and a flexible sole. They are comfortable from day one. Other woven shoes are falling apart after just a few days of wearing. Our shoe is handcrafted from high-quality leather, and the stitched sole makes sure it holds together. There are of course beautiful exceptions, but they often cost twice as much.Size informationWe are using European sizes for our shoes. Please note that all sizes below are men's sizes, but everyone can wear our shoes. If you are unsure, please, measure your foot from heel to toe. The soft construction adapts really well to your foot as long as you select the right length.DeliveryFor our Indiegogo backers, we'll  start shipping the shoes in November 2018.For backers in the US: FREE SHIPPING applies to all preorders. No US import duty or fees on orders below 800 USD.For backers in EU: FREE SHIPPING applies to all preorders. VAT is included in your pledge.For INTERNATIONAL backers: Shipping is 15€, duties and local taxes will be charged by the appropriate authority at the destination country and are paid by the recipient.Due to our limited margins, we will have to charge exchange shipping both ways for any exchanges that need to be made. This applies to all backers, US, Sweden, EU and international.New to crowdfunding?Here's a short introduction; Crowdfunding makes it possible for people and businesses to finance new products or projects by letting everyone who wants to, contribute financially and get a reward in return.Since we're in a pre-market stage, we don't need to consider the markups required by retailers. This gives you a UNIQUE opportunity to get a pair of shoes before everyone else, at a price far below the future high street cost.Risks and challengesWe are working with advisors from different parts of the industry to make sure we have all elements in place for a smooth delivery. We have a logistic pipeline already setup. The development and coming production of our shoe are supervised by a member of Portugals most premiere shoemaking families, to ensure construction and quality meets our standards.We are confident that we will deliver a luxurious and high-quality shoe. However unlikely, there is a risk of delays due to high demand from some of the subcontractors of our factory, possibly delaying our delivery a few days.About usWe're two brothers living in Malmö, south of Sweden.

The heavyweight blended cotton fabric is reinforced with several feet of Kevlar threading, while the hood joint is further reinforced with a durable piped seam. Designed for Adventuring, Travel and Holding your expanded Everyday Carry items.The Hoodie You’ve Always Wanted.Ever Sigma 50 starts with a heavyweight, blended cotton fabric. After the fabric is hand cut, it is first sewn with ultra premium Corespun threading. This is regarded by many as the best quality threading in the world. When this step is completed, the seams are then overstitched with vertical runs of Kevlar threading. This hybrid matrix of Kevlar and Corespun creates the strongest seams ever put in a hoodie. All the hardware is premium aged brass, and feature an all weather ready, heavy-duty YKK Zipper. Why Kevlar?Kevlar is one of the most incredible materials ever created by humankind.

So she shared a video on YouTube where she was looking for warm-hearted, international professionals to join the project.</p><p>Italian, internationally well-known print designer, <strong>Silvia</strong> (30), who has designed for established brands such as Zara, Topshop and Adidas, saw the video and sent an email to Elina.

<br/>Looking for the right suppliers and couple of words about pricing                           </h3><p>The biggest surprise along the way has been how hard it has been finding the right suppliers. Unfortunately, there are many certificated companies that offer only a couple of certificated products. We wanted to find partners, especially in fabric production, who are really committed into sustainable production all the way! After spending one and a half years finding actively great quality fabrics, we found an Italian family owned company, Albini Group, who produces high quality shirt fabrics and uses green energy in their mills. Their know-how and passion is beyond expectations! That, of course, also shows in the price; we learned that most of their fabrics are over 10€ per meter - far more expensive than the fabrics coming from Asia (they cost normally 1-4 € per meter). We learned that Albini is well known for its high standards and quality. Because we only want to offer the best for you, Albini’s fabrics were our choice for the first collection. Even though they are specialised in shirt fabrics, we were fortunate to find a beautiful, cotton-Tencel fabric for our shirt dress too.            </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1473410832/oslotxdtktytlgnktydq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We talked a lot about printing.

iluut’s first collectioniluut’s first collection is inspired by a soft and minimal approach to the brand’s Scandinavian roots. It embraces classical and timeless pieces with a playful twist to its prints and detailing to give it a fresh and modern approach. The pieces are very relaxed with a modern silhouette that fits well to various body types. They are great pieces to have time and time again from summer to transitional weather because of its breathable and sustainable fabrics.The collection contains a relaxed lightweight denim shirt dress and a modern shirt in three colours (one white, two printed) and three sizes (S, M, L). Nathalie wears the Cotton-Tencel shirt dress​ Nathalie wears the Linen-cotton dotted shirt​ Nathalie wears the Linen-cotton square shirt​ Nathalie wears the Linen-cotton white shirt​  Cotton-Tencel shirt dress  Linen-cotton white shirt  Linen-cotton square shirt  Linen-cotton dotted shirt​  IllustrationsWe cherish the beautiful design work and now you have a special chance to buy our sketches! Lovely interior elements to decorate your home or as a gift. Our storyiluut was born from our Finnish founder, Elina (29), and her dream about a more sustainable fashion industry. She felt that our generation needed new fashion standards: beautiful and affordable clothes should be possible to make without compromising the working conditions and our environment. Pretty ambitious dream, isn’t it? Elina wanted to challenge herself and make it happen. So she shared a video on YouTube where she was looking for warm-hearted, international professionals to join the project.Italian, internationally well-known print designer, Silvia (30), who has designed for established brands such as Zara, Topshop and Adidas, saw the video and sent an email to Elina. The young women started Skyping and noticed they shared the same vision about ethically and environmentally sustainable produced garments, designed for the modern woman.The pieces fell into place when they found a fashion designer, Vj (25), living in London, who shared the same thoughts about sustainability and a value-led fashion industry. Vj has worked for both luxury and premium brands such as Simone Rocha and Self-Portrait Studio and currently designing dresses for Marks&Spencer.Every now and then we meet face to face to have inspiring workshops or visit our partners, but our daily work is mostly done online using different innovative tools.

<p><u><i>Will my laptop fit?</i></u></p>
<p>The Bobby Bizz has a special pocket to keep your Laptop safe and secure during your travels. This pocket is big enough for all laptops with the size 15,6”, however some 17” models can also fit.</p>
<p>Below are the dimensions of the laptop compartment, please check these with the dimensions of your own laptop to see if your model will fit:</p>
<p>36 cm (H) x 29 cm (L) x 3 cm (D)</p>

<p><u><i>Is the Backpack 100% waterproof?</i></u></p>
<p>The backpack is water repellent, but not waterproof.</p>
<p>This means that in normal rain conditions, you should be safe and all your belongings will stay dry. However the bag is not intended to protect your belongings when thrown in a pool :) or to be in a full rain pour for about an hour.</p>
<p>We have a separate rain cover available on this page that you can pledge for. Simply select the pledge with the rain cover or add 5 euro (per rain cover) to your pledge to add.</p>
<p>The standard version does not come with the extra rain cover.</p>
<p><u><i>What are the specs of the security cable?</i></u></p>
<p>Length: 44 cm<br/>Thickness: 2mm</p>
<p><i><u>What weight can the bag hold?</u></i></p>
<p>20 kg</p>
<p>*This is the limit we tested. It might still hold weight up to 30kg, but this is not tested by us as we do not think the bag will be filled with belongings over 20 kg.</p>
<p><u><i>Is the Backpack washing machine proof?</i></u></p>
<p>The backpack is not washing machine proof. However, since the whole backpack is made from water repellent material, the backpack is already better protected against dirt and stains attaching to the fabric.<br/>Furthermore, it is easily washable with a wet cloth or wipe.</p>
<p><u><i>Will there be other colors?</i></u></p>
<p>Not at this moment, we feel that the black really suits the Bobby Bizz. Also adding extra colors will put a strain on our production process, which could cause delays.</p>
<p><i><u>What payment methods do you accept?</u></i></p>
<p>For this project we can only accept payment by Credit Card, no other payments methods.<br/>If there is a problem with the payment with your CC, please contact the customer support team of Kickstarter, as they are in charge of collecting the payments.</p>
<p><u><i>Can I pay extra to get an earlier delivery?</i></u></p>
<p>This is unfortunately not possible. It is not a matter of extra costs, but a matter of making sure that we ship out all the backpacks in the most efficient way as possible.</p>
<p>We unfortunately cannot make acceptations to this process as it will delay all the other shipments.</p>
<p><u><i>Will I have to pay duties/VAT to receive my order?</i></u></p>
<p>We will do our upmost best to prevent this from happening, but any applicable duties/VAT are the sole responsibility of the backer, and not our team.</p>
<p>We have absolutely no control over the additional duties/VAT that may or may not be charged in your country. If you are unsure whether or not you will be charged duties/VAT at the time of receiving your perk, please get in touch with your local post office.</p>
<p>There is also a handy tool online available to calculate these costs. Please note that this is an external online partner, so we cannot be held accountable for differences between the actual cost and what is mentioned on this website: <a href=""http://www.dutycalculator.com/new-import-duty-and-tax-calculation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dutycalculator.com/new-import-duty-a...</a>.</p>
<p>The bags will be shipped from China, this will help you to calculate the costs.</p>
<p><u><i>What is the refund policy?</i></u></p>
<p>Due to the nature of Kickstarter as a crowdfunding platform, we cannot offer refunds to backers once the project ends.</p>
<p>Once the campaign ends, your pledges are immediately turned into a hard production order, this because we do not want to let anybody down on the delivery time. Therefore we cannot offer refunds once the campaign has ended.</p>
<p>However if you experience any quality problems, we are here to help in multiple ways! You can send us a mail at bobby@xd-design.com, chat live with our team at <a href=""http://www.xd-design.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.xd-design.com</a> or send us a private message here on Indiegogo. We will be here to help solve your problem!</p>
<p><u><i>What if something is wrong with my backpack once receiving it?</i></u></p>
<p>In the very exceptional case of this happening, we will of course offer you the best service to find a suitable solution for you.

We will be here to help solve your problem!</p>
<p><u><i>Where can I fill in my delivery address?</i></u></p>
<p>At the end of the project we will send out a survey to all our backers. In this survey we will collect all needed data such as your delivery address.<br/>We will also send out a mail to all backers right before we will send out all the packages to make sure this delivery address is still up to date.</p>
<p><u><i>Will we receive a tracking number for our shipment?</i></u></p>
<p>All backers will receive a personal tracking number with which they can trace their shipment.</p>
<p><u><i>Can I pick up my delivery?</i></u></p>
<p>This is unfortunately not possible; our entire delivery process is automated to create as much efficiency as possible. This in order to make sure that all backers will receive their package on time (or even earlier than expected). A manual pick-up will disrupt this process and is therefore not possible.</p>
<p><u><i>Will the zippers be strong enough to hold the lock?</i></u></p>
<p>The reinforced metal zippers are much stronger than regular zipper pullers. They have been created to keep your lock tight and to make sure that nobody can easily brake your zippers and take the backpack.</p>

I am <strong>Vassiliki-Zafiria Ypsilanti</strong> and for more than 15 years I have been working as a Business Architect and a Project Manager for a large public organization. In 2018, I decided to quit my job in order to follow my heart… MANTILITY!</p><p>As an art enthusiast myself and being friends with many artists and designers, I often feel disappointed by the challenges they face in gaining exposure, networking and monetization. Meanwhile, as a fashion lover I am attracted by fashion items that could reflect the hard work put into it by the artisan. I strongly believe in conscientious shopping and that means, for me, the items that are accessible and make you feel good, long after the initial decision of purchase.  </p><p>With a team of friends coming from different leads of life, we started MANTILITY with a mission (we call it “The MANTILITY movement”) in order to create an eclectic online silk scarves gallery that provides a platform of expression to artists and offers worldwide meticulously crafted scarves in accessible prices. We view our scarves as the noble messengers of silk, canvases for different artists to narrate stories and feelings. Wearing a MANTILITY scarf offers not only the unique touch of a 100% high quality silk artefact, but also brings you closer to the exclusive artistic expression of the designer providing pleasure through your senses. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565050100/uanwlegf0acuh5dguqhk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564353207/dxcnbdm7ixuaxlrc7r3h.jpg"" src=""""/></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Partnerships with artists</strong> – We have already partnered with 11 both emerging as well as established artists from all over Greece to start this campaign. These are not just artists picked up randomly, but people we respect and value their work and share our MANTILITY values with. We offer them a platform of exhibiting their art and a way to monetize it. Each designer is rewarded either on a basis of a fixed contract or on % of sales based on their own decision. By reaching our stretch goals we will be adding new artists and new designs in our eclectic online scarf gallery (please see our stretch goals).</li>
<li>
<strong>True quality</strong> – Greece has one of the longest and most important traditions in Sericulture and Silk processing in Europe. We have invested 2 years in testing different silk qualities, scarf dimensions, color differentiations, manufacturing/processing possibilities, packaging and labelling. Not only have we partnered with the leading silk goods producer in Greece (3rd generation family business) but we have also invested an important part of our (limited) budget to produce numerous scarf prototypes in all different designs in order to improve the final product to what we consider “true MANTILITY quality” (please also see FAQ for the list of high quality of raw materials used). </li>
<li>
<strong>Supply chain</strong> - Luxury brands usually markup their costs by a minimum of 400% due to middlemen and overhead expenses. Thanks to our direct-to-consumer approach, we skip the industry’s markups (wholesalers and distributors) and do our best to pass these savings to you. In addition, this helps us offer higher rewards to our partner designers in relation to industry standards. </li>
<li>
<strong>Customer experience</strong> – We have already mentioned that we believe in purchasing choices that make you feel good also on the long term. This is not only about the product but also about the whole customer journey. We will do whatever it takes for you to be completely satisfied with your whole customer experience, from communicating to shipping challenges to anything that comes up.</li>

I am Vassiliki-Zafiria Ypsilanti and for more than 15 years I have been working as a Business Architect and a Project Manager for a large public organization. In 2018, I decided to quit my job in order to follow my heart… MANTILITY!As an art enthusiast myself and being friends with many artists and designers, I often feel disappointed by the challenges they face in gaining exposure, networking and monetization. Meanwhile, as a fashion lover I am attracted by fashion items that could reflect the hard work put into it by the artisan. I strongly believe in conscientious shopping and that means, for me, the items that are accessible and make you feel good, long after the initial decision of purchase.  With a team of friends coming from different leads of life, we started MANTILITY with a mission (we call it “The MANTILITY movement”) in order to create an eclectic online silk scarves gallery that provides a platform of expression to artists and offers worldwide meticulously crafted scarves in accessible prices. We view our scarves as the noble messengers of silk, canvases for different artists to narrate stories and feelings. Wearing a MANTILITY scarf offers not only the unique touch of a 100% high quality silk artefact, but also brings you closer to the exclusive artistic expression of the designer providing pleasure through your senses.   

Partnerships with artists – We have already partnered with 11 both emerging as well as established artists from all over Greece to start this campaign. These are not just artists picked up randomly, but people we respect and value their work and share our MANTILITY values with. We offer them a platform of exhibiting their art and a way to monetize it. Each designer is rewarded either on a basis of a fixed contract or on % of sales based on their own decision. By reaching our stretch goals we will be adding new artists and new designs in our eclectic online scarf gallery (please see our stretch goals).

True quality – Greece has one of the longest and most important traditions in Sericulture and Silk processing in Europe. We have invested 2 years in testing different silk qualities, scarf dimensions, color differentiations, manufacturing/processing possibilities, packaging and labelling. Not only have we partnered with the leading silk goods producer in Greece (3rd generation family business) but we have also invested an important part of our (limited) budget to produce numerous scarf prototypes in all different designs in order to improve the final product to what we consider “true MANTILITY quality” (please also see FAQ for the list of high quality of raw materials used). 

Supply chain - Luxury brands usually markup their costs by a minimum of 400% due to middlemen and overhead expenses. Thanks to our direct-to-consumer approach, we skip the industry’s markups (wholesalers and distributors) and do our best to pass these savings to you. In addition, this helps us offer higher rewards to our partner designers in relation to industry standards. 

Customer experience – We have already mentioned that we believe in purchasing choices that make you feel good also on the long term. This is not only about the product but also about the whole customer journey. We will do whatever it takes for you to be completely satisfied with your whole customer experience, from communicating to shipping challenges to anything that comes up.
 Every MANTILITY Scarf, after being twill-woven, printed, cut, washed and ironed, is machine and hand sewed in the traditional way.​Please browse our MANTILITY GALLERY below, choose the design you like, support your favourite designer and become a MANTILITY Collector. Become a MANTILITY Dreamer! For our Indiegogo supporters we have designed exclusive rewards packs; MANTILITY scarves with 20% - 40% discount before they are officially launched on the market. In addition, we offer unique MANTILITY perks related to experience like the illustration of your favorite lyrics on a single silk scarf!    In MANTILITY we strongly believe that crowdfunding is a fair and democratic way of funding new ideas.  So, we kindly ask your support. We pledge for $19000 in order to start MANTILITY. These funds (besides bringing you value added products), will help us lower our cost production and enhance our capability for new designs and new product dimensions. As a result, this lower cost structure, will further improve our ability to reward and bring more artists into our movement. If we are lucky enough to see our goal being overtaken by your support, we also have a bigger plan of enhancing our multidimensional & multicultural artistic collectivity by bringing more artists and more designs into our MANTILITY movement. Our stretch goals include a social project for empowering refugees through design co-creation and also a collective design project using the “Exquisite Corpse”, the Surrealist Drawing Game. 
  For us, this campaign is the first step for recreating “a new artistic worldwide silk road”. That will mean extending our MANTILITY movement and collaborating with artists all over the world offering a platform for expression, exposure and monetization to them and accessible luxury fashion items to our customers.  We aspire and try to:
create social value through an extroverted collective
become a medium of the accessible luxury movement
place design as an essential element of both products and processes
approach aesthetics as a way of life
be open, fair, honest, and authentic
have a good time

<p></p>
<p>5 years ago, as the result of an urban exploring trip, our first fire hose wallet was born. It was rough around the edges, but very unique. In the years thereafter we started making more and more of them as they make great and highly original gifts. The result is that today quite a number of our friends and family carry a unique wallet in their pockets and purses. Over the years we received loads of feedback and we were able to refine our design and production techniques to a point where we can proudly say we can bring you a well-designed and high quality product.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/903553/files/20141004083818-Yellowbanner.png?1412437098"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""/><br/></p>
<br/><h2>About our wallets</h2> <p></p>
<p>To make this wallet we re-purposed <b>two materials</b>: The heavy duty <b>fire hose</b> every local fire
department uses is a great material for a wallet: it features smooth and
clean rubber on the inside, and a highly durable polyester jacket featuring a
unique looking pattern and a great feel on the outside. Additionally we use old <b>bicycle inner tubes</b> to
construct the card pockets. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/954335/files/20141023122438-Rubber-Interior.png?1414092278"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>

Because of the extreme toughness of the
material, the wallet can only be <b>sewn by hand.</b> This is time consuming but also
guarantees an excellent <b>quality</b> as every wallet passes through our hands.<br/><br/><p>The design is kept as simple as possible. We believe this approach gives the most <b>elegant</b> result for a <b>rough material</b> like this. In this way the material gets the full opportunity to speak for itself. To achieve this we kept the wallet surface clean and smooth: there is no label, and there are only two visible seams. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/908465/files/20141006110642-bLUEbanner.png?1412618802"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>To improve comfort
and portability we eliminated the classic change pouch; after all, every guy
knows that change in the back pocket is a pain in the ass, literally.</p>
<p> Furthermore, it features<b> two pocket</b><b>s</b> which can each hold <b>multiple cards</b> and
a large <b>inside compartment </b>for<b> money</b> and documents. The card pockets and the whole inside of the wallet are made out of rubber, ensuring a clean and protective environment for everything inside.<br/></p>
<p>Fire hose is extremely <b>tough</b>, that means our wallets have a <b>spirit</b>: they leave our workshop with a well defined fold in the middle, but a fresh wallet won't completely close when left on it's own. It needs to be <b>domesticated </b>by the owner by using it and carrying it in a pocket for a while. This does not mean the wallet can not be used from the very start, it simply means that when you take it out initially it will somewhat unfold by itself.<br/></p>
<h4>Colors<br/>
</h4>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/906133/files/20141005141723-Colors2.png?1412543843"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>Every wallet is available in a <b>range of colors</b>, from the classic fire-hose red to a
bright and vivid blue. On top of that each wallet will start to show a <b>unique</b>
color <b>pattern</b> over time, as any signs of wear during the previous life as a
fire hose, will result in a different pattern. </p>

<p>We now offer a Limited Antwerp Edition! These wallets are made from <b>originally red colored</b> firehose directly from the Antwerp Fire Department.

</div></div>","Hello! Thank you for checking out our product. 
We are Simon and Jakob, two young aspiring entrepreneurs. What you should know about us is that we are passionate about reusing and upcycling practically anything that the world today see as waste. We find that discarded industrial materials are particularly interesting to re-purpose: they yield very  creative and unique results an more often than not the original material properties add to the functionality of the final product. 



5 years ago, as the result of an urban exploring trip, our first fire hose wallet was born. It was rough around the edges, but very unique. In the years thereafter we started making more and more of them as they make great and highly original gifts. The result is that today quite a number of our friends and family carry a unique wallet in their pockets and purses. Over the years we received loads of feedback and we were able to refine our design and production techniques to a point where we can proudly say we can bring you a well-designed and high quality product.


About our wallets 
To make this wallet we re-purposed two materials: The heavy duty fire hose every local fire
department uses is a great material for a wallet: it features smooth and
clean rubber on the inside, and a highly durable polyester jacket featuring a
unique looking pattern and a great feel on the outside. Additionally we use old bicycle inner tubes to
construct the card pockets. 





Because of the extreme toughness of the
material, the wallet can only be sewn by hand. This is time consuming but also
guarantees an excellent quality as every wallet passes through our hands.The design is kept as simple as possible. We believe this approach gives the most elegant result for a rough material like this. In this way the material gets the full opportunity to speak for itself. To achieve this we kept the wallet surface clean and smooth: there is no label, and there are only two visible seams. 


To improve comfort
and portability we eliminated the classic change pouch; after all, every guy
knows that change in the back pocket is a pain in the ass, literally.
 Furthermore, it features two pockets which can each hold multiple cards and
a large inside compartment for money and documents. The card pockets and the whole inside of the wallet are made out of rubber, ensuring a clean and protective environment for everything inside.
Fire hose is extremely tough, that means our wallets have a spirit: they leave our workshop with a well defined fold in the middle, but a fresh wallet won't completely close when left on it's own. It needs to be domesticated by the owner by using it and carrying it in a pocket for a while. This does not mean the wallet can not be used from the very start, it simply means that when you take it out initially it will somewhat unfold by itself.
Colors



Every wallet is available in a range of colors, from the classic fire-hose red to a
bright and vivid blue. On top of that each wallet will start to show a unique
color pattern over time, as any signs of wear during the previous life as a
fire hose, will result in a different pattern. 

Sizes


If you have trouble choosing, please visit the gallery section. We included some handy print-outs with the exact sizes!

Limited Antwerp Edition
We now offer a Limited Antwerp Edition! These wallets are made from originally red colored firehose directly from the Antwerp Fire Department. As these wallets aren't colored afterwards, the signs of use and wear are more clear and make this edition very unique. They also feature a black stripe thoughout the wallet. As our firehose supply for this version is very small, it is limited to only 20 pieces!

  Risks & Challenges   

Sourcing fire hose is not obvious, it is material that is made to last. We are working with several partners to achieve a steady supply chain. For now we just don't offer any more wallets than we can make with the materials we have in stock. Pick up your wallet fast, before it runs out of stock.

Every used fire hose is different, fabric textures may vary. This is nice as this creates a variety of unique pieces, but we need to ensure that every wallet closely resembles the units we have shown.

The product is entirely hand-made; this means that in order to maintain our high quality our production capability is not endless. We know what we can produce, and how fast. This is why we limit the amount of units per delivery dates. Our shipping dates are set, with a two week buffer period to make sure we don't miss them.

Take the pilots watch for example their large legible numerals (for easy reading), huge crowns (for handling with gloves), and extra long straps (to wear over thick leather jackets) were all explicitly chosen to serve the airmen that wore them. Today the flieger watch design does not offer real-life functionality but it is still great looking classic timepiece . ""Voted as The Best Kickstarter Watch Brands To Invest in "" - FashionBeans  Hi, We are Chotovelli & Figli, third generation watchmakers based out of Antwerp, Belgium focused on the design, production, and sale of military-inspired watches at attainable prices.   In Nov 2018 we launched our first kickstarter campaign of a Minimal Pilot Watch the Flieger 1919 series which showcased the classic type B (B-uhr dial) . Now we are taking on the next challenge and reproducing the classic B-Uhr Type A design.  The Navigator  Like all Flieger watches from that era our Navigator 1949 Pilot Watch is engineered and designed to showcase Functionality ,Reliability and precision.Since its initial introduction, the B-Uhr has gone on to be one of the most important watch designs in history, having a substantial impact on the war years, going on to inspire countless watches, and influencing almost every subsequent pilots’ and military design that followed it. TIPO 1  Case & Design The case has a satin sand blasted finish and the design harkens back to 1940s pocket watches which were issued to U-boat crews and Navy Pilots during the war. The surgical grade 316L stainless steel case is 43mm in diameter x 12mm in height , so a substantial watch without going over the top.   The Dial  The dials of the watches are meant for maximum readability, The Tipo 1 is using a straightforward black-and-white design. Each has an outer minute track with enlarged marks and accompanying Arabic numerals for each hour, with the exception of the 12 o’clock position, which features the B-Uhr signature triangle icon in upside down position which give the watch more minimal feel .  Indicating the time on all models are two blued-steel sword hour and minute hands, which are  luminescence. along with a simple stick seconds hand with a blue counterweight  The Crystal High Quality scratch resistance Domed mineral. The crown is mid size and easy to use for setting the time .

At that point in time, with the information we had, we 100% believed we would be ready. For each of the subsequent delays and revised forecasts for our launch dates, we believed the same. We have never intentionally provided a launch date that we didn’t believe we could hit.<br/> <br/>There are a lot of very good reasons why we haven’t yet launched. Some mistakes and missteps we’ve made have contributed to our delays, and for that we genuinely apologize. We’ve learned it’s the nature of start-up life that not everything will go smoothly, or to our preferred timetable. But we’ve also learned none of this matters one bit, that what really matters is this: when you are going to get the devices you paid for last year. The answer to that question is: September, not June, as we had forecast in our last update.<br/> <br/>Despite this additional delay, it’s important for us to stress that you should have no doubts that Halo will launch. To help reassure you that we have made significant progress, we will be sending out a link to a short YouTube video in a few weeks, in which we will show you just how close Halo is to being in your hands and on the market.

</div><h3><span>UPDATE!</span></h3><div><span><p><span>Thanks to everyone who has supported our Indiegogo campaign so far! Because of all your questions and comments (and the successful close of our $900K investment round), we have actually made huge strides to bring you the battery powered Halo device as well! Thanks to your support, our team went back to the labs and are ready to release and sell the new Halo Battery Operated Smoke Detector right now!</span></p></span></div><div>
<h4><span>How does the battery operated Halo work?</span></h4>
<p>The battery operated Halo runs on 4 AA batteries that are easy to replace without the need for tools! Our engineers focused on power conservation from the very beginning of our design, and the the battery powered Halo is able to provide the same level of sensor monitoring and intelligent processing as our hard-wired version for customers who are in need of a “battery only” option.</p>
<h4>How long do they last?</h4>
<p>Under typical conditions, the batteries should last 2 years.</p>
<h4>What features does this Halo still have?</h4>
<p>The battery operated Halo has all of the same great features aside from the Night Light feature and the Weather Alerts feature.</p>

<h2><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If you're like 90% of Americans, you're only safe from one type of fire.</span></h2>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Most people think that when they have a smoke detector, they're protected from all fires. This simply isn't true. 90% of US homes have an ionization-only smoke detector. If you're one of these people, it means that your smoke detector may not detect a smoldering fire for 15-50 minutes.</p>
<p>Think about this. In the average home, firefighters agree that many people have as little as two minutes to escape. If your smoke detector is going to take 15-50 minutes to detect a fire, then you're already too late. This is why a dual sensor smoke alarm is so vital to your safety. Both the ionization and photoelectric sensors are vital to your safety from both smoldering and flash fires.</p>
<p>The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends a dual sensor approach, because you never know what type of fire will strike.</p>
<p><b>Halo is the only smoke detector that can protect your family from everything: Flash fires, smoldering fires, carbon monoxide, and dangerous weather.</b></p>

<br/><h4>Protect Your Family from ""The Silent Killer""</h4>
<p>Carbon monoxide gases are invisible, odorless, and deadly. Have peace of mind with Halo.</p><h4>How Will Halo Warn me of Carbon Monoxide?</h4><p>When Halo notices elevated levels of gas, you'll receive an auditory and visual alert.</p><p><span></span></p><ul>
<li><p><span>First, a voice will alert you, ""Elevated CO in the living room, move to fresh air!""</span></p></li>
<li><p>Then, a pulsing orange light from the device will warn you visually of the danger.</p></li>
<li><p>The pulse of the light will speed up as the CO gas increases, and slow down as it decreases.</p></li>
<li>If it's unsafe for you to be in the room where the gas has been detected, the orange pulse will turn to an orange and white flashing light, along with an auditory alert: ""Danger, CO in the living room, move to fresh air.""</li>

<h4>Protect Your Family &amp; Save Money on Insurance with Halo</h4>
<p>Did you know most insurance companies will give you a discount if you have a connected smoke detector and/or smoke alarm? With Halo or Halo+ installed in your home, you're eligible for up to a 10% discount on your home insurance policy.</p>
<br/><div><span><h4>Why do I get this discount?</h4>
<p>Simply put, connected home smoke alarms are safer. It saves the insurance company money if you're making safer choices for your home. With a connected home smoke alarm, you get to receive alerts via your cell phone which offers a greater degree of protection, and a more intelligent alert system. You're safer, your home is safer, and the insurance company can worry less. This means they'll give you a discount.</p>
<p>Are you a homeowner, landlord or property manager? If you have Halo, your deduction for owning a safer smoke alarm will pay for your Halo smoke alarm within an average of 2 years! After that, it's money in your pocket.</p>

<h3>Halo's Smart Logic</h3>
</span></span></strong>
<h4>Is your smoke alarm risking your life?</h4>
<p>71% of structure fires deaths are caused because a smoke detector that has a missing or discharged battery. This means that the victims weren’t able to make it to safety in time. Something that was meant to save lives ends up being rendered useless because the batteries were useless.</p>
<p>We've all been there: You're fixing your morning breakfast when you accidentally burn the bacon, or the toast. A shrill, ear-splitting beep echoes through your house and everyone runs into the kitchen to see if there's cause for alarm. Or there's that annoying chirp, chirp, chirp in the middle of the night. You get out of bed and, in an effort to silence the chirp, you remove the battery or (even worse) take down your smoke alarm. Now you've taken a marginally effective early warning device and disabled it, making it completely ineffective.</p>
<p>This is where the problem starts. Pulling the batteries out of your smoke detector puts you at a huge risk of being caught in a home fire without enough time to escape.</p>
<p>Your smoke detector is so annoying that it is literally risking your life. </p>
<h4>How Halo Stops This Deadly Cycle<br/>No Chirps!</h4>
<p>Halo is equipped with the industry’s first, long lasting, lithium-ion rechargeable battery, which virtually removes that annoying nighttime chirp forever from our hardwired model. As for the battery operated version, Halo will notify you with a reminder to your cell phone, using words  rather than annoying beeps to inform you that your batteries are running low and need to be replaced.  Thank you Halo!</p>
<h4>Smart Logic's 5 Sensors</h4>
<p>False alarms are dangerous. They numb us to potentially dangerous situations and, up until now, the homeowner had to take the smoke alarm’s word for whether or not there was danger. Sadly and loudly, that alert came in the form of an annoying 85db beep.</p>
<p>Every Halo smoke alarm is equipped with 5 different sensors: photoelectric, ionization, CO, heat, and humidity. The constant intelligent monitoring of these 5 sensors helps Halo learn from its environment and helps to reduce false alarms while confirming actual dangerous concerns.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<strong><span><span><span><h4><span>How Does It Work?</span></h4>
<br/><p><b>1.The Shower Episode</b></p></span></span></span></strong>
<p>If you’re taking a shower, the steam has the ability to block out the ion and photoelectric sensors and trigger a false alarm. Since Halo is equipped with CO, heat, and humidity sensors, it can tell if there is a spike in the humidity with no increase of carbon monoxide and only a minor increase in heat.

<p>On Saturday, May 16, 2015. Halo Smart Labs teamed up with the St. Stephens Fire Department on a control burn in Catawba County, North Carolina. Several other fire departments joined in as the department set several Class I fires in an abandoned house.</p>
<p>It was the culmination of a partnership we had been working on with the department for several weeks. Fire departments often do controlled burns to teach the newer members of their teams how real fires work, as well as work on how to respond in live simulations. At Halo, we wanted to put our device in a real, controlled fire where we could monitor the data. The St. Stephens Fire Department was enthusiastic about joining forces, as the data Halo collected could be of use to the department as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432239331/dqnizrajmjuxfz5tduey.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our engineers installed Halo and a camera to monitor it in the hallway of the house. Then the department began to light fires, and set up outside, where they could safely stream and monitor data from the Halo alarm.</p>
<p>The fire department began by starting a Class I fire with no accelerators (gasoline, etc).  Then they went in and put it out before starting another one. The controlled burn began around 9 AM and lasted until after 2 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Halo only sent data back to our engineers during the first fire. Temperatures in the house reached 220 degrees Fahrenheit before Halo quit sending date when its enclosure liquefied and the hardware inside fell on the floor.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432239365/kdxd4jchcw5f7ppcqdrf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When the firefighters went in, the smoke from the fire went from two feet from the ground all the way up to the ceiling, and firefighters told Josh Cox, one of the engineers on the project, that it was so thick he were literally unable to see his hand in front of his face. When they broke open a window to let the smoke out, the firefighters noticed Halo flashing on the floor and brought what was left of the device out. Even though the enclosure melted, Halo was still functioning as an alarm and, when it cooled, resumed transmitting data to the engineers.</p>
<p>We could not be happier with the results from the controlled burn and look forward to sharing them with you! Determining how actual fires work helps us to continue improving Halo, particularly in how its monitoring system eliminates false alarm—because you only want your smoke alarm to go off when there’s truly a need for it.</p>

<br/><h3>How Halo Will Alert You During a Fire</h3>
<p>With auditory and visual warnings you're guaranteed to be aware of any danger in your home.</p>
<h4>What happens if Smoke is detected?</h4>
<p>With Halo's Smart Logic algorithms, you’ll worry less about the shrill beeping sound of a false alarm. If Halo senses a potential issue, it will start off by issuing a gentle verbal and visual warning. For example, ""Elevated smoke in the kitchen"" will be announced through all of your Halo smoke alarms, accompanied by a slowly pulsing red light at the device in the kitchen. As the smoke increases, the speed of the pulse increases, and as smoke dissipates, the pulse will slow. You can also silence your Halo by pushing the center button on the device, or by using the Halo app.  If the smoke exceeds the safe zone after you've silenced it, it will alert you by flashing red and white and saying, ""Danger smoke in the kitchen!” If muted again, Halo will be silent for 15 minutes, giving you time to rectify the situation or get out.</p>
<br/><h4>What happens if smoke is detected and I’m away from home?</h4>
<p>As soon as your Halo notices a potential threat, it will alert you via your cell phone. </p>

<h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>How many Halo Smoke Alarms do I need?</i>  </b></p>
<p>The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends installing smoke alarms in each bedroom, outside of each sleeping area and on every level of the home, including the basement. Your state or local recommendations may increase the recommended number of smoke alarms, but this is considered a minimum.</p>
<p><b><i>How many Halo WX should I have in my home? </i>  </b> </p>
<p>In order to receive the best chance of receiving a timely warning in a dangerous event, we recommend at least one Halo WX on each level of your home.<br/></p>
<p><i><b>It says ""AC Hard Wired."" What does that mean?</b>   </i></p>
<p>There are two types of power supplying smoke detectors: ""Hard Wired,"" which are powered by your home's electrical wiring (typically with a battery back-up) and ""Battery Powered,"" which are NOT connected to your home's wiring and run solely on battery power. <br/></p>
<p><i><b>How do I know if my home is wired for AC smoke alarms?  </b></i></p>
<p>Since 1989, ""hard wired"" (non-battery powered) smoke alarms with battery back-up have been required in the construction of a new home. If your home was built after 1989 or has had the electrical wiring upgraded to current NEC standards since then, you probably have hard-wired smoke alarms. You can also check this by removing your smoke alarm from its base plate the next time you perform your monthly test. If there are wires coming out of the back of the smoke alarm, it is likely hard-wired. If not, it is more likely to be a battery-powered only unit.</p>
<p><i><b>Where are Halo Smart Labs devices going to be manufactured?  </b></i></p>
<p>We are very proud to say that Halo Smart Labs products will be manufactured in the USA. Some of the components required to build our units <i>must</i> be sourced from overseas, but every other aspect of designing, developing, electronic manufacturing, injection molding, assembling, packaging and warehousing will take place here in the United States.<br/></p>
<p><i><b>Will these be difficult to install or setup?</b></i></p>
<p>We have designed the Halo products to be as easy to setup and install as possible, but some people may prefer not to be on a ladder or feel uncomfortable working with the wiring in their home. In these cases, we recommend finding a reputable contractor or handyman in your area who might be able to assist. <br/></p>
<p><i><b>What connected home platforms can/will Halo products work with? </b>  </i></p>
<p>Halo and Halo WX both use Wi-Fi and Zigbee wireless protocols, ensuring our system works with almost every connected home platform on the market. Halo Smart Labs is a proud partner of the OpenHome Labs program and is currently working to certify Halo and Halo WX to work with the iControl platform, which provides connectivity to many of the existing connected home platforms available. We have also been designated a Certified Apple Product Developer and iOS Developer to make sure the Halo products work with HomeKit later this year, and have been working with teams from various other ""retail branded"" connected home systems to become certified as quickly as possible. We have known from the beginning that hazards don't discriminate, so safety and connectivity shouldn't either. </p>
</div></div>","UPDATE!Hello, Everyone!We launched our Indiegogo campaign almost a year ago and estimated our delivery date to be November 2015. At that point in time, with the information we had, we 100% believed we would be ready. For each of the subsequent delays and revised forecasts for our launch dates, we believed the same. We have never intentionally provided a launch date that we didn’t believe we could hit. There are a lot of very good reasons why we haven’t yet launched. Some mistakes and missteps we’ve made have contributed to our delays, and for that we genuinely apologize. We’ve learned it’s the nature of start-up life that not everything will go smoothly, or to our preferred timetable. But we’ve also learned none of this matters one bit, that what really matters is this: when you are going to get the devices you paid for last year. The answer to that question is: September, not June, as we had forecast in our last update. Despite this additional delay, it’s important for us to stress that you should have no doubts that Halo will launch. To help reassure you that we have made significant progress, we will be sending out a link to a short YouTube video in a few weeks, in which we will show you just how close Halo is to being in your hands and on the market. In the meanwhile, here’s a sneak peek of our latest packaging design.                           We don’t just understand your frustration, we share it. We set out to build the safest, smartest smoke alarm in the world. Knowing that we are very close to that goal, and closer to the goal of helping keep families safe in their homes, it’s difficult to accept any delay, but we will get there. When we do, it will be thanks to the support, encouragement, and persistence of people like you, who believed in us from the beginning.  Thank you.Ben StaggCEO & Co-founderIntroducing the Halo and Halo+ Smoke Detectors
Halo is an industry-first combination of sensor technology for flash fires, smoldering fires and carbon monoxide in a single device. No other smoke alarm at any price offers you this same level of protection, period. The new home-alert system connects the device to the Internet and home-automation systems, plus users can receive alerts and adjust settings with an iOS and Android app. It will also send alerts to mobile devices so users are aware of danger even if they are thousands of miles away.


UPDATE!Thanks to everyone who has supported our Indiegogo campaign so far! Because of all your questions and comments (and the successful close of our $900K investment round), we have actually made huge strides to bring you the battery powered Halo device as well! Thanks to your support, our team went back to the labs and are ready to release and sell the new Halo Battery Operated Smoke Detector right now!
How does the battery operated Halo work?
The battery operated Halo runs on 4 AA batteries that are easy to replace without the need for tools! Our engineers focused on power conservation from the very beginning of our design, and the the battery powered Halo is able to provide the same level of sensor monitoring and intelligent processing as our hard-wired version for customers who are in need of a “battery only” option.
How long do they last?
Under typical conditions, the batteries should last 2 years.
What features does this Halo still have?
The battery operated Halo has all of the same great features aside from the Night Light feature and the Weather Alerts feature.


If you're like 90% of Americans, you're only safe from one type of fire.

Most people think that when they have a smoke detector, they're protected from all fires. This simply isn't true. 90% of US homes have an ionization-only smoke detector. If you're one of these people, it means that your smoke detector may not detect a smoldering fire for 15-50 minutes.
Think about this. In the average home, firefighters agree that many people have as little as two minutes to escape. If your smoke detector is going to take 15-50 minutes to detect a fire, then you're already too late. This is why a dual sensor smoke alarm is so vital to your safety. Both the ionization and photoelectric sensors are vital to your safety from both smoldering and flash fires.
The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recommends a dual sensor approach, because you never know what type of fire will strike.
Halo is the only smoke detector that can protect your family from everything: Flash fires, smoldering fires, carbon monoxide, and dangerous weather.





Carbon Monoxide
Protect Your Family from ""The Silent Killer""
Carbon monoxide gases are invisible, odorless, and deadly. Have peace of mind with Halo.How Will Halo Warn me of Carbon Monoxide?When Halo notices elevated levels of gas, you'll receive an auditory and visual alert.
First, a voice will alert you, ""Elevated CO in the living room, move to fresh air!""
Then, a pulsing orange light from the device will warn you visually of the danger.
The pulse of the light will speed up as the CO gas increases, and slow down as it decreases.
If it's unsafe for you to be in the room where the gas has been detected, the orange pulse will turn to an orange and white flashing light, along with an auditory alert: ""Danger, CO in the living room, move to fresh air.""

Weather Alerts with the Halo+
Protect Your Home and Family from Severe Weather
Are you in a location that's at risk for tornadoes? The Halo+ can alert you to location specific National Weather Service issued warnings to help you get to safety within plenty of time.
Halo+ comes preset out of the box to receive tornado warnings only. You can choose to add additional weather alerts from the list below:


Protect Your Family & Save Money on Insurance with Halo
Did you know most insurance companies will give you a discount if you have a connected smoke detector and/or smoke alarm? With Halo or Halo+ installed in your home, you're eligible for up to a 10% discount on your home insurance policy.
Why do I get this discount?
Simply put, connected home smoke alarms are safer. It saves the insurance company money if you're making safer choices for your home. With a connected home smoke alarm, you get to receive alerts via your cell phone which offers a greater degree of protection, and a more intelligent alert system. You're safer, your home is safer, and the insurance company can worry less. This means they'll give you a discount.
Are you a homeowner, landlord or property manager? If you have Halo, your deduction for owning a safer smoke alarm will pay for your Halo smoke alarm within an average of 2 years! After that, it's money in your pocket.




Halo's Smart Logic

Is your smoke alarm risking your life?
71% of structure fires deaths are caused because a smoke detector that has a missing or discharged battery. This means that the victims weren’t able to make it to safety in time. Something that was meant to save lives ends up being rendered useless because the batteries were useless.
We've all been there: You're fixing your morning breakfast when you accidentally burn the bacon, or the toast. A shrill, ear-splitting beep echoes through your house and everyone runs into the kitchen to see if there's cause for alarm. Or there's that annoying chirp, chirp, chirp in the middle of the night. You get out of bed and, in an effort to silence the chirp, you remove the battery or (even worse) take down your smoke alarm. Now you've taken a marginally effective early warning device and disabled it, making it completely ineffective.
This is where the problem starts. Pulling the batteries out of your smoke detector puts you at a huge risk of being caught in a home fire without enough time to escape.
Your smoke detector is so annoying that it is literally risking your life. 
How Halo Stops This Deadly CycleNo Chirps!
Halo is equipped with the industry’s first, long lasting, lithium-ion rechargeable battery, which virtually removes that annoying nighttime chirp forever from our hardwired model. As for the battery operated version, Halo will notify you with a reminder to your cell phone, using words  rather than annoying beeps to inform you that your batteries are running low and need to be replaced.  Thank you Halo!
Smart Logic's 5 Sensors
False alarms are dangerous. They numb us to potentially dangerous situations and, up until now, the homeowner had to take the smoke alarm’s word for whether or not there was danger. Sadly and loudly, that alert came in the form of an annoying 85db beep.
Every Halo smoke alarm is equipped with 5 different sensors: photoelectric, ionization, CO, heat, and humidity. The constant intelligent monitoring of these 5 sensors helps Halo learn from its environment and helps to reduce false alarms while confirming actual dangerous concerns.



How Does It Work?
1.The Shower Episode
If you’re taking a shower, the steam has the ability to block out the ion and photoelectric sensors and trigger a false alarm. Since Halo is equipped with CO, heat, and humidity sensors, it can tell if there is a spike in the humidity with no increase of carbon monoxide and only a minor increase in heat. Because of those sensors, Halo recognizes that there is no fire, and even if the smoke detecting sensors are triggered, Halo will know not to sound a false alarm.
2. Burnt Toast
Every false alarm has a signature. If your halo smoke alarm goes into warning status and you are not at home, Halo will give you real-time updates and provide you with an interpretation of the data at hand. With our smart sensor logic, we will know if there is only a burned toast incident in your home, or a dangerous fire taking place.

Unlike a fan that tries to get maximum airflow, blö cools off a small portion on your body using ambient cooling, similar to how an ice cube cools you off.

However, how many of those belts would you consider being “the perfect belt?”   “Finding the perfect belt”, or the “belt experience”, is an experience akin to finding “true love”. You know it’s out there, but always illusive, just out of reach. Some of you may be luckier than others, but the rest of us; it may be a never-ending search.  Sometimes you think you found the perfect belt, only to realize it’s anything but…. they can get moldy, become riddled with holes, never the right fit when you gain or lose just a bit of weight, bulky and boring, you name it.  Belt cost a lot of money and take up a decent amount of space, especially when they aren’t the right fit, or have too many problems. Ordinary belts have lots of problems. It can also be a hassle; so many of us simply settle for wearing inferior belts and ruining their image and personality without ever realizing it. What a tragedy!   We have set out to correct this tragedy. No more settling for an inferior belt!The MIN Belt is the ""True Love"" you have been searching for! The belt that no one thought existed. A minimal, modern design, that is stylish without flamboyance, and yet offering the perfect fit! Just one MIN Belt, you can replace all the other belts in your collection. A design that is suited for work or play, from tailored suits, to hiking. You got it.       We realised that we were fed up with ordinary belts, which are prone to numerous problems. The world needed a new kind of belt, so we came up with a brilliant idea. Our extraordinary belt design was crafted with these five concepts in mind:  1. Minimal and Inspiring2. Simple, but stylish and meaningful3. Unique buckle mechanism and innovative belt strap material4. Solution to all common belt problems5. Very durable This was the beginning of ""MIN Belt"".   The MIN Belt, features a unique, patent-pending buckle design, that is both versatile and highly functional. The buckle is created out of a single piece of stainless steel, transformed through laser cutting, forming, sandblasting, and a jewellery-grade PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) finish.  The MIN Buckle has a unique, simple, and elegant design, that functions as a 2-tier clip, holding belt strap in place.   The ""M-I-N"" typographic design buckle is made from special stainless steel, featuring a matte finish, followed with jewelry-grade PVD color coating that is both strong, and beautiful: the perfect finishing touch, to your everyday outfit.  The belt strap itself, is very important to the overall feel of the belt you choose. It is also where most problems lie.  We have researched, tested and experimented with many belt strap prototypes.  Finally, we developed our unique belt strap material, which has a great feel, beautiful colors, great texture, as well as being extremely durable. It has to be very comfortable to wear, and must be a perfect match for the MIN Buckle.  The MIN Strap is 35 mm-wide premium-grade polymer-based coated webbing that is super durable and water resistant. The strap has a texture that is similar to leather, but a lot more durable. You will immediately sense the superb strap quality and texture from a distance, and the overall feel will be summed up in just one word….”Premium”.  We are offering two MIN Strap colours: Black and Brown. More strap colors will be added later.   MIN Belt features a minimal design without holes, flaps, loops, or any unnecessary stuff. It is a simple combination of the MIN Buckle and the MIN Strap. Together, the MIN Belt fixes all of your typical belt problems. It offers a new belt experience with plenty of benefits over ordinary belts. You no longer need so many belts in your closet from now on!  The MIN Belt is stylish and looks stunning with any outfit, allowing it to be mixed and matched with any dress code for any occasion.     Wearing the MIN Belt is also quick and easy.

I have also long been involved in and concerned about sustainability issues. Now with two very aware young girls (ages 7 &amp; 11) who are both fashion <i>and very</i> environmentally conscious and having married into a family of lifelong entrepreneurs, I have been inspired to go for my dream of creating my own fashion label, a sleepwear brand that my ‘aware’ children will be proud of when they look behind the label, a brand that will allow me (and hopefully you too) to sleep with a clear conscious.<br/>Made sustainably and ethically in the USA, and ideally right here in the Great Lakes region. Our Mission is to make dreamy soft, comfortable sleepwear that doesn’t harm the earth or health of the wearer.</p><p>A bit about myself. I was born and raised on the Great Lakes and now living in Door County amongst the greatest body of freshwater in the world, and given the challenges, the traditional fashion industry creates, I plan to do good while making a positive impact. We have a corresponding .org in the works that will highlight issues and challenges related to the Great Lakes while promoting awareness and solutions to help keep our lakes ‘fresh’ for generations to come before it takes on an orange hue!</p><h3>THE LAUNCH COLLECTION:</h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533090625/ksollhuslush881x6naf.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Our launch design is a very comfortable, slightly retro look.

<li>After fulfillment, near term, design and ethically produce my winter and spring collections.</li>
<li>As we grow I plan to create a real, ethical, business with real jobs and continue to offer more quality products that will delight my customers. </li>
</ul><p><strong>MORE DETAILS:</strong> <br/>My ambition is to weave social consciousness and sustainability into the fabric of the brand. I care about the process, the who, the where, the what goes into the clothes that I wear. As a mom of young children who get ‘it’ about concerns of our environment, I would be cheating them of the clean future they deserve if I just went the “business as usual” route and profits at all costs, humans, and environment be damned, I gotta get mine. Yuck! How do people sleep at night with that mindset? We all know there is a better way.<br/>I feel strongly as more and more people hear our story and enjoy our boutique pj’s, we’ll find an increasing number of concerned consumers who realize the impact and power of their dollars spent and who want to be part of the solution.  <br/>We are inspired by the Great Lakes and their beautiful, life-sustaining water that forms the largest body of freshwater on the planet by area and contains 21% of the world’s freshwater by volume. The waters from these lakes impact our life and the lives of over 30 million people who live around the Great Lakes basin on a daily basis.</p><p>Those who live, work and play here know, there are many special places in our Great Lakes region and they need our attention and protection. It is our belief that just by proximity alone we are stewards of this incredible resource and want to do our part to help sustain them for many generations.  <br/><br/>Knowing what goes into our pj’s and what doesn’t, we know you will sleep good at night, and lord knows we all could use a good night sleep these days! At Fresh Riviera® Clothing We call it Enclothed Cognition. Wear what makes you feel good!

Dreamy soft, organic cotton jammies, designed & ethically crafted right here in the USA.Like many, I have long dreamed of being involved in the fashion industry, even attending college studying fashion before graduating with a degree in social work. I have also long been involved in and concerned about sustainability issues. Now with two very aware young girls (ages 7 & 11) who are both fashion and very environmentally conscious and having married into a family of lifelong entrepreneurs, I have been inspired to go for my dream of creating my own fashion label, a sleepwear brand that my ‘aware’ children will be proud of when they look behind the label, a brand that will allow me (and hopefully you too) to sleep with a clear conscious.Made sustainably and ethically in the USA, and ideally right here in the Great Lakes region. Our Mission is to make dreamy soft, comfortable sleepwear that doesn’t harm the earth or health of the wearer.A bit about myself. I was born and raised on the Great Lakes and now living in Door County amongst the greatest body of freshwater in the world, and given the challenges, the traditional fashion industry creates, I plan to do good while making a positive impact. We have a corresponding .org in the works that will highlight issues and challenges related to the Great Lakes while promoting awareness and solutions to help keep our lakes ‘fresh’ for generations to come before it takes on an orange hue!THE LAUNCH COLLECTION:        Our launch design is a very comfortable, slightly retro look. Loose fit, faux wrap top with loose fit track style shorts with coordinating trim. Currently available in two colors, inspired by a relaxing evening of watching the sunset on a sandy beach on your favorite spot on The Great Lakes.    Sunset Blush with coordinating Sand shorts.   Aqua Breeze with coordinating Sand shorts.THE PLAN:
Launch my dreamy soft organic jammies that are made in the U.S.A. 
Take orders and supporters and craft and deliver my jammies.
After fulfillment, near term, design and ethically produce my winter and spring collections.
As we grow I plan to create a real, ethical, business with real jobs and continue to offer more quality products that will delight my customers. 
MORE DETAILS: My ambition is to weave social consciousness and sustainability into the fabric of the brand. I care about the process, the who, the where, the what goes into the clothes that I wear. As a mom of young children who get ‘it’ about concerns of our environment, I would be cheating them of the clean future they deserve if I just went the “business as usual” route and profits at all costs, humans, and environment be damned, I gotta get mine. Yuck! How do people sleep at night with that mindset? We all know there is a better way.I feel strongly as more and more people hear our story and enjoy our boutique pj’s, we’ll find an increasing number of concerned consumers who realize the impact and power of their dollars spent and who want to be part of the solution.  We are inspired by the Great Lakes and their beautiful, life-sustaining water that forms the largest body of freshwater on the planet by area and contains 21% of the world’s freshwater by volume. The waters from these lakes impact our life and the lives of over 30 million people who live around the Great Lakes basin on a daily basis.Those who live, work and play here know, there are many special places in our Great Lakes region and they need our attention and protection. It is our belief that just by proximity alone we are stewards of this incredible resource and want to do our part to help sustain them for many generations.  Knowing what goes into our pj’s and what doesn’t, we know you will sleep good at night, and lord knows we all could use a good night sleep these days!

Inside & Out!Why Pre-Order?Your support helps make an impact in the world... plus you get a super comfy pair of organic cotton pj's.Not gonna lie, creating a simple pair of ethically, made in the USA pj’s using earth-friendly fabric is not a simple as it may seem.

 Five years ago, I broke my back riding BMX. During recovery, I realized sitting on my thick wallet was causing serious back pain. So I took it out and set it by my hospital bed. Next thing I know, it’s gone!Maybe bulky wallets don’t make your back hurt, but they sure are uncomfortable and extremely ugly in your pocket (unless you like having a tumor on your butt). Sure, you can put it in your front pocket - but unless you’re looking for a confidence booster, having a bulge in the front is not very appealing either.So enter in thin, minimalist wallets... When I looked into the options for minimalist wallets, I immediately saw problems. First off, the wallets weren’t even thin enough - especially after putting in cards! They still created bulge and, at least for me, still gave me back pain!Next was the durability. All the wallets I found were cheaply made and wore down easy. The pockets would stretch (making it bulky), the seams would rip, the material would degrade. Within a few months, I would have to replace them.Last, and this was the most difficult, they didn’t carry enough cards. Each wallet company kept telling me that 1 or 2 cards was more than enough for my needs. They would even say there was a “bonus” 3rd and 4th card slot. Seriously? I had to constantly switch out cards for my needs and even misplaced my ID a few times! Not to mention, I couldn’t carry any cash. I needed a wallet that was ultra-thin, even when full, strong enough to hold up to my active lifestyle, and made to last.So me and my team went to search for the most advanced technical materials science had to offer. The wallet material had to be super thin, ridiculously strong, ultralight, and sustainable.We also developed a never-before-used Exo design that uses your cards to provide structure to the wallet - eliminating internal layers that add unnecessary thickness.After countless designs, engineering tests, and prototype iterations, we finally did it. A truly thin wallet that is built to last and will carry everything you need without creating bulk - all in a classic bifold design. We used a military-spec ballistic material that is 15x stronger than steel and thinner than a razor blade. This next-gen material is the same stuff in body armor used by the military and keeps your Stealth Wallet from stretching, tearing, breaking, or wearing out.Our wallet material is the newest breakthrough in material science and is currently used in body armor, car armor, motorcycle gear, cut-resistant gloves, mining & tow ropes, and air cargo nets in the military.

Don't believe us? Check out a group of strong men trying to destroy the Stealth Razor Wallet.Not only is our material strong, it’s incredibly thin & lightweight! The material itself is much thinner than a razor blade making it perfect for ultra-thin wallets. No more stretched out wallets! We only used the best materials and stitching so you won’t have any baggy pockets after you stuff your Stealth Wallet full of cards and cash.Stealth Wallet is made to last. From the material to the manufacturing, we made sure every aspect of the Stealth Wallet was designed, engineered, and chosen to stay strong and durable for a long time.Stealth Wallet will last you much longer than your typical wallet and most definitely longer than other “thin” wallets. While most slim wallets only have space for a couple cards, we refused to compromise. The Stealth Wallet’s patent-pending design uses offset card slots to optimize capacity without creating bulk. As a result, you can carry 8 cards plus cash in an ultra-thin minimalist wallet. It’s just better engineering.Stealth Wallet can hold up to 8 cards securely in its innovative slot design. Cards can be easily seen and accessed from the slots - so you don’t have to fumble around to get the one you need!Most wallets (even “thin” wallets) use a piece of cheap cardboard or plastic to give structure to the wallet. Stealth Wallet uses a patent-pending Exo design that lets your cards provide structure to the wallet and doesn’t need any additional internal layers to keep structural integrity. This keeps your wallet exceptionally thin, even when it’s packed!Our structure design is completely unique to Stealth Wallet and has never been seen or used in wallets before!Maximize accessibility and usability with card stacking. Get to your cards quickly and easily without forgetting what pocket they’re in.  Our patent-pending ballistic bungee cash loop holds cash in place with easy removal and better cash organization. Slip cash in and out without having to fold any bills or fumble in a pocket. Our ballistic bungee is powerfully secure. Your cash is firmly locked in your wallet until you want to take it out. No folding needed!The bungee lets you easily take out your cash without any fumbling, searching, or unfolding. Simply flip to find your bill and pull to remove it. Get the exact bill you need quick and easy.You can even use your cards without taking them out with the quick card slide feature!Our bungee loop makes it easy to search through your bills without removing them. Quickly find and grab your bill while keeping the rest of your cash tied down. All Stealth Wallets are protected with RFID-blocking lining. This keeps your information secure from data and credit card theft. Travel safe and worry-free wherever life’s journey takes you.Keep your ID ready at all times. Stealth Wallet comes with an ID Window so you don’t have to fumble around with your ID or mix it with your credit cards.This is particularly unique for a slim wallet since the window usually adds thickness. We avoided this unnecessary thickness by getting rid of the plastic typically used in the window and using our special design to maintain the structure of the wallet. Our Stealth Razor Wallet is perfect for all kinds of adventures.Made to survive even your craziest journeys. Stealth Razor is as tough as you are and will stick with you through all of life’s adventures.Whether you carry it with you every day or only during active moments, the Stealth Razor will never hold you back.Stealth Razor is sweat and water resistant. The special material can actually float! This makes the Stealth Razor the best adventure wallet out there.The Stealth Razor is also ultralight - weighing only 3.9 grams when empty. That’s lighter than a sheet of paper!Stealth Razor is also 100% vegan and completely free of animal products for all you animal lovers!  Our Stealth Leather Wallet is perfect for your everyday carry as well as your dressiest occasions. We use super-slim premium performance leather from a European tannery with nearly two centuries of experience. Sustainably made, our leather is environmentally certified, and every hide used is a byproduct of the meat industry.Stealth Leather is made from specifically sourced leather that was made to last. This isn’t your cheap watch strap leather. Our leather is specially chosen and created with  time-proven, state-of-the-art techniques to ensure they don’t degrade quickly overtime.Stealth Leather Wallets will age nicely with character - rather than wear down in quality and aesthetics overtime. Super strong, ultra-thin, and extremely practical - Stealth Wallet is made for the modern adventurer. We made zero compromises and ensured that, no matter what, you only receive the absolute best.Whether you’re heading to the boardroom or to the beach, flying on a plane or jumping out of one, commuting downtown or hiking Half Dome, Stealth Wallet is made for you.

<p>What started out as a ""spacious"" 1200 square-foot studio has lately become <strong>PACKED </strong>with raw materials: 96"" x 36"" sheets of copper and bronze; 4'x8' sheets of plywood and MDF; various shapes and sizes of steel for table-legs, substrates and so forth; boxes of scrap which we ""self-recycle"" -- digging through smaller and smaller pieces to use until all that's left is tiny chips; inventory; soldering  and welding supplies; tools that we only use occasionally (like our bead-roller that we use about once a year - but when you need a bead-roller, nothing else will do); worktables; and lots of shelves to store things.</p>
<p>The bottom line is, we're crowding ourselves out of our own studio and its become apparent that we cannot continue to use our art studio for a storeroom.  The space needs to be reserved exclusively for making art and storage needs to be done in another building. </p>
<p><strong>So, what to do?</strong></p>
<p>We can buy a premade shed, spacious enough for our needs and have it trucked in and set on blocks for $5000. This is a superior method compared to building it ourselves, for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>One, if we have it built offsite and trucked in, we don't need a building permit and we don't need to have it inspected. If we build it ourselves, we need to apply for a permit and explain why we ""need"" another building on our property. If the city decides we don't ""need"" it; no permit. Also, part of the permitting process involves a waiting period while the city gathers opinions, pro and con, as to whether or not should be allowed to build; again, another chance for the project to be torpedoed when all of that could be simply and easily avoided by having the shed prebuilt and trucked in. Plus there's the waiting part of the waiting period and -- don't forget -- the two inspections. If we fail either one of the inspections, theres even more delay while we fix whatever caused us to fail the inspection. If we have the shed trucked in, there's no inspection required at all. Between the waiting period and the inspections, that makes for a lot of waiting around. The longer we wait, the longer we're struggling trying to move about our overcrowded studio. All of that is avoided, again, by buying a premade building and having it delivered. In short, there's a lot of ways things can go wrong if we try to build the shed ourselves and almost no way things can go wrong if we have it prebuilt and delivered. It really is the best way.</li>
<li>Two, we travel about six months out of the year; with layovers at home of usually two days a week, Two days wherein we are madly building more art pieces to sell on the road. That doesn't leave us a lot of time for building a shed.</li>
<li>Three, we're metal artists, not wooden shed-builders. While I'm reasonably certain we could build a shed if we absolutely had to, from an economic and time-management standpoint, it makes sense to ""stick to our knitting"" (jewelry and interior design) and pay someone whose field of expertise is making and delivering sheds. ""Division of labor"": It's worked for centuries. We see no reason to buck that trend now.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, buying the shed and having it delivered and set up, while slightly more pricey than building it ourselves (but only if we ignore the cost of our own labor) is, on the whole, a far better way to go to get the storage capacity we so desperately need.</p>
<p>Having to come up with an additional $5000 on top of our monthly expenses is a daunting task.</p>
<p>Having a shed means we can work better, faster, make more stuff and more kinds of stuff that you can enjoy, but only if we have room to make it in. Do you see the conundrum? We can't make more money to be able to buy a shed until we can clear some room to allow us to take on more and bigger projects so that we can make more money to enable us to buy a shed!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Optimism rules and Opportunities never cease. We started Nora Swanson Arts over 10 years ago and we have, combined, over 60 years experience in the art business.</p>
<p>We're very confident in our ability to meet demand for this project. The ""exclusive"" pieces have already been made and are resting comfortably in their glass case (case not included with purchase), anxiously awaiting news of who their new owner will be! We've also made a goodly supply of our ""popular"" items and if we run low, no worries. We can make more. We've done this before; a couple of times! So, as before, even if you're the ONLY person who backs us, you'll still get your pieces. We have a fully equipped (if extremely primitive) shop. So, if any contingencies arise, we've got them covered. And we're pros at shipping. We've been shipping our work for many years. So again, you have nothing to fear. If any unforeseeable setbacks or delays occur, we'll be sure to let you know, ASAP!  We realize we're a mighty small fish in a mighty big pond. But nothing was ever accomplished by saying, “I can't”. This is just the start.</p>
<p><strong>Join us! With your help, we can make good things happen!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>    Some people, no matter how much they may want to, just can't contribute monetarily.<br/>    We understand that. And it doesn't mean you can't help<br/>    Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign<br/>    Put us on Facebook and Twitter and all of your social networking sites<br/>    Don't forget the Indiegogo share tools</p>
<p>So, whether it's by spreading the word through social media, buying an inexpensive art-piece, or buying a top-of-the-line <i>legacy-piece, </i>there are lots of ways to move things forward. We are grateful for your interest in our work!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

We will then be traveling, five days a week, to Art Shows around the eastern half of the country, On the two days that we're home, we're either unloading the truck, making more pieces to sell, or loading the truck and preparing to leave for the next Art Show. That doesn't leave us a lot of time for entertaining and in any case, we wouldn't be much fun! The Art Show season ends in late November and then we'll have time to tidy up a bit and prepare to receive visitors! So, that's why we can't have you over until December. Sorry!

<li>
<strong>The mortgage: </strong>we own the studio, so someday, we'll be done paying for it! But for now, we have to keep paying or the bank won't let us use it anymore!</li>
<li>
<strong>Utilities:</strong> Water and electricity; We heat with wood, but we use a lot of electricity for lighting; fans; (you need exhaust fans when you're welding and soldering so you don't poison yourself with the fumes!), power tools - drills, sanders, grinders and so on; the welder uses a lot of electricity; all of the jewelry gets washed thoroughly, multiple times - that uses a lot of water.</li>
<li>
<strong>Raw materials:</strong> copper, bronze, silver, stones, wood</li>
<li>
<strong>Expendables:</strong> solder, flux, welding rod, welding gas (argon), acetylene, sandpaper, glue, grinding wheels, cutting wheels, drill bits</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Depreciation</i> on tools: </strong>The major tools; the welder, the drill-press and other expensive items all wear out eventually, and so do pliers and sheers and files and angle-grinders and saws. Hammers never wear out, for some reason. ""<i>Depreciation</i>"" means you're setting aside a portion of the value of that tool over time, so when it comes time to buy a new one, you have the money.</li>
</ul><p>The rest goes to:</p><ul>

We create wonderful pieces of jewelry and interior design using copper, bronze and other metals as well as delightful semi-precious stones.If you like our work, please back our projectOur little traveling Art-ShowWe've driven over 300,000 miles and given our ""pitch"" to over a hundred thousand people at art shows across much of the eastern United States.Now, thanks to Indiegogo, we can come directly to you! Our goal is to get as much Nora Swanson Arts ""anti-bling"" into the hands of as many Swansonistas as possible!  Our Vision
What started out as a ""spacious"" 1200 square-foot studio has lately become PACKED with raw materials: 96"" x 36"" sheets of copper and bronze; 4'x8' sheets of plywood and MDF; various shapes and sizes of steel for table-legs, substrates and so forth; boxes of scrap which we ""self-recycle"" -- digging through smaller and smaller pieces to use until all that's left is tiny chips; inventory; soldering  and welding supplies; tools that we only use occasionally (like our bead-roller that we use about once a year - but when you need a bead-roller, nothing else will do); worktables; and lots of shelves to store things.
The bottom line is, we're crowding ourselves out of our own studio and its become apparent that we cannot continue to use our art studio for a storeroom.  The space needs to be reserved exclusively for making art and storage needs to be done in another building. 
So, what to do?
We can buy a premade shed, spacious enough for our needs and have it trucked in and set on blocks for $5000. This is a superior method compared to building it ourselves, for a number of reasons:

One, if we have it built offsite and trucked in, we don't need a building permit and we don't need to have it inspected. If we build it ourselves, we need to apply for a permit and explain why we ""need"" another building on our property. If the city decides we don't ""need"" it; no permit. Also, part of the permitting process involves a waiting period while the city gathers opinions, pro and con, as to whether or not should be allowed to build; again, another chance for the project to be torpedoed when all of that could be simply and easily avoided by having the shed prebuilt and trucked in. Plus there's the waiting part of the waiting period and -- don't forget -- the two inspections. If we fail either one of the inspections, theres even more delay while we fix whatever caused us to fail the inspection. If we have the shed trucked in, there's no inspection required at all. Between the waiting period and the inspections, that makes for a lot of waiting around. The longer we wait, the longer we're struggling trying to move about our overcrowded studio. All of that is avoided, again, by buying a premade building and having it delivered. In short, there's a lot of ways things can go wrong if we try to build the shed ourselves and almost no way things can go wrong if we have it prebuilt and delivered. It really is the best way.
Two, we travel about six months out of the year; with layovers at home of usually two days a week, Two days wherein we are madly building more art pieces to sell on the road. That doesn't leave us a lot of time for building a shed.
Three, we're metal artists, not wooden shed-builders. While I'm reasonably certain we could build a shed if we absolutely had to, from an economic and time-management standpoint, it makes sense to ""stick to our knitting"" (jewelry and interior design) and pay someone whose field of expertise is making and delivering sheds. ""Division of labor"": It's worked for centuries. We see no reason to buck that trend now.

In short, buying the shed and having it delivered and set up, while slightly more pricey than building it ourselves (but only if we ignore the cost of our own labor) is, on the whole, a far better way to go to get the storage capacity we so desperately need.
Having to come up with an additional $5000 on top of our monthly expenses is a daunting task.
Having a shed means we can work better, faster, make more stuff and more kinds of stuff that you can enjoy, but only if we have room to make it in. Do you see the conundrum? We can't make more money to be able to buy a shed until we can clear some room to allow us to take on more and bigger projects so that we can make more money to enable us to buy a shed!

We've set up a tempting array of some rather lavish rewards for those of you intrepid enough to back this project. We hope you'll see something you really like and we can make a deal.

Risks & Challenges
Optimism rules and Opportunities never cease. We started Nora Swanson Arts over 10 years ago and we have, combined, over 60 years experience in the art business.
We're very confident in our ability to meet demand for this project. The ""exclusive"" pieces have already been made and are resting comfortably in their glass case (case not included with purchase), anxiously awaiting news of who their new owner will be! We've also made a goodly supply of our ""popular"" items and if we run low, no worries. We can make more. We've done this before; a couple of times! So, as before, even if you're the ONLY person who backs us, you'll still get your pieces. We have a fully equipped (if extremely primitive) shop. So, if any contingencies arise, we've got them covered. And we're pros at shipping. We've been shipping our work for many years. So again, you have nothing to fear. If any unforeseeable setbacks or delays occur, we'll be sure to let you know, ASAP!  We realize we're a mighty small fish in a mighty big pond. But nothing was ever accomplished by saying, “I can't”. This is just the start.
Join us! With your help, we can make good things happen!
 
Other Ways You Can Help
    Some people, no matter how much they may want to, just can't contribute monetarily.    We understand that. And it doesn't mean you can't help    Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign    Put us on Facebook and Twitter and all of your social networking sites    Don't forget the Indiegogo share tools
So, whether it's by spreading the word through social media, buying an inexpensive art-piece, or buying a top-of-the-line legacy-piece, there are lots of ways to move things forward. We are grateful for your interest in our work!
Thank you!

Can't you make more?""Yes, of course we can make more. But the nature (and some would say ""the charm"") of handmade pieces is that they are never exactly duplicatable; there will never be pieces of turquoise ( or Kentucky Agate) exactly like these pieces, and we'll never do metal work that exactly duplicates these pieces.With that in mind, if you've seen a piece anywhere on our IGG page that you like, and you think you'd like something similar, please contact us via email.

We'll even tuck you in!Travel extra.*(Why is the Super Fan/Super Tour not available until December? For a very simple and good reason: When our IGG campaign ends, we will be scrambling madly to fill orders and make any additional items needed. As soon as that's done, the Art Show Season begins. We will then be traveling, five days a week, to Art Shows around the eastern half of the country, On the two days that we're home, we're either unloading the truck, making more pieces to sell, or loading the truck and preparing to leave for the next Art Show. That doesn't leave us a lot of time for entertaining and in any case, we wouldn't be much fun! The Art Show season ends in late November and then we'll have time to tidy up a bit and prepare to receive visitors! So, that's why we can't have you over until December. Sorry! On the plus side, winters are generally mild here and you can enjoy our fantastic wood-stove while we tour the studio and design your jewelry! We'll buy the beer! That's not so bad, eh?) EXTRA!

The perfect his'n'her combo for any occasion!*Limited Edition   So, what else is new?Sometimes, we get asked, ""Besides making jewelry, what else do you do?""We're glad you asked! Check out the video below to find out a bit more about us. This clip will give you more of a feel for our operation and how we like to do things. We're ""old school""; smokin' hot metal and big hammers! We're definitely not building smart watches!If you like our work, you can click the BACK IT button at the top-right of the page to donate any amount for no perk.Oh! And the next video is a bit further down the page. Thanks!   Where does the money go?In our case, that's relatively easy to answer:A big chunk of our monthly expenses go to studio overhead including,

The mortgage: we own the studio, so someday, we'll be done paying for it! But for now, we have to keep paying or the bank won't let us use it anymore!

Utilities: Water and electricity; We heat with wood, but we use a lot of electricity for lighting; fans; (you need exhaust fans when you're welding and soldering so you don't poison yourself with the fumes!), power tools - drills, sanders, grinders and so on; the welder uses a lot of electricity; all of the jewelry gets washed thoroughly, multiple times - that uses a lot of water.

Raw materials: copper, bronze, silver, stones, wood

Expendables: solder, flux, welding rod, welding gas (argon), acetylene, sandpaper, glue, grinding wheels, cutting wheels, drill bits

Depreciation on tools: The major tools; the welder, the drill-press and other expensive items all wear out eventually, and so do pliers and sheers and files and angle-grinders and saws. Hammers never wear out, for some reason. ""Depreciation"" means you're setting aside a portion of the value of that tool over time, so when it comes time to buy a new one, you have the money.
The rest goes to:

Our lenses <strong>increase the magnification</strong> of our sight, ensuring the ciliary muscle does not overwork.

<h3>
<u>THE IDEA FOR </u><u>EXYRA</u>
</h3>
<p>My previous job involved intensive engineering design and modeling, which entailed staring at my computer screen for 10 hours or more in a typical workday. By the end of the day, my eyes would be sore and strained, occasionally accompanied by a blistering headache. Many of my colleagues suffered a similar experience on a frequent basis, as their jobs also involved prolonged computer use. </p>
<p>I began researching the stress on my eyes, and I learned that digital eyestrain was a condition and not just an inherent part of day-to-day life. An extended study revealed that these complaints were linked to prolonged exposure to blue light, which is emitted from sources such as the screen of a digital device and artificial lighting.</p>
<p>There are glasses that are designed to reduce digital eyestrain during screen use, but current glasses in the market are plain and unattractive. With their yellow-orange tinted lenses and unappealing design, I was not comfortable wearing them in public or in an office environment. I came to realize the niche potential in this area; a concept that would allow countless people to moderate the effect of screen use on their eyes through a pair of affordable, stylish computer glasses. The EXYRA concept was born.</p>
<p><strong>Our Vision</strong></p>
<p>Our main focus is to create awareness of the consequences of an exponentially increasing exposure to digital screens on our eye health – and provide a solution to mitigate the impact. We specifically focus on blue light emissions from digital devices; and offer a product that does not compromise one’s daily professional look. We make beautiful, handcrafted acetate glasses to help you do what you do better, and look great while doing it.</p>
<p>But we are more than that. We are a network of smart, talented professionals who understand the need for connectivity and cooperation. We are fashion-voguish, digital warriors who design, finance and develop awesome concepts. We are a community of technology users who desire to build innovative products and services of tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Our Want is to Meet Your Need </strong></p>
<p>We want to reach out to as many people as we can to create an informed awareness about our great product. Please share our story and our vision with the world. Your support will ensure that more and more people become conscious of the dangers of blue light and the incredible health benefits they can gain from the use of EXYRA glasses</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Countless hours of design, development, prototypes, samples, testing and the completion of the product are all behind us. Through this intensive process, we have reduced many risks and potential issues regarding product quality and reliability. Now EXYRA glasses are much more than a great idea!</p>
<p>The next step is to take EXYRA to the market, but producing eyeglasses are expensive. Even costlier is the acetate material used to create attractive frames and high-quality lenses with a blue light filter. Our main challenge is raising the funds up front for setting up production, shipping and holding inventories. As a small business, it is incredibly challenging to access the required funding. That is why we are asking you to contribute in any way you can. In addition, by getting in early and helping us out, we have some great rewards for you!</p>

</div></div>","THE PROBLEMYou probably know about the dangers of ultraviolet (UV) light, but have you heard of blue light?Where does Blue Light come from?Blue light is ever-present in your environment – both outdoors and indoors. It is naturally produced by the sun, dispensed from fluorescent light bulbs and emitted by LEDs present in digital devices such as computer screens, tablets and smartphones.What is Blue Light?Blue light is part of visible light and close to UV on the light spectrum, comprising of wavelengths that range from 400 nm to 500 nm. How can Blue Light harm you?Our naked eyes are not designed for exposure to artificial blue light emitted from digital devices, since short-wavelength, high-energy blue light penetrates all the way into the retina. Excessive exposure to blue light can have adverse effects on our eye health, leading to side effects such as eyestrain, headaches and difficulty in sleeping; and its cumulative effect can cause damage to the retina. Click on the link below to find out more about the harmful effects of blue light:http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-sidehttps://thevisioncouncil.org/content/blue-light-exposure-and-digital-eye-strain/adultshttp://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/03/health/digital-eyestrain/ THE SOLUTIONBLUE LIGHT FILTER TECHNOLOGYEXYRA glasses are specially designed to optimize vision when viewing content on digital screens. The precision-engineered EXYRA lenses absorb and reflect the high-energy bIue light that can otherwise strain your eyes. EXYRA lenses are made of an in-monomer material that blocks harmful blue and ultraviolet light. Since the material itself blocks blue light, the lens retains the property whenever it is in use. The lens also allows the healthier blue-turquoise light in, which helps in proper color perception and wakefulness.ANTI-FATIGUEOur eyes are not designed to stare at things up-close for long hours. Even if your normal vision does not require correction for everyday tasks, you may find that long hours spent viewing a computer screen can cause considerable eye fatigue. When staring at closer objects, the ciliary muscle in our eye spasms back and forth to adjust. This strains the eye and makes it tired. Our lenses increase the magnification of our sight, ensuring the ciliary muscle does not overwork. The concept behind the lens is not to add magnification (although a slightly enlarged image is presented), but to move the eye’s focal point closer without using the eye muscles for accommodation. EXYRA Lens features:
Innovative Blue Light filter technology
UV++ protection
Increased visual contrast
Anti-fatigue
Anti-reflection
Anti-scratch
CLEAR LENSES AND STYLISH FRAMEWe understand that your look, your style and what it says about you is an important part of your personal image. We have created a stylish brand for computer glasses, featuring clear lenses and beautifully designed frames. EXYRA glasses allow you to enjoy benefits such as less eyestrain, enhanced color contrast and better performance while working on your computer – all the while looking good doing it.EXYRA LENS PERFORMANCEOur lenses block almost 70% of harmful light on the spectrum of 380-440 nm.Table of Wavelength (nm) vs Sample Transmission Data (%T)EXYRA Glasses put to the testIn the following video, test was conducted with 405 nm blue light laser. And you can see how effective EXYRA lenses blocking blue light in comparisson to a normal lenses.

<p>That is our core message to you. At some point in our lives, we all need a little push - that little reminder that we are more than capable of accomplishing so many great things and successfully pursuing and realizing our goals.

<p> </p>
<p>We launched RistBandz only a few short months ago - 5 months to be precise. Those last few months have been a great learning experience for us in terms of what we're trying to achieve. The feedback has been excellent and the people who have come across our wristbands really love them.</p>

<p><strong>But we'd love to do that as a team -</strong> <strong>with you</strong>. We would love for you to be a part of this process and look forward to building something great together. </p>
<p>We're currently undertaking a new reconstructive phase as a brand.</p>

<p>As we mentioned in the purpose section, the goal of this campaign is to continue growing this brand so we can continue to inspire you and others for years to come.</p>
<p>For us to successfully accomplish that goal we need to take into account our costs of operations and other administrative fees. The funds we receive from this campaign will help us alleviate some of those fees while we continue to ensure you get a quality product.</p>
<p>Here's summary on how we plan on using the funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing/Growing our product inventory</li>
<li>Shipping &amp; Delivery</li>
<li>Future Marketing campaigns</li>
<li> Cost of operations (Business, Legal &amp; Administrative)</li>
<li>Developing and expanding our content &amp; product distribution channels</li>
</ul>
<p>We also want to make you aware that our campaign will run for <strong>30 days (Feb-March)</strong>. Production will begin immediately after we receive the funds. Our estimated shipping date for all the products is early April. However if all runs smoothly, shipping might begin sooner than that. (<i>Please also refer to our Risk &amp; Challenges section further down the page.</i>)</p>

</div></div>","Remain Inspired, Stimulate your Talent!
That is our core message to you. At some point in our lives, we all need a little push - that little reminder that we are more than capable of accomplishing so many great things and successfully pursuing and realizing our goals. That's precisely the raison d’etre of RistBandz. Our wristbands (and all future products) are here to reaffirm what you already know about yourself - that you are indeed capable of anything.
Every time you wear one of our wristbands, the printed message instantly reminds you to go out and do something awesome, not only for yourself but for others as well. That was the spark behind our slogan, ""More Than Just a Wristband."" Our mission is to be a constant source of affirmation, inspiration, and motivation for others. That's why we're inviting you to flex your R.I.S.T. - Remain Inspired and Stimulate your Talent.
 

 
We launched RistBandz only a few short months ago - 5 months to be precise. Those last few months have been a great learning experience for us in terms of what we're trying to achieve. The feedback has been excellent and the people who have come across our wristbands really love them.
We're humbled by all the positive responses and believe this is the perfect opportunity for us to continue growing. 
But we'd love to do that as a team - with you. We would love for you to be a part of this process and look forward to building something great together. 
We're currently undertaking a new reconstructive phase as a brand.
The purpose of this campaign is to help us expand our reach, increase our catalog of wristbands and redesign our platforms in such a manner that we can continue to serve you with more Inspirational and Motivational content for years to come.
Please read on to Learn about our Stories and how we plan on truly serving you.
 

 






Our wristbands are not meant to only decorate your wrists but also elevate your mindset.
The current set of designs are based on a few of the messages that have inspired us up until this point and continue to remain the driving force behind everything we seek to accomplish as a motivational & inspirational brand.
 We believe you can relate to them too. Choose a wristband that speaks directly to who you are and rock it with pride!






We're also proud to introduce our first line of apparel currently exclusive only to our campaign backers.
Holding true to our brand statement and our values, we designed the ""ME"" t-shirt and the ""BE DFFRNT"" sweatshirt with you in mind - stark reminders that inspiration comes from within and what makes you different makes you unique.
Represent yourself like no one else would.


ALL OUR PERKS INCLUDE FREE SHIPPING WITHIN THE U.S (EXCLUSIVE ONLY TO OUR INDIEGOGO BACKERS)
 

As we mentioned in the purpose section, the goal of this campaign is to continue growing this brand so we can continue to inspire you and others for years to come.
For us to successfully accomplish that goal we need to take into account our costs of operations and other administrative fees. The funds we receive from this campaign will help us alleviate some of those fees while we continue to ensure you get a quality product.
Here's summary on how we plan on using the funds:

Manufacturing/Growing our product inventory
Shipping & Delivery
Future Marketing campaigns
 Cost of operations (Business, Legal & Administrative)
Developing and expanding our content & product distribution channels

We also want to make you aware that our campaign will run for 30 days (Feb-March). Production will begin immediately after we receive the funds. Our estimated shipping date for all the products is early April. However if all runs smoothly, shipping might begin sooner than that. (Please also refer to our Risk & Challenges section further down the page.)

 

We plan on using this platform and our campaign as the launching pad to build our community. 
A community that includes you, us and other driven individuals out there who know they have a bigger purpose in life and are ready to take on any challenges that come their way.
A community that not only inspires one another but one that also helps you realize that despite whatever internal struggles you may be facing right now, deep down, you have the driving force within yourself to manifest your goals.
That's why we need your help.
We have a vision and big plans for the future but none of that will be possible without you. We're humbled and beyond blessed to even have this opportunity before us but we know we couldn't have made it this far without the help we got from others.
So we kindly ask that you help support our campaign. Pick a wristband, a t-shirt, a sweatshirt or any other perk you see fit for you as we strive together to build a community that will make a difference - one wristband at a time.
 

We've already worked with our manufacturers to ensure the highest quality products. These manufacturers have decades of experience. We are also fully prepared to carry out the entire project successfully and deliver all the products on time.

We already have systems in place and a small but excellent team ready in place to ensure everything runs smoothly.
We've already created a small sample size of our products available on our site (yet to officially re-launch) and tested all our shipping models to make sure everything is intact. 
That said, sometimes unforeseen events might occur during the manufacturing process. As you may understand, these might be circumstances out of our control. Even if it is only minimal there are certain common factors that might cause a slight delay. However, we promise to send you updates at every step throughout the process so you remain fully informed till your items get to you.
 


We'd obviously love for you to support our campaign. But we'd also appreciate it if you help us spread the word. We'd love it if you told even just one person about our campaign and how to support us.

<h1> </h1>
<h1> Do you hate sorting and folding socks?<span>  Me too!</span>
</h1>
<p>My name is Jacob Dietle. I’m 14 years old, and this is the story about my new company, Snapz USA, which is bringing my designs to life.</p>
<p>I’m going to tell you about how I solved an age-old problem, how we’re going to benefit disadvantaged kids, how we’re launching this product at one of America's most famous retailers this holiday season, and how you can help, including how you can be part of my Advisory Board and meet all kinds of interesting entrepreneurs.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Sorting socks sucks!</h2>
<p>Doing laundry is one of my weekly chores and most definitely my least favorite part is sorting socks. You put socks in the washing machine, then the dryer, then you have a big pile of socks to sort through and attempt to match them. Of course, it almost always turns out that the Sock Zombies have stolen one or two socks so you’re left with extras.</p>
<p>Back to sorting... Colors have to match. Patterns have to match. It takes a long time and is about the most boring, biggest waste of time I can think of.</p>
<p>I spend twenty minutes folding jeans, shirts and underwear, and then it takes me two or three times longer to sort and fold the socks. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137199/files/20131016160007-a-jovis-jpg.jpg?1381964407"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Sorting socks sucks! Don’t you agree?</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>This is Snapz.</h2>
<p>It’s bad enough with just my socks, but I have two brothers. That’s a lot of socks every week. So I figured there must be a better way to deal with this sock thing. If I could just figure out a way to keep the socks together while being washed and dried, afterwards, they would already be sorted and ready to put in the dresser.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137196/files/20131016155832-Jacob-and-brothers.jpg?1381964312"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I tried multiple ways of keepings socks together: safety pins, chip clips, paper clips, folding, rubber bands, but nothing worked. </p>
<p>Then it hit me: if I could find a small, super strong means to snap them together, I could just take them off, snap them together, toss in the wash, put in the drier, then ---<i>viola!</i>---they’d already be connected and ready to be put back in the drawer.</p>
<p>I told my Mom about my idea and she said we needed to talk to her friend Bill Townsend who is an entrepreneur and chairman of <a href=""http://www.amatifoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amati Foundation</a>, a nonprofit focused on helping young people. Bill’s companies have sold for over $7 billion so I trusted that he knew what he was doing when it came to launching a product. Bill loved my idea and said that if I wanted to start a company around it, he and my Mom would help guide me. I thought this was a great idea: after all, who says a 14 year old can’t start a company, especially if I get good advisors?<span>  I’ll tell you about these advisors in a bit.</span></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h2>For now, let me tell you about Snapz!</h2>
<p>I like to design things in an effort to make them better. I began learning about sock manufacturing. I worked with manufacturers around the world until I found one that could make what I believe to be the best feeling socks available. Then I worked with <a href=""http://www.ykk-usa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">YKK,</a> the famous American zipper and snap company to create the specialized snaps that hold my socks together. I got samples made, then we tested them, then we made changes, then we tested them again, until finally we had socks that we loved.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137200/files/20131016160035-a-YKK.jpg?1381964435"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As you saw in my video, most socks are made of cotton, rubber and polyester which is cheap but doesn’t help with odor or wicking moisture away. I figured if I’m going to design socks and start a company around them, I don’t just want to make socks like everyone else; I want to make socks better. </p>
<p>I sought a way to make socks that would perform well but have environmental<br/>benefits, too.<span>  They have to be comfortable, long lasting, and whether they are dress socks or athletic socks, they have to control odor. Then I learned about bamboo and its anti-odor properties. I learned that viscose bamboo, when made from hard bamboo stalks, creates a cozy fiber that is soft and warm, yet helps wick moisture away, keeping your feet dry. </span>Viscose bamboo material has a soft and buttery feel and can absorb 3-4 times as much moisture as cotton. That means less odor. This is what makes bamboo perfect for socks. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137201/files/20131016160100-a-viscose-bamboo.jpg?1381964460"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Bamboo has a lot of other benefits so I decided that my socks had to have bamboo in them and when we got the test samples in, my hunch proved right. <strong><em>These socks are really, really comfortable!</em></strong> Plus, at the end of the day, you don’t have to worry about taking your shoes off and your socks stinking like they would if only made from cotton.</p>
<p>Did you know that bamboo is ecologically friendly to our planet?<span><span> </span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Bamboo requires no irrigation to grow because it thrives under natural rainfall. </li>
<li>A stand of bamboo creates 35% more oxygen than an equivalent stand of trees while absorbing 5 times the greenhouse gases. </li>
<li>It requires no chemical pesticides or fertilizers to grow because it naturally fights pests and lives great in many different natural settings, growing up to 47 inches in a single day once mature. </li>
<li>Bamboo does not need replanted after harvest because, unlike trees, bamboo will regrow right from the cut. </li>
<li>Due to the fact that bamboo roots stay in the ground when cut, it protects the soil from erosion and keeps it nutrient rich. </li>
</ol>
<p>Bamboo is a marvelous green alternative to help preserve the environment!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137203/files/20131016160123-a-jacob-in-bamboo.jpg?1381964483"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h2>Giving back to Americans in need.</h2>
<p>We can all agree the environment is important, and most companies would say that sourcing bamboo is a good enough way to give back. But I don’t want Snapz USA to be “good enough;” I want it to be “exceptional!” </p>
<p>I thought if I could do something to help other kids, this would be even more fun to do and something my friends would want to help me build.</p>
<p><strong><em>You know, lots of kids don’t have the basic necessities of a good pair of socks.</em></strong> </p>
<p>I learned this from talking to children’s charities. Something as simple as a pair of socks can make a difference in a disadvantaged kid’s life.</p>
<p>That is why I created the <strong>“Buy 3, Donate 1”</strong> program for Snaps USA. When consumers purchase a 3-pack of Snaps, whether in a retail store or online, they're not only getting a great sock that solves the whole sorting and folding mess, but they're helping put new socks on the feet of kids that may be economically disadvantaged, living in a homeless shelter, or just struggling to be able to put well-made clothes on their bodies. For every 3-pack sold, Snaps USA will donate another pair to disadvantaged kids.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137204/files/20131016160155-a-homeless-good.jpg?1381964515"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Next, because I also love music, I decided to give 5% of the company profits to Amati Foundation so that can continue buying musical instruments for kids who can’t afford them. In return, they agreed to underwrite all our corporate entity formation. Amati Foundation doesn't buy crummy musical instruments for their recipients, they get really good instruments that young people can use from school to college and into their careers. By supporting them, we can help thousands of kids gain access to music education which has been proven to help with cognitive ability. </p>
<p>It's like we're creating ""warm feet, warm minds"" and I can picture it now…a kid dancing around the room in their Snaps socks while playing violin. It will be like Tom Cruise’s underwear dance in Risky Business, but with a Bach Serenade instead of Bob Seger!<br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h2>A big launch for the holidays!</h2>
<p>This campaign isn’t about a concept. The product is finished. It works great. It’s ready to go to market. I just need your help to get it there.</p>
<p>Snapz socks have been tested through over 500 washings in both household and industrial washers and driers. They are proven to work. Now they are ready to be manufactured. Best of all, I have a great partner whom we intend to launch with for the 2013 holiday season…the world famous retailer Fred Segal.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137207/files/20131016160339-Fred-Segal-640w.jpg?1381964619"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><a href=""http://www.fredsegal.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Fred Segal </a>is an upscale Los Angeles, California based clothing retailer with two stores in Hollywood and Santa Monica. It has a long history of being ahead of trends: in 1960, Mr. Segal opened the world’s first jeans-only store. It grew to include other clothing, footwear and now restaurants and is expanding to Japan and Las Vegas.<span>  They’ve been featured in many TV shows and movies including <i>Entourage, Legally<br/>Blonde, The L Word, White Oleander, Beverly Hills 90210, Dawson’s Creek, Clueless, Maid To Order, </i>and<i> Less Than Zero. </i>Even the singer <a href=""http://www.pinkspage.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pink </a>has referenced Fred Segal in her songs. </span></p>
<p>I’m also meeting with major retailers to get them to sell Snapz after the launch at Fred Segal and envision selling these socks at places like Amazon.com, Sak’s, Barney’s, Macy’s, Kohl's, Target, Men’s Warehouse, JC Penney and specialty retailers around the world. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137236/files/20131016161741-Logos.jpg?1381965461"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The more retailers we line up, the better, because my goal is that by the time I graduate high school, Snaps USA will have donated 1,000,000 pairs of socks to needy kids.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h2>Why Snapz is on Indiegogo.</h2>
<p>Bill and Mom recommended I put together a group of advisors to guide my business. They said I needed to find people who could pitch in with their time and talents to help me grow this. I agreed.</p>
<p>One of the things we discussed was how we would fund the company. My Mom and Bill paid for the start-up costs to get to this point. Bill likes his socks so much he offered to fund the whole company, but we discussed the value of earning and protecting the lessons that come with and are needed in making a company succeed. That’s when I realized I wouldn’t learn anything if he just wrote a check for $100,000. I wanted to learn what it was like to be an entrepreneur and part of that is learning how to raise funds to launch this product. </p>
<p><strong>This campaign will give Snaps USA the funding required to go from samples to full scale production</strong>, including ordering materials, manufacturing, hiring salespeople, filing more patents, launching an e-commerce website, bringing Snapz to the masses and beginning to design more great products.</p>
<p>I picked Indiegogo because I like the concept of people pitching in to help create something in the fashion space, and with Snapz, when you pitch in, you not only help me launch the company, but you support our efforts to provide socks to disadvantaged children and musical instruments to deserving kids.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/137238/files/20131016161843-a-snaps-socks.jpg?1381965523"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h2>You can help me reach these goals. </h2>
<p>We need $64,000 to ramp up production and go to market. My advisors said if we raise $100,000 or more via this campaign, they will contribute another $100,000 for new products. What a great challenge!</p>
<p>But right now, I need your help to raise $64,000 to get our first shipments done and start selling through Fred Segal and online. And if we hit $100,000, that's all the better!</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h2>Snapz advisors.</h2>
<p>I have a great group of advisors that I have to tell you about. </p>
<p>First is the most important person in my life, my Mom, Lisa Lane Dietle. She’s an amazing woman! I got my desire to help others from her.

Brian knows more about the Department Store and Specialty Store channels of retail distribution than almost anybody in America so I’m really happy to have him be part of this. </span></p>
<p>Overseeing our budget---<i>and your donation</i>---is Katrina Yao, who is Sr. Director of Finance at the #2 pure play online retailer <a href=""http://www.newegg.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Newegg.com</a>. She is a Certified Public Accountant and Certified Internal Auditor and will oversee finance and auditing at Snaps USA.<span>  (by the way, Katrina has a son who also hates sorting socks.)</span></p>
<p>Can you believe a 14 year old has gotten such a great group of people together to help make this a success? <strong>You know what the secret is?</strong> I told them about the product and asked them to help. Brian said, ""I can't believe I didn't think of this!"" and Shelley said it was ""brilliant!"" I am very thankful for their help and expertise. </p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h2>This is just the start.</h2>
<p>So there you have it: the story of Snaps and how I went from 40 minutes of sock sorting to less than 5 minutes while creating a great feeling, long-lasting product that helps the environment while also helping clothe and support disadvantaged kids.</p>
<p><strong>Now it is up to you.</strong> <b>Please consider supporting my project and product. I think it’s a winner and by helping, you can be among the first to have the pleasure of wearing and washing---and not having to sort---Snapz.</b></p>
<p>You can help me promote this project, too. Will you please put a link to this campaign on your Facebook page or tweet it on Twitter.  Just paste this url:   <b><a href=""http://igg.me/at/snapzsocks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://igg.me/at/snapzsocks</a></b></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Give Snaps a try. I thank you, our ecosystem thanks you, and tens of thousands of kids will thank you, too.</span></p>

My name is Jacob Dietle. I’m 14 years old, and this is the story about my new company, Snapz USA, which is bringing my designs to life.
I’m going to tell you about how I solved an age-old problem, how we’re going to benefit disadvantaged kids, how we’re launching this product at one of America's most famous retailers this holiday season, and how you can help, including how you can be part of my Advisory Board and meet all kinds of interesting entrepreneurs.
 
Sorting socks sucks!
Doing laundry is one of my weekly chores and most definitely my least favorite part is sorting socks. You put socks in the washing machine, then the dryer, then you have a big pile of socks to sort through and attempt to match them. Of course, it almost always turns out that the Sock Zombies have stolen one or two socks so you’re left with extras.
Back to sorting... Colors have to match. Patterns have to match. It takes a long time and is about the most boring, biggest waste of time I can think of.
I spend twenty minutes folding jeans, shirts and underwear, and then it takes me two or three times longer to sort and fold the socks. 

Sorting socks sucks! Don’t you agree?
 
This is Snapz.
It’s bad enough with just my socks, but I have two brothers. That’s a lot of socks every week. So I figured there must be a better way to deal with this sock thing. If I could just figure out a way to keep the socks together while being washed and dried, afterwards, they would already be sorted and ready to put in the dresser.

I tried multiple ways of keepings socks together: safety pins, chip clips, paper clips, folding, rubber bands, but nothing worked. 
Then it hit me: if I could find a small, super strong means to snap them together, I could just take them off, snap them together, toss in the wash, put in the drier, then ---viola!---they’d already be connected and ready to be put back in the drawer.
I told my Mom about my idea and she said we needed to talk to her friend Bill Townsend who is an entrepreneur and chairman of Amati Foundation, a nonprofit focused on helping young people. Bill’s companies have sold for over $7 billion so I trusted that he knew what he was doing when it came to launching a product. Bill loved my idea and said that if I wanted to start a company around it, he and my Mom would help guide me. I thought this was a great idea: after all, who says a 14 year old can’t start a company, especially if I get good advisors?  I’ll tell you about these advisors in a bit.

For now, let me tell you about Snapz!
I like to design things in an effort to make them better. I began learning about sock manufacturing. I worked with manufacturers around the world until I found one that could make what I believe to be the best feeling socks available. Then I worked with YKK, the famous American zipper and snap company to create the specialized snaps that hold my socks together. I got samples made, then we tested them, then we made changes, then we tested them again, until finally we had socks that we loved.

As you saw in my video, most socks are made of cotton, rubber and polyester which is cheap but doesn’t help with odor or wicking moisture away. I figured if I’m going to design socks and start a company around them, I don’t just want to make socks like everyone else; I want to make socks better. 
I sought a way to make socks that would perform well but have environmentalbenefits, too.  They have to be comfortable, long lasting, and whether they are dress socks or athletic socks, they have to control odor. Then I learned about bamboo and its anti-odor properties. I learned that viscose bamboo, when made from hard bamboo stalks, creates a cozy fiber that is soft and warm, yet helps wick moisture away, keeping your feet dry. Viscose bamboo material has a soft and buttery feel and can absorb 3-4 times as much moisture as cotton. That means less odor. This is what makes bamboo perfect for socks. 

Bamboo has a lot of other benefits so I decided that my socks had to have bamboo in them and when we got the test samples in, my hunch proved right. These socks are really, really comfortable! Plus, at the end of the day, you don’t have to worry about taking your shoes off and your socks stinking like they would if only made from cotton.
Did you know that bamboo is ecologically friendly to our planet? 


Bamboo requires no irrigation to grow because it thrives under natural rainfall. 
A stand of bamboo creates 35% more oxygen than an equivalent stand of trees while absorbing 5 times the greenhouse gases. 
It requires no chemical pesticides or fertilizers to grow because it naturally fights pests and lives great in many different natural settings, growing up to 47 inches in a single day once mature. 
Bamboo does not need replanted after harvest because, unlike trees, bamboo will regrow right from the cut. 
Due to the fact that bamboo roots stay in the ground when cut, it protects the soil from erosion and keeps it nutrient rich. 

Bamboo is a marvelous green alternative to help preserve the environment!


Giving back to Americans in need.
We can all agree the environment is important, and most companies would say that sourcing bamboo is a good enough way to give back. But I don’t want Snapz USA to be “good enough;” I want it to be “exceptional!” 
I thought if I could do something to help other kids, this would be even more fun to do and something my friends would want to help me build.
You know, lots of kids don’t have the basic necessities of a good pair of socks. 
I learned this from talking to children’s charities. Something as simple as a pair of socks can make a difference in a disadvantaged kid’s life.
That is why I created the “Buy 3, Donate 1” program for Snaps USA. When consumers purchase a 3-pack of Snaps, whether in a retail store or online, they're not only getting a great sock that solves the whole sorting and folding mess, but they're helping put new socks on the feet of kids that may be economically disadvantaged, living in a homeless shelter, or just struggling to be able to put well-made clothes on their bodies. For every 3-pack sold, Snaps USA will donate another pair to disadvantaged kids.

Next, because I also love music, I decided to give 5% of the company profits to Amati Foundation so that can continue buying musical instruments for kids who can’t afford them. In return, they agreed to underwrite all our corporate entity formation. Amati Foundation doesn't buy crummy musical instruments for their recipients, they get really good instruments that young people can use from school to college and into their careers. By supporting them, we can help thousands of kids gain access to music education which has been proven to help with cognitive ability. 
It's like we're creating ""warm feet, warm minds"" and I can picture it now…a kid dancing around the room in their Snaps socks while playing violin. It will be like Tom Cruise’s underwear dance in Risky Business, but with a Bach Serenade instead of Bob Seger!

A big launch for the holidays!
This campaign isn’t about a concept. The product is finished. It works great. It’s ready to go to market. I just need your help to get it there.
Snapz socks have been tested through over 500 washings in both household and industrial washers and driers. They are proven to work. Now they are ready to be manufactured. Best of all, I have a great partner whom we intend to launch with for the 2013 holiday season…the world famous retailer Fred Segal.

Fred Segal is an upscale Los Angeles, California based clothing retailer with two stores in Hollywood and Santa Monica. It has a long history of being ahead of trends: in 1960, Mr. Segal opened the world’s first jeans-only store. It grew to include other clothing, footwear and now restaurants and is expanding to Japan and Las Vegas.  They’ve been featured in many TV shows and movies including Entourage, LegallyBlonde, The L Word, White Oleander, Beverly Hills 90210, Dawson’s Creek, Clueless, Maid To Order, and Less Than Zero. Even the singer Pink has referenced Fred Segal in her songs. 
I’m also meeting with major retailers to get them to sell Snapz after the launch at Fred Segal and envision selling these socks at places like Amazon.com, Sak’s, Barney’s, Macy’s, Kohl's, Target, Men’s Warehouse, JC Penney and specialty retailers around the world. 

The more retailers we line up, the better, because my goal is that by the time I graduate high school, Snaps USA will have donated 1,000,000 pairs of socks to needy kids.

Why Snapz is on Indiegogo.
Bill and Mom recommended I put together a group of advisors to guide my business. They said I needed to find people who could pitch in with their time and talents to help me grow this. I agreed.
One of the things we discussed was how we would fund the company. My Mom and Bill paid for the start-up costs to get to this point. Bill likes his socks so much he offered to fund the whole company, but we discussed the value of earning and protecting the lessons that come with and are needed in making a company succeed. That’s when I realized I wouldn’t learn anything if he just wrote a check for $100,000. I wanted to learn what it was like to be an entrepreneur and part of that is learning how to raise funds to launch this product. 
This campaign will give Snaps USA the funding required to go from samples to full scale production, including ordering materials, manufacturing, hiring salespeople, filing more patents, launching an e-commerce website, bringing Snapz to the masses and beginning to design more great products.
I picked Indiegogo because I like the concept of people pitching in to help create something in the fashion space, and with Snapz, when you pitch in, you not only help me launch the company, but you support our efforts to provide socks to disadvantaged children and musical instruments to deserving kids.


You can help me reach these goals. 
We need $64,000 to ramp up production and go to market. My advisors said if we raise $100,000 or more via this campaign, they will contribute another $100,000 for new products. What a great challenge!
But right now, I need your help to raise $64,000 to get our first shipments done and start selling through Fred Segal and online. And if we hit $100,000, that's all the better!

Snapz advisors.
I have a great group of advisors that I have to tell you about. 
First is the most important person in my life, my Mom, Lisa Lane Dietle. She’s an amazing woman! I got my desire to help others from her. She received a service award by Dependency Court Los Angeles, CA for her public service and is always looking for ways to help others. She has worked for P&G, Jockey, and started Agent of Change where she works with companies like Hillsides, Crystals Garment, Leland Zales, Chrislie Formulations. Mom is my rock and foundation and is always encouraging me to think big.
Bill Townsend is an entrepreneur, author, and, tech and advertising veteran. He has been involved in launching or managing some of the biggest names in the Internet including Lycos, GeoCities (now Yahoo!), Deja.com (now ebay and Google), and Newegg.com. He knows a lot about attracting customers, having been involved in several successful products including P90X, Tony Horton’s Ten Minute Trainer, TurboJam, Insanity, TeamBeachbody, Jeunesse Global, Carbonixx, GoCards, and Beyond The Wall retail stores.  He also has lots of experience in working inEurope and Asia. Bill knows technology and the Internet so he’s going to be of greathelp as we move into e-commerce and social media.
Shelley Sarmiento is the founder of Little White Fashion Truck which brings unique and different clothing products to consumers through her fleet of, you guessed it, little white fashion trucks which are marketed exclusively through social media. She was cofounder of the 103-store chain White House/Black Market, which was sold to the leading women’s retailer Chico’s. She also teaches at the Fashion Institute of Technology and is full of great ideas!
Brian Kelner is a veteran of the fashion and accessories industry.  For over 20 years he has been a sales representative for companies like Christian Dior men’s hosiery (or socks, as I call them), Isotoner gloves and slippers, and Docker/Levi small leather goods.  He is president of Kelner Merchandising Network (KMN), and Solebury  Software. KMN is a national third party store service company, specializing in men's and ladies accessories and furnishings, and Solebury Software is a Software as a Service (SAAS) company specializing in scheduling and reporting for Field Service Organizations. Brian knows more about the Department Store and Specialty Store channels of retail distribution than almost anybody in America so I’m really happy to have him be part of this. 
Overseeing our budget---and your donation---is Katrina Yao, who is Sr. Director of Finance at the #2 pure play online retailer Newegg.com. She is a Certified Public Accountant and Certified Internal Auditor and will oversee finance and auditing at Snaps USA.  (by the way, Katrina has a son who also hates sorting socks.)
Can you believe a 14 year old has gotten such a great group of people together to help make this a success? You know what the secret is? I told them about the product and asked them to help. Brian said, ""I can't believe I didn't think of this!"" and Shelley said it was ""brilliant!"" I am very thankful for their help and expertise. 

This is just the start.
So there you have it: the story of Snaps and how I went from 40 minutes of sock sorting to less than 5 minutes while creating a great feeling, long-lasting product that helps the environment while also helping clothe and support disadvantaged kids.
Now it is up to you. Please consider supporting my project and product. I think it’s a winner and by helping, you can be among the first to have the pleasure of wearing and washing---and not having to sort---Snapz.
You can help me promote this project, too. Will you please put a link to this campaign on your Facebook page or tweet it on Twitter.  Just paste this url:   http://igg.me/at/snapzsocks
Give Snaps a try. I thank you, our ecosystem thanks you, and tens of thousands of kids will thank you, too.
-- Jacob

</div></div>","When I was a student I was poor, 
 I remember this, like it was yesterday, 
I bought only things I had to buy, Everything else is out of the question. 
In my heart I knew that for me it's a temporary situation, and yet the feeling burned within me. This sense of disability. An inability to achieve the things I want, thanks to that I understood the feelings of the needy.
 
In addition, during this period I was about to get married, so I decided to take one of my gowns from Yad Abraham  Foundation
 (which was quite new at the time). 
I chose a dress and I got it immediately , I have to say that they made ​​me feel like I was in the store  buying my wedding dress ...

















For me it's closure, this is the opportunity for me to give what I have, andas a fashion designer, I want to contribute as much as Abraham handdresses, shoes, accessories, so that many brides who are now in a position where I was, will receive a free wedding dress.We'll do it together, together we can change the world.

</div></div>","“We are designers, why don’t we design something for ourselves?” – We asked each other when we couldn’t find a stylish and functional bicycle basket for our everyday commute. As designers, and as bike riders, we imagined a unique carrying accessory that is more than just a regular basket. Besides being functional we wanted it to become an important part of our style too.That’s how the PaperSpokes crates were born.NOW WE NEED YOUR HELP THAT WE CAN START MANUFACTURING THE PRODUCTS!


We designed two customizable wooden bicycles crates that fit into the everyday need of the urban cyclers: one bigger sized, the ZIGZAG, and a smaller square shaped, the SPOTTY. They don’t just look amazingly beautiful, they are functional as well. 


ZIGZAG is our bigger, rectangular crate with fixed shock cord. 


SPOTTY is our smaller, square shaped crate with rearrangeable shock cord. The position of the cord can be easily changed, the holes on the crate give wild range of possibility. 
















Besides the high-quality materials we were keen on the details too, these make our crates real design products. The crates are registered design products in the European Union.










The PaperSpokes crates are made of locally sourced special wood that stands up to both the sun and the rain. No chemicals were used during manufacturing, the products are repairable and recyclable, and completely eco-friendly.






We wanted to add something extra that our product can offer. We wove a light-reflecting fiber in our elastic shock cords, thus they are perfect to help you with visibility at night.







The PaperSpokes crates are for everyday urban use: commute to work, go shopping, meet friends. 
The SPOTTY is ideal for those, who love the variability. Everything important fits in, and it’s still a lovable size. The ZIGZAG is for cyclists, who love classic design and carry larger items. Their shock cords can fasten any object into the crate, or even on the outside surface of it.




You can fix both of the crates onto your own bike rack, either you choose the front or the back.








You can fix the crates to your own bicycle luggage rack with our mounting device, which is included to the crates.

Which bicycle luggage racks will they fit?

You don’t have luggage rack on your bicycle? No problem, simply order one online, or choose one from your local bike shop.

 













(No luggage rack is included to the crates.)

always the goal.  Well that time is now, and the first step is to
make some seriously awesome bow ties.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1032722/files/20141120105637-Modern_Armor_for_the_Urban_Warrior.png?1416509797"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b></b></p><p><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1032719/files/20141120105545-Banner_-_The_Bow_Ties.png?1416509745"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I hand-make each bow tie
from a mix of anodized aluminum and EPDM rubber rings.  The result is
a lightweight, soft bow tie that's completely unique.  The first one
that I made was such a hit, I knew that I had to make more of them. 
I've received a lot of good feedback and advice while making my
initial patterns, and have worked and reworked them until I was able
to make a comfortable, easy to wear tie without sacrificing any
design capability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this run, I've created
eight initial patterns for people to choose from, and have broken
them down into two categories: Standard and Premier.</p><p><br/></p>

</div>","UPDATE 2: I did an interview with Good Day Sacramento! We talked about chainmail and bow ties.  You can check it out here: http://gooddaysacramento.cbslocal.com/video/109...UPDATE 1:  Due to popular demand, hair bows are now available!  They're the same as the Standard or Premier bow ties, but you'll be able to pick that option when the post-campaign survey goes out in December!
That's the philosophy behind
Chained Beauty Designs; to create new, fashionable, eye-catching
pieces using old-world techniques.  
My name is Peter, and I've
been making chainmail for five years.  When I started to get serious
about my craft, the idea to make unique, never before seen pieces was
always the goal.  Well that time is now, and the first step is to
make some seriously awesome bow ties.
I hand-make each bow tie
from a mix of anodized aluminum and EPDM rubber rings.  The result is
a lightweight, soft bow tie that's completely unique.  The first one
that I made was such a hit, I knew that I had to make more of them. 
I've received a lot of good feedback and advice while making my
initial patterns, and have worked and reworked them until I was able
to make a comfortable, easy to wear tie without sacrificing any
design capability.

For this run, I've created
eight initial patterns for people to choose from, and have broken
them down into two categories: Standard and Premier.





There are nine different
colors to choose from, and each bow tie is made from up to two
different colors.  That's a lot of different combinations, making for
some unique bow ties.



*Colors
can vary slightly from batch to batch, such as one orange turning out
a little brighter, or a purple having more blue hue in it*


Each bow tie normally comes
with an band made from soft, double-lined elastic.  The kind that
wont pinch so it's comfortable to wear against the skin.  
However, a bow tie can be
upgraded to a chainmail band by adding $5 to your pledge.  This is
just to cover the cost of materials and extra construction time for
the band itself.  The chainmail will be a bit more durable than the
elastic, but both are equally comfortable to easy to put on.You can also choose to have your bow tie made into a hair clip, at no additional cost.  The clips are woven into the bow itself, to keep it strong and reinforce it enough to hold the bow in place.

A survey will go out after the campaign is finished, in order to find out what colors/designs everyone wants, and you'll be able to pick your preferred attachment then.


Custom Bow TiesThere are a few reward tiers
that give you the option of creating your own bow tie.  Each one of
these will have the chainmail strap (because you're awesome), and can
incorporate as many colors as you'd like.  I'll be in constant
communication with everyone that chooses one of these.  Because each
one will be made using a unique design, they will take a bit longer
to get out to everyone.

	Treasure Box
One of the things I've
worked a lot with is Structured Chainmail, i.e. 3-Dimensional

people a custom chainmail box that will fit their bow tie in it.  I'm

<p></p></span></div>","Shadow Heart by HIROYUKI is innovative jewelry that elegantly casts a silhouette of the heart symbol.

It is a special gift, especially for the one you love or for yourself. There is no greater force than love, and the Shadow Heart speaks to this love in a charming way. Love is invisible, but felt even in the absence of another's embrace. It's an eternal link, binding two hearts. Unseen, but ever present. As you or a loved one wears the Shadow Heart, you feel the love of its shadow.


The best time to see The Shadow heart.




Facing the sun on a sunny day, between the hours of 11am and 2pm, will create the perfect heart silhouette. It can also been seen when standing under a bright light. 

The Origin of the Shadow heart
I have designed products all over the world including Japan, Korea, China, UK and the USA. As a designer, I have a dream to create objects that evoke emotion. Jewelry is the is perfect subject to make that dream come true. For me, the challenge of designing jewelry was not just creating the shape, but portraying it’s meaning in a unique way. The concept of the Shadow Heart is to cast the silhouette of a heart from an object, making it a better representation of love. It is present and felt, but not always seen.

<p>Hey Indiegogo! We’ve all had this problem before. It’s the end of a grueling workday or a fun night out. You’ve been looking good rocking those heels but now all you want to do is kick back and relax. Wouldn’t it be great if you had a pair of on-the-go comfortable flats to slip into?</p>
<h3><strong>Introducing the FlipSlip! The 2<sup>nd</sup> pair that EVERY woman needs.</strong></h3>
<p>Say ""Goodbye"" to walking the city streets barefoot, and say ""Hello"" to a relieving stroll back to the car, or walk home.</p>
<h3><strong>What are FlipSlips?</strong></h3>
<p>FlipSlips are The World’s First and ONLY compact shoes to fold sole-to-sole. They can be conveniently taken anywhere. We’ve worked hard to design a shoe that folds down to the size of an iPhone to easily fit into a small purse or pocket, perfectly within arm’s reach for when that moment comes along. You’ll be relieved knowing that unbelievable comfort is just a Flip Slip away!</p>
<p>The patented technology is simple and easily folds or unfolds in mere seconds!</p>
<p>Thanks to its hygienic design, The FlipSlip is the ONLY shoe on the market to fold sole-to-sole which means all the dirty parts are kept inside.</p>
<p>Its slim design allows it to be taken everywhere. It’s quality neoprene upper makes it waterproof, yet breathable for all occasions. The padded, foam cushion insole makes walking a comforting breeze.</p>
<p>Flip Slip is TRULY an all-purpose shoe and we love it!</p>
<h3><strong>We’ve come a long way to get to this point and wish to spread the love and joy we’ve experienced with others even more. </strong></h3>
<p>One of the next steps to achieve this is to create new designs to satisfy the growing demand’s different tastes! We understand that this is going to take time, money, and plenty of help from those around us and this is what brings us to IndieGoGo and our Community Design Project!</p>
<p>We strongly believe that the solution lies in working with our supportive communities and enriching the lives of others. We launched the Community Design Project to increase the designs in our collection and are doing so by actively involving the creative artist community in the process.</p>
<h3><strong>We called on artists from all over the U.S. to help us create the newest Flip Slip Foldable Shoes Collection. </strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Community Design"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1199.photobucket.com/albums/aa475/eflatto/Slide05.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Community Design""/></strong></p>
<p>They each had a couple of weeks to create the design and build a prototype and were given our pre-existing design to use as the base. In exchange, they received an opportunity to have fun sharing their talent with the world, receive full recognition for their work, learn about the process behind making shoes, as well as get a chance to be fairly compensated along the way; each artist will receive 25% percent of the profit from their designs. A golden opportunity during such tough economic times.</p>

<p><img alt=""helping others"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1199.photobucket.com/albums/aa475/eflatto/Slide06.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>About Metallic Strappers:</p>
<p>Artist RaymondCho wanted to put the straps in a much more fashion forward way using thinner straps and placing them along the back and wrapping the ankle of the foot.  This metallic finish can come in gold or silver or copper or colors that utilize metallic material. Features a bit of a point for a more interesting and fashion-forward look. The backing that supports the strap can come up 1 inch - 2 inches as long as it sits just on the ankle or above it. This shoe can be worn with a cocktail dress after a party to show off straps or with any shorter bottom piece in any other occasion to best show off the full design of the shoe. </p>

<p>Sunkiss: Main focus of the design was color and print. The orange satin on both the toe and the heel give it a chic look with the help of the bow which makes it playful. The print has a hint of orange which ties the shoe together and makes it kind of uniformed. The medallion in the middle gives the shoe a little attitude and conservativeness at the same time.</p>

</div></div>","It all started with a simple idea, a dream to make the World a better place...
FlipSlips are foldable designer flats on the go that can easily fit into a small purse or a pocket. We have reduced the shoe to the size of an iPhone and made it fold so that it doesn't get your belongings dirty.

The FlipSlip's Unique Patented Technology is the only shoe that folds sole-to-sole and has a reversible upper so it is compressible and hygienic.

 

 
FLIP SLIP DESIGN PROJECT ON INDIEGOGO
WATCH OUR PRESENTATION ON YOUTUBE: http://youtu.be/w3uuwEhkCfs

Hey Indiegogo! We’ve all had this problem before. It’s the end of a grueling workday or a fun night out. You’ve been looking good rocking those heels but now all you want to do is kick back and relax. Wouldn’t it be great if you had a pair of on-the-go comfortable flats to slip into?
Introducing the FlipSlip! The 2nd pair that EVERY woman needs.
Say ""Goodbye"" to walking the city streets barefoot, and say ""Hello"" to a relieving stroll back to the car, or walk home.
What are FlipSlips?
FlipSlips are The World’s First and ONLY compact shoes to fold sole-to-sole. They can be conveniently taken anywhere. We’ve worked hard to design a shoe that folds down to the size of an iPhone to easily fit into a small purse or pocket, perfectly within arm’s reach for when that moment comes along. You’ll be relieved knowing that unbelievable comfort is just a Flip Slip away!
The patented technology is simple and easily folds or unfolds in mere seconds!
Thanks to its hygienic design, The FlipSlip is the ONLY shoe on the market to fold sole-to-sole which means all the dirty parts are kept inside.
Its slim design allows it to be taken everywhere. It’s quality neoprene upper makes it waterproof, yet breathable for all occasions. The padded, foam cushion insole makes walking a comforting breeze.
Flip Slip is TRULY an all-purpose shoe and we love it!
We’ve come a long way to get to this point and wish to spread the love and joy we’ve experienced with others even more. 
One of the next steps to achieve this is to create new designs to satisfy the growing demand’s different tastes! We understand that this is going to take time, money, and plenty of help from those around us and this is what brings us to IndieGoGo and our Community Design Project!
We strongly believe that the solution lies in working with our supportive communities and enriching the lives of others. We launched the Community Design Project to increase the designs in our collection and are doing so by actively involving the creative artist community in the process.
We called on artists from all over the U.S. to help us create the newest Flip Slip Foldable Shoes Collection. 


They each had a couple of weeks to create the design and build a prototype and were given our pre-existing design to use as the base. In exchange, they received an opportunity to have fun sharing their talent with the world, receive full recognition for their work, learn about the process behind making shoes, as well as get a chance to be fairly compensated along the way; each artist will receive 25% percent of the profit from their designs. A golden opportunity during such tough economic times.
 

But in order to truly make this a success, we need your help! Although this is a competition, with your help – ALL designs that meet our factory minimums will be made. All the artists can win. All of us can take one step towards achieving our dreams – together.

So this brings us to our next “step,” which is explaining in more detail, the benefits of supporting this campaign.
For as low as $20, you can get the ultra compact SLIM-Flips --- it has a soft foldable sole, and it’s great for emergency back-up use. You will also get an invitation to our San Francisco Launch Party in August and make a charitable donation to Kiva.org, a non-profit on a mission to alleviate poverty by empowering entrepreneurs through micro-loans.

 
For $35, you can also get our Classic Flip Slips in your choice of 32 different colors! You will have a chance to vote on the top 5 colors, and ALL of our shoes come with an expandable Flip-Tote bag to carry your other shoes in.
Starting at $49, you can take part in our Community Design Project and support our fellow designers:
There are 3 categories, which are The Embellished Collection, The Shoe Aficionado Collection, and The LUX Collection.
You can take a look at our Designer Gallery to see each one and learn more about each design and artist. Please Hurry! The first 200 purchases for each category will receive a 15% discount on their order.
For those who can’t decide, we also have a MYSTERY Shoe that will be the first design and category to reach 200+ pairs. Purchasing the MYSTERY design will also include a pair of SLIM-Flips as a thank you for your support.
We want to bring you a high-quality, handcrafted replica of the original artwork made by each artist. Our factory is ready to go and we already have all the molds and everything we need to get going. The only thing that we need to get going is money.
So how does this work exactly? 

It’s simple. You donate. You get a pair and in turn, help us meet our fundraising goal of $20,000+ for this to be a smashing success. As an added bonus, by pre-ordering a pair of our designer shoes, you’ll also get to take part in the entire creative process and provide feedback on the final design, as well as receive photos and be kept posted on the progress of your shoes.
We are seeking Retailers and Distributors to help us SPREAD the love even more!
If you’re as excited as we are, and want to really make a difference in our campaign, become a distributor, where you will be THE FIRST to get 12+ pairs of FlipSlips at wholesale price before they hit stores! They also make for GREAT gifts.
Anyone, Designers or Sponsors alike, will also have the option to create their own design with our FlipSlip Technology and receive 200 pairs of customized shoes.

Join Us.
We’re always on the lookout for passionate individuals and calling on artists to help with our project. If you want to join our team and work together to achieve our dreams, e-mail us at info@flipslip.com
We hope you’ll love FlipSlips as much as we do. REMEMBER: There are two BIG ways you can support us, you can Like us on Facebook and [SPREAD] the word to all your friends about our project, or donate and receive a pair of our shoes!
Thanks Indiegogo! We’ll see you on the Flip Side!

This shoe can be worn with a cocktail dress after a party to show off straps or with any shorter bottom piece in any other occasion to best show off the full design of the shoe.

Who
I'm a Brazilian designer based in Milan specialized in watch design. I have made designs for a lot of brands over the last 8 years and now I'm here to present my own brand the COPACABANA.
Want to see some of my works go here: www.rsmiranda.com
I produced a small quantity of watches just with the Brazilian flag to present in the Milan design week. You can see this model under.



Goals
What I would like to reach is to produce a lot of more watches to sell during the next soccer world cup, with the flags of all the countries that will be playing the for the cup.
The more funds we get the more watches we will produce, we will need 25.000 to produce a good quantities of watches and to pay the moulding costs.

What
Copacabana watch is a quartz 3 hands watch with interchangeable silicone straps and 3ATM water resistance, the design was based on the Brazilians flip flops.  You can chose the watch with the flag you like.
 






 
When
First delivery with the Country you choose will be made at the end of July beginning of August (depends the country you live for delivery issues)
Second delivery (perk for the GROUP STAGE and ALL COUNTRIES MODELS) will be made at the beginning of 2014, after the World Cup's qualification process has end (19 November) and the withdraw of groups have been made.
 



You
Contribute and get the watches you choose. If your country is playing in the world cup we will do the watch even if you don't see it here under. If you like to have your country version image please right to us. note that we decide to make 3 models for each country.

<p><strong>For the Love of Earthbags (F.L.O.E.)</strong> is an interactive design project that aims to prove that it’s possible to approach high-design in a manner that is tasteful, modern, and groundbreaking by using only the most basic materials, such as the dirt beneath our feet.</p>
<p>This project is an initiative led by architect Travis Hughbanks and supported by Edge of Seven (<a href=""http://www.edgeofseven.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.edgeofseven.org</a>) and Architecture for Humanity Denver in partnership with the local community of Basa, Nepal. The final product will be a higher secondary school in the village of Basa, Nepal. The school is one of VERY few high schools in the region and will allow students to achieve a higher secondary education in a safe, environmentally friendly building close to home!</p>
<p>Edge of Seven is a nonprofit organization that generates awareness and volunteer support for projects that invest in education, health and economic opportunity for girls in developing countries. According to the World Bank, 30 percent of Nepalis live in poverty and this population is most concentrated in rural areas where people survive off of agriculture and subsistence farming. For Edge of Seven, earthbags offered an opportunity to improve rural educational infrastructure and combat poverty in the most low-cost, efficient and sustainable way possible.</p>
<p><strong>How will the funding be spent? </strong>The money raised through this campaign will be used for supplies to create the earthbag school, educational tools, and the production of the graphic materials.</p>
<p>F.L.O.E.’s end goal is to elevate the practice of earthbag construction by producing several engaging and creative educational materials that will be used both to promote earthbag construction and teach local residents how to build with this method. The materials to be produced are an animated video and a graphic print manual.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.edgeofseven.org/Poster/Graphics%20Body.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>These resources will be heavy on simple, culturally-neutral, step-by-step graphics so that they can be easily understood by anyone and easily translated into different languages. After production, they will be made available to the public for free on the web under Creative Commons licensing.</p>

<p>To gather content for the production of the F.L.O.E. materials, we will build a prototype earthbag building in rural Nepal that will be turned over to the local community upon completion for use as a higher secondary school. In addition to the educational materials we will produce for mass distribution, we will also inlay a plaque containing graphics that outline step-by-step instructions for earthbag construction in to one of the building’s walls so the structure itself will act as an educational resource.</p>

<p>While most people aren’t familiar with earthbag construction, those who are will probably conjure images of a “yurt-like” structure at its mention.

<p><strong>Why build with earthbags? What are the benefits?</strong></p>
<p>The benefits to building with earthbags are:</p>
<p>â—      <strong>It’s environmentally-friendly, sustainable, and draws on locally-available materials</strong>: For most earthbag buildings, it’s possible to use the dirt and stone excavated from the building site as the filler for the earthbags. What you dig out of the earth, you put back into the building. Low-waste. Simple.</p>
<p>â—      <strong>It’s cheaper than traditional methods</strong>: The main building materials used in earthbag construction are polypropolene bags and dirt, both of which are extremely affordable. Using locally-harvested stone and dirt reduces material transportation costs. Because the building method is so simple, it requires practically no skilled labor. Anyone with minimal training can build with earthbags.</p>
<p>â—      <strong>It’s sturdy and earthquake-resistant</strong>: Just picture how a building made of 16-inch-wide bags filled with loose dirt would react during an earthquake in comparison to one built of stone and mortar. Where the latter would easily break apart during a tremor, earthbags have more flexibility and less rigidity and are better able to absorb shock.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.edgeofseven.org/Poster/EARTHBAG-DIAGRAM.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why Nepal?</strong></p>
<p>We chose the Solukhumbu Region of Nepal for the prototype build, because it is a country with a need for better earthquake-resistant buildings. The Himalayas were rocked by a magnitude 6.9 earthquake in September 2011, which destroyed many community buildings and homes in the Everest Region of Nepal, highlighting the inadequacies in the country’s infrastructure. Nepal is a place that stands to benefit greatly from not only gaining knowledge of more disaster-proof building techniques, but also from gaining knowledge of cheaper building techniques.</p>

<p><strong>    It's simple! I consider a bow tie a unique and very special accessory. </strong>It has always been a symbol of solemnity, some kind of romanticism and sometimes even impudence. <strong>Not for nothing among its fans are the Playboy rabbit and the most charming spy - James Bond. </strong></p>
<p>    So why do they lose their relevance today? Sadly, but nowadays you can meet a man in a bow tie only in a photo! </p>
<p>    I think that the reason lies in the lack of decent design variations. Although many accessories have been evolved and there were interesting modern matches and combinations of materials, but any of them apply to a bow tie. They seem to be stuck in time. Of course, you can meet attempts to modernize this accessory, but for some reasons most of them aren’t successful. </p>
<p>    That's why I'm sure this is an excellent challenge for our team! Since we just love difficulties! Let's restore the popularity of this accessory! <strong>What is pleasant, our backers say that we are doing very well. The faithful fans of this accessory cannot be mistaken!</strong></p>

I consider a bow tie a unique and very special accessory. It has always been a symbol of solemnity, some kind of romanticism and sometimes even impudence. Not for nothing among its fans are the Playboy rabbit and the most charming spy - James Bond. 
    So why do they lose their relevance today? Sadly, but nowadays you can meet a man in a bow tie only in a photo! 
    I think that the reason lies in the lack of decent design variations. Although many accessories have been evolved and there were interesting modern matches and combinations of materials, but any of them apply to a bow tie. They seem to be stuck in time. Of course, you can meet attempts to modernize this accessory, but for some reasons most of them aren’t successful. 
    That's why I'm sure this is an excellent challenge for our team! Since we just love difficulties! Let's restore the popularity of this accessory! What is pleasant, our backers say that we are doing very well. The faithful fans of this accessory cannot be mistaken!
   This means that we are on the right track! Your warm words inspire us to new achievements! No doubt, this time we tried even more and what you will see next definitely won't leave anyone indifferent to the bow ties!  EGGO is initially high-quality materials! After all, a good impression of a beautiful design can easily be spoiled by bad quality materials and performance.     One of our main materials is high-quality Italian leather. It is available in 8 colors: black, brown, beige, white, khaki, terra cotta, red and blue. We are highly convinced in its quality, since we are working with this material from the first project on Indiegogo and our backers give very positive references about this material!     Another very important element of our bow tie is the tweed fabric. We have spent about two months searching for the perfect combination of fabric and its texture with real leather! Eventually, we succeeded! And the result is worth it!     Finally, the most important - our bow tie is two-sided! Instead of one bow tie you will get two. You can change the side depending on your clothes, mood or just for a change. Cool, isn’t it?    For your bow tie you can choose yourself the perfect combination of leather, fabric and patch! As we don’t know your preferences, we give you complete freedom of choice to create something individual!    We have our own production, quite small for right now, but own, what is very important for us. It means we can implement the boldest decisions and be confident in the quality of each product!     And of course everyone loves our branded packaging. It helps not only keep the bow tie intact during transportation, but it also can be a great gift to your family and friends!     It is thought that a bow tie is a male accessory.

It is fully waterproof for those of us who sometimes throw our wallets in the washer. Our custom battery and design gives you 3 times the life as most trackers on the market. Our integrated TapSense technology allows you to simply tap your wallet to ring your phone and silence alarms.But the KiwiCard is not just for wallets. If you can put a card inside it, you can track it.KiwiCard connects with the KiwiTrackers app on your mobile phone to provide you with an array of item finding features.The KiwiCard’s TapSense technology allows you to find your phone too! Simply give it a few firm taps and your phone will begin to ring. If your KiwiCard is inside a wallet, notebook, or outside pocket of a bag, just tap on the item and the KiwiCard will pick up the vibrations. You don't even need to pull your wallet out of your pocket!The KiwiTrackers app is available for both iPhone and Android mobile devices and works with your KiwiCards and future KiwiTracker products (yes, a keychain version will be coming!)Figuring out how to make the world's thinnest tracking device without compromising durability was not easy. The KiwiCard consists of many layers of material fused together to make a durable watertight enclosure. Our process is so unique and requires such precision that we cannot outsource it. Because of this and to support our local economy, KiwiCards will be created and packaged at our facility in the USA.The KiwiCard’s custom, flexible battery holds 3 times more charge than the coin cell batteries typically used by most item tracking devices. The KiwiCard is water-tight, making it completely waterproof (IPX8 for the geeks like us) which means the batteries are not replaceable. Batteries are not something you need to worry about with our service model.Let’s face it…you’re forgetful. This is why we offer the KiwiCard as a service. It’s peace of mind for you. When you purchase a service you get guaranteed KiwiCards so long as you keep your service active. That means free replacements if its lost or damaged, and when the battery is getting low you will receive a free replacement automatically. When it’s time to renew your service you can do it with a few quick clicks in the app.

Design for the KiwiCard started in July of 2016 and we are currently on our third design iteration. We are waiting on an order of 200 units of our current revision circuit boards to be delivered by the end of March. These circuit boards will be programmed and used for our phase 1 beta tests and our Kickstarter beta tests. In designing the enclosure we have tested over 40 variants of plastics from various suppliers around the world. We currently have all the necessary equipment to create small quantities of production-grade units for our beta tests. We also have most of the necessary equipment for mass production as we only need to upgrade our programming station to mass produce KiwiCards at our facility.Mikey decided he would leave his job as a research engineer at Georgia Tech Research Institute designing software and computer solutions for the United States Air Force. After a couple of weeks, he put in a month’s notice and quit his job. It was shortly after this that Charlie joined him part time. Charlie was still finishing up school and thus did not have much time, nor was he in the same city. Mikey was hard at work developing by hand the first prototype of the KiwiCard. When Gonzalo joined the team, Mikey already had a prototype. Soon after that, Charlie graduated and moved to Macon to work full-time.Now, you may be wondering where the name 43Tech comes from.

<h3><strong>What is a My Staycation Box?</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you love to travel, want to give a thoughtful gift to a lonely grandparent, or watching a loved one fight cancer - the gift of a vacation would be great, right? What if you just can't drop everything to go on a vacation or buy a one way ticket for a friend or loved one?  My Staycation Box can help by bringing a unique vacation experience each month through 6-8 regionally handmade products sourced from and inspired by that month's destination!  The value of products in each box range from $5-10 each and touch on each of the 5 senses making for a unique subscription box unlike any other on the market.  Also each box includes free shipping!  </p>

<h3><strong> The Story Behind My Staycation Box?</strong></h3>
<p>The idea for a travel-themed box happened early 2016 when the founder's mother, Carol, received the news that she had cancer... again. Already having endured harsh chemotherapy and radiation treatments, she, and her family, thought it was all behind her. Two weeks into doing rounds of radiation treatments, it was evident she needed a break to find the strength to keep fighting. That is when founder, Michelle Sholund, had the idea of ""what if we could bring a vacation to her?"". Quickly realizing there are countless others who too could benefit from an escape, such as going on a vacation like caregivers, busy moms, loved ones living in using homes, to travel enthusiasts on a shoe string budget.  As an artist herself, the founder also saw this as an opportunity to help fellow artists all over the world to get their handmade products in the hands of people who would truly enjoy learning about the culture of that box's destination theme yet do not have the means to do so on their own.  From the mix of these two needs, My Staycation Box was born.</p>

<h3><strong>What will be in each subscription box?</strong></h3>
<p>Playing off the idea of a staycation, subscribers will get to explore popular travel destinations from the comfort of their own home via 6-8 handmade products inspired from that month's destination where all products touch on all 5 senses.  In any given box subscribers can experience popular travel destinations though cd's from local musicians, small batch handmade eco-friendly candles, soaps and jewelry from regional artisans, postcards from local photographers, non perishable food and drink mixes from artisanal regional makers as well as a guide book full of info and breath taking photos about that destination.  Additionally artisans are promoted via inserts itemizing the products in the box with their website address in each of the box to encourage subscribers to buy directly from the artist if they like what they experience in the box.</p>

<h3><strong>How are we getting the products for the boxes?  </strong></h3>
<p>The founder, Michelle Sholund, has a lot of experience working with local artisans because she is an artisan as well as ran her own gift shop featuring work from local art and crafters .  Michelle is a candle maker where her own brand of eco-friendly palm wax candles called By the Bay Botanicals are unique in that they are named after and inspired by popular travel destinations and will be included in some of the My Staycation Box boxes.  Artisans like Michelle (the founder) have a hard time getting their locally made products in the hands of people also seeking handmade regional gifts due to lack of funds and only relying on word mouth advertising such as selling at art festivals, farmers markets, or their own website.  Michelle is able to utilize her current network of artists, internet research, as well as allow subscribers to suggest artists for future boxes too. </p>

<h3><strong>What are some of our risks and challenges?</strong></h3>
<p>Finding new artisans every month is a daunting task however we are already curating items for 4 months of box themes working with handmade artists and regional small businesses from destinations we are expecting to feature in our future box destination themes.  While our standard month to month box starts at $40 and may be pricey for some price breaks will help encourage others to try a 3 month and 6 month subscription options.  Shipping within the USA is also included in the price of the box and feel many subscribers will appreciate that. Additionally the typical value of each box will range from $40-50! Currently we are fine tuning the website to make sure the subscription experience is easy to understand and navigate. We are using state of the art apps and subscription service tools to help prevent issues such as shipping and credit card confusion.</p>

How are we getting the products for the boxes?  
The founder, Michelle Sholund, has a lot of experience working with local artisans because she is an artisan as well as ran her own gift shop featuring work from local art and crafters .  Michelle is a candle maker where her own brand of eco-friendly palm wax candles called By the Bay Botanicals are unique in that they are named after and inspired by popular travel destinations and will be included in some of the My Staycation Box boxes.  Artisans like Michelle (the founder) have a hard time getting their locally made products in the hands of people also seeking handmade regional gifts due to lack of funds and only relying on word mouth advertising such as selling at art festivals, farmers markets, or their own website.  Michelle is able to utilize her current network of artists, internet research, as well as allow subscribers to suggest artists for future boxes too. 
What will we do with the funding?
Great question! 
So far we have put in...  our own money to developing the prototype which includes the box design and getting it printed and shipped to us for approval, buying a variety of products to start working with artists as well as determine what can and cannot fit in future design themed boxes.  We also have a team that tests the products for quality and desirability.  Our own funds have been used for website design, expenses to create an explainitory video, and other miscellaneous expenses that has gone into test marketing the prototype too.

 [ R ] for the Beauty of Roundness [R] is designed with a unique roundness to express its beauty of both elegance and usability. We created the form that looks distinct and yet maximizing the use of ease.We put many ideas into the structural design:  to provide a smooth user experience and to keep its shape nicely.デザインは[R]の名称の由来の一つでもある曲線美（the beauty of roundness）を生かし、今までにない優美な趣を表現しつつ、使い勝手を最大限に高めています。また、随所に細やかな配慮を施し、自然な動線と型崩れを起こさないデザインとなっています。 Innovative water-repellent suede[R] is using an innovative water-repellent suede, a unique and beautiful leather material processed by Sankei Sangyo, a seasoned tannery in Sumida, Tokyo with more than 85 years of history. The newly developed water-repellent suede keeps its soft touch and brilliant color while protecting from the water almost permanently. It's an innovative material never seen before, providing a combination of both elegance and durability.外を包む美しいスエードは、85年以上の伝統と技術を伝える東京都墨田区の革工場である株式会社三恵産業が、独自に編み出した手法によって、その柔らかな手触り、鮮やかな発色と撥水性を両立させることに成功したもので、今までにない気品と耐久性を備えています。Using tanned pigskin for inner compartmentWe made the inner compartment with tanned pigskin, a leather dyed with natural coloring. It will gradually show a unique seasoning and charm as years pass by. 内側の仕切りは、自然の着色料で染色したエコでナチュラルな「ヌメ革」を使用し、使うほどに味わいが出る個性豊かな仕様になっています。 A Thin Design: height =0.4 inch (1 cm)The case is designed to be thin, a height of 0.4 inches (1 cm). It matches with all kinds of the scene in the daily life. It doesn't choose a style of cloth or dress, and it can be used for both formal and casual occasions.奥行き1センチの薄さとデザインは、着ている服やスタイルを選ばず、あらゆる生活のシーンにマッチし、フォーマルでもカジュアルでも合わせてくれます。ジャケットの内ポケットへ入れても、ジャケットのラインを崩さず、 ポケットに入れても、Rの曲線で動線を妨げません。Various ideas are applied to prevent users from overloading the case. It's a light, compact, and multi-functional case for a short outing: fits well in a bag or a pocket.過度にモノを入れることのないように随所に工夫があり、ちょっとしたお出かけに持ち歩いても重くなく、カバンの中に入れてもスッキリと収まるオールラウンド・プレーヤーです。 Unique Inner CompartmentInside the case is divided into three sections with a partition with various holders in the middle. Free spaces on both sides are designed to put smartphones and bills. Various holders in the middle section are used to put coins, cards, SD cards, and a key.ケースの内部は、中心のポケット群を挟んで３つの部分に分かれています。両サイドは、スマートフォンや紙幣を出し入れできるようなフリースペースで、中心のポケット群は、小銭やカード、SDカードや鍵などを整理して収めることができるように様々な工夫が凝らされています。  ABOUT ROOP DESIGNRoop is a Bengal word of ""beauty."" It is widely used for girl's name in South Asian countries. We named our new brand as we loved its charming sound and the meaning it represents. Roop（ループ）とは、ベンガル語で「美しい」を意味する言葉で、インドでは女の子の名前としても人気があるそうです。その素敵な言葉の響きと「R」という文字への私たちの特別の思いも重なって、Roop Designというお洒落な名前のブランドを立ち上げることにしました。And we have a special feeling on the alphabet ""R"" which relates to words such as respect, reliance, and relationship. We treasure these words as they are the foundation of the culture we embrace: a long history of collaboration and mutual respect among small factories in Tokyo.「R」の文字には、私たちが大切にしているたくさんの言葉が連なっています。お互いを敬う尊敬（respect）、信頼（reliance）、確かな関係（relationship）など。こうした言葉は、小さな町工場がお互いの技術、経験への敬意と信頼関係で協力しあう姿に重なりあい、私たちの心に深く響くのです。 Smart & Multi-Functional[R] is a multi-functional leather case which you can use as a wallet as well as a small bag to carry. Although the height is only 0.4 inches, it has plenty of capacity to contain things nicely.You can put your iPhone, even a Plus series of iPhone, a passport, a key, ten cards, ten dollar bills, fifteen coins, and ten receipts and it will only be less than an inch. Carry [R] with you anytime and anywhere.[R]は、薄型の多機能ケースで、わずか1 cmの薄さながら、十分な収納力を誇ります。スマートフォン、パスポート、鍵、カードを１０枚、紙幣を１０枚、コインを１５枚、レシートを１０枚入れても、２cm程の厚みで、スマートにいつでもどこでも持ち運びができます。スマートフォンは、大型のiPhone6、7、8のPlusシリーズも余裕を持って収納できます。 Innovative Water-Repellent Suede[R] is using a unique water-repellent pigskin suede developed by Sankei Sangyo, a traditional tannery in Sumida, Tokyo with more than 85 years of history. Suede is a favorite material for its pleasant touch and luxurious feeling, but it is weak to water as it gets stained and dirty when it gets wet. Previously, it was protected by coating the surface, but it was temporary treatment. This newly developed suede has its fibers soaked into the water-repellent agent in the coloring process so that the effect will be almost permanent.Thanks to this innovative water-repellent suede, we are now able to produce all-weather suede leather case.[R]は、東京都墨田区で85年以上の歴史を誇る三恵産業株式会社が開発した撥水スエードを外側に使用しています。スエードは、心地良い肌さわりと高級感をもち、人気が高い素材ですが、水分が付着すると吸収し、シミになりやすく、汚れやすいという弱点を持ちます。従来、表面にコーティングすることで一時的に撥水性を持たせていましたが、本撥水スエードは、染色工程において繊維の奥深くまで撥水剤を染み込ませているため、撥水効果が半永久的に持続します。これにより、スエードの利点を損なわず、メンテナンスが楽で、どんな天候でも外で使用できる多機能ケースを実現することができました。 Useful Inner compartmentThe bottom of the coin space is stitched in a curved so that it is easy to take out the coins and see the inside. This curve prevents the space to be overloaded as well. The cardholder holds the cards vertically which allows the user to handle them without a hassle. We also add an ""access tab"" to secondary cardholder so that the user can take out the cards smoothly. 小銭入れ部分の底は曲線で縫製を行い、使いやすさと、見やすさ、 底部分の膨らみを抑える設計にしています。カードの収納を縦にすることで、スムーズな出し入れを可能にしました。アクセスタブをつけ、カードの出し入れを簡単にするアイデアも取り入れています。We will use tanned leather for the inner compartment. It keeps the beauty and the gloss of genuine leather. And the color will be seasoned as the time pass by. The color will be brown, a color specially ordered for [R]. 内装には、ヌメ革を使用します。ベジタブルタンニンなめしを施し、革本来の美しさと光沢感、経年変化を味わえるもので、強度を持たせる為に型押しを施しています。色はRoop design特注のブラウンになります。Fastener and Hand StitchesWe used a high-end YKK fastener and put hand stitches on places where the load is high. YKK製の高級ファスナーを使用し、負荷がかかりやすい箇所にはハンドステッチを施しました。There are 2 colors,handle leatherBody color BLACK,NAVY,BROWN / Black leatherBody color NATURAL,GRAY,RED,KHAKI / Natural leatherハンドルの引き手は、２色あり、本体がBLACK,NAVY,BROWNには、ヌメ革のBLACKのレザー本体がNATURAL,GRAY,RED,KHAKIには、ヌメ革のNATURALのレザーが付きます。Protection on the cornerWe put a specially polished metal part on the corner of the case to protect it from wearing out.もっとも擦れやすいケースの角を保護するため、特別の研磨を施した金具を取り付けています。There are 2 colors.Polished metal part.Body color Black,Navy,Brown / Black metalBody color  Natural,Gray,Red,Khaki / Brass metal研磨加工を施した金具は、２色あります。本体が、BLACK,NAVY,BROWNにはBLACKNATURAL,GRAY,RED,KHAKIには真鍮ゴールドが付きます。
Special Rivet to reinforce the durability
To reinforce the durability, we used a special rivet to spots where the threads get loose. And to keep the case thin and make the friction minimum, we scraped the rivet's surface and made it as thin as possible.ほつれが発生しやすい部分に、カシメを打ち強度を増しています。 薄さを維持することと表の革への影響を最小限に抑える為、カシメの表面を削り、厚みを抑える加工を施しています。Sewn by seasoned craftsmen[R] is sewn by seasoned craftsmen in Tokyo. Each one is handmade and produced with ultimate care and Japanese craftsmanship.縫製は、墨田区で３０年以上の歴史を誇る、革を専門とする町工場で行なっています。 有名ブランドの革製品の修理なども多く手がける技術力、経験を持った信頼出来る工場です。 Sankei Sangyo Co., Ltd. is a pigskin tannery based in Sumida, Tokyo with more than 85 years of history. It has an integrated operation of tanning, coloring, and processing pigskin, accumulating profound skills and years of experience and trust in the industry. 三恵産業株式会社は、東京都墨田区で85年以上の歴史を誇る豚革を専門にする革工場です。長年築き上げてきた技術と信頼をもとにピッグスキンの鞣し、染色・加工を一貫しており、その高い技術力は高く評価されています。Pigskin is produced more than 100% in Japan. Sumida, Tokyo is the largest tannery cluster in Japan, producing 90% of the Japanese pigskin. Sankei Sangyo is the largest producer in the industry having a factory in Sumida as well as one in Himeji, Hyogo. 豚革（ピッグスキン）は、日本国内で自給自足できる唯一の革素材です。東京都墨田区は、日本国内のピッグスキンの90%の生産量を誇る一大生産地であり、中でも三恵産業は墨田区の工場に加え、兵庫県姫路市にも工場を持地、最も多く豚革を生産しています。Thanks to sophisticated skills and knowhows of Japanese tanneries, the quality of Japanese pigskin is known as a world's top class. As one of the leaders in the industry, Sankei Sangyo has continuously worked for better quality and endeavored for new development. The strength of the Sankei Sangyo is in the coloring and finishing. The variation, vividness, and stableness of the colors they can produce are amazing. 日本の革工場の洗練された技術やノウハウによって、日本製のピッグスキンは世界の最高水準の品質を誇っています。中でも業界を先導する１社として、三恵産業はたゆまぬ品質改善と新製品開発に取り組み続けています。同社が特に優れているのは染色と仕上げ加工です。染めることのできる色の多彩さ、鮮やかさ、そしてその品質を安定的に維持できる技術力は、他の追随を許さないものがあります。  The water-repellent suede developed by the company is exceptionally innovative. It is challenging to conduct coloring and treat water-repellent at the same time. It requires a high skill of craftsmanship and years of experience.The mastery craftsmen adjust the combination of coloring and water-repellent agent according to the weather and moisture in the factory, which is something no other factory can emulate.同社が開発した撥水加工スエードは、特に画期的な技術です。染色と撥水加工を同時に行うことは非常に難しく、職人の技術と長年の経験によって、初めて実現できました。天候や湿度などの諸条件に合わせながら、微妙に配合の調整を加えながら染色と撥水加工を行うもので、ここに他社が容易にマネのできない同社の強みがあります。Roop Design is founded and operated by Miyoko and Takayuki Takagi, a husband and wife, a parent of three lovely children, and a resident of Katsushika, Tokyo.  Miyoko, a lifestyle designer, has become interested in creating/producing new lifestyle products to the global market combining Japanese craftsmanship and aesthetic.

Wrap the sun's warmth around you with ThermalTech, a groundbreaking jacket that will increase your body temperature up to 20°F  in just two minutes using the energy of the sun without adding bulky layers! This is the biggest innovation to hit fashion in years! These amazing jackets will keep you warmer longer allowing you to do the things you love the most in the outdoors.Never freeze for fashion ever again! ThermalTech jackets are breathable, waterproof and slim down the traditional bulky winter look. Stay toasty warm while you go about your normal outdoor activities such as shopping, walking around town, or running errands. We even have jackets that will keep away jack frost during activities such as hiking, jogging, camping and snowboarding, No matter the activity, our three different jackets have you covered!
 

 
 
ThermalTech fabric is easily embeddable into almost any clothing style and material, with the following key features:

 
 
 

You will be the first to wrap yourself up in the warmth of the sun with our jackets with ThermalTech built in! Available in both Men and Women cuts, we have the following jacket collections: Street (perfect for running errands around town or a night out on the town), Explorer (great for campers, hikers and fishing) and Extreme (ideal companion for snowboarding and skiing). Each style will be available in several popular colors and sizes S, M, L, XL and XXL. The jackets are also under a one year warranty.
 

 
Utilizing patented, lightweight energy absorbing fabric technology, ThermalTech fabric is designed to capture the sun’s ultraviolet rays (as well as energy from artificial light sources) and transform them into heat to warm wearers up to an additional 18F in a matter of minutes. 
 
 The stainless steel mesh fabric threads are strong yet lightweight, lending to extended lifetime use, while it's paper-thin design reduces the additional weight that heat-storing materials typically bring to outerwear.
 We have created a line of light-weight, stylish, durable, and waterproof outerwear jackets with the ThermalTech smart fabric built in! Whether you're heading out into the woods, getting to an important meeting, or hanging out with your friends, jackets powered by ThermalTech will keep you warm and looking stylish while on the go!
 

 
 
 


 


STRETCH GOAL #1 - $50,000 USD - ADDITION OF INNER GLOVES AND BOTTLE HOLDER
 
If we meet our $50,000 goal, we will add inner gloves to the jacket perks*. The inner gloves feature a stretchy thumb-loop made with Spandex and Polyamide to keep your hands extra toasty. *Men-street jackets will not be not included this feature.
We will also include with every jacket a bottle holder to effortlessly hold your bottles (whatever you’re drinking) to leave your hands free. The bottle holder will consist of a wide elastic strip inside the jackets at the level of the handwarmer pockets to keep and prevent spillage. Fits most normal 17oz bottle sizes. (all jackets)
 
 

 
STRETCH GOAL #2 - $100,000 USD - ADDITION OF MOBILE CHARGER WITH EXTRA CUSTOM INNER JACKET POCKET
 
If we meet our $100,000 goal, everyone who buys a jacket will get a mobile charger integrated into the jackets so wearers can charge their phone while enjoying their outdoor activities. The ThermalTech jackets will have an extra pocket added within the cell phone pocket to keep it safe and secure from all movement. Please note that the mobile charger is not charged by the jacket and is a separate USB charger. 
 

Mobile charger pocket specs: 

•80*35*5mm
•Weight: 80g
•Input 5V 1 A (DC)
•Output DC 5V 1 A
•Battery type: Polymer
•for IPhone MP3/MP4/Samsung/HTC
•Special pocket to carry on in thermaltech jackets.


 
ThermalTech was co-founded by Carlos Cortes Manica and Fatima Rocha Arguelles with the goal to ""impact people's life positively through technology"". We started out making solar technology for solar water heater industry and were always inventing new ways to use materials related to solar. 
 
 
 

ThermalTech's group of seven passionate engineers is lead by one of the best scientists in Mexico. She recently won the Mexico National Science Academy award! Her PHD thesis on solar coatings combined with the group's passion for finding new ways to harness the sun's energy is the basis for ThermalTech! 
 
Today ThermalTech is patented in over 10 Countries! We've been trying to find a good home for our technology for the last few years. Last year, everything changed when we were awarded first place over 1,000 contestants as Best Technological Start Up at the Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Morocco. 
 

That helps us to meet incredible people including Dr. Jill Biden (Joe Biden's wife), Secretary Penny Prizker, and Small Business Director Maria Contreras-Sweet. It's through their encouragement and insistence that we take our ""neat idea"" and make it into a reality, which is why we started this campaign!

The Zerod idea actually originated from the wardrobe of Kevin, who’s an entrepreneur as well as an outdoor enthusiast. He had half filled up his wardrobe with trench coat jackets, which he used for business, and half with performance jackets which were for his hobbies and daily use. The problem was that his trench coats couldn’t handle the extra cold, or heavy rain, when he was out for business, whereas, in the meantime, the performance jackets did not match the suit and tie look and made him look unprofessional. We were also inspired by the detachable liners of the performance jackets and integrated that design into the Zerod, making it a performance jacket with a trench coat look, and which can be worn in Spring, Fall and Winter.</p><div data-id=""27798844""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1586204378/utwpvcyxenwvcrsasbh8.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""27798848""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1586204378/xyqttn8oiioghq4qvjy1.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""28386204""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><a href=""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1AEaU-BbQGchaxjl7dGa9wW1CewYoQslT?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1586204379/ricg0a5uzyoodjqjvov7.jpg"" src=""""/> </a></p>

A jacket with a stylish and trendy trench coat design that matches both business and casual looks.
A jacket that can be worn in 3 seasons (featuring a detachable inner jacket)
A jacket made from eco-friendly fabrics.
A jacket with multiple and spacious pockets.

 
 
 Zerod comes in 3 colors – 
Honey
Black Navy
 Fog Grey [Unlocked]
 Charcoal [Unlocked]
  
  
  
 Zerod is laminated with a soft-shell (outer fabric), TPU/membrane (in between) and fleece (inner fabric) to block out harsh winds and rain while providing essential warmth.TPU (membrane)：WP/MP 20,000/20,000 (JIS)
 
 We are using an Eco Bionic coating (PFC Free coating) which repels water with no added chemicals. (PFCs are frequently used as durable water-repellent (DWR), which actually contain fluorocarbons or PFCs that have been shown to be a hormone disruptor.)PFC Free Coating + Membrane = keeps you dry for over an hour, even in heavy rain.

 
We have also made the outer shell extremely soft to make it both look and feel like a trench coat.  FABRIC INDEX [40D%88%nylon12%spandex weave fabric +TPU +100%poly polar fleece] 
 Actually, we are the first design team to add another 2.5 layers within the same jacket as a lining, making the Zerod a unique 3+2.5 layer jacket.
 We are not the first ones to apply graphene technology to a jacket. However, we are definitely the first one to bring it to the market at the lowest price. OK, this is not a magic! The light bulb presentation demonstrates the membrane, which is made from graphene.  Although Graphene is highly conductive, the graphene membrane is 100% safe. It’s the perfect solution to protect against electrostatic discharges (Anti-Static), especially in cold and dry weather.  
  Graphene is one of the natural methods used to regulate skin temperature and increase it [in chilly/cold temperatures] or decrease it [in warm/hot temperatures] by an average of 2°C. It does this by evenly spreading heat from the warmer parts of your body like your chest and back to the other colder parts. It'll make you ""feel warmer"" in chilly/cold temperatures while you'll ""feel cooler"" in warm/hot temperature.  
 
 
 Sweat contains bacteria that quickly grows and makes the clothes smell. Inherently, graphene is bacteriostatic, which means bacteria can’t grow or reproduce on its surface, giving Zerod anti-bacteria and anti-odor properties.
 FABRIC INDEX[50D 100 %polyester Interlock double fabric+Graphene TPU]  
 
 In total, Zerod has 10 pockets, allowing users to carry extra items and making it very convenient to wear:
 
 
 
 The removable hood adds extra protection during bad weather and can be easily taken off to transform Zerod into a trench coat.
 
 We also designed the hood zip to make it “invisible” to give more of a trench coat look when you wear Zerod with the stand-up collar without the hood. (You can’t see the zipper on the collar).
 
 
 To bring extra warmth, Zerod comes with a detachable inner down jacket which you can easily zip on or off the Zerod, or even wear it separately.

 Sizing Info
Please take measures with a slim fit/regular fit t-shirt, or something you normally wear under a jacket. DO NOT wear a jacket while you are measuring.
The sizing chart is for your body measures [not the jacket measures].
Tips
Slim Fit: Add 2'' to your body measures [Chest, Waist and Hips].
Regular Fit: Add 4'' to your body measures [Chest, Waist and Hips].
Loose Fit: Add 6'' to your body measures [Chest, Waist and Hips].
How to Measure [Chest/Bust, Waist, Hips and Sleeve]- Sleeve: Comfortably bend your arm [about 90 degrees] and measure from the shoulder [along the outer side of your arm] to the wrist.   For the rest of measures, there is nothing particular. You can check with any YouTube videos if you have any questions. Make sure your tape measure is straight and snug around the body. DO NOT pull it tight [We are not selling underwear :-) ].- Chest / Bust- Waist- HipsJacket Length  WASH & CARE INSTRUCTIONS TEAMAt Texlab, we partner with the world’s leading textile suppliers and integrate cutting-edge technology into our superbly designed products. The Zerod idea actually originated from the wardrobe of Kevin, who’s an entrepreneur as well as an outdoor enthusiast. He had half filled up his wardrobe with trench coat jackets, which he used for business, and half with performance jackets which were for his hobbies and daily use. The problem was that his trench coats couldn’t handle the extra cold, or heavy rain, when he was out for business, whereas, in the meantime, the performance jackets did not match the suit and tie look and made him look unprofessional. We were also inspired by the detachable liners of the performance jackets and integrated that design into the Zerod, making it a performance jacket with a trench coat look, and which can be worn in Spring, Fall and Winter. 
 This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1000+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $430M raised between them.  Zerod Demonstration Video If you have any questions, feel free to take a look at the demonstration video or check out the FAQs.

<p><strong>Thank you </strong>so much for checking out the ChariT Fashion Apparel Indiegogo campaign! We are here to pursue a solution, with your help, to solve a heartbreaking problem.</p>
<p>You see, there are people in the world that don't get a chance. They don't get a chance to drink clean water, eat nutritious foods to keep them healthy, live free from sex trafficking, smile because illness is taking over their bodies, wear warm clothes in the cold of winter, pursue an education, or simply live. </p>
<p>Thankfully, there are charities that address these issue as best they can. But, they have limits. Many charities struggle to reach the people that need their help the most because of a funding shortfall. Simply getting people to know about their cause is difficult. And this brings up a problem.</p>
<p><img alt="" photo Problem_Image_zps383099e8.jpg"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1362.photobucket.com/albums/r690/ChariTFashion/Problem_Image_zps383099e8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> <span>So I wanted to come up with a solution to help charities with a resource to break through the limitations they face.</span></p>

<p>To give our partnering charities an extra ""gogo"" we will increase the amount of giving from each t-shirt sold during this Indiegogo campaign from $4.50 (20% of proceeds) to <strong>$5.50</strong><span> (that's over 30% with some of the reward levels!). This increase will give these charities an extra boost to help those in need.</span> </p>
<h1><strong>WHY ARE WE HERE?</strong></h1>
<p>We are seeking your support to help us start or first line of men's t-shirts. Our goal of $6000 will get us the inventory we need to launch the first four men's designs and have them available after this campaign. Not only will it get us our first men's apparel line, it will also result in financial support to our partnering charities so they can do what they do in making the world a better place.</p>

<h3>Sustainable Harvest International (SHI)</h3>
<p>In Central America, the devastating cycle of slash-and-burn farming does not allow families to meet their basic nutritional needs. Malnutrition contributes directly to poverty, which leads to increased childhood mortality rates, reduced access to higher education, poor housing, lack of sanitation systems and limited access to medical care. </p>
<p>Sustainable Harvest International (SHI) works with over 650 families in rural farming communities in Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama. SHI's local field trainers work together with families for 3-5 years, providing them with the training and tools they need to preserve our planet's tropical forests while overcoming poverty. </p>
<p>You can help these desperate farmers who long for training to protect our tropical forests. </p>
<p>How your purchase helps Sustainable Harvest International:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 t-shirts = Plant Five Trees</li>
<li>10 t-shirts = Plant a Family Garden</li>
<li>145 t-shirts = Support a Family for 1 Year</li>

<h3><strong>ChariT Fashion Brand (CF)</strong></h3>
<p>For every ChariT Fashion Rally for Bostont-shirt sold during the Indiegogo campaign we will donate $5 to help the victims of the Boston Marathon bombings. This terrible event has changed the lives of the victims and their families. We want to do anything and everything we can to help them get through it. We'll be donating to the great organizations which assist the victims in any form they need.<strong><span> </span></strong></p>
<p>Although the stretch goal design, ""Peace in the Storm"", wasn't initially created to assist the vitims of the Oklahoma tornados, we have decided to direct it's donation to them. With each purchase of this t-shirt, we'll donate $5.50 toward thier relief. This storm took lives and destroyed homes and we want to do what ever can be done to assist those affected by this as best we can. We'll be donating to an organization which will be directly invovled with those affected.</p>
<h2>OUR PRODUCTS</h2>
<p>These shirts are 100% Ring-spun/Combed Cotton Jersey, Vintage Wash, Men's regular fit, and made by an ethically managed manufacturer. What does all this mean? These t-shirts will be one of the most comfortable t-shirts you'll ever own. During this Indiegogo campaign you will be able to select sizes small, medium, large, x-large and xx-large.</p>
<p>To give the ultimate comfort feel we printing using discharged screen printing where we can. The discharge process replaces the garments color with the color in the design. This leaves the soft natural feel of the fabric. It also doesn't crack, peel or fade. Some garments wont take the discharge so we'll use a water based ink. The water based ink's are a great alternative to discharge and still leave a soft feel on the t-shirts. Our goal is to offer the best finish and we are sure you wont be disappointed either way.</p>
<p>Our hats are 100% certified organic cotton twill front with 100% recycled polyester mesh back. To give this hat great comfort and style they are structured, mid-profile, six-panel, and pre-curved visor. The snap tab size adjustment creates a great fit for just about anyone.</p>
<p>Why start with only men's? Through research, men don't have as many options available to them to show support to charities. We want to provide stylish t-shirts and apparel that keep with up with the trends so they (we) don't have to stretch personal styles. We don't want to limit it to only men's. We'll be adding women's fashion to our lines as we go, and hopefully in the near future. </p>

Actioncam Armor is more than just a lens protection solution, its the future of the way you will use and interact with your GoPro.Born out of frustration with the stock, flimsy and easily breakable mounts and lack of accessory adaptions we created the first ring mount that will fully upgrade your GoPro into the big leagues.Precision CNC machined billet aluminium frame with poly-carbonate lens protection will help you to stay a hero! Over the last few years I lost several GoPro units to smashed glass, damaged lenses and mounts that broke and the camera was never recovered.                                              I decided enough was enough and wanted to develop a final solution that would not only keep my lenses safe from high speed flying gravel and debris but also a much stronger mount system capable of reducing the vibration and more importantly, reducing the chance of the camera being snapped off the mount!Who needs Actioncam Armor?From professional film and TV camera crew to race track goers , there are only so many ways in which you can mount your GoPro - until now!By mounting to the main lens protrusion with an interference (tight and perfect fit with no slack) fit you are starting to hold the camera closer to the central mass (imagine holding a pencil at one end and doing a circular motion, then hold it in the middle and do the same thing! Much better).By adding the accessories and mounts (such as the above gun rail mount) this way you create a stronger less fragile, and a much more convenient way of using your GoPro.The best part is that we have used standard M5 threads on the 4 side faces, so if you need to make yourself a specific mount you can! But we will be releasing lots more ourselves! So keep an eye out on our stretch goals.
We have kept the design modular with standardised threads so you can find replacement bolts no matter where you are in the world!Easy to use and fit, keeping your cameras rolling with nothing more special than a standard hex (Allen) key.Stop letting the current range of GoPro mounts restrict how you film.Our planned stretch goals are going to inlcude:

Pitcanny rail module (Police/Airsoft/Paintball)


Caribina clip module


Spacer block module


Rigid sheer mount/Angle mount


LED Lighting Ring


Microphone Mount

The poly-carbonate lens has been designed to be easily replaced when its
fulfilled its sacrificial role of protecting your gopro from flying
debris. 
The advantage of the poly-carbonate is its high impact strength. At 3mm
its as thick as most riot shields on the market, and is much more capable of taking the impacts that the glass cannot.What perks are available?To get this into production we are offering the first 200 at £55 which at is less than cost price to get the project underway. We are choosing to do this as we have already invested so much time and money that we just want to see what you guys can create and film with the mount!            If your really into the project and want to make it happen then please consider being a wonderful benefactor and helping us reach our goal quicker by ordering the gold plated version of the lens protector! Its highly personal and will be made from the first 5 units to come off the production line and will be individually numbered within its bespoke lining of the 1120 Actioncam Armor Pelicase.What stage am I at now?We launched the product at the Makegood festival @ the old Selfridges hotel on the 29th of May. We had an amazing response to the product from Film and TV industry including many production companies.We had the pleasure of meeting Jason Bradbury from the Gadget Show who shared his enthusiasm for the product and recognised its need for professional filming purposes.We are at the stage where we need to produce the injection molds and have a minimum run of 200 of the CNC machined units.We have had 3D prints made and evaluated for fitment and viewing angles, and have just had back the first CNC machined pre production sample which has massively exceeded our wildest dreams for fitment.Unlike many other crowd funding campaigns I have put in all of the time and my own money and am not expecting you to fund any development work. The product is ready to be produced with your help and support.Our UK manufacturer is ready to start the tooling and machining once we have gained the funding. They have an amazing reputation for quality and share our ethos on perfection.What will your support mean?Your
support will enable me to continue to design and develop innovative products
for Actioncam Armor so that you have more options for using your Go Pro.  I want to be able to respond to changes in use of the GoPro system but to also adapt and produce for other Actioncam systems over time once we become established.
I believe
that my designs will enable people to change the way they use their action
cameras, and also change people's perceptions of what an action camera can do.
How will I use the funds that are raised?The bulk of our funds are to be used for tooling costs for the injection moulding of the lens system and seals, with the remainder going towards production of the product itself.Our supply chain for all the other parts are ready to go, which means that as soon as we have the funding in our possession we can start placing orders and get the product to you as soon as possible!Who am I?....Hi, my name is Chris McGee.  Twelve months ago I launched my first company www.littlebiglaser.com in London and have grown it to be a respected laser cutting, design and consulting service. This even included a range of our own stock products for which we have been delivering consistent happy customers for our Pro-stand Promarker pen racks.

<h1>What Makes Melon Goggles So Great?</h1>
<p>We wanted to design a
product that would meet the demanding requirements of the most adventurous skiers

from first timers through to seasoned pros.  As a result we have developed a design that offers maximum
visibility without compromising on quality. </p>

<h1>So Why Do We Need You?</h1>
<p>
</p>
<p>Since our launch four months
ago we've already accomplished more than we imagined possible. We're receiving
compliments daily on the quality of our products, our speedy delivery times and
our customer service. Having received orders from customers over the globe, we
know that people want what we have to offer.  </p>
<p>Melon was never going to be
a one product company and in order to expand we’ve had to take risks. We know
our goggles are great and we want everyone to experience them. We’ve reinvested
everything we’ve made from the sales of sunglasses over the last four months into
the down payment to start the manufacturing and now we need your help to see us
through. So click the link, get customising and help shape the future of the
snow sports eyewear market by purchasing a pair of Melon goggles today!</p>

Our Story

Not taking life too
seriously is ingrained in our culture here at Melon. All of the team are board
junkies and we created Melon as an outlet to be creative, bring products to the
market where we feel there is a gap and earn enough cash to keep us doing what
we love doing…riding.
We started Melon for three
main reasons:


We were sick of spending
half a week’s wages on a pair of sunglasses or goggles either for them to break
or get lost on the hill. We wanted to make products that feel and look good to
ride in, are durable and most importantly are affordable.
We wanted to create a company
that was fun to work in and a culture that our customers could relate to. We
work hard but lets face it, who wants to work 80 hour a week in a job they
hate? We believe there’s a better way to do business and we want to be part of
the change.
Generating profits allows
us to give something back to the community that we live through. As we grow as
a company we want to invest in educating people and find ways to encourage
entrepreneurial activity within the extreme sports community.
Since launching Melon and
our initial sunglasses range in June 2013 we’ve been overwhelmed by the
positive response. We’ve had many late nights, uncountable cups of coffee and
invested our time and money into making it a success. But sunglasses were just
the beginning for Melon and with the launch of our first snow goggle we hope to
cement ourselves as being on the forefront of innovation in the sports eyewear
market.

Melon Goggles


Melon Goggles are the
result of months of designing, prototype manufacturing and a snow season’s

we know they can take a beating. At almost half the price of comparable goggles

Melon was never going to be
a one product company and in order to expand we’ve had to take risks. We know
our goggles are great and we want everyone to experience them. We’ve reinvested
everything we’ve made from the sales of sunglasses over the last four months into
the down payment to start the manufacturing and now we need your help to see us
through. So click the link, get customising and help shape the future of the
snow sports eyewear market by purchasing a pair of Melon goggles today!

When Will I Receive My Goggles?
We've got so much faith in our product that we've already begun the manufacturing process. This means that we will be aiming to get your goggles to you from December 10th and before the start of the snow season. We'll sending the goggles out in the order that we receive contributions, so the sooner we receive your contribution the sooner we can get your pair of new Melon goggles to you. 



UPDATE: Stretch Goal 2



Thanks to everyone that has helped us smash our first stretch goal of £20,000 that has enabled us to start to manufacture polarised lenses for our goggles! 
We have now added a second stretch goal of £35,000 which will allow us to add more colours to our goggles collection if we reach it. But we want YOU to vote on which colour you want us to add to the Melon ""Chief"" Goggle range, so place your votes 
HERE

Thanks again and keep spreading the word!

<p><br/>Wir leben in einer Zeit voller Veränderungen. Mode ist ein Luxusprodukt und dennoch mitlerweile für jedermann erschwinglich - in heutigem Maße scheint es mir oft überflüssig. <br/>Es gibt für mich daher nur eine schlüssige Konsequenz: Die Gestaltung von Bekleidung und den Fokus gerichtet auf ökologische Textilien.</p>
<p>Baumwolle, Leinen, Hanf, Tussah-Seide.</p>
<p><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/644186/pictures/full/20130204135823-textiles.jpg?1360015111"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 90px; margin-right: 90px;""/></p>
<p><br/>Dies sind großartige und sehr interessante Materialien, welche viele Möglichkeiten birgen.<br/><br/>Jetzt ist jedoch nicht die Zeit für Experimente, sondern für ein solides Geschäftsmodell um die Visionen in die Realität zu transportieren - mit all meiner Kraft und Herz werde ich mein Label auf lange, kräftige Bein stellen.</p>
<p>Hier brauche ich eure Hilfe, um die Ideen vom Papier in Tragbares umzuwandeln.</p>
<br/><h2>DIE IDEE</h2>
<p>Ich entwickle aktuell einen Online-Shop in welchem der Kunde die Möglichkeit hat sein gewünschtes Teil nach seinen Wünschen zu optimieren:<br/><br/>Farbe, Material (nur ökologisch zertifizierte), Änderungen am Design, sowie Design auf Anfrage.<br/>Der Kunde hat somit die Möglichkeit ein Teil zu erwerben, das exakt seinen Vorstellungen entspricht. Er muss keine Kompromisse eingehen.</p>
<p>Mein Konzept spricht vier Gruppen an:</p>
<p>1. Klicken und kaufen</p>
<p>2. Kaufen mit Änderungswunsch</p>
<p>3. Interessiert an einem Teil welches nicht zum Typ passt - hier kann ein neues Teil dem Typ entsprechend kreiert werden.</p>
<p>4. Nachhaltig eingestellter Konsument</p>
<p>KEINE VERSCHWENDUNG - WEDER VON MATERIALIEN NOCH VON FINANZMITTELN UND KEINE PRODUKTION OHNE KUNDEN STATTFINDET.</p>
<h3>Das Konzept beinhaltet:</h3>
- Bedachtes, nachhaltiges Konsumieren
<p>- Lokale Produktion</p>
<p>- Nachhaltigkeit</p>
<p>- Individualität</p>
<h3>
<br/>LASST UNS DAS LABEL ""ENGST"" GRÜNDEN UND EINEN SCHRITT IN DIE ZUKUNFT MACHEN! ALLE PROZESSE DER BEKLEIDUNGSINDUSTRIE INBEGRIFFEN! JETZT!</h3>

<br/>DIE WICHTIGKEIT</h2>
<div>
<p>Lasst uns die Veränderung der Mode-Industrie vorantreiben. Weg von der Oberflächlichkeit hin zu etwas mehr Solidem, Sinnvollerem. Die Schönheit, welche so faszinierend ist können wir doch beibehalten, aber in einem realisitschem Rahmen. Wir sollten mit der Zeit gehen, in welcher QUALITÄT, REINHEIT, ZEITLOSIGKEIT UND NACHHALTIGKEIT benötigt werden und kombinierbar sind.</p>
<h3>Gegenwärtig stelle ich mir folgende Frage:</h3>
Wo will die heutige Gesellschaft hin? Die Menschen sind von der Gigantomanie erfasst. Der Wunsch alles in noch größerem, schnellerem, vielfältigerem Maße zu erschaffen, grenzt an Wahnsinn.
<p class=""EinfacherAbsatz"">Produkte reisen tausende Kilometer, ehe sie den Endverbraucher erreichen. Luxus und Niedrigpreise charakterisieren unser Konsumverhalten.</p>
<p class=""EinfacherAbsatz"">Niemand möchte sich verantwortlich fühlen, sich mit Veränderungen befassen, die einem ein Stück des bisherigen Luxus nehmen, auf Annehmlichkeiten verzichten. Nun sind es jedoch genau wir, unsere Generation, die diese Herausforderung annehmen muss.</p>
<p class=""EinfacherAbsatz"">Die Welt verändert sich, mit oder ohne uns. Nur wenn wir uns in Bewegung setzen, können wir an einer Änderung mitwirken und sei sie nur minimal.</p>
<p class=""EinfacherAbsatz"">„Ohne Emotionen kann man Dunkelheit nicht in Licht und Apathie nicht in Bewegung verwandeln.“     <br/>Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961)</p>
<p class=""EinfacherAbsatz"">Unsere Zeit ist komplex.</p>
<p class=""EinfacherAbsatz"">Womit wir kämpfen ist die Last des Luxus.</p>
<p class=""EinfacherAbsatz"">Was fangen wir mit unserem Leben an?</p>
<p class=""EinfacherAbsatz"">Alles, definitiv alles ist überall möglich...</p>

  ENGST


Wir leben in einer Zeit voller Veränderungen. Mode ist ein Luxusprodukt und dennoch mitlerweile für jedermann erschwinglich - in heutigem Maße scheint es mir oft überflüssig. Es gibt für mich daher nur eine schlüssige Konsequenz: Die Gestaltung von Bekleidung und den Fokus gerichtet auf ökologische Textilien.
Baumwolle, Leinen, Hanf, Tussah-Seide.

Dies sind großartige und sehr interessante Materialien, welche viele Möglichkeiten birgen.Jetzt ist jedoch nicht die Zeit für Experimente, sondern für ein solides Geschäftsmodell um die Visionen in die Realität zu transportieren - mit all meiner Kraft und Herz werde ich mein Label auf lange, kräftige Bein stellen.
Hier brauche ich eure Hilfe, um die Ideen vom Papier in Tragbares umzuwandeln.
DIE IDEE
Ich entwickle aktuell einen Online-Shop in welchem der Kunde die Möglichkeit hat sein gewünschtes Teil nach seinen Wünschen zu optimieren:Farbe, Material (nur ökologisch zertifizierte), Änderungen am Design, sowie Design auf Anfrage.Der Kunde hat somit die Möglichkeit ein Teil zu erwerben, das exakt seinen Vorstellungen entspricht. Er muss keine Kompromisse eingehen.
Mein Konzept spricht vier Gruppen an:
1. Klicken und kaufen
2. Kaufen mit Änderungswunsch
3. Interessiert an einem Teil welches nicht zum Typ passt - hier kann ein neues Teil dem Typ entsprechend kreiert werden.
4. Nachhaltig eingestellter Konsument
KEINE VERSCHWENDUNG - WEDER VON MATERIALIEN NOCH VON FINANZMITTELN UND KEINE PRODUKTION OHNE KUNDEN STATTFINDET.
Das Konzept beinhaltet:
- Bedachtes, nachhaltiges Konsumieren
- Lokale Produktion
- Nachhaltigkeit
- Individualität

LASST UNS DAS LABEL ""ENGST"" GRÜNDEN UND EINEN SCHRITT IN DIE ZUKUNFT MACHEN! ALLE PROZESSE DER BEKLEIDUNGSINDUSTRIE INBEGRIFFEN! JETZT!
 

DIE WICHTIGKEIT

Lasst uns die Veränderung der Mode-Industrie vorantreiben. Weg von der Oberflächlichkeit hin zu etwas mehr Solidem, Sinnvollerem. Die Schönheit, welche so faszinierend ist können wir doch beibehalten, aber in einem realisitschem Rahmen. Wir sollten mit der Zeit gehen, in welcher QUALITÄT, REINHEIT, ZEITLOSIGKEIT UND NACHHALTIGKEIT benötigt werden und kombinierbar sind.
Gegenwärtig stelle ich mir folgende Frage:
Wo will die heutige Gesellschaft hin? Die Menschen sind von der Gigantomanie erfasst. Der Wunsch alles in noch größerem, schnellerem, vielfältigerem Maße zu erschaffen, grenzt an Wahnsinn.
Produkte reisen tausende Kilometer, ehe sie den Endverbraucher erreichen. Luxus und Niedrigpreise charakterisieren unser Konsumverhalten.
Niemand möchte sich verantwortlich fühlen, sich mit Veränderungen befassen, die einem ein Stück des bisherigen Luxus nehmen, auf Annehmlichkeiten verzichten. Nun sind es jedoch genau wir, unsere Generation, die diese Herausforderung annehmen muss.
Die Welt verändert sich, mit oder ohne uns. Nur wenn wir uns in Bewegung setzen, können wir an einer Änderung mitwirken und sei sie nur minimal.
„Ohne Emotionen kann man Dunkelheit nicht in Licht und Apathie nicht in Bewegung verwandeln.“     Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961)
Unsere Zeit ist komplex.
Womit wir kämpfen ist die Last des Luxus.
Was fangen wir mit unserem Leben an?
Alles, definitiv alles ist überall möglich...

<p>Heritage Watch Company is a family operated project that was formed purely by accident.

MANUFACTURING We have established relationships with experienced watchmakers to mitigate the risk of delays by material suppliers and to ensure quality control is implemented to the highest level. We have built prototypes with our manufacturer and they fully understand our product, specifications and production timeline. While we know there will still be unexpected challenges along the way, we will always be transparent and inform our backers of potential hurdles along the way.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is Thought Space<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Thought Space Apparel is a US-based clothing and art
collective operating out of the beautiful and historic Lower Hudson Valley in
New York. <br/></p>
<p>Owned and operated by young entrepreneurs and deeply rooted in
the tattoo and art community, the goal of Thought Space is to provide far more
than simply the highest quality products at a fair cost. <br/></p>Hang-tags are screen-printed in, so no more discomfort. No-feel, discharge printing on all designs for comfort and quality. No more thick, uncomfortable prints - you shouldn't be thinking about your shirt while you're trying to elevate your mind.<br/>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We're aiming to raise funds to be able to launch with a full line of products in time for Fall, when the line officially debuts at the 3rd annual <a href=""http://www.westchestertattoocon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Westchester Tattoo Convention</a> in October. Your contribution is greatly appreciated, and to thank you, we'll be getting your items out to you as quickly as possible and all items will be fulfilled in September 2015 - we hate waiting months for stuff we back, too. On top of it, we are
offering a few rewards in this campaign that will not be available anywhere
else once it ends. You’ll also get first access to the entire line, available
through this campaign weeks before our webstore, any brick &amp; mortar
locations or conventions/trade shows. You'll even get a discount code to use once our webstore does open on a future order once the campaign ends. Not to mention the deep discounts that are being given on the products in the perk packages of this campaign! <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Your contribution will help us in many ways, and for it we
are extremely grateful. First of all, by picking up some discounted threads
today, you will help us directly by contributing to our initial order,
including restock and new items. You’ll be helping us to have enough stock
on-hand, at launch, to fill storefronts, our webstore, and to provide our
traveling sales team to bring The Collective to cities all over the country,
spreading art and inspiration. <br/></p>

<p>Our team spent 18 months sourcing one of the best lightweight jacket materials around. Our <b>NESSH™ 10D Ripstop Nylon</b> is super-light, with a tight weave that offers excellent wind resistance and down proofing. Additionally, <b>we use the same fabric on both the outer and inner shells</b>. Many well-known brands skimp on quality by using a lower quality fabric on the jacket’s inner shell…we don’t.</p>

<p><b>Down or Synthetic - which to choose?</b> We knew that one insulation just wouldn't cover all the bases. Down is super warm and packable, but doesn't perform well when wet. Synthetic has excellent wet-weather performance, but isn't as packable or lightweight as Down. So instead we decided to do something radical, by offering the exact same jacket, with two different insulation options. <b>850 Fill Power Goose Down - OR - 3M FL700 Synthetic insulation</b>.</p>

<p>Down clothing ranges in Fill Power (FP) from 550FP up to 900FP. Higher Fill Power Down traps more insulating air pockets than lower quality down (e.g. 550FP). Very few brands choose to use Down with very high Fill Power ratings, due to its considerable cost. The NESSH Jacket uses <b>850 Fill Power Down</b> to provide industry-leading insulation.</p>
<p>All Down used in Dark Peak jackets has been certified by the Responsible Down Standard (RDS), ensuring that Down comes from animals that have not been subjected to any unnecessary harm. We pride ourselves on reinforcing this outlook.</p>

<p>The NESSH jacket features <b>a form-fitting design </b>with<b> innovative Verti-Stretch™ vertical side baffles</b>. These baffles expand or contract to better fit your physique and give you more flexibility when layering under the jacket.</p>
<p>It's got <b>plenty of pockets</b> and features <b>wrist gaiters/mitts</b> that prevent drafts and help keep your hands warm (use them or don’t, they tuck away when not in use). It also has <b>a longer length than other brands, with an extended lower back </b>(drop-back), giving more protection than other jackets in its class.</p>
<p>The versatile <b>2-way YKK zipper </b>allows you to unzip the jacket from the top or bottom. Perfect for wearing over bulky items (like a climbing harness), the NESSH jacket can unzip slightly when you’re sitting down, so it will never bunch up on you.</p>
<p><strong>And of course, it folds into it's own pocket for easy storage!</strong></p>

<p>At Dark Peak, we’re passionate about great products, but we also believe it’s not enough for a business to simply strive for profit, benefiting only a handful of shareholders.</p>
<p>As a business, we have an opportunity to improve society, to give back and help bring issues to the forefront of people’s minds. Which is why we decided to adopt a One Sold, One Given model, by promising that for every jacket we sell, we’ll donate another jacket to a person affected by homelessness, in the country you live in. Help us help the vulnerable in your home country.</p>
<div data-id=""23140099""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/023/140/099/780f2d725d42a48a8bc9a3758dc26ad2_original.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1541374114&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=e370bd507f741287f647596b300d1e41"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>We’ve received some great question about how our One Sold, One Given promise works, here are some answers:</p>
<p><b>Q: Is the jacket you give the same as the NESSH jacket?</b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>No. For many reasons the NESSH jacket is not suitable for the needs of someone without permanent shelter. Knowing this we’re working with charities and directly with homeless people to develop a different jacket, designed to be as warm and as hard wearing as possible. It’s cut longer in the body to stop drafts, and has a deep drawstring hood. We have selected a water resistant, hardwearing polyester shell combined with synthetic insulation fill that retains insulating properties when wet. One of these jackets will be donated for every NESSH jacket sold.</p>
<p><b>Q: Is the jacket you donate branded with a Dark Peak logo? </b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No. The jacket we give is unbranded. This reduces it’s intrinsic value and reduces the temptation for someone to sell it, instead of wear it.</p>
<p><b>Q: Will the jacket being given on my behalf, go to someone in my home country? </b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Yes! We are working with charities worldwide and wherever possible we will donate the jacket on your behalf, to a charity in your home country.</p>
<p><b>Q: If I return my jacket for a refund, will you still give a jacket away? </b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>No. Unfortunately, we can only give a jacket for every jacket sold. If you return your jacket for a refund, we cannot then afford to also give a jacket away.</p>
<p><b>Q: How do you donate the jackets? </b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>We work with charities in different countries to provide bulk donation of jackets to homeless shelters, who will then distribute them to people in need.</p>
<p><b>Q: Can I personally sign up to receive a donated jacket? </b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> No. Unfortunately we are not able to donate to individuals at this time. After our campaign ends our website will have a link to charities we partner with.</p>

<p><b>One Warm Coat</b> is a US national non-profit organization that works to provide a free, warm coat to any person in need. They support individuals, groups, companies and organizations across the U.S. by providing the tools and resources needed to hold a successful coat drive, collecting lightly used coats for donation to people in need. In 2017/18 season they helped arrange donation of over 600,000 coats to people in need across the U.S. and 7 other countries. </p>

You can buy the NESSH Jacket now at www.darkpeakgear.com



 




 


Our team spent 18 months sourcing one of the best lightweight jacket materials around. Our NESSH™ 10D Ripstop Nylon is super-light, with a tight weave that offers excellent wind resistance and down proofing. Additionally, we use the same fabric on both the outer and inner shells. Many well-known brands skimp on quality by using a lower quality fabric on the jacket’s inner shell…we don’t.

Down or Synthetic - which to choose? We knew that one insulation just wouldn't cover all the bases. Down is super warm and packable, but doesn't perform well when wet. Synthetic has excellent wet-weather performance, but isn't as packable or lightweight as Down. So instead we decided to do something radical, by offering the exact same jacket, with two different insulation options. 850 Fill Power Goose Down - OR - 3M FL700 Synthetic insulation.

Down clothing ranges in Fill Power (FP) from 550FP up to 900FP. Higher Fill Power Down traps more insulating air pockets than lower quality down (e.g. 550FP). Very few brands choose to use Down with very high Fill Power ratings, due to its considerable cost. The NESSH Jacket uses 850 Fill Power Down to provide industry-leading insulation.
All Down used in Dark Peak jackets has been certified by the Responsible Down Standard (RDS), ensuring that Down comes from animals that have not been subjected to any unnecessary harm. We pride ourselves on reinforcing this outlook.

For those who are allergic to, or prefer to avoid, Down, we also offer the same jacket filled instead with premium 3M Featherless (FL700) Synthetic Insulation - considered the best synthetic, Down-like insulation on the market.


The NESSH jacket features a form-fitting design with innovative Verti-Stretch™ vertical side baffles. These baffles expand or contract to better fit your physique and give you more flexibility when layering under the jacket.
It's got plenty of pockets and features wrist gaiters/mitts that prevent drafts and help keep your hands warm (use them or don’t, they tuck away when not in use). It also has a longer length than other brands, with an extended lower back (drop-back), giving more protection than other jackets in its class.
The versatile 2-way YKK zipper allows you to unzip the jacket from the top or bottom. Perfect for wearing over bulky items (like a climbing harness), the NESSH jacket can unzip slightly when you’re sitting down, so it will never bunch up on you.
And of course, it folds into it's own pocket for easy storage!


Did you know that when buying a jacket from a well-known brand, you pay 6-8 times what it actually costs to manufacture? Why? These brands have bloated marketing budgets, distributors and retailers who all take their piece.

By cutting out traditional retail middlemen and only selling directly to you, we can give you a world class jacket, at wholesale pricing and use some of our profits to give a jacket to someone who’s homeless.

We've use a combination of 5 fabric colors to create our range. Each jacket color (excluding Black) has a different color inner shell, which compliments the outer shell color. Additionally some inner shell colors vary depending on the gender of the jacket. You'll find more detail on each below:

 

 

 

 

 
Don't want a hooded jacket? No problem - Every color option in the range is also available in a hoodless version. You'll be given the option to select color and whether your NESSH jacket is hooded or hoodless via a survey after the campaign has ended.

 

At Dark Peak, we’re passionate about great products, but we also believe it’s not enough for a business to simply strive for profit, benefiting only a handful of shareholders.
As a business, we have an opportunity to improve society, to give back and help bring issues to the forefront of people’s minds. Which is why we decided to adopt a One Sold, One Given model, by promising that for every jacket we sell, we’ll donate another jacket to a person affected by homelessness, in the country you live in. Help us help the vulnerable in your home country.

We’ve received some great question about how our One Sold, One Given promise works, here are some answers:
Q: Is the jacket you give the same as the NESSH jacket?
A: No. For many reasons the NESSH jacket is not suitable for the needs of someone without permanent shelter. Knowing this we’re working with charities and directly with homeless people to develop a different jacket, designed to be as warm and as hard wearing as possible. It’s cut longer in the body to stop drafts, and has a deep drawstring hood. We have selected a water resistant, hardwearing polyester shell combined with synthetic insulation fill that retains insulating properties when wet. One of these jackets will be donated for every NESSH jacket sold.
Q: Is the jacket you donate branded with a Dark Peak logo? 
A: No. The jacket we give is unbranded. This reduces it’s intrinsic value and reduces the temptation for someone to sell it, instead of wear it.
Q: Will the jacket being given on my behalf, go to someone in my home country? 
A: Yes! We are working with charities worldwide and wherever possible we will donate the jacket on your behalf, to a charity in your home country.
Q: If I return my jacket for a refund, will you still give a jacket away? 
A: No. Unfortunately, we can only give a jacket for every jacket sold. If you return your jacket for a refund, we cannot then afford to also give a jacket away.
Q: How do you donate the jackets? 
A: We work with charities in different countries to provide bulk donation of jackets to homeless shelters, who will then distribute them to people in need.
Q: Can I personally sign up to receive a donated jacket? 
A: No. Unfortunately we are not able to donate to individuals at this time. After our campaign ends our website will have a link to charities we partner with.
 

One Warm Coat is a US national non-profit organization that works to provide a free, warm coat to any person in need. They support individuals, groups, companies and organizations across the U.S. by providing the tools and resources needed to hold a successful coat drive, collecting lightly used coats for donation to people in need. In 2017/18 season they helped arrange donation of over 600,000 coats to people in need across the U.S. and 7 other countries. 
We are excited to continue building relationships with charities around the world in your home country. If you are associated with a charity or shelter, who have need for the jackets we'll donate, please get in touch.

 

We spent 2 years making one of the best insulated mid-layers in the world. Testing every last material and refining every last feature, until it was ready for you.

<h3>                                    Why XProtect?</h3>
<p>The Xprotect is not just a accessory for the ipad but a necessity. There is no case on the market that can offer protection like ""X"", while still allowing you to use all of your ipad's functions.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">

<p><strong>                        </strong>                                 <strong>Our story:</strong></p>
<p>This concept started when we noticed the limitations of the iPad. Here I have this powerful machine but I am afraid to take it anywhere. Why should the iPad be limited to on land only? Why should you have to worry about going near water or dusty areas? Well, you don't anymore!</p>
<p>So we put our heads together and many prototypes and designs later, we have Xprotect. We have spent countless hours making sure we did not limit the iPad at all with this case. We have 1 of each color created right now and all three have been tested 30 feet underwater for 30 minutes, with not a drop of water in the case after testing. With our Beta model, we need your support to make this a reality in stores across America.</p>
<p><strong>How could you benefit from Xprotect?</strong></p>
<p>1. Taking underwater photo's and video with your iPad.</p>
<p>2. Go to the beach and put all of your valuables in the case (The shoe is no longer the go to place.)</p>
<p>3. Hiking and camping in bad weather.</p>
<p>4. Reading in the bath tub.</p>
<p>5. Playing games in the pool.</p>
<p>6. Bring it to the water park and keep your money and phone in the case.</p>
<p>7. Cooking in the kitchen.</p>
<p>8. Let your kids play with out worrying about food or fingerprints on the screen.</p>
<p>9. Any dusty environment.</p>
<p>10. Out on a boat, ( it floats). </p>

</div></div>","Why XProtect?
The Xprotect is not just a accessory for the ipad but a necessity. There is no case on the market that can offer protection like ""X"", while still allowing you to use all of your ipad's functions.

Perfect for using in the kitchen.
                                                         Our story:
This concept started when we noticed the limitations of the iPad. Here I have this powerful machine but I am afraid to take it anywhere. Why should the iPad be limited to on land only? Why should you have to worry about going near water or dusty areas? Well, you don't anymore!
So we put our heads together and many prototypes and designs later, we have Xprotect. We have spent countless hours making sure we did not limit the iPad at all with this case. We have 1 of each color created right now and all three have been tested 30 feet underwater for 30 minutes, with not a drop of water in the case after testing. With our Beta model, we need your support to make this a reality in stores across America.
How could you benefit from Xprotect?
1. Taking underwater photo's and video with your iPad.
2. Go to the beach and put all of your valuables in the case (The shoe is no longer the go to place.)
3. Hiking and camping in bad weather.
4. Reading in the bath tub.
5. Playing games in the pool.
6. Bring it to the water park and keep your money and phone in the case.
7. Cooking in the kitchen.
8. Let your kids play with out worrying about food or fingerprints on the screen.
9. Any dusty environment.
10. Out on a boat, ( it floats).

Perfect for the pool
                                                 Xprotect Stats
1. High quality material in waterproof PVC provides complete protection
2. 100% waterproof material
3. Access all of the iPad's features through the case
4. Clear front case allows you to see the entire screen
5. Precision molded smart case for maximum protection
6. IP68 under water rating. ( Highest rating you can have for a under water case.)

Choose from any of the three colors.
                             

The rear window allows you to still have access to the camera.
           

Absolutely no worry about water again, it floats

You also forgot to bring that special offer, discount, reward, coupon, club card, or gift card that would have saved you money.

<p><strong>I've been enjoying brilliant colors and unique clothes since I was a young child.

Comfort and practicality are wedded with flattering style and unique design.           <br/>Adding clothes for men and kids has created the satisfaction of truly having something for everyone.

I've been enjoying brilliant colors and unique clothes since I was a young child. I created a clothing line designed for real women, influenced by my grandmother's handmade dresses, the vintage dresses my mother collected, my own thrift store finds, and my amazing collection of never-used vintage fabrics. Comfort and practicality are wedded with flattering style and unique design.           Adding clothes for men and kids has created the satisfaction of truly having something for everyone. Each piece from Lush Life is made in a limited production run or is one-of-a-kind, allowing everyone to enjoy the luxury of a rare piece of clothing at a reasonable price.  I love spreading joy, positive self-image and creative vision through my work.  It's time to reach more people with Lush Life beauty. With a wide-array of colorful designs, customers are often overwhelmed by choices.  Creating an eye-catching display that allows an easy shopping experience will draw people into the booth and encourage them to spend more time shopping.  I will purchase a grid display, waterfall racks, and, with enough funds, a professional grade canopy.   Additional funds will go towards other 

display improvements, such as fabric for curtains, lighting, rugs, mirror, etc.  Lush Life has been operating as a one-woman cabin industry for almost ten years now, and it's time to grow.  Motivated by a desire to have a positive impact on society, my dream is to create a worker-owned business that demonstrates how  an ethically-run business can be financially successful. Improving the display is a first step to increasing sales and moving the business to the point of creating jobs.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1>Designing LunaR</h1>
<p>The LunaR team has put endless hours and effort into designing LunaR and optimizing its solar-harvesting capabilities. We’ve made countless prototypes. Tested. Refined. Redesigned. And finally reached a result that satisfied our thirst to redefine the smartwatch landscape.  </p>
<p>As Chief Designer, Gavin has been responsible for the design ethics and optimized comfort of LunaR. Known for an aversion to the word “no,” he helped the team push boundaries farther than they thought possible and reach goals that seemed unattainable.</p>

<h1>Indoor and outdoor charging</h1>
<p>Our days revolve around the sun, but we don’t always stop when it sets. Like us, LunaR can rely on both natural and artificial light. With a daily exposure of as little as 1 hour (&gt;10k LUX), LunaR's solar panel can harvest enough power to deliver infinite battery life. You can easily check your watch’s current light-harvesting levels through the LunaR app.</p>

<h1>  </h1>
<h1>A clear breakthrough in solar technology  </h1>
<p>LunaR’s exclusive transparent solar panel was pioneered by Sunpartner, a leading solar technology company from France. Coined WYSIPS® (What You See Is Photovoltaic Surface), this innovative technology harvests energy from a variety of light sources while still delivering allowing clear visibility through the panel.</p>

<h1>Recharge with your watch</h1>
<p>Like LunaR, we also run on sunshine. Vitamin D is essential for strong bones and a healthy immune system. It has also been shown to reduce the risk of depression, multiple sclerosis, heart disease and the flu. LunaR lets you set your own daily sunshine exposure goals. Your LunaR app will keep you notified about your progression.</p>

Introducing LunaR, the world's first solar powered smartwatch.
LunaR combines intelligent functionality and a timeless aesthetic with breakthrough solar technology. Designed with travelers, outdoor enthusiasts and watch aficionados in mind, LunaR is a modern, self-sustaining and functional wearable that will keep you connected, informed and on time––without the need to plug in and recharge.

Designing LunaR
The LunaR team has put endless hours and effort into designing LunaR and optimizing its solar-harvesting capabilities. We’ve made countless prototypes. Tested. Refined. Redesigned. And finally reached a result that satisfied our thirst to redefine the smartwatch landscape.  
As Chief Designer, Gavin has been responsible for the design ethics and optimized comfort of LunaR. Known for an aversion to the word “no,” he helped the team push boundaries farther than they thought possible and reach goals that seemed unattainable.

LunaR's transparent solar panel harvests both natural and artificial light, and will retain full charge with a intensity of >10K Lux
 
Indoor and outdoor charging
Our days revolve around the sun, but we don’t always stop when it sets. Like us, LunaR can rely on both natural and artificial light. With a daily exposure of as little as 1 hour (>10k LUX), LunaR's solar panel can harvest enough power to deliver infinite battery life. You can easily check your watch’s current light-harvesting levels through the LunaR app.
  

  
A clear breakthrough in solar technology  
LunaR’s exclusive transparent solar panel was pioneered by Sunpartner, a leading solar technology company from France. Coined WYSIPS® (What You See Is Photovoltaic Surface), this innovative technology harvests energy from a variety of light sources while still delivering allowing clear visibility through the panel.

Recharge with your watch
Like LunaR, we also run on sunshine. Vitamin D is essential for strong bones and a healthy immune system. It has also been shown to reduce the risk of depression, multiple sclerosis, heart disease and the flu. LunaR lets you set your own daily sunshine exposure goals. Your LunaR app will keep you notified about your progression.

LunaR was thoughtfully designed to enhance travel, outdoor activity, and everyday experiences without ever causing the inconvenience of a low-battery or dying device.
 
When you travel, LunaR can show you 2 time zones: your local time (displayed through LED) and home time (displayed on hands).
 
Dual time zone
LunaR keeps you on time, wherever you are. With its built-in world clock function, LunaR easily reports the time for your current and home locations. This means you can display two time zones on one (analog) watch, keeping you seamlessly in sync with friends, family and colleagues.

LunaR features integrated sunrise and sunset technology, providing accurate data for your current location through both LunaR embedded LEDs and on the dashboard page of the LunaR app.
 

  
 

 
App integration

 

 
LunaR's embedded LED array and vibration technology integrates with all of your apps, providing discreet, at-a-glance notifications so you don't have to upset the flow of your daily activities to stay connected, informed and on schedule.

Sleep monitoring


 
Our research shows that healthy sleep is as important as physical exertion—that’s why LunaR gives you feedback on your waking activities AND your sleep. 
LunaR analyzes sleep health with a refined algorithm that tracks deep sleep, light sleep and time awake, evaluating data so you can easily understand and optimize your sleep habits. 
With bedtime integration, the LunaR app will alert you when it’s time for bed, automatically putting LunaR in sleep-tracking mode. At your designated wakeup time, you’ll be notified by a gentle vibration alarm.

<p>What would you say if the jeans you are wearing right now were not only a fashionable cut and made of premium denim, but also hand-sewn to your exact measures? All this at no extra costs for marketing, thanks to Indiegogo’s crowdfunding. Sounds exciting? Read on! With jeans today you will find a lot of common problems: uninspiring designs, limited choices of materials, unflattering cuts, and quite simply jeans that don’t sit well. The solution to any of these issues usually comes at great expense for the buyer. Jean the Tailor jeans turn all these problems into their strong points. Here’s how:</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""font-family: arial; line-height: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt; color: #564b3e;"">Made to your Measures</h3>
<p>Jean the Tailor produces individual cuts for individual people. That means the jeans are sewn specifically for you — not just in some groups of “forms”, <strong>but by your exact measures</strong> — it’s a perfect fit! We achieve this by drawing an individual cut for every single pair that we create, and cutting them all out of denim one by one.</p>

<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.jeantailor.com/indiegogo-2013/pic-3.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 40px;""/>For Jean the Tailor jeans we use the best in denim — great quality cotton from Europe, and for our premium line for the true denim lover the best of selvedge from Japan’s Kuroki mills. We met with Mr. Kuroki in Paris, and hand-picked the tastiest produce from his factory to satisfy even the most capricious aficionados of raw selvedge denim.</p>

<p><strong>The Classic<br/></strong>High quality European denim, available in stiff (100% cotton) or stretch (2% elastane) denim variants. The classic model looks good with almost anything you can imagine — be it a casual outfit for everyday wear or a night out in the club — the perfect fit is always in style.</p>
<p><strong>Selvedge straight-cut</strong><br/>The best in selvedge denim for the true denim aficionado. The eternal straight cut, made of Japanese 14.5 oz selvedge denim straight from Japan’s Kuroki mills comes with an ornamental strip of denim self-edge on the 5th pocket.</p>
<p><strong>TrouserJeans</strong><br/>A real class of its own — the authentic trouser look, except in denim. Complete with trouser crease lines and trouser pockets. Available in stiff (100% cotton) or stretch (2% elastane) denim. Perfect for a more sophisticated look with a shirt or blouse.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""font-family: arial; line-height: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt; color: #564b3e;"">True gender equality</h3>
<p>Jean the Tailor offers a true rarity — women’s straight cut selvedge jeans. You won’t easily find this type of cut in any shops at all, let alone made of selvedge. The difficulty in creating this cut is to preserve the original selvedge lining of the denim, which shows on the hem of the jeans. We solve this problem when creating the individual cut, making sure than the straight cut sits well even on the curviest forms.</p>

<h3 style=""font-family: arial; line-height: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt; color: #564b3e;"">Made in Europe</h3>
<p>For Jean theTailor jeans the production cannot be outsourced to countries specialized in mass-production. Our way of creating jeans requires a close cooperation between the processes of designing, drafting, cutting, and sewing. In addition, we begin creating your jeans only after we receive your measurements, and this means the production of each pair needs to start ASAP. By keeping the production local we also ensure that you get your jeans faster.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""font-family: arial; line-height: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt; color: #564b3e;"">Avoiding extra costs</h3>
<p>Our jeans are not being sold in any retail stores, not only because we just can’t do that (we need your measures to create the cut, remember?), but this also helps us avoid all the mark-up costs retailers usually charge.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""font-family: arial; line-height: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt; color: #564b3e;"">Tailor made</h3>
<p>Jean Tailor jeans are also tailor made, which means they are each produced individually, by one master assembling them, and not on an assembly belt, by parts. This is a rare practice nowadays, but it assures that the quality of our jeans rises.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""font-family: arial; line-height: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt; color: #564b3e;"">Customizable</h3>
<p>With the extended goal we aim to offer you the ability to customize the ingredients for your jeans. Already now, through Indiegogo, we provide a choice in thread colors, button/rivets designs, and washing options. By reaching the extended goal we will make a wider variety of washes, different denims and pocket linings, back-pocket designs, and custom laser engravings available as well.</p>

<h3 style=""font-family: arial; line-height: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt; color: #564b3e;"">How will the measurements be taken?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>There are several options available to you when it comes to shaping your jeans the way you want.</p>
<p>Barring the option of going to one of our partner ateliers, the best choice will always be to visit a professional tailor who will take your measurements for you. Just make sure to explain to them that this will be for jeans, not trousers, and mention whatever wishes you might have regarding the shape of the jeans.</p>
<p>If you already have a pair that you have spent a lot of time on wearing-in and find it sits great on you, you can simply take the measures off that pair, and we will make you an identical one in size.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the campaign we will also be posting detailed instructions on how to take your measurements by yourself, should you decide to do that.</p>
<p>You can also simply choose a standard size from a standard size table, or choose a standard size and add your own modifications, etc...</p>
<p>Remember, we are open to discussing all the details once we start accepting your orders, and will make sure you will find an option that will be tailor made for you.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""font-family: arial; line-height: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt; color: #564b3e;"">How soon can I get my jeans?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>We will start the production of your jeans right after the campaign ends, which will be in the first half of October. Depending on the queue of orders the production of your jeans can take anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks. The Early Bird perks will of course be treated with priority.</p>
<p>After your jeans are done, we send them to you straight away. Factoring in whatever time is necessary to ship them to your location, you should receive your jeans in 1-2 months after the campaign ends.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""font-family: arial; line-height: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt; color: #564b3e;"">What if they don't fit?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Anything can happen, so if by any chance we mess up and send you jeans that are absolutely off the measures you have provided, we will make you some new ones. </p>
<p>However it can also happen that you lose/gain some weight in the meantime, which we unfortunately cannot account for. Therefore if you plan to go on a diet or to bulk up in the near future, please consider that when sending us your measures, and factor in any differences that may occur.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""font-family: arial; line-height: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-size: 16pt; color: #564b3e;"">What are the shipping options?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>For both the jeans and the smaller perks, such as the keychain or the keyholder we can ship globally, however you will need to calculate in around 2-10€ for shipping, depending on your location.</p>
<p>Since we are located in Latvia, EU, shipping across Europe is easier and therefore cheaper.</p>
<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","What would you say if the jeans you are wearing right now were not only a fashionable cut and made of premium denim, but also hand-sewn to your exact measures? All this at no extra costs for marketing, thanks to Indiegogo’s crowdfunding. Sounds exciting? Read on! With jeans today you will find a lot of common problems: uninspiring designs, limited choices of materials, unflattering cuts, and quite simply jeans that don’t sit well. The solution to any of these issues usually comes at great expense for the buyer. Jean the Tailor jeans turn all these problems into their strong points. Here’s how:
 
Made to your Measures
Jean the Tailor produces individual cuts for individual people. That means the jeans are sewn specifically for you — not just in some groups of “forms”, but by your exact measures — it’s a perfect fit! We achieve this by drawing an individual cut for every single pair that we create, and cutting them all out of denim one by one.

 
The Best in Denim
For Jean the Tailor jeans we use the best in denim — great quality cotton from Europe, and for our premium line for the true denim lover the best of selvedge from Japan’s Kuroki mills. We met with Mr. Kuroki in Paris, and hand-picked the tastiest produce from his factory to satisfy even the most capricious aficionados of raw selvedge denim.
“...for the true denim lover the best of selvedge from Japan’s Kuroki mills...”
 
The Models
The designs for our models aim to be versatile as well as functional. For Indiegogo we offer three types of models: a classic jeans look, a selvedge straight-cut, and a classy trouser-jeans model. Each variation comes both in men’s and women’s versions.



ClassicJeans Look

 

SelvedgeStraight-Cut

 

ClassyTrouser-Jeans



The ClassicHigh quality European denim, available in stiff (100% cotton) or stretch (2% elastane) denim variants. The classic model looks good with almost anything you can imagine — be it a casual outfit for everyday wear or a night out in the club — the perfect fit is always in style.
Selvedge straight-cutThe best in selvedge denim for the true denim aficionado. The eternal straight cut, made of Japanese 14.5 oz selvedge denim straight from Japan’s Kuroki mills comes with an ornamental strip of denim self-edge on the 5th pocket.
TrouserJeansA real class of its own — the authentic trouser look, except in denim. Complete with trouser crease lines and trouser pockets. Available in stiff (100% cotton) or stretch (2% elastane) denim. Perfect for a more sophisticated look with a shirt or blouse.
 
True gender equality
Jean the Tailor offers a true rarity — women’s straight cut selvedge jeans. You won’t easily find this type of cut in any shops at all, let alone made of selvedge. The difficulty in creating this cut is to preserve the original selvedge lining of the denim, which shows on the hem of the jeans. We solve this problem when creating the individual cut, making sure than the straight cut sits well even on the curviest forms.

 
Made in Europe
For Jean theTailor jeans the production cannot be outsourced to countries specialized in mass-production. Our way of creating jeans requires a close cooperation between the processes of designing, drafting, cutting, and sewing. In addition, we begin creating your jeans only after we receive your measurements, and this means the production of each pair needs to start ASAP. By keeping the production local we also ensure that you get your jeans faster.
 
Avoiding extra costs
Our jeans are not being sold in any retail stores, not only because we just can’t do that (we need your measures to create the cut, remember?), but this also helps us avoid all the mark-up costs retailers usually charge.
 
Tailor made
Jean Tailor jeans are also tailor made, which means they are each produced individually, by one master assembling them, and not on an assembly belt, by parts. This is a rare practice nowadays, but it assures that the quality of our jeans rises.
 
Customizable
With the extended goal we aim to offer you the ability to customize the ingredients for your jeans. Already now, through Indiegogo, we provide a choice in thread colors, button/rivets designs, and washing options. By reaching the extended goal we will make a wider variety of washes, different denims and pocket linings, back-pocket designs, and custom laser engravings available as well.

How It Works?
So you’ve ordered a pair of jeans from the perks, and the deadline of the project arrives. What now?


Step 1: The measurements
We will send you a survey, in which we ask you for your measures and options. In terms of size you can:

Step 2: The Cut
Our skilled patternmakers will create your individual cut from your measures. Yes, this is all done individually, and the way we make it possible is through clever use of algorithms in patterns, and experience in making individual cuts.



Step 3: The manufacturing & Delivering
Now the jeans are cut out of the denim, and everything is individually assembled, with one master working per jeans.  After they’re done and measured, they are sent off to post-processing — washing and riveting.  Your jeans are ready and you will receive them per mail. We can ship all around the world.

We Invest In: — Jean Tailor designer initiative (to help new designers get a foothold in the industry through us); — hiring people; — materials; — development and testing;You Get: — production of made to measure jeans; — crazy new designs of jeans; — an extra array in denim selection (hemp denim, rare japanese selvedge, etc); — colored denim (the whole gamut of colors); — extra customizations (patterned pocket linings, etc.); — quality improvements (edging on inside seams, strengthening of materials, etc.)
 
 
 
Our Story

We're focused on developing great jeans: we think this is important, as people wear them a lot of the time. We aim to improve on every aspect of the product, and yet keep the price affordable. The jeans you see here on Indiegogo represent our first line of products, which reflect our high standards and ideals when it comes to design and development. We are a team of enthusiastic professionals coming from very different backgrounds, each of us filling essential roles in the project. Meet the team! 
Ilya Bulichev Fashion designer with specialization in jeans. Ilya has been working with fashion and jeans for most of his life. He has more than 10 years of experience specifically with denim, and runs his small fashion atelier in his home city of Riga. Ilya is the one who knows everything about jeans styles, technology and design. 
Yanis Lubins As the original author of the idea behind the project, with over 10 years experience in sales and marketing, Yanis is the guy you contact if you want to cooperate with us through our partner program. 
Boris Lytvinenko Solving the problems of logistics, Boris makes sure we have all the great denim ingredients to work with, and takes care of the delivery of your jeans. 
Sergey Potapov Running a smooth and lean manufacturing process of your made to measure orders is a tricky task, and Sergey ensures the intricate workings behind this process result in a great end-product for you. 
Roman Sidoroff (from lab9.pro) Our graphics guru. Roman is a world class graphics designer with over 15 years of experience. He is behind all our visual presentation material and marketing consultant. All the cool graphics you see (logo, labels, website, banners, etc.) were designed and executed by Roman.
 
 
 
Questions?
How will the measurements be taken?

There are several options available to you when it comes to shaping your jeans the way you want.
Barring the option of going to one of our partner ateliers, the best choice will always be to visit a professional tailor who will take your measurements for you. Just make sure to explain to them that this will be for jeans, not trousers, and mention whatever wishes you might have regarding the shape of the jeans.
If you already have a pair that you have spent a lot of time on wearing-in and find it sits great on you, you can simply take the measures off that pair, and we will make you an identical one in size.
Towards the end of the campaign we will also be posting detailed instructions on how to take your measurements by yourself, should you decide to do that.
You can also simply choose a standard size from a standard size table, or choose a standard size and add your own modifications, etc...
Remember, we are open to discussing all the details once we start accepting your orders, and will make sure you will find an option that will be tailor made for you.

 
How soon can I get my jeans?

We will start the production of your jeans right after the campaign ends, which will be in the first half of October. Depending on the queue of orders the production of your jeans can take anywhere from 2 to 6 weeks. The Early Bird perks will of course be treated with priority.
After your jeans are done, we send them to you straight away. Factoring in whatever time is necessary to ship them to your location, you should receive your jeans in 1-2 months after the campaign ends.

 
What if they don't fit?

Anything can happen, so if by any chance we mess up and send you jeans that are absolutely off the measures you have provided, we will make you some new ones. 
However it can also happen that you lose/gain some weight in the meantime, which we unfortunately cannot account for. Therefore if you plan to go on a diet or to bulk up in the near future, please consider that when sending us your measures, and factor in any differences that may occur.

 
What are the shipping options?

For both the jeans and the smaller perks, such as the keychain or the keyholder we can ship globally, however you will need to calculate in around 2-10€ for shipping, depending on your location.
Since we are located in Latvia, EU, shipping across Europe is easier and therefore cheaper.",30.0,0,"1 Campaign
