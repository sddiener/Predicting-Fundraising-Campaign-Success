<h3>What is the Get Home Smart Card?</h3>
<p>The Get Home Smart Card is a Taxi Gift Card that provides a Taxi Ride for your loved ones. </p>
<p>The concept of the Get Home Smart Card was created as my son, Bryce, was turning 21. I was concerned about his safety and that he would not make the Smart choice of taking a Taxi home from a night out.  I wondered why there wasn't a Gift Card I could give him - that he could ONLY use for a Taxi ride. This is how the idea of the Get Home Smart Card originated.</p>
<p>As the idea grew, we realized there are many layers to this Taxi Card. </p>
<p><strong>* </strong> <strong>Teens</strong> started becoming a huge aspect to the Get Home Smart Card.  We realized that Teens feel they have no option but to get in a car with a friend even if they feel uncomfortable.  I did a survey at the local high school and over 89% of teens said they would NOT call their parents to pick them up if they were in an ""Uncomfortable Situation"".  This is scary! I am a single Mom of 3 kids and my older 2 kids (ages 24 and 22) told me they would have <strong>never</strong> called me!  Even though I told them they could!</p>
<p><strong>* </strong> <strong>College Kid's</strong> are a large part of our model, so they can travel safe around their campus.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong>  <strong>Adults,</strong> we need to change our thought process and use Taxi's if we are going out and have any cocktails.  There are many campaigns that tell us to not drive drunk, but we are never told to take a Taxi, we need to change our own mindset.</p>
<p><strong>*</strong>  <strong>Seniors</strong> will also benefit from the Get Home Smart Card, giving them a little freedom if they no longer drive and take the pressure off their children who may not be able to bring them to a doctor appointment.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need to Launch</h3>
The Get Home Smart Card is Patent Pending since September 2008 and Trademark.  We will have a rewards program to encourage continued use and we will connect to the nearest Taxi Member through the callers phone.  All transactions will be done through the smart phone with the Taxi Companies through our APP.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The <strong>ONLY</strong> thing that has held us back in launching is funding.  With this economy, it is very hard to get funding.  We have been creative trying to recieve funding by entering contests - we are a 2 time finalist in the Pepsi Refresh Grant Project.  We have been featured on ABC 7 Chicago Inventors Segment with Janet Davies and have been written up in all the Chicagoloand Newspapers.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>One of our biggest allies is the Illinois Liquor Department Education Manager and we are waiting to find out if the Illinois Department of Transportation Division of Traffic Safety is going to give a a grant, we find out in August!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What we need the money for is the programing of the APP and the front and back end of the website.  I have been in contact with APP developers and we know exactly how it needs to be programmed and work for our business model.  All the other aspects are already done, our website, our name, our eye catching Logo. </div>
<div> </div>

<h3>Get Home Smart Card Impact on the Community</h3>
<p>We will have a strong impact on the community through education against drunk driving.  In High Schools and Colleges we want to educate Teens to know they can ""Speak Up"" if they are Uncomfortable in someones car and the person is driving erratic.  This is our ""Bee Smart"" Campaign.  We will get the community involved in helping us get the word out.</p>
<p>We have always referred to ourselves as a Safety Minded Company and have always approached this as a Safety Campaign.</p>

</div>
<p> </p></div>","What is the Get Home Smart Card?
The Get Home Smart Card is a Taxi Gift Card that provides a Taxi Ride for your loved ones. 
The concept of the Get Home Smart Card was created as my son, Bryce, was turning 21. I was concerned about his safety and that he would not make the Smart choice of taking a Taxi home from a night out.  I wondered why there wasn't a Gift Card I could give him - that he could ONLY use for a Taxi ride. This is how the idea of the Get Home Smart Card originated.
As the idea grew, we realized there are many layers to this Taxi Card. 
*  Teens started becoming a huge aspect to the Get Home Smart Card.  We realized that Teens feel they have no option but to get in a car with a friend even if they feel uncomfortable.  I did a survey at the local high school and over 89% of teens said they would NOT call their parents to pick them up if they were in an ""Uncomfortable Situation"".  This is scary! I am a single Mom of 3 kids and my older 2 kids (ages 24 and 22) told me they would have never called me!  Even though I told them they could!
*  College Kid's are a large part of our model, so they can travel safe around their campus.
*  Adults, we need to change our thought process and use Taxi's if we are going out and have any cocktails.  There are many campaigns that tell us to not drive drunk, but we are never told to take a Taxi, we need to change our own mindset.
*  Seniors will also benefit from the Get Home Smart Card, giving them a little freedom if they no longer drive and take the pressure off their children who may not be able to bring them to a doctor appointment.


What We Need to Launch
The Get Home Smart Card is Patent Pending since September 2008 and Trademark.  We will have a rewards program to encourage continued use and we will connect to the nearest Taxi Member through the callers phone.  All transactions will be done through the smart phone with the Taxi Companies through our APP.
 
The ONLY thing that has held us back in launching is funding.  With this economy, it is very hard to get funding.  We have been creative trying to recieve funding by entering contests - we are a 2 time finalist in the Pepsi Refresh Grant Project.  We have been featured on ABC 7 Chicago Inventors Segment with Janet Davies and have been written up in all the Chicagoloand Newspapers.  
 
One of our biggest allies is the Illinois Liquor Department Education Manager and we are waiting to find out if the Illinois Department of Transportation Division of Traffic Safety is going to give a a grant, we find out in August!
 
What we need the money for is the programing of the APP and the front and back end of the website.  I have been in contact with APP developers and we know exactly how it needs to be programmed and work for our business model.  All the other aspects are already done, our website, our name, our eye catching Logo.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
Follow your phone into a new audio adventure: Hackney Hear uses your mobile to play interviews, features, poetry, music and new writing depending on your location. <br/><br/>Your movements will trigger audio clips as you walk, creating your own soundscape. A whopping 400 stories will be tagged over one of London's coolest areas swathing the Olympic borough in glorious sound wherever you go through a new smartphone GPS app. <br/><p> </p>
<p>Why us? Well, we're the team behind the award-winning Hackney Podcast - a sort of London version of Radiolab - and this is a kind of interactive radio programme, where famous and ordinary residents share their stories as music scores your journey, with the Olympic stadium on the skyline.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We'll be preserving conversations with musicians, writers, engineers, mothers, truants, hairdressers... anyone with an interesting story to tell.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Hackney Hear will be available from Jan 2012 - just as London gears up for the Olympics. There'll be an extra 500,000 vistors to the area over the summer and we aim to be THE voice of Hackney to the outside world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No matter where you stand in the borough, there will be a glorious noise of music, stories, poetry and archive from our rich past - all channeled direct to your ears.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It doesn't take much to make a difference: every donation will add another voice to the mix. The more stories we have, the better the experience for listeners. Making 400 mini-documentaries is no small feat!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Even a tiny donation can provide travel expenses to a volunteer - and they might come back with an interview that makes grown men weep/laugh/gape. THAT's the kind of reaction we're after. And you can make it happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why is this funding page in $$$ and not £££?</h3>
<p>Well, this being an American site we've adopted their currency for this fundraising scheme and we think the project should appeal globally - you might well be over for a vacation and lured over to London's trendy East End for the day... maybe or visiting for the Olympics, or you might just want to support a really innovative project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the dollars shouldn't matter - IndieGoGo/PayPal will convert the currency for you. So if you were to donate $10, that would take about £7 out of your account.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Over the next few months we'll be requesting help on elements from voicework to poetry - so add yourself to our mailing list and we'll keep you in the loop: head to hackneyhear.com for details.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you're a business or individual that would like to get involved in a more substantial way (cheques are always welcome!) then contact francesca@hackneyhear.com</p>

<h3>Why does this soccer ball have soft fins?</h3>
<p><img alt=""Five KixFriction Colors"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/images.ecwid.com/images/410158/37162461.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Kixsports is about to introduce a new version of its KixFriction ball.  This coming version is hand sewn, comes in bright neon colors and has rounded soft rubber fins.  We came to this invention by observing the disadvantages of off pitch play with a normal soccer ball. When soccer is played in the street or a gym the ball action is not like that on a soccer pitch. The ball is fast and rolls on forever. The energy normally absorbed by grass remains in the ball. When playing in a confined space, players have to pull their punches or the ball flies off too far too fast. Futsol balls and other balls available to reduce these effects sacrifice the weight and feel of a normal soccer ball.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://images-cdn.ecwid.com/images/410158/36687030.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""KixFriction Neon Yellow""/></p>
<p>So we set out to make a ball that is the world standard official size and weight, and reacts absolutely normally to body contact. However our ball behaves differently when flying or rolling. We invented a ball that feels indistinguishable from a normal ball when kicked or headed. The fins on our ball are so soft that you cannot feel them in play.</p>
<p>The result is a soccer ball that reacts to you just like any other normal soccer ball but rolls as if rolling on grass and flies through the air only about half as far.</p>
<p>You can see a review of our presentation of the features and benefits of this ball at the Stanford University GSB Cool Products Expo at <a href=""http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/04/14/BUF71O2JC5.DTL&amp;feed=rss.technology"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/04/14/BUF71O2JC5.DTL&amp;feed=rss.technology</a></p>
<p>The Kixsports team has been developing innovative sports gear since 2009. Our first product, the KixKube won a training product of the year award for 2010 at the NSCAA convention. This five sided goal is the first to make one-v-one soccer possible anywhere. <br/>The Kixsports team includes NCAA coaches, product designers, world class marketers and inovation specialists.</p>

<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>To get the sort of quality performance we wanted we determined that the ball material must also be of high quality. After experimenting with both machine sewn and hand sewn balls we decided that hand sewn balls provide the best and longest lasting performance.

their experience of freedom in the west and also talk freely about why they left

As little as $1 can be donated via the Contribute Now button.Short Summary
We are a group of atheists from the Middle
East which most of you know at least from watching or hearing about
the tragic events that the news channels bring from our religion &
terrorism plagued region. We, as
atheists in the Arab countries, suffer a lot of oppression since our countries
do not believe in freedom of thinking or expression. The types of oppression we
face come in many ways and ranges from threats and imprisonment to
actually being killed as a punishment for being an apostate from Islam. Here are some true
examples of the reality we live in:
 
1- Saudi Arabian journalist
Raif Badawi was sentenced to
seven years in prison and 600 lashes for the crime of “criticizing Islam” through his website and twitter account.
2- Saudi Arabian writer Hamza Kashgari, 24, imprisoned
since February 2012 on charges of apostasy for criticizing the Prophet Muhammad
on Twitter.
3- Alber
Saber is an Egyptian blogger arrested on 13 September 2012 on allegations
of having shared the YouTube trailer for the anti-Islam film Innocence of
Muslims on his Facebook page.
…. And many more who we
might never heard of.
 
 Right now as atheists in the Arab countries we
rely heavily on social networks such as Facebook and twitter where we can work
underground with fake names, of course, but still even in those social
networks we've been followed by the Muslim masses led by those evil
religious leaders and they group flag our Facebook pages or twitter accounts
which are in turn closed automatically by the system until we appeal the
decision of closing and as soon as we get back out accounts the soon they start
again.
 
 Other method we use as well to reach to the
masses of Muslims is through relying on Arabic atheists who live outside like
Europe or the US where no persecution can be practiced on them. They video blog (vlog) on YouTube about
their experience of freedom in the west and also talk freely about why they left
Islam to atheism. But even those YouTube channels were not
spared by them and they started flagging them and one of these channels is the
channel of an Egyptian vlogger goes by the nick name: MasryMolhed, which mean “Egyptian atheist”. This was his first channel: www.youtube.com/user/masrymolhed,
where they flagged him
for impersonation!!  (. Even though this man is not
impersonating anyone but still the mass flagging those Muslims are doing to his
channel manages to close it. And since the appeal process is a very tedious one
and even if he appeals they’ll mass flag again.
 ----------------------
So,
this campaign is about raising money for the cost of creating a website away
from those social network websites that force their unfair policies on us
atheists without protecting our content from being flagged falsely every time.
By
raising money for creating our own website, we atheists can come together and
post our content in one site and most importantly protecting our content from
being flagged by those religious people who don’t respect the views of those
who disagree with them.
 --------------------------------
 
What We Need
 
·   
We
need to raise money for the cost of at least 3 years of web-hosting at
bluehost.com and the cost of obtaining our website domain which costs about 12
USD a year and lastly we need a web designer who will help us design and
program the site so that we could upload videos or even articles freely away
from censorship.
· According to
bluehost.com, web-hosting cost 4 USD a month if we take a 36 months

years which amount to 12 USD per year, plus the web designer and programmer who

calculating the costs we came up with 400 USD for hosting the site for 3 years
only plus 100$ could be used to advertise our new site. After that, we
think that the website ads that we’ll put in our future website could secure
the future hosting costs.
·   If we can’t reach
our goal, we still have hope by trying to raise money through some students
secretly but of course your donations would  ease it a lot on us since we
are working underground out of the fear of persecution.
 
 
The
Impact & Goals
 
Our main goals from creating this website
are:
 · Creating a platform for all Arab thinkers
whether atheists or agnostics to speak their mind away from social network
censorship and misuse of their flagging systems by extremists.
 ·  Reaching to those people
who are taught thinking outside of the box is ""haram"", unlawful or a
taboo and to clear the bad images that religious leaders put in them about us
atheists.
· Teaching people the importance of tolerance and that we
(atheists or any minor religious or non-religious groups) are not danger
to their religion or belief as long as they keep their religion
from influencing others or holding back their freedom of expression.
· Teaching and helping people understand the importance of
adopting a secular thinking and attitude as well as increasing
people's awareness to the importance of individual's value in
the society regardless of their religion or believe & how that
contributes to spreading tolerance among the society and eventually & gradually
imposing it upon our dictator rulers in all Arab countries.

Thank you so much to all supporters and perkers!
If you feel you're too late and would like to get a Smartrap anyway, we setup a webshop ( two languages there ) : imprime3d.fr  or Smartfriendz.com
Delivery will be february. Not so much waiting as the campaign was not over our expectations, so we're ready to produce smoothly.
We will update here with new photos and videos as we advance. 
Happy new year !

We are...... a small designers and builders team from France .Our background is in graphics design and mobile apps development  ( w6developpement.com) and before 3d animation development ( cantoche.com) but  for years , we have been building and using 3d printers , mostly open source , self made machines.Our vision...... is to develop professional quality open source hardware. We want to play a role in changing the world by helping people to produce locally in a fair business model.Our first project, the Smartrap , will be the basis of all the forthcoming projects and will be used to fabricate their parts.The Smartrap... The smartrap is in constant evolution, keeping up with the latest developments in 3d printing. It is constantly improving itself. And the best thing is that you can print your own upgrade or duplicate it , triplicate...No more waiting for upgrades from ""the company"" that  built your machine, or worse, buying a new printer every few months because the ""product"" you bought has become obsolete ! Which will happen, because 3D printing is moving fast.What makes the Smartrap a living machine?: You wont hesitate to upgrade your smartrap as it evolves because you know it takes only one hour to disassemble and rebuild! Assembly is mostly made by snapping or fitting pieces together.
The smartrap prints its own upgrades. The updates, upgrades and replication of the Smartrap is made by your own smartrap at home, without the need for special machinery, like a laser cutting machine ! 
It is 100%  active open source : It means that all files and documentation  are accessible to the general public. You can find all the information you need on thingiverse.com. It is already a great success ( in the most popular items ) .  
The open source licence is GPL: Freely available for anyone to copy . Anyone can build Smartrap machines and make a business from it anywhere in the world.Features: Global
Estimated build time : less than one hour!

Structure entirely made of printed parts.

NO laser cut or steel frame parts. 
Auto levelling bed. 
The printer

Fused filament fabrication :  PLA plastic


Print size : 150 x 150 x 150 mm


Resolution : All axis : 0.1 mm

Power : 60 Watts
This campaign was started with the intention to distribute a first batch of the model and improve it to a professional standard, with all the documentation and support. If it’s a success, everyone wins : 
Us:  as we will know how many printers to build, we will be able to better meet your demands!!! The funds we get from the campaign let us continue to improve this machine.
You : you will have a great 3d printer like never before. You will enjoy, as we already do, the benefits of a living machine, without paying for every upgrade and without the need to buy a new machine every year.
Everyone : as the Smartrap is open source (GPL)  the model will be largely improved and all makers will have a new easy option to make a 3d printer. We hope , if everything works out fine, it will start small businesses around the world, spreading the Smartrap in every village , for family and friends. Especially in places where it's hard to find specialised tools .
What to expect                  Note: At the time of delivery, the model will certainly have improved from what you can actually see. We are proposing different perks with the following content :

You will be able to concentrate at your job tasks, enjoy your meetings with friends, exercise or walk your dog without concerning that you’ll ever miss a notification. It works with your favorite app or game too so you’ll never miss an update on Facebook or Tweeter as Notty will let you know all the new stuff! Notty is waterproof and very resistant, so you can wear it when swimming or practicing your favorite sports! You can enjoy a night at a club with your friends and listen to your favorite music, and no matter how loud it gets, you can still know if someone is trying to reach you. Use it as your personal alarm in the morning, without worrying that you will disturb your loved ones. Even if you forget your phone in another room, and you cannot hear it ringing, Notty will alarm you immediately.
  Notty's Design

 My first design uses a 3D printed model, just for functionality. I am planning on using specially crafted molds to bring you the best look and feel possible. Notty is not only useful, but also a discreet yet noticeable accessory. It will be a perfect match for your outfit! Several colors will soon be available wich which will suit both men and women, on any occasion. If you have a design that you think we could implement with Notty, you can send it and we will select the most popular one for our next concept.

  Help Notty and Preorder
 The first model took 6 months to design and 2 months of prototyping and testing. Right now, I have functional design that I can demonstrate its features to everybody. For the next step, I need your help to bring a fully functional product to the market. Your funding will go into: further research. smaller board. better battery. new design. boxing and shipping. new features implementation. You can support Notty by contributing to my Indigogo campaign and preorder one of the models promoted there. Notty will come in different sizes and colors, so before ordering be sure to specify the size and color of your ring.


  Notty Real Live Tests
 I have decided to share with everybody the current progress of Notty project. I will be posting constant updates in design and functionality with the intention of making this an interactive development process, where I can add/remove improve features based on your opinion. Here is some of the work so far:
 call test
 outdoor test
 vibration motor test
 underwater test


  What's Next ?

 In the next version I plan on adding : an accelerometer for gesture recognition. You could write messages and phone numbers, or activate your favorite apps directly with your finger. a series of hardware buttons for controlling your favorite apps. This will also include a special feature called “panic button” witch can help you reach someone in a case of an emergency without accessing your phone. a curved led screen witch will scroll the contents of your notification and display the current time, temperature and gps information. a buzzer, just in case you can’t find your ring around the house. find my phone feature, based on a hardware button or a customized gesture. other features based on your input.",52.0,4,"1 Campaign

<p>I am Tony Powers, Constitutional Conservative Talk Radio host of
“Powers to the People” 3-6PM ET weekdays on TalkRadio1230 WEZO-AM in Augusta,
Georgia and the iTalkUS On-air, Online and Wireless Radio network at <a href=""http://www.italkus.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.iTalkUS.com</a></p>
<p>We are building
TalkRadio1230 WEZO-AM in Augusta into a Conservative beacon of hope that
will be the ""anchor,"" using our studios and facilities, to
power the iTalkUS Network on stations across the country. We’re reaching out to Constitutional
Conservatives, like you, who believe in “limited government” answerable to “We
the People” to help make this important work possible.</p>
<p>With decades of successful radio experience, we have a unique
plan to build an On-Air (terrestrial radio), Online and Wireless (smart phones
and smart cars) National Constitutional Conservative Talk Radio Network. <br/></p><p>We have developed the
technology to do that without the high cost of satellite delivery to other
broadcast stations. We have also put together a strong week-day line-up of
seasoned Constitutional Conservative Talk Show Host (Chris Salcedo, Erik Rush, Edward Woodson, Joe Messina, Captain Matt Bruce, Kevin Jackson) who will be competitive
with anyone on the major networks. We’re also looking for additional weekend
programming so if you are a Constitutional Conservative Talker who’s ready to
make the next step to national syndication, contact us with a link to your work
and share this appeal with your network of friends. (For syndication info
contact tony@iTalkUS.com)</p>
<p>There are literally thousands of AM radio stations
across America that are currently losing money because they lack, and can't
get, quality programming. They are in major markets and small towns that are
""under the umbrella"" of other AM and FM stations that made the move
to Talk Radio early on. They are now unable to get ""competitive""
programming because only one station in a market can carry Rush, Beck, Levin or
the other satellite network talkers. </p>
<p>Because ""Conservative Talk Radio"" is the ONLY
profitable format on AM radio this leaves these stations at a tremendous disadvantage.</p>
<p>We can now deliver informative, entertaining and commercially
profitable Conservative Talk Radio Content to AM and FM stations
across the country that are ""desperate"" for alternative programming
at NO COST to them. What we need is the start up funds to make it happen now
when we can have
a HUGE impact on the 2014 and 2016 elections. </p>
<p><b>Enter iTalkUS!</b></p>
<p>Once we have funding for the equipment, computers, servers,
soft-ware and personnel we need to launch iTalkUS, we should be able to sign on
100 - 150+ stations to take all or part of our programming in short
order. With that kind of local ""on-air"" presence across the country
and with the right promotion we could reach millions of people listening for
Conservative Talk on AM radio. Of course most stations now have their own
""online"" streaming as well, which could multiply our
""reach"" by millions listening on computers, cell phones and through
""blue-tooth"" in their cars (all new cars have USB ports or
""wireless"" connectivity built in). <b>""Wireless"" is
the future of radio!</b></p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to make iTalkUS.com the Conservative
News-Talk Radio ""Network of Choice"" to listeners across the country.</p>
<p>Unlike satellite delivered networks, we won't just be
offering programs, we want to brand and offer the entire network and bring to
radio what Fox News has brought to Cable TV but with a clear
Constitutional Conservative message. It is not our intent to be ""fair and
balanced"" but to educate the grass-roots across the Country on the Constitutional
Conservative ""limited government"" principles and moral ideals
that our Founders envisioned.</p>
<p>Of course we also know that economic decay is a direct result of
the ""moral decay"" of our society and our message is one of rebuilding
the nuclear family in America which is the bedrock of the kind of moral society
that the Founders understood would be essential for keeping our Republic strong
and prosperous.</p>
<p><b>Enter you!</b></p>
<p>Are you a Conservative that wants to make a real difference but
are tired of seeing your “campaign contributions” wasted on politicians that
say one thing to get elected and once in office never deliver on their
promises? Stop funding politicians and progressives in both political parties
that only care about growing government to empower themselves while enslaving
us and our children!  Start educating and empowering “We the People” with
the Constitutional Conservative truth that smaller “limited government,”
individual economic freedom, personal responsibility and morality are the
principles on which we can rebuild the greatest nation in the history of the
world. Please, invest in iTalkUS and help us create a true “Radio Free
America!” Our future, our children’s future and the freedom of generations to
come depends on what we do today. Will we meet the challenge and insure a
future of freedom and opportunity? Don’t let history record us as the
generation that lost the American Dream. Give what you can and even if you
can’t give, please share this message with others who can.</p>
<p>Socialism is on the march and the forces of evil would have
Godly people silenced. iTalkUS will be a powerful voice fighting for the God
Given Freedom that our Founders and millions of patriots have fought and died
for. But it can only happen if people like you stand with us to make it happen.
Thank you for your contributions and spreading the word about iTalkUS because,
like us, you know that freedom isn’t free.</p>

</div><h1>The simple solution to safe charging of LIPO batteries</h1><p>If 
you’re into drones, FPV or RC, then you have lithium batteries. In the 
past several years they have become an integral part of our hobby.</p><p>It
 may be rare, but they do catch on fire. That is why all manufactures 
caution to charge only while attended.
As I got use to charging lithium batteries, I became more and more 
careless. I like to go to the field with batteries charged, so started 
charging the night before. Thankfully I was in my shop when I had my 
first charging fire or my entire house would have burnt down. Others 
were less lucky, like this New Zealand Homeowner:</p><a href=""http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/67589147/Batteries-blamed-for-fire-that-destroyed-Stoke-home"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><p>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>
<figcaption><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">After
getting the fire out and the smoldering battery out of the house, I had 
an intense cleanup effort, the battery produced a very heavy black soot 
that was throughout my entire house, it settled on everything.</span><br/></figcaption></figure></a><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458979832/yk2ztkwjmwzog4a57n8f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p>I knew I would never charge inside again, unless there was a safe
 way to do it.  I knew charging bags don’t really work, so started 
thinking about the problem, I felt as a successful aerospace design 
engineer I could figure out a practical solution.</p><h1>The Design (Patent Pending)</h1><p>
So after analyzing the problem I designed an insulated double wall steel
 box that contains the fire and intense heat, the smoke and soot is 
filtered through a steel and fiberglass flame arrestor which also 
reduces the heat of the exhaust gases.  The clean and relative cool 
smoke is vented out of the box to prevent the box from exploding. The 
battery still produces a large quantity of smoke but it is clean and 
free of soot and will clear out quickly.</p><p>So I build a prototype with the help of a trusted manufacturer I worked with for a few years, here's what it looked:</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FYjimkwMbHz8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DYjimkwMbHz8&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FYjimkwMbHz8%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p><br/><p>After finalizing the design after successfully testing the prototype 
with many batteries, I settled for the following dimensions:</p><p>The <b>internal box is 9.5x6.5x4</b> inches. The  external dimensions are 12x9x7 inches.</p><p>
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">

<figcaption>Three View</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
<p>The flame arrester is placed in the box lid by design, as the act of 
opening and closing the box ensures a clear area around the exhaust 
holes to further help prevent the chance of a house fire.</p><p>

<figcaption>Flame arrester principle</figcaption>

<p></p>
<h1>Prototype testing</h1><p>With this box you can charge lithium 
batteries at home unattended in complete safety. To prove my point I set
 the BAT-SAFE in a cardboard box full of tissue paper to verify that 
even in this extremely flammable environment the box would perform as 
designed.</p><p>
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">
<img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458980099/mx98apt64f5fb2rkvaqh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<figcaption>Box buried in paper tissue</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>
<p>And it worked. In the testing process, I have deliberately 
overcharged dozens of lipo batteries to the point of exploding. This 
included batteries of all shapes and sizes, from small to very large. As
 the design deprives the fire of oxygen, the temperatures inside the 
BAT-SAFE are reduced further helping to prevent a home fire.</p><p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Most of the risks and challenges are behind us. We have completed a

 the help of an ISO certified manufacturer overseas. We are experienced 
in development and manufacturing of consumer products and our

<p>We will re-test the production box with over a dozen battery fire 
tests to prove it is effective and rate the box with a maximum battery 
capacity. 
<br/>We will test out all of our production features to ensure they work 
as intended. Only after all testing has been completed successfully will
 we start production.
<br/>And we will update you with the test results.</p>
<p>The concept and design is simple significantly reducing the risk of the product not preforming as advertised. </p>
<p>In order to bring the cost down to an affordable amount, we need to

you’re into drones, FPV or RC, then you have lithium batteries. In the 
past several years they have become an integral part of our hobby.It
 may be rare, but they do catch on fire. That is why all manufactures 
caution to charge only while attended.
As I got use to charging lithium batteries, I became more and more 
careless. I like to go to the field with batteries charged, so started 
charging the night before. Thankfully I was in my shop when I had my 
first charging fire or my entire house would have burnt down. Others 
were less lucky, like this New Zealand Homeowner:




After
getting the fire out and the smoldering battery out of the house, I had 
an intense cleanup effort, the battery produced a very heavy black soot 
that was throughout my entire house, it settled on everything.I knew I would never charge inside again, unless there was a safe
 way to do it.  I knew charging bags don’t really work, so started 
thinking about the problem, I felt as a successful aerospace design 
engineer I could figure out a practical solution.The Design (Patent Pending)
So after analyzing the problem I designed an insulated double wall steel
 box that contains the fire and intense heat, the smoke and soot is 
filtered through a steel and fiberglass flame arrestor which also 
reduces the heat of the exhaust gases.  The clean and relative cool 
smoke is vented out of the box to prevent the box from exploding. The 
battery still produces a large quantity of smoke but it is clean and 
free of soot and will clear out quickly.So I build a prototype with the help of a trusted manufacturer I worked with for a few years, here's what it looked:After finalizing the design after successfully testing the prototype 
with many batteries, I settled for the following dimensions:The internal box is 9.5x6.5x4 inches. The  external dimensions are 12x9x7 inches.


Three View


The flame arrester is placed in the box lid by design, as the act of 
opening and closing the box ensures a clear area around the exhaust 
holes to further help prevent the chance of a house fire.


Flame arrester principle


Prototype testingWith this box you can charge lithium 
batteries at home unattended in complete safety. To prove my point I set
 the BAT-SAFE in a cardboard box full of tissue paper to verify that 
even in this extremely flammable environment the box would perform as 
designed.


Box buried in paper tissue


And it worked. In the testing process, I have deliberately 
overcharged dozens of lipo batteries to the point of exploding. This 
included batteries of all shapes and sizes, from small to very large. As
 the design deprives the fire of oxygen, the temperatures inside the 
BAT-SAFE are reduced further helping to prevent a home fire.


Battery blowing up inside the BAT-SAFE


Video link to battery blowup inside the BAT-SAFEAmmo cansWe have also tested an ammo can just to point out why a sealed metal box doesn't provide you with safety.
Final designIn addition to preventing fires I also knew the 
box needed to be light weight, easy to use, and inexpensive. The box 
will be made from super thin wall steel sheet, will have a magnetic 
attached charger stand, and a handle for easy transportation.  We 
designed a fire proof lid seal and wire ways allow access for charging 
wires.We have finished a pre production prototype according to our drawings already, which is however not fully functional yet.It opens and closes with one hand and will be so convenient to use that it will never be neglected.

We have successfully produced a prototype from some existing box 
tooling to test out and prove our system, but with your support we 
will make custom tooling to produce the perfect charging safe box.  It 
will be convenient to use for charging, storage and transporting of Lipo
 cells in complete safety. And we all can have peace of mind.  Please 
help me produce the BAT-SAFE, and put a stop to the dangers of Lipo 
charging.

<p>They say the best camera is the one that's with you. We believe the same is true when it comes to tripods. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><b>Risks and challenges</b></h2>
<p>The funds we need to raise in this campaign are to pay for the cost of production of our new Pocket Tripod sizes. The cost of manufacturing the tooling has already been paid for thanks to our backers who helped us reach our goal in 2013. Since then we have gained lots of experience in producing Pocket Tripods. Having shipped Pocket Tripods to thousands of customers worldwide, we've also created an efficient delivery process.</p>
<p>The only factor that can create a challenge is having a large surge of demand. Having too many pre-orders - in excess of 1000 Pocket Tripods - can cause delays. This is because the production process is very labour intensive, and increasing the quantity we need may cause our manufacturer to demand more time and delay production and delivery. Each unit is individually tested after assembly, and carefully packaged. There are many sub-components that go into making a complete Pocket Tripod. A surge in demand can create delays as one or more of our suppliers try to meet the increased demand. </p>
<p>However, we will be in constant communication with our suppliers as well as backers, and will do all that we can to ensure the rewards are delivered on time.</p>

</div></div>","A camera’s most essential accessory is its tripod. The design of a tripod has not changed since the early 1800’s when photography was first invented. If our primary cameras are slim enough to be discreetly carried with us every day, why should our tripods be any different.         In 2013, turned to crowdfunding to create the Pocket Tripod. A fully adjustable tripod for your iPhone that fits in a wallet. We set out to make the most practical iPhone accessory that's actually with you when you need it, instead of sitting at home collecting dust.  Thanks to your support, we successfully achieved our goal. The Pocket Tripod was manufactured and shipped to all our 2,565 backers on time. Now it's being used by thousands of people worldwide as their primary iPhone tripod.Professional photographers use it to create stunning images on the go.  The Pocket Tripod is no longer a distant concept, but a field-tested and proven product that is used by thousands of people every day.Pocket Tripod PRO• Rubberized universal adapters• Carbon fiber legs• Resilient designOur backers have been essential in shaping the Pocket Tripod’s future. The one thing that was requested the most was to have the Pocket Tripod compatible with phones that are in a case because removing the case would take too much time and just isn't convenient.So we decided to make the Pocket Tripod universal. Instead of having it made specific to any iPhone, we’ve changed its design to take any device that matches its opening size. Each Pocket Tripod size has a wider opening than the next by an increment of 0.5 mm.Fine enough to coincide with the thickness of almost any device on the market and any case. 
Three sizes of the universal Pocket Tripods have already been produced and have been user-tested for more than a year. With your help, we plan to make them all. 

With the new universal Pocket Tripod, we've set out to create one of the most practical smartphone tripods without compromising the safety of your device. 

No matter where you are, capturing that perfect time-lapse with your iPhone or Android has never been easier. 



We’ve spent the past few months working with some of the top case manufacturers to test the Pocket Tripod and make sure it's compatible with their most popular cases. We’ve also shipped these universal Pocket Tripods to the backers of our first Kickstarter campaign for further user testing and feedback. Thanks to this collaborative effort, we've been able to catalogue the compatibility of many of the most popular cases on the market.

This design is made to also help prevent smartphone related health conditions like selfie-wrist and selfie-elbow, which are recently rising conditions which affect the bones and nerves in the arm in elbow due to the unergonomic phone grip which is used when taking photos.    In addition to the ergonomic and comfortable grip, Lensta Grip's design offers additional weight which is needed to stabilize your phone to prevent shaky and blurry photos.    With Lensta Grip's comfortable and ergonomic design, you can safely take photos and videos with one hand without worrying about the phone falling off, or the need to use both your hands to make your phone stable.    Lensta Grip is designed with extra outlets for both tripods, and hand or neck straps, so you can upgrade your photo taking experience any time.  Compatible With Straps Remote Shutter Button Feature  Choose a perk on the campaign's right side and order Lensta Grip now with the edition you want: a classic vegan leather edition with a vintage camera button, or a playful cumin colored corduroy version topped with a patent-pending donut shaped button.Along with that, make sure to choose your preference between a fixed Grip button, or a remote and fixed one. The remote & fixed option allows you to remove the Grip button to snap photor remotely. It also allows you to change the bluetooth battery if you needed to.  Lensta Grip is easy to use. All you need to do is turn your bluetooth on and connect it to that of the grip's in order to enable the bluetooth camera button, and you're set to go. Use the shutter button remotely, or attach Lensta Grip to your phone using the universal clip. Behind the ScenesFor designing Lensta, we got the help of a professional product and industrial design studio to make sure the Grip design is as ergonomic and flawless as possible.We started to iterate on the design after 3D printing several prototypes and testing them with people, until we reached to an ideal design which we believe most people will find ergonomic and smooth. And as this is not Lensta's first product or manufacturing journey, we already have our manufacturing partners lined up and ready, and we already have ready-to-ship units which we'll start sending as soon as the campaign ends. We expect the journey from campaign to delivery to be smooth and fast, and we are very excited about seeing Lensta Grip in your hands. Here is our PCB which makes the magic happen so that you can enjoy a camera-like bluetooth shutter Check out our product test video Extras:Affiliate Program:Join our affiliate program for free and earn 30% cash-back for helping us spread the word:  https://lensta-grip.kickbooster.me/boost For press inquiries: Visit our press kit here or contact us at info@lensta.co for any press related inquiries.",18.0,1,"3 Campaigns

interface designed to work with your existing 5-pin or USB MIDI controllers to
connect to your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</p>
<p><b>What iPhone, iPad, and Mac models
are compatible with the puc+? </b>The
following iOS devices are compatible but must be updated to iOS 8.2+; iPad
Mini, iPad 3 or newer, iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPhone 5 or newer. Compatible Macs
have to have OS X 10.10 Yosemite installed and support Bluetooth LE (4.0) connectivity. To check your Mac’s compatibility
follow the steps outlined in this video: <a href=""https://youtu.be/wdNHmq-llNY"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>https://youtu.be/wdNHmq-llNY</span></a>. </p>
<p><b>How does the puc+ work? </b>The puc+ sees MIDI activity on the 5-pin port or USB port
and converts it to Bluetooth MIDI. Your iOS 8.2+ enabled iPhone, iPad, or Mac
running Yosemite recognizes the puc+ as an available MIDI device for your apps
or DAW.</p>
<p><b>Does the puc+ work with Bluetooth
audio systems?</b> Bluetooth audio is a different
specification than Bluetooth MIDI. Bluetooth MIDI passes no audio data, just
MIDI. Bluetooth audio requires higher data buffering (increased latency) than
most users would tolerate for musical performance applications. We suggest
users use cabled audio solutions when using the puc+.</p>
<p><b>The puc+ works with BOTH 5-pin and
USB controllers?</b> Yes. The puc+ is equipped with
the traditional 5-pin MIDI port for your controllers that use it, AND a micro
USB port for connecting USB controllers. The puc+ comes equipped with
a Micro USB Host OTG Cable (it’s a fancy Y cable for USB connections) to
connect up your USB controller (and even a power source if you need it.)</p>
<p><b>What’s the range of the puc+?</b> All wireless devices are subject to conditions, but
the puc+ has routinely been tested to work up to a range of 40 feet or better
in good conditions.</p>
<p><b>Can I use a puc+ for each of the
MIDI controllers in my rig?</b> Yes,
Apple’s Bluetooth MIDI connectivity can discover and connect to more than one
puc+. Each of your controllers can connect to a puc+ and be available to
control your apps and DAW’s.</p>
<p><b>How is the puc+ powered?</b> The puc+ runs on two AA batteries and can easily
operate for 8-10 hours on a full charge. The micro USB port will also accept
most standard micro USB power supplies if you’d rather an AC power solution.</p>
<p><b>Can the puc+ power my USB
controllers?</b> If your USB controller draws
less than 300mA via the USB cable, the puc+ can power your controller. If your
controller draws more than 300mA, the puc+’s included Micro USB Host OTG Cable
can accommodate the appropriate power supply for your controller and pass the necessary
power to it. </p>
<p><b>Does the puc+ require an app for
connecting to iOS or OS X?</b> No.
Because the puc+ uses Apple's Bluetooth MIDI connectivity in iOS 8.2+ and OS X
Yosemite all of the required discovery and connection is available in the
operating system. However, a puc+ app is in the works to help handle firmware
updates and toggling the 5-pin port between Input and Output modes.</p>
<p><br/>
<b>What iOS apps are compatible with the puc+?</b> Lots. More than we can
mention here in an FAQ. Good ones too. GarageBand, Animoog, BeatHawk, NAVE,
SampleTank, Korg's iApps, Magellan, and the list goes on and on. We'll be
publishing a list of our favorites very soon.<br/>
<br/>
<b>What DAW's are</b> <b>compatible with the puc+?</b> If your DAW
operates on a Mac running Yosemite, you're already compatible. Logic Pro X,
Ableton Live, GarageBand, Reaper, ProTools, Reason, etc. </p>
<p><b>Can the puc+ handle multi-channel
MIDI input?</b> Yes, if your controller dishes
out multi-channel MIDI the puc+ will happily pass it along. If your app or DAW
is configured to recognize multi-channel input you should expect the same
results as using a MIDI cable.</p>
<p><b>What’s the latency of the puc+’s
MIDI transmission?</b> At this time we don’t publish
the exact latency figures, but it’s fast - under 15 milliseconds and optimized
for whichever platform (iOS or OS X) it’s connected to.</p>
<p><b>Is the puc+ compatible with Apple
hardware and operating systems only?</b> Yes,
and here's why - currently Android and Windows systems and hardware don’t
support Bluetooth MIDI connections. If and when native support for Bluetooth
MIDI connectivity becomes available for Android or any other platform, the
compatibility of the puc+ to work on those platforms can be developed.</p>
<p><b>What is the warranty?</b> We provide a 180 day limited warranty from the date of
purchase, or in the case of this campaign delivery to the recipient. If a
defect exists and is reported within the warranty period we’ll repair, replace,
or refund your purchase. </p>
<p><b>Can I change or cancel my perk?</b>Indiegogo policy dictates that campaign owners have no
ability to adjust perk selections. That means we cannot upgrade your perk, we
cannot change your perk and we cannot cancel your perk. Please note that
contributions made on indiegogo are also non-refundable.</p>

<p><strong>How is this app different than other apps for runners?</strong><br/> RunSomeone is our solution to several problems that other apps may not address. At its core it targets the number one reason why so many people find it difficult to stay on a running regimen – MOTIVATION! We know that having a running partner and/or other people cheering you on are two of the best motivators. But what if you run at 5 in the morning and there’s no one around to run with or cheer you on? What if your running partner lives in another town or state? What if they live next door but your schedules don’t coincide?</p>
<p>RunSomeone brings you the next best thing – a place where you can meet, run, compete, and motivate each other wherever you are and whenever you run.<br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to faqs</a></p>
<p><a id=""virtual"" name=""virtual"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p><strong>What do you mean it's a virtual running application?</strong><br/> How many of us have experienced this scenario? You and a couple of friends decide to start running and get in shape but your schedules don't allow you to run together. You all say you're going to do it on your own but seldom does everyone stay the course. Or you force some schedule changes and start a promising regiment only to find that the scheduling is more challenging than the run itself and you wind up running alone. And without the motivation of people cheering you on, the workouts quickly become a thing of the past. RunSomeone allows you to stay connected with your running partners even if they are not running by your side. Simply create or join a virtual running group (or team) and everyone can run on their own schedule. RunSomeone captures everyone's running activities and creates stats for all in the group to see. Real people become your running partners on the RunSomeone app. The app compares activities, reports status, and allows you to communicate with each other for that motivational support that most of us need.<br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to faqs</a></p>
<p><a id=""howmotivate"" name=""howmotivate"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p><strong>How is it motivational?</strong><br/> RunSomeone allows you to setup goals and milestones. It keeps track of all your running activity and statistics and is always comparing against your goals. At a glance, it will show you how you are doing and prompt you when you’re falling behind (and praises you when you’re ahead).</p>
<p>When you team up with running partners motivation is elevated because your running stats are shared with your partners. They can see what you’re doing (and not doing) and vice-versa. RunSomeone compares your stats with those of your partners' and lets you know how you’re doing. Through the app you can send each other encouraging messages or egg each other on.</p>
<p>When you use the app’s “Race” features, motivation is at its peak. RunSomeone allows you to setup “Races” for two or more people to join. In this environment you either compete with each other or compete against time. For some of us, nothing is more motivating than a good ol’ friendly competition.<br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to faqs</a></p>
<p><a id=""howsocial"" name=""howsocial"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p><strong>How is it social?</strong><br/> RunSomeone will have a built in messaging system that will allow runners to post comments and communicate before, during, and after their runs. This can be used to discuss training regimens, ask for running advise, or share motivational messages and techniques. Integration with popular social networks such as facebook, twitter, and dailymile will allow you to share your goals and achievements with friends and family so you can keep them abreast of your training activities and have them root for you and support your cause!<br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to faqs</a></p>
<p><a id=""howsocialB"" name=""howsocialB"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p><strong>How is it social beyond the people I know?</strong><br/> With RunSomeone you are not limited to running with people that you know. Its social component allows you to partner with people around the globe. You can partner with people that are at the same running level as you or at higher levels if you're looking for greater motivation or you can join public running groups. Either way, you communicate with each other, share tips, and most importantly motivate each other along the way.<br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to faqs</a></p>
<p><a id=""goals"" name=""goals"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p><strong>Can I set goals?</strong><br/> Setting goals is the foundation of achievement and is the foundation of RunSomeone. You can set up a running regimen with specific goals in mind and RunSomeone will track your progress - all along prompting you with status and alerts.<br/><a href=""#faqs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to faqs</a></p>
<p><a id=""compete"" name=""compete"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p><strong>In competitive mode, what are some of the race types?</strong></p>
<ol start=""1"">
<li>Goal Race: This race type allows you to set running goals and milestones to be achieved in a given time period. For example, a race can be created where participants must run 15 miles in 1 week's time. The app will alert you of your status-to-goal and motivate you along the way. All activity is shared with all the runners of that race so you can see if you’re falling behind compared to the others. Most times this is enough motivation to get you going. When it isn’t, your friends can use RunSomeone to send you private messages to do some of their own motivating.  </li>
<li>Challenge race: This race is designed for runners who want the continued challenge of doing better. Perhaps looking to improve their own personal record. The goal of this race format is to run farther or faster than the others in this race. This is a round robin environment where the race will continue for as long as each competitor surpasses the previous best mark, which of course, can be your own.</li>
<li>Competitive race: This race caters to the runner that is motivated mostly by competition or to those looking to obtain some friendly bragging rights. A runner can invite a friend or two to a race that is similar to a 100 yard dash in track and field. You set up the race rules and RunSomeone will track each runner’s progress and pick the winner.</li>

How is this app different than other apps for runners? RunSomeone is our solution to several problems that other apps may not address. At its core it targets the number one reason why so many people find it difficult to stay on a running regimen – MOTIVATION! We know that having a running partner and/or other people cheering you on are two of the best motivators. But what if you run at 5 in the morning and there’s no one around to run with or cheer you on? What if your running partner lives in another town or state? What if they live next door but your schedules don’t coincide?
RunSomeone brings you the next best thing – a place where you can meet, run, compete, and motivate each other wherever you are and whenever you run.Back to faqs

What do you mean it's a virtual running application? How many of us have experienced this scenario? You and a couple of friends decide to start running and get in shape but your schedules don't allow you to run together. You all say you're going to do it on your own but seldom does everyone stay the course. Or you force some schedule changes and start a promising regiment only to find that the scheduling is more challenging than the run itself and you wind up running alone. And without the motivation of people cheering you on, the workouts quickly become a thing of the past. RunSomeone allows you to stay connected with your running partners even if they are not running by your side. Simply create or join a virtual running group (or team) and everyone can run on their own schedule. RunSomeone captures everyone's running activities and creates stats for all in the group to see. Real people become your running partners on the RunSomeone app. The app compares activities, reports status, and allows you to communicate with each other for that motivational support that most of us need.Back to faqs

How is it motivational? RunSomeone allows you to setup goals and milestones. It keeps track of all your running activity and statistics and is always comparing against your goals. At a glance, it will show you how you are doing and prompt you when you’re falling behind (and praises you when you’re ahead).
When you team up with running partners motivation is elevated because your running stats are shared with your partners. They can see what you’re doing (and not doing) and vice-versa. RunSomeone compares your stats with those of your partners' and lets you know how you’re doing. Through the app you can send each other encouraging messages or egg each other on.
When you use the app’s “Race” features, motivation is at its peak. RunSomeone allows you to setup “Races” for two or more people to join. In this environment you either compete with each other or compete against time. For some of us, nothing is more motivating than a good ol’ friendly competition.Back to faqs

How is it social? RunSomeone will have a built in messaging system that will allow runners to post comments and communicate before, during, and after their runs. This can be used to discuss training regimens, ask for running advise, or share motivational messages and techniques. Integration with popular social networks such as facebook, twitter, and dailymile will allow you to share your goals and achievements with friends and family so you can keep them abreast of your training activities and have them root for you and support your cause!Back to faqs

How is it social beyond the people I know? With RunSomeone you are not limited to running with people that you know. Its social component allows you to partner with people around the globe. You can partner with people that are at the same running level as you or at higher levels if you're looking for greater motivation or you can join public running groups. Either way, you communicate with each other, share tips, and most importantly motivate each other along the way.Back to faqs

Can I set goals? Setting goals is the foundation of achievement and is the foundation of RunSomeone. You can set up a running regimen with specific goals in mind and RunSomeone will track your progress - all along prompting you with status and alerts.Back to faqs

In competitive mode, what are some of the race types?

Goal Race: This race type allows you to set running goals and milestones to be achieved in a given time period. For example, a race can be created where participants must run 15 miles in 1 week's time. The app will alert you of your status-to-goal and motivate you along the way. All activity is shared with all the runners of that race so you can see if you’re falling behind compared to the others. Most times this is enough motivation to get you going. When it isn’t, your friends can use RunSomeone to send you private messages to do some of their own motivating.  
Challenge race: This race is designed for runners who want the continued challenge of doing better. Perhaps looking to improve their own personal record. The goal of this race format is to run farther or faster than the others in this race. This is a round robin environment where the race will continue for as long as each competitor surpasses the previous best mark, which of course, can be your own.
Competitive race: This race caters to the runner that is motivated mostly by competition or to those looking to obtain some friendly bragging rights. A runner can invite a friend or two to a race that is similar to a 100 yard dash in track and field. You set up the race rules and RunSomeone will track each runner’s progress and pick the winner.
Back to faqs 
What platforms will this application be available on? Our goal is to develop RunSomeone for both Apple (iPhone) and Android smartphones.Back to faqs

What kind of stats will be available for my runs? RunSomeone records the distance, time, pace, calories and frequency of all your runs.Back to faqs

Will measurements be shown in metric or imperial units? BothBack to faqs

Will the app be available in other non-English languages? While measurements will be available in metric and imperial units, the first version of RunSomeone will be available in the English language only.Back to faqs


Yes. We have a list of extra features that we want to add to the application. Your donation of $100 or more allows you to vote on the feature that you want most to be added.

CHARGEKEY IN THE NEWS:



“The New NOMAD CHARGEKEY Is Like A Jumper Cable For Your Phone”
“A year ago the guys at NOMAD released a small, portable USB cable for iPhones and micro USB devices. Now they’ve launched the CHARGEKEY, a super-small “cable” for charging your device via any USB port.”

     - TechCrunch

“The makers of the CHARGECARD—that wallet-friendly credit card-sized sync cable for smartphones—are back with a new product called the CHARGEKEY that's instead designed to hang out on your keychain.”

     - Gizmodo


""Tiny CHARGEKEY for iPhone 5 is always handy and ready to go...If you're anywhere that there's an open USB port, you can plug in your iPhone (or iPad -- the CHARGEKEY is designed to withstand up to 3.1 A of current) to top it off.""

     - TUAW

 
“The CHARGEKEY Might Be The Smallest Lightning Charger Possible”
“...impressively small CHARGEKEY, a teeny tiny USB-to-Lightning adapter that – yes – hooks onto a keyring.”

     - Cult of Mac













Production and Delivery
We are using a trusted manufacturer who currently manufactures our first product, CHARGECARD. We’ve already initiated the tooling for CHARGEKEY and we expect to ship on November 30th, meaning your CHARGEKEYS will arrive before December 10th.

CHARGEKEY will charge your phone as fast as any other cable will. The rate of charge actually depends on which USB port you’re connected to.

<h3><strong>An output of your smartphone or other Bluetooth connected device</strong></h3>
<p>GlassUp is basically a second screen output for your devices (mobile, smartphones, etc). It’s like being up to date with everything, <strong><em>without having to check your smartphone continuously.</em></strong> Information is sent from your smartphone to your GlassUp simply via a Bluetooth connection.</p>
<p>The types of content and data transferred to GlassUp will be determined by the apps you choose to download.</p>
<p>Thanks to our technology you will not need to grab your smartphone continuously anymore, but only when you want to act upon a particular notification.</p>
<p>The concept is similar to that of a Bluetooth earphone (actually, we have thought of a notifier earphone as well). Whatever arrives on the glasses is already on the phone, so it’s useful only to see messages without grabbing your smartphone. We see it as a first step towards telepathy, for which we couldn’t yet find the technology solution (yet :-)).</p>

<h3>Comparison with Google Glass and other competitors</h3>
<p>Compared to Google Glass, our eyeglasses are more focused on SHOWING information, in a very utilitarian approach. </p>
<ul>
<li>GlassUp is ""receive only"". No photos or videos involved, no privacy issues.</li>
<li>The projection is Monochrome (currently green, but we may switch to amber).</li>
<li>Longer battery life</li>
<li>GlassUp projects the information close to the center of vision, with less strain to the eye of the wearer</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is very important: leveraging the experience of our  team member Gianluigi, who had developed optical systems for airplane pilots' helmets, we knew from the start that the information had to appear almost in the center of the field of view, vs forcing you to look laterally. This is the main issue we worked on, and only when we found the technical solution we went on with the project. </p>
<p>A good metaphor is that with Google Glass it’s like seeing something in the rear-view mirror of a car, whereas <em><strong>with GlassUp it’s like seeing it on the windscreen</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Last but not least: Google chose a very distinctive look for their product, our GlassUp will look like a normal pair of eyeglasses.</p>

<h3>Land of Design</h3>
<p>North-East Italy leads by far the world in terms of eye-wear design, with companies -such as Luxottica, Safilo, Marcolin, De Rigo - designing and producing most of the world leading brands (Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue, Carrera, Polaroid, and so many more). We are located in the very center of this district, so we plan to take advantage of the know-how spread in our neighborhood.</p>
<p>We will start with one or two designs, but we plan to have a more varied product line (sport, casual, high-tech, business, etc.), as soon as it makes financial sense. We have already presented our technology to the Italian fashion business, and various brands are willing to work with us.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Cutting Edge Technology</h3>
<p>To develop the product we had in mind, our team member Gianluigi Tregnaghi selected some of the best professionals in this sector. He and Fabrizio Liberati, for instance, are two of the three most qualified optical scientists in Italy. We are collaborating with various universities around Italy, and we are connected with other specialized centers in Italy and elsewhere.<br/><br/>We have filed a patent application covering our technology in Italy, we are planning on filing extensions of said application and we intend to file more applications in the near future on the improvements we will be making. The optical technology, of which we are very proud, is our strength, and we know it’s extremely difficult to replicate.</p>
<p><img alt=""Andrea checking Gianluigi's work"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/854149/pictures/full/20130606024352-banco_1.JPG?1370511835"" src="""" style="""" title=""Andrea trying the system ""/></p>
<h3>Team</h3>
<p><strong>Francesco Giartosio</strong>, CEO, a passion for applied technology and man-machine interaction</p>
<p><strong>Gianluigi Tregnaghi</strong>, CTO, exceptional experience developing optical systems, including for car windscreens and air force pilots’ helmets</p>
<p><strong>Andrea Tellatin</strong>, COO, managed the development and industrialization of I’m Watch, a successful smartwatch</p>
<p><strong>Alfio Giuffrida</strong>, Business Development Director, a long experience as a technical sales manager in the telecommunications industry</p>
<p><strong>Luca Escoffier</strong>, Mentor, who we chose particularly for his wide experience in intellectual property, licensing agreements, Asian markets (he follows us from Japan), and strategic partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Optical Team</strong>: Fabrizio Liberati, Tommaso Occhipinti, Fabio Frassetto, Ivan Capraro</p>
<p><strong>Hardware and Firmware Team</strong>: Fabio D'Alessi, Alberto Scarpa, Stefano Bianconi and their kidz.</p>
<p><strong>Product Engineering, Manufacturing and Logistics: </strong>Fabio Patron and his team.</p>
<p>And many more fans of the project, who are excited to work with us.  Such as <strong>Filippo and Jennifer Catalano</strong>, who arranged the crowdfunding campaign.  And <strong>Giovanni Contini</strong>, running the show at the fairs.</p>
<p>The core team lives in the North-East of Italy, that by far leads the world eyeglass market (about two thirds of the eyeglasses in the world are made by companies located here), so for sure we’ll take advantage of the skills, and market coverage, of our region’s industry.</p>
<p><img alt=""Gianluigi checking the optical system"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/854144/pictures/full/20130606024250-banco_3.JPG?1370511774"" src="""" style="""" title=""Gianluigi at the work ""/></p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>We started the feasibility study in the fall of 2011, the development of the optical system in the spring of 2012, and the development of the hardware and software in the fall of 2012. Our streamlined product vision allowed us to prototype and develop quickly through rapid iterations.</p>
<p>We have now arrived at the first prototype with our own work and money, which was the plan, and that’s where we have to stop and we need you!</p>
<p>What we need to do now is the industrialization, we need to finalize the specs, look for suppliers, define the production process, make molds, take care of the international certifications and additional patent filings, and so on. </p>
<p>We plan to have the final product definition by the end of July, and proceed to the industrialization.  We should have a first buggy pre-series at the end of September.  Once we've fixed the bugs and the specs are final, we'll start the certifications and the production, and we expect to have the product on the market in February 2014.</p>
<h3>Sporty Look:</h3>

<h3>Is What I See What I get?</h3>
<p>You might be asking:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Will the product I get actually look like the one in the video?</strong></em></li>
<li><em><strong>Will the messages I see actually appear like the one in the video?</strong></em></li>
</ul>
<p>The answer to both questions is,<strong> <em>yes, if not bette</em></strong><em><strong>r!</strong></em>  In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concerning the <strong><em>design of the glasses</em></strong>, the actors in the video are wearing the eyeglass model that we have currently selected, the sporty one, to which we had attached for this purpose the actual electronic circuit and optical system from the previous prototype.  In the next few months we will test other designs, and try to improve still, so the eyeglasses could look like the ones in the video, or probably better.  The design you see in other images also on this page, such as the classic look, are previous prototypes, again we believe we can improve on them. The frame in the video is still a little thick, we've made it thinner afterwords. </li>
<li>The image above (sporty look) shows a bulky optical - electronic element.  Forget about that: it is the 3d of the current prototipe, we made it bulky because we need room to work on it.  As soon as it's finalized we'll miniaturize it, no worry.</li>
<li>The lens will probably be <strong>slightly tinted</strong>, not completely transparent, because people who do not need eyeglasses don't want to be asked if their sight has deteriorated, and sunglasses blend better in every day use.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>As for the <strong><em>aspect of the messages</em></strong>, the guys who produced the video (brilliant work of <a href=""http://www.pongofilms.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Pongofilms</a> from Modena, Italy) were given the actual formats and screenshots from our sdk simulator, so the messages should look quite like those in the video - <em>except if we hire a good designer, which we will do.</em>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><img alt=""Smartphone pairing - Design is tentative"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/855861/pictures/full/20130606194335-Pairing.png?1370573019"" src="""" style="""" title=""Pairing ""/></h3>
<h3>Product specs</h3>
<p><em>(very provisional, we’ll update them over time) </em></p>
<p>We expect to have two-three designs in two-three sizes, but this will depend on the partnerships we’ll bring home.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Weight</strong> around 65 grams (tested on our first prototype) </li>
<li>On board <strong>OS</strong>: Android </li>
<li>
<strong>Sensors</strong>: accelerometer, compass, ambient light sensor, precision altimeter, perhaps more (the GPS is already on your smartphone, so we don’t need it)</li>
<li>
<strong>Connectivity</strong>: Bluetooth LE </li>
<li>
<strong>Optical system,</strong> made of a display and a set of lenses and mirrors. The resolution of the display is 320x240. If you ask more details on the optics, you’re a competitor.</li>
<li>One day of <strong>battery life</strong> recharge via mini-usb</li>
<li>
<strong>Lenses:</strong> Lenses will be slightly tinted</li>
<li>
<strong>Controls:</strong> A touch-pad, with the usual controls (tap, double tap, long press, swipe vertically and horizontally), we are deciding now which ones to keep for us to on/off the projector (probably the long press), the others will be left to the developers to manage the apps.</li>
<li>
<strong>Color combinations:</strong> The frame you see in the video is red on white, it's one of the two versions we plan to sell - the other is green on black</li>
<li>
<strong>Prescription glasses</strong> - we get asked all the time, and a hard one: can our GlassUp be used with your prescription lenses? The lens of our GlassUp is very special, so you can not replace it with yours. We are working on a solution. We’ll likely be able to accommodate simple vision defects at a small cost</li>
<li>
<strong>Next versions</strong> - We will have to make tough calls in for the evolution of the product. The roadmap (a camera, voice controls? binoculars?..) will take into account market feedback (and yours!) and consider what will be achievable by the team while we increase the team size</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt=""Touch surface and controls on the side - Design is tentative"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/855865/pictures/full/20130606194418-Touch.png?1370573064"" src="""" style="""" title=""Touch ""/></p>
<h3>APPS:</h3>
<p>We plan to release a few apps on our own, such as the notifier, the visual impaired help, the translator. For the rest, <strong><em>we’ll release the APIs</em></strong> and rely on external developers. We’re confident that there will be many, both because they’re already calling every day, and because Andrea has already gone through this with his smartwatch, and thousands of developers have downloaded the APIs. </p>
<p>On May 25, we presented for the first time our SDK and simulator to a <a href=""http://www.whymca.org/evento/hack-reality-2-rise-information"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hackathon</a> in Milan. The winning team developed an app that would read the engine data from the processor of a car or motorbike and send them on the glasses. </p>
<p>Our API will work for Android (they already are) and iOS (almost done), probably also for Windows 7 but this still needs work (on Microsoft side, obviously). We’ll also have to create a translator, a compiler, that will make it possible to convert relatively easily the current mobile apps to show the messages on the eyeglass, instead of on the display of the mobile.</p>
<p><img alt=""A team of developers working with our APIs. They built an app displaying the speed, RPM, etc., extracted from the processor of a motorbike."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/854153/pictures/full/20130606025027-Developers_developers_developers.JPG?1370512231"" src="""" style="""" title=""The first Hackathon ""/></p>
<h3>Business model, distribution, marketing, partnerships, investors</h3>
<p>We are working hard to make strategic partnerships, as we want to distribute the product through existing proven channels. We are currently in talks with some companies in different fields: eye-wear, telecommunications, consumer electronics, sports, games - we can’t name them yet and we don’t want to anyway. We have high confidence that at least one of these agreements will be finalized. In case none does, we are already in talks with national importers and distributors.</p>
<p>Our business model is to sell the glasses, and let the external developers sell the apps they make. In addition to the general consumer market, of techies and sportsmen/women, there is a wealth of rich and huge niches (medical, gaming, museums, and so on), that we can work on - when we’ll have time to do it.</p>

Here’s what GlassUp is for:
GlassUp displays to the user any kind of message, super-imposed on reality. See it as a convenient ""second screen for your smartphone""

Some examples:

Emails, text messages, Facebook updates, tweets, RSS, calendar events, incoming calls 
Breaking news, weather, stock exchange, sport results
Real time feedback display for running, biking, sailing, action sports
Turn by turn directions to riders (motorcycles, bikes,..)
Aid for hearing impaired
Translations display when talking in different languages 
Patients’ body data to a surgeon
Instructions to workers in warehousing or maintenance
Teleprompter for public speaking
Subtitles at the movies (for hearing impaired and for different languages) 
Details about works of art at a museum
Gaming
Domotics, etc..

Most of these use cases come from actual customers waiting for the product, so we want to deliver it as soon as possible and open up the possibilities to all, you included!




An output of your smartphone or other Bluetooth connected device
GlassUp is basically a second screen output for your devices (mobile, smartphones, etc). It’s like being up to date with everything, without having to check your smartphone continuously. Information is sent from your smartphone to your GlassUp simply via a Bluetooth connection.
The types of content and data transferred to GlassUp will be determined by the apps you choose to download.
Thanks to our technology you will not need to grab your smartphone continuously anymore, but only when you want to act upon a particular notification.
The concept is similar to that of a Bluetooth earphone (actually, we have thought of a notifier earphone as well). Whatever arrives on the glasses is already on the phone, so it’s useful only to see messages without grabbing your smartphone. We see it as a first step towards telepathy, for which we couldn’t yet find the technology solution (yet :-)).




Comparison with Google Glass and other competitors
Compared to Google Glass, our eyeglasses are more focused on SHOWING information, in a very utilitarian approach. 

GlassUp is ""receive only"". No photos or videos involved, no privacy issues.
The projection is Monochrome (currently green, but we may switch to amber).
Longer battery life
GlassUp projects the information close to the center of vision, with less strain to the eye of the wearer

The latter is very important: leveraging the experience of our  team member Gianluigi, who had developed optical systems for airplane pilots' helmets, we knew from the start that the information had to appear almost in the center of the field of view, vs forcing you to look laterally. This is the main issue we worked on, and only when we found the technical solution we went on with the project. 
A good metaphor is that with Google Glass it’s like seeing something in the rear-view mirror of a car, whereas with GlassUp it’s like seeing it on the windscreen.
Last but not least: Google chose a very distinctive look for their product, our GlassUp will look like a normal pair of eyeglasses.

We are located in the very center of this district, so we plan to take advantage of the know-how spread in our neighborhood.
We will start with one or two designs, but we plan to have a more varied product line (sport, casual, high-tech, business, etc.), as soon as it makes financial sense. We have already presented our technology to the Italian fashion business, and various brands are willing to work with us.



Cutting Edge Technology
To develop the product we had in mind, our team member Gianluigi Tregnaghi selected some of the best professionals in this sector. He and Fabrizio Liberati, for instance, are two of the three most qualified optical scientists in Italy. We are collaborating with various universities around Italy, and we are connected with other specialized centers in Italy and elsewhere.We have filed a patent application covering our technology in Italy, we are planning on filing extensions of said application and we intend to file more applications in the near future on the improvements we will be making. The optical technology, of which we are very proud, is our strength, and we know it’s extremely difficult to replicate.

Team
Francesco Giartosio, CEO, a passion for applied technology and man-machine interaction
Gianluigi Tregnaghi, CTO, exceptional experience developing optical systems, including for car windscreens and air force pilots’ helmets
Andrea Tellatin, COO, managed the development and industrialization of I’m Watch, a successful smartwatch
Alfio Giuffrida, Business Development Director, a long experience as a technical sales manager in the telecommunications industry
Luca Escoffier, Mentor, who we chose particularly for his wide experience in intellectual property, licensing agreements, Asian markets (he follows us from Japan), and strategic partnerships.
Optical Team: Fabrizio Liberati, Tommaso Occhipinti, Fabio Frassetto, Ivan Capraro
Hardware and Firmware Team: Fabio D'Alessi, Alberto Scarpa, Stefano Bianconi and their kidz.
Product Engineering, Manufacturing and Logistics: Fabio Patron and his team.
And many more fans of the project, who are excited to work with us.  Such as Filippo and Jennifer Catalano, who arranged the crowdfunding campaign.  And Giovanni Contini, running the show at the fairs.
The core team lives in the North-East of Italy, that by far leads the world eyeglass market (about two thirds of the eyeglasses in the world are made by companies located here), so for sure we’ll take advantage of the skills, and market coverage, of our region’s industry.

Timeline
We started the feasibility study in the fall of 2011, the development of the optical system in the spring of 2012, and the development of the hardware and software in the fall of 2012. Our streamlined product vision allowed us to prototype and develop quickly through rapid iterations.
We have now arrived at the first prototype with our own work and money, which was the plan, and that’s where we have to stop and we need you!
What we need to do now is the industrialization, we need to finalize the specs, look for suppliers, define the production process, make molds, take care of the international certifications and additional patent filings, and so on. 
We plan to have the final product definition by the end of July, and proceed to the industrialization.  We should have a first buggy pre-series at the end of September.  Once we've fixed the bugs and the specs are final, we'll start the certifications and the production, and we expect to have the product on the market in February 2014.
Sporty Look:

Classic Look:

Is What I See What I get?
You might be asking:

Will the product I get actually look like the one in the video?
Will the messages I see actually appear like the one in the video?

The answer to both questions is, yes, if not better!  In particular:

Concerning the design of the glasses, the actors in the video are wearing the eyeglass model that we have currently selected, the sporty one, to which we had attached for this purpose the actual electronic circuit and optical system from the previous prototype.  In the next few months we will test other designs, and try to improve still, so the eyeglasses could look like the ones in the video, or probably better.  The design you see in other images also on this page, such as the classic look, are previous prototypes, again we believe we can improve on them. The frame in the video is still a little thick, we've made it thinner afterwords. 
The image above (sporty look) shows a bulky optical - electronic element.  Forget about that: it is the 3d of the current prototipe, we made it bulky because we need room to work on it.  As soon as it's finalized we'll miniaturize it, no worry.
The lens will probably be slightly tinted, not completely transparent, because people who do not need eyeglasses don't want to be asked if their sight has deteriorated, and sunglasses blend better in every day use.


As for the aspect of the messages, the guys who produced the video (brilliant work of Pongofilms from Modena, Italy) were given the actual formats and screenshots from our sdk simulator, so the messages should look quite like those in the video - except if we hire a good designer, which we will do.



Product specs
(very provisional, we’ll update them over time) 
We expect to have two-three designs in two-three sizes, but this will depend on the partnerships we’ll bring home.


Weight around 65 grams (tested on our first prototype) 
On board OS: Android 

Sensors: accelerometer, compass, ambient light sensor, precision altimeter, perhaps more (the GPS is already on your smartphone, so we don’t need it)

Connectivity: Bluetooth LE 

Optical system, made of a display and a set of lenses and mirrors. The resolution of the display is 320x240. If you ask more details on the optics, you’re a competitor.
One day of battery life recharge via mini-usb

Lenses: Lenses will be slightly tinted

Controls: A touch-pad, with the usual controls (tap, double tap, long press, swipe vertically and horizontally), we are deciding now which ones to keep for us to on/off the projector (probably the long press), the others will be left to the developers to manage the apps.

Color combinations: The frame you see in the video is red on white, it's one of the two versions we plan to sell - the other is green on black

Prescription glasses - we get asked all the time, and a hard one: can our GlassUp be used with your prescription lenses? The lens of our GlassUp is very special, so you can not replace it with yours. We are working on a solution. We’ll likely be able to accommodate simple vision defects at a small cost

Next versions - We will have to make tough calls in for the evolution of the product. The roadmap (a camera, voice controls? binoculars?..) will take into account market feedback (and yours!) and consider what will be achievable by the team while we increase the team size


APPS:
We plan to release a few apps on our own, such as the notifier, the visual impaired help, the translator. For the rest, we’ll release the APIs and rely on external developers. We’re confident that there will be many, both because they’re already calling every day, and because Andrea has already gone through this with his smartwatch, and thousands of developers have downloaded the APIs. 
On May 25, we presented for the first time our SDK and simulator to a Hackathon in Milan. The winning team developed an app that would read the engine data from the processor of a car or motorbike and send them on the glasses. 
Our API will work for Android (they already are) and iOS (almost done), probably also for Windows 7 but this still needs work (on Microsoft side, obviously). We’ll also have to create a translator, a compiler, that will make it possible to convert relatively easily the current mobile apps to show the messages on the eyeglass, instead of on the display of the mobile.

Business model, distribution, marketing, partnerships, investors
We are working hard to make strategic partnerships, as we want to distribute the product through existing proven channels. We are currently in talks with some companies in different fields: eye-wear, telecommunications, consumer electronics, sports, games - we can’t name them yet and we don’t want to anyway. We have high confidence that at least one of these agreements will be finalized. In case none does, we are already in talks with national importers and distributors.
Our business model is to sell the glasses, and let the external developers sell the apps they make. In addition to the general consumer market, of techies and sportsmen/women, there is a wealth of rich and huge niches (medical, gaming, museums, and so on), that we can work on - when we’ll have time to do it.

<h1><b>WOS 2.0</b></h1>
<p>It looks frightening. It IS frightening. The second edition of the WOS is even more powerful than the first one, definitely the most powerful iPhone speaker and possibly the most powerful single speaker on the market. With 44 elements plus four mega powerful subwoofers and a weight of 178 kilos it is only for people who believe music should be enjoyed loudly. </p>

<h1><b>Features</b></h1>
<p>Apart from the basic features you might except from an iPhone speaker, Bluetooth, tube amplifier, individually built chambers for the speakers we have built in some pretty cool stuff you might not expect from a speaker. Like a monkey head.</p>
<p>The small monkey head is warning you if playing too loud. Normal (high) volume and the monkey has no problem, his eyes are glowing blue but if you play very loud the eyes turns golden, if you keep on increasing the volume they will turn red. Red means there's an immediate risk for permanent hearing loss. After five minutes playing in the red zone, the monkey´s head pops and the music stops. Once the monkeys head is returned the speaker can be used again, This is a safety feature to prevent damage to ears and property. </p>

<br/>As we have been successfully building generators of all sizes for over 7 years, it was easy for us to take that exceptional design and miniaturized it.  One great thing about that design is that no matter which way you turn the generator shaft it always produces the same polarity.  In other words, the red lead is always positive and the black lead is always negative.  That gave us an idea.</h3><h3><br/></h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/504960/files/20140413083333-iMoveCharger2.jpg?1397403213"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">
<br/>Years ago some wrist watches were ‘self-winding’.  By just walking around, you wound your mechanical watch.  That ‘self-winding’ was accomplished by using a half-circle weight connected to a shaft.  The weight always tried to stay level with gravity.  The wearer’s movement caused the weight to be shifted.  The weight would react by swinging back one way or another.

<br/>We took that same principle, but instead of tying the weight to gears we connected it to the shaft of our miniaturized generator.  Moving the device caused the weight to swing the generator’s rotor back and forth.  This movement created electrical current because the magnets on the rotor are swept past stationary coils of wire.  We take that electrical potential and convert it into charging voltage.</h3><h3><br/></h3><h3><br/></h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/507054/files/20140414064642-Flash.jpg?1397483202"" src="""" style=""""/></h3><h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">

We’re designing products that address real issues in a variety of fields such as health and wellbeing, education, communication technology and many more. Our tools and methods differ, but all of our designs focus on enhancing people’s lives.

You will be able to see our work on display at the Duncan of Jordanstone Degree Show in May and New Designers in London in July. These are great opportunities to showcase our talent and to meet people working in the industry. 

THIS IS WHERE WE NEED YOUR HELP!

In order for us to showcase our work, we need to get materials to build our exhibition space/structures, design and print brochures/catalogues and also transport all equipment, build and products down to London for New Designers.

What Do You Get?

Donate £5 - You will receive a beautiful and unique postcard designed by our students.


Donate £20 - Guided tour and hospitality package at the Degree Show.


Donate £50 - Signed brochure with a printed acknowledgement for your donation.


Donate £75 - Commemorative poster designed by us. (A3 size)


Donate £100 - Your name will be displayed at the Degree Show and New Designers for acknowledgement alongside a copy of all previous rewards.

If you would like to support us, your help would be very much appreciated.

<p>I am a software developer by profession and I enjoy technology. As a hobby
I have always been playing around with optical instruments like microscopes and
telescopes. I also have some background in production as my family used to own
a small unit in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><span>My new product:</span></b></p>
<p>Please do see the demo video. It's a short video of about 3.5 minutes video that covers all the important information.

</p><p><span>This microscope is a complete redesign of the classical field
microscope. It's a very compact design and is made especially for
smartphones. You can simply use your smartphone screen to view the enlarged
image and click pictures and videos. It's
 great fun to use and also has an amazing educational value for kids,
students or teachers. It's very easy to use. My own 8 year old is already hooked on it. <br/>

</h1><p> It has the perfect magnification to enjoy watching the amazing world of
microorganisms. All the demo pictures and videos have been shot with the above
combination. Thanks to high quality optics, the image quality is so amazing that
you can even do further digital zoom to increase the magnification. Or you can simply stream a live video directly on your TV (if your mobile phone allows screen mirroring).</p><b></b><p><br/></p><p><span></span></p><p><b>Quality

<p></p><h4>Where is it made:</h4>
Designed and prototyped by me in Switzerland (where I live).<br/>
The parts are made in Asian countries as per my 3D designs.<br/>
These parts are then quality controlled and carefully assembled in Switzerland
from where the final product will be shipped.<div>

production:</b></p>
<p>Product design :       Completed<br/>
Prototyping:               Completed<br/>
Trial production:       Completed<br/>
Mass Production:      To do</p>
<p>The road from idea to final product is a very long one.  I am well aware of this considering my past production background.  This product is
not just an idea but it's in the advanced stage of production. The parts used
for trial production are actual parts produced with plastic molding and metal cutting machines, the same process as they would be produced in mass
(not from 3D printing).  Now it's more about achieving the economies of
scale so that it's possible to keep the costs low. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><span>About the campaign</span></b></p>
<p>By funding this campaign you can be the first ones to own this
cool product.  The raised funds along with my personal
investments will be used to produce this microscope in large quantity so that
the economies of scale can be achieved. You will be helping to spread this product along with its educational value to many many more people at an affordable price.  It's so simple to use, that even kids can use it.<br/>

<p>You receive a hand written thank you note.</p>
<p>Once I have my costs covered, I intend to pass on this perk to students

</p>
<p><b><span>Perk-2: <br/>

cover slips for your use. I want you to have a full experience without having
to pay extra for accessories.<br/>
<br/>
!!!!Note: I do need to charge additional 20 USD shipping charge for shipping the product outside Switzerland. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><span>Flexible campaign</span></b><br/>
I have set this campaign as a flexible one. Which means that if I am not able
to achieve full funding, you will still get the product. Even though this means
that my production cost will be much higher initially. My motivation here is
mainly to bring this interesting product to as many people as possible. I do
hope that as more and more people know about it, the sales will then pickup.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><span>Risks &amp; Challenges</span></b></p>
<p>Any temporary issues during the production process can affect the
expected delivery dates. For example it can happen that some part acquires a defect in the process of mass production. This will then have to be fixed
again which can cause a delay of few weeks in the delivery of final product.
However, the risk is already minimized as a trial production has already
completed.</p>
<p>Overall, having some
experience in how the production and assembly works, I can ensure you that the
risks are manageable.  </p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>If you like my product but
are not able to participate, you can still help me by spreading the word
around. For example if you know other people, like friends, students or
teachers who could be interested in something like this, you can let them know
about this product. You can use Indiegogo share tools for this
purpose or just send them a link to this page.</p>

</h2><p>The Tor software is a program you can run on your computer that helps keep you safe on the Internet. Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location. This set of volunteer relays is called the Tor network. You can read more about how Tor works on the <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">overview page</a>.</p><p>The Tor Project is a non-profit (charity) organization that maintains and develops the Tor software.</p><h2><a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#WhatProtectionsDoesTorProvide"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">What protections does Tor provide?</a></h2><p>Internet communication is based on a store-and-forward model that can be understood in analogy to postal mail: Data is transmitted in blocks called IP datagrams or packets. Every packet includes a source IP address (of the sender) and a destination IP address (of the receiver), just as ordinary letters contain postal addresses of sender and receiver. The way from sender to receiver involves multiple hops of routers, where each router inspects the destination IP address and forwards the packet closer to its destination. Thus, every router between sender and receiver learns that the sender is communicating with the receiver. In particular, your local ISP is in the position to build a complete profile of your Internet usage. In addition, every server in the Internet that can see any of the packets can profile your behaviour.</p><p>The aim of Tor is to improve your privacy by sending your traffic through a series of proxies. Your communication is encrypted in multiple layers and routed via multiple hops through the Tor network to the final receiver. More details on this process can be found in the <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/about/overview"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tor overview</a>. Note that all your local ISP can observe now is that you are communicating with Tor nodes. Similarly, servers in the Internet just see that they are being contacted by Tor nodes.</p><p>Generally speaking, Tor aims to solve three privacy problems:</p><p>First, Tor prevents websites and other services from learning your location, which they can use to build databases about your habits and interests. With Tor, your Internet connections don't give you away by default -- now you can have the ability to choose, for each connection, how much information to reveal.</p><p>Second, Tor prevents people watching your traffic locally (such as your ISP) from learning what information you're fetching and where you're fetching it from. It also stops them from deciding what you're allowed to learn and publish -- if you can get to any part of the Tor network, you can reach any site on the Internet.</p><p>Third, Tor routes your connection through more than one Tor relay so no single relay can learn what you're up to. Because these relays are run by different individuals or organizations, distributing trust provides more security than the old <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#Torisdifferent"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">one hop proxy </a>approach.</p><p>Note, however, that there are situations where Tor fails to solve these privacy problems entirely: see the entry below on <a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#AttacksOnOnionRouting"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">remaining attacks</a>.</p><h3><a href=""https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq.html.en#IsTorLikeAVPN"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Is Tor like a VPN?</a></h3><p><b>Do not use a VPN as an <a href=""http://www.nbcnews.com/news/investigations/war-anonymous-british-spies-attacked-hackers-snowden-docs-show-n21361"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">anonymity solution</a>.</b> If you're looking for a trusted entry into the Tor network, or if you want to obscure the fact that you're using Tor, setting up a private server as a bridge works quite well.</p><p>VPNs encrypt the traffic between the user and the VPN provider, and they can act as a proxy between a user and an online destination. However, VPNs have a single point of failure: the VPN provider. A technically proficient attacker or a number of employees could retrieve the full identity information associated with a VPN user. It is also possible to use coercion or other means to convince a VPN provider to reveal their users' identities. Identities can be discovered by following a money trail (using Bitcoin does not solve this problem because Bitcoin is not anonymous), or by persuading the VPN provider to hand over logs. Even if a VPN provider says they don't keep logs, users have to take their word for it---and trust that the VPN provider won't buckle to outside pressures that might want them to start keeping logs.</p><p>When you use a VPN, websites can still build up a persistent profile of your usage over time. Even though sites you visit won't automatically get your originating IP address, they still know how to profile you based on your browsing history.</p><p>When you use Tor the IP address you connect to changes at most every 10 minutes, and often more frequently than that.

About Tor
The Tor software is a program you can run on your computer that helps keep you safe on the Internet. Tor protects you by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents the sites you visit from learning your physical location. This set of volunteer relays is called the Tor network. You can read more about how Tor works on the overview page.The Tor Project is a non-profit (charity) organization that maintains and develops the Tor software.What protections does Tor provide?Internet communication is based on a store-and-forward model that can be understood in analogy to postal mail: Data is transmitted in blocks called IP datagrams or packets. Every packet includes a source IP address (of the sender) and a destination IP address (of the receiver), just as ordinary letters contain postal addresses of sender and receiver. The way from sender to receiver involves multiple hops of routers, where each router inspects the destination IP address and forwards the packet closer to its destination. Thus, every router between sender and receiver learns that the sender is communicating with the receiver. In particular, your local ISP is in the position to build a complete profile of your Internet usage. In addition, every server in the Internet that can see any of the packets can profile your behaviour.The aim of Tor is to improve your privacy by sending your traffic through a series of proxies. Your communication is encrypted in multiple layers and routed via multiple hops through the Tor network to the final receiver. More details on this process can be found in the Tor overview. Note that all your local ISP can observe now is that you are communicating with Tor nodes. Similarly, servers in the Internet just see that they are being contacted by Tor nodes.Generally speaking, Tor aims to solve three privacy problems:First, Tor prevents websites and other services from learning your location, which they can use to build databases about your habits and interests. With Tor, your Internet connections don't give you away by default -- now you can have the ability to choose, for each connection, how much information to reveal.Second, Tor prevents people watching your traffic locally (such as your ISP) from learning what information you're fetching and where you're fetching it from. It also stops them from deciding what you're allowed to learn and publish -- if you can get to any part of the Tor network, you can reach any site on the Internet.Third, Tor routes your connection through more than one Tor relay so no single relay can learn what you're up to. Because these relays are run by different individuals or organizations, distributing trust provides more security than the old one hop proxy approach.Note, however, that there are situations where Tor fails to solve these privacy problems entirely: see the entry below on remaining attacks.Is Tor like a VPN?Do not use a VPN as an anonymity solution. If you're looking for a trusted entry into the Tor network, or if you want to obscure the fact that you're using Tor, setting up a private server as a bridge works quite well.VPNs encrypt the traffic between the user and the VPN provider, and they can act as a proxy between a user and an online destination. However, VPNs have a single point of failure: the VPN provider. A technically proficient attacker or a number of employees could retrieve the full identity information associated with a VPN user. It is also possible to use coercion or other means to convince a VPN provider to reveal their users' identities. Identities can be discovered by following a money trail (using Bitcoin does not solve this problem because Bitcoin is not anonymous), or by persuading the VPN provider to hand over logs. Even if a VPN provider says they don't keep logs, users have to take their word for it---and trust that the VPN provider won't buckle to outside pressures that might want them to start keeping logs.When you use a VPN, websites can still build up a persistent profile of your usage over time. Even though sites you visit won't automatically get your originating IP address, they still know how to profile you based on your browsing history.When you use Tor the IP address you connect to changes at most every 10 minutes, and often more frequently than that. This makes it extremely dificult for websites to create any sort of persistent profile of Tor users (assuming you did not identify yourself in other ways). No one Tor relay can know enough information to compromise any Tor user because of Tor's encrypted three-hop circuit design.Aren't 10 proxies (proxychains) better than Tor with only 3 hops?Proxychains is a program that sends your traffic through a series of open web proxies that you supply before sending it on to your final destination. Unlike Tor, proxychains does not encrypt the connections between each proxy server. An open proxy that wanted to monitor your connection could see all the other proxy servers you wanted to use between itself and your final destination, as well as the IP address that proxy hop received traffic from.Because the Tor protocol requires encrypted relay-to-relay connections, not even a misbehaving relay can see the entire path of any Tor user.While Tor relays are run by volunteers and checked periodically for suspicious behavior, many open proxies that can be found with a search engine are compromised machines, misconfigured private proxies not intended for public use, or honeypots set up to exploit users.10% of raised funds will be donated to the Official Tor Project and the Electronic Frontier foundation.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

Hiipe
- What is Hiipe?
Hiipe is the 1st chat app that rewards you for communicating like you already do. Users earn points – smart points – which they can redeem for a chance to win prizes or get discounts from participating merchants world wide
Hiipe is in Beta version and available for download for Android and iPhones.
Features
For Users:


Earn points for inviting others, chatting, calling, browsing the web, sharing pictures and videos - Things you do every day on one or more chat apps out there from Whatsapp to Instagram to Snapchat without getting anything in return except the feeling of being trendy!



With the points you earn you can enter into raffles for a chance to win prizes or get discounts to products and services all over!



Device and number independent - How many times do you have to register for Whatsapp and Viber, each time you switch phones or get a new number? And for every device you have, you have a different set of friends. With Hiipe, you do not have to re-register each time you get a new device or phone number. All this is made possible thanks to our patented email to phone number resolution approach.


Private and secure – keep your phone number private so you chat with who you want to, when you want to. Only chat with friends you want to chat with, and if you block a person or delete them from your list, they are done! No spam, no pranks! Furthermore, our end-to-end encryption ensures your chats are secure.
For businesses:



 
What We Need 

Let’s be real, the present version of Hiipe being a beta version is far from perfect, though it does well to showcase our concept. It is limited in usability and experience. We have already completed the design for the next major release and now need your help to get there. The money you contribute will enable us to:
1. Improve the design of the app interface to ensure it is bug-free, highly functional and user-friendly.





 
2. Introduce new chatting features like group chatting, video calling so you can interact face-to-face with family and friends from anywhere in the world.




 3. Create merchant profiles in the app, improve merchant portal and acquire additional merchants so our users have access to exciting rewards like spa packages, travel discounts, fitness classes, and the latest electronic gadgets.

<h1>HopMotion is the LeapMotion app for Android. </h1>
<p>Our goal is to allow LeapMotion to function with Android as easily as it does with Mac and PC operating systems i.e. plug in and play. The app already has a prototype but I'm here to get your help in completing it. </p>
<p>I have been a fan of LeapMotion since they first introduced their prototype product. This is “Minority Report” in the flesh, in fact it’s even better, because you don’t need the gloves. Sure, there are detractors who are willing to go on and say the technology isn’t as promised or not good enough. But, that goes with any emerging technology and it will take years to perfect and consumers to become comfortable with it. Like, how Blackberry users switched to iOS and Android smartphones, despite the initial few years of reluctance, I believe motion sensing technology will replace current human interaction peripherals. </p>
<p>As with any new technology it is hard to find investors who are willing to take a risk with your product. All too often investors demand a say in the product, collateral, performance reports, and prioritize their vision. As with too many cooks in the kitchen, we end up with Cyanide instead of Crème Brûlée. This is the reason why I’m here on Kickstarter to get the funds necessary to finish this project. </p>
<p>HopMotion is not some distant project, or a glimmer in our eyes, it is real, it is here and it works. </p>
<p>We funded the first phase of development ourselves but we need more money to finish the product and move it to the Alpha stages of testing, which incidentally is one of our rewards. Now some of you might ask why don’t we simply wait till LeapMotion publishes the SDK and support for Android for free. </p>
<p>Well, SDK and native support takes time to deliver. Any driver on Android will have to be part of an Android update because it will require KERNEL level programming. This process is not only long and time consuming but, it is also depended on product testing by both LeapMotion and Google. It is not too farfetched to believe that support of LeapMotion devices on Android will not happen till Google’s next I/O conference in June 2014. </p>
<p>How does HopMotion get around this problem while two large companies can’t? The answer is simple we go another direction. Instead of using KERNEL level programming to build a driver for LeapMotion, we are using Virtual Network Computing (VNC) protocols to take over the Android device and port the existing SDK over to Android. </p>
<p>This means essentially, we let the controller take over the device. </p>
<p>I can see the brianiacs among you raising your eyebrows and hands, ready to lay down bear the disadvantages of using VNC protocols to connect with a peripheral device. </p>
<p>Relax! I know it’s not ideal, but initial testing shows that it works quite well with basic tasks such as browsing, opening apps, zooming, etc… Further, since the LeapMotion device is hard connected (Micro USB to Micro USB)to the Android device there is no question of buffering interval/time lag. </p>
<p>Besides, like I said earlier no new technology will come out of the box perfect, the only real question is do you want to play with LeapMotion on your Android in two weeks or do you want to wait months to a year? </p>
<p>That’s right folks, we plan on releasing the Alpha stage of the App within 2 weeks of completion of funding. </p>
<p>We are currently working on a video and it should be posted as an update soon. The video will show the prototype app doing its thing. </p>
<p><b>MY GOAL WITH THIS APP </b></p>
<p>The goal of this Android app is to bring the world of LeapMotion to your Android device as early as tomorrow and I don’t mean figuratively. </p>
<p><b>Stages of development: </b></p>
<p>1.	Prototype/Experimental – Our current stage, where we prove that using VNC we can port a driver for Android. </p>
<p>2.	Alpha Stage – LeapMotion functions essentially as a mouse pointer on your android screen </p>
<p>3.	Beta Stage – Addition of “multi-touch” gestures </p>
<p>4.	Product Deployment </p>
<p>5.	Updates and future fixes </p>
<p><b>WHAT MAKES THIS APP AWESOME? </b></p>
<p>Besides the use of a new method of programming to introduce an experimental interface to your mobile device, bypassing software restrictions to provide unfettered access, not tomorrow but today! </p>
<p><b>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?</b> </p>
<p>100% of this money will go to pay for the development of the app. </p>
<p><b>Got questions?</b> Ask me!! I want to hear from you! </p>

To celebrate the start of our campaign - we would like to thank our first backers, by giving each of you 6 pairs of 3D glasses for every screen you buy!                                 HURRY UP - THE OFFER IS STILL VALID!!!                   Every one of us has its own ways of entertainment.However, there is something that unites us all – TV!!!

new and unique projector’s screen. It will immerse you into a range of new,
previously unknown, visual sensations. SKYLINE FUSION has an improved image

You will be able to enjoy SKYLINE FUSION projector screens in three different modes.1 - Closed - you can close it and it will be very discreet and wont interfere with you interior design2 - Open/ Flat - you can keep the screen in the more traditiona flat way3 - Open/ Curved - you can make the screen the screen curved and rela[ your eyeAfter all, isn’t it what we all dream
of?Let us show you how it works: Today, as well as in the past, your eyes constantly have to adapt to the new focal distance, this kind of screen will tire your eyes outConvex Screen – This is our past.Flat screen –This is our present.The curve provides you identical and balanced viewing from all screen areas. Curved Screen lets you experience the most comfortable perception of the image with no extra effort to your eye.
Curved screen - this is our future.The research at the Kyushu University showed, that the minimum distortion of the picture, from the distance at which we usually watch TV, is achieved when the radius of the screen is between 5000mm – 11000mm.

 “Investigation on distance perception in the
virtual space and real space ”, - Doctor Takeda, Kyushu University (2009).Are you still wondering why the curved projector screens are better than flat ones?Well, let us explain:Curved screen gives
you greater effect of immersion due to distortion of the reflected light. This
screen has a greater light concentration, increasing the quality of the
picture. The light is less scattered over the room, while optimizing
light reflectivity towards the audience. As a result we have more immersive and
enjoyable image

When the screen is curved  you get an identical and balanced distance from all screen areas. Keeping in mind all of the above, we are proud to present you the best!SKYLINE FUSION is an automatic multifunctional curved screen, with the mind blowing possibilities. You may use it either way: as a flat screen – the one you are already used to, or the curved screen - enjoying the effect of deep immersion and enhanced color reproduction.SKYLINE FUSION Nude - made out of white hornbeam wood.SKYLINE FUSION Hazel - made out of walnut wood.SKYLINE FUSION Prime - made out of oak wood.

Flip works just like the pencil you grew up with. With Flip, you don't have to worry about charging your stylus or connecting to your tablet to unlock the features like flip to erase and palm rejection. Flip knows what you want it to do without using batteries or Bluetooth. It’s intuitive, easy to use, and gives you all the features and benefits of an active stylus without the complexity.   Want to erase? Flip knows. Just flip it over, and your stylus is now an eraser. Flip is also a very powerful tool that both professional and amateur digital artists will love. With Flip's interchangeable magnetic tips, the artist in you will be inspired to draw, sketch, and paint in all your favorite apps.Want to rest your palm on the screen while using the stylus? Flip knows. Since we know the exact location of the stylus, we can perfectly reject any other object touching the screen.Want to hover and then zoom in to generate more detail? Flip knows. Just enable the hover functionality, and we can even detect the stylus while it is still in the air.Want to take notes in a class or meeting but don't want to re-enter your password and reconnect your Bluetooth stylus every time your iPad wakes up again? Flip knows. We sense when you stop writing, automatically dim your screen to help save power, and instantly turn your screen back on when you reach to make your next note.Flip uses an incredibly simple and unique method of communication with any iOS device so you can write on your iPhone or iPad just like you would with a pen and paper.In the past, advanced smart stylus features like flip to erase, palm rejection, and others have required complex electronics. To improve upon this, we've powered Flip with magnets.Our rare earth magnets produce an exact invisible magnetic field that is always on, just like the earth's magnetic field.Bluetooth-Free and Battery-FreeFlip's patented software algorithms, developed by our software partner Widevantage, use the hardware already in your device to sense and detect Flip's magnetic field and determine the precise location and orientation of the stylus, so our palm rejection, flip to erase and other features work perfectly without ever needing Bluetooth or batteries.Flip comes with a free, easy to use note taking and drawing app called Flip Notes.We also know many of our backers already have their favorite apps, so we've developed an app developer's kit that allows any note taking or drawing app to quickly integrate Flip's features into their software.Apps we are currently working with include:Apps we plan to work with include:We are happy to keep adding to the list - just let us know your favorite app, and we will work with them!       Lynktec has a proven track record of delivering innovative, award-winning products that fundamentally improve how users experience technology in their everyday lives, and we are proud of the praise and accolades we've received from top media influences over the years!                        Flip is compatible with all iPads and iPhones. All Flip styluses will also come with a FREE Flip Notes app download!

<p>Modular synthesizer users need sequencers to produce complex series of notes or effects upon which to build interesting musical structures. Having a sequencer which is simple to use, inexpensive, and offers up to 16 steps in a compact format allows the user the ability to combine multiple units for creating complex sequences. This sequencer is flexible, allowing two independent 8 step or one 16 step sequence to be dialed in, programmable, with individual step functions as well as global settings to be made from a simple user interface, and economical, priced in the range of many other synth modules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your contribution will help put this flexible device into production.</li>
<li>Three versions will support the current major synthesizer formats.</li>
<li>Features such as built in quantizers, programmable gate width outputs, two operating modes, and multiple voltage output ranges give it capabilities beyond basic sequencers.</li>
</ul><p>You can help us get this module into production with a contribution and get a fabulous Grove Audio t-shirt as a token of our appreciation or if you contribute at the highest level, you will receive a production unit in your format of choice.</p>
<h3>Here is What Your Contribution Will Do-</h3>
<p>Contributions made to this campaign will be used exclusively to fund the production costs of this new module. When we create a new device, we encounter production costs beyond the cost of the components used to make each unit. A portion of the funds contributed will be used to offset these one-time charges.</p>
<p>Three major components are used in any module and have substantial tooling costs to get even one part made. These components are the panel, the printed circuit boards, and any specialized parts. In this module, there is a microprocessor which controls the unit and provides the functions of the operator interface. In addition to these tooling charges, sufficient quantities of parts to produce an initial run of modules will be purchased.</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of your contribution can be applied as a discount in the future toward the purchase of the new module.</li>
<li>If you contribute to the successful campaign at the top two levels, you will receive free domestic or discounted international shipping on the perks that you will receive.</li>
<li>At all contribution levels, you will receive the incredible limited-edition Grove Audio project t-shirt that will stun your friends at the next synthesizer gathering you attend.</li>
</ul><div>
<h3>Relief From Patching Boredom-</h3>
<p>This new compact sequencer won't cure any diseases but it will provide immediate relief from boring synthesizer patches. It will multiply your creativity by implementing exciting percussion rhythms and soaring arpeggios. It will remove the drudgery of counting notes in complex tempos.</p>
<ul>
<li>The project fulfills the need for a multifunctioned basic sequencer for use in your modular synthesizer.</li>
<li>Supplements and expands your existing sequencer modules.</li>
<li>Brings a compact sequencing option to all popular analog modular formats including Dotcom (MOOG), MOTM, and Eurorack.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features of this Module-</h3>
<ul>
<li>Two operating modes - Two independent 1X8 step sequences or one 1X16 step sequence.</li>
<li>Each step can be set to enabled, skip, or stop.</li>
<li>Each sequence length can be set for 2 to 8 or 1 to 16 steps depending on current mode.</li>
<li>Each sequence provides a control voltage output and a gate output signal for each active step.</li>
<li>Control voltage range is set by a front panel selector to 0-2V, 0-5V or 0-10V range.</li>
<li>Gate output signal is a 0-5V active-high pulse.</li>
<li>Each channel has a clock input and a reset input. The voltage level is 0-5V active-high for both types of input.</li>
<li>The Gate pulse width is settable to be a fixed width or dependent on the width of the clock pulse.</li>
<li>The unit width for Dotcom format is 4.25 inches (2MU), for MOTM format is 3.50 inches (2MT) or for Eurorack is 183 millimeters (36HP).</li>
<li>Each channel has a switchable quantizer to divide the voltage ranges into 1/12th volt steps to allow accurate note values to be produced.</li>

If you contribute to the successful campaign at the top two levels, you will receive free domestic or discounted international shipping on the perks that you will receive.
At all contribution levels, you will receive the incredible limited-edition Grove Audio project t-shirt that will stun your friends at the next synthesizer gathering you attend.

Relief From Patching Boredom-
This new compact sequencer won't cure any diseases but it will provide immediate relief from boring synthesizer patches. It will multiply your creativity by implementing exciting percussion rhythms and soaring arpeggios. It will remove the drudgery of counting notes in complex tempos.

The project fulfills the need for a multifunctioned basic sequencer for use in your modular synthesizer.
Supplements and expands your existing sequencer modules.
Brings a compact sequencing option to all popular analog modular formats including Dotcom (MOOG), MOTM, and Eurorack.

Features of this Module-

Two operating modes - Two independent 1X8 step sequences or one 1X16 step sequence.
Each step can be set to enabled, skip, or stop.
Each sequence length can be set for 2 to 8 or 1 to 16 steps depending on current mode.
Each sequence provides a control voltage output and a gate output signal for each active step.
Control voltage range is set by a front panel selector to 0-2V, 0-5V or 0-10V range.
Gate output signal is a 0-5V active-high pulse.
Each channel has a clock input and a reset input. The voltage level is 0-5V active-high for both types of input.
The Gate pulse width is settable to be a fixed width or dependent on the width of the clock pulse.
The unit width for Dotcom format is 4.25 inches (2MU), for MOTM format is 3.50 inches (2MT) or for Eurorack is 183 millimeters (36HP).
Each channel has a switchable quantizer to divide the voltage ranges into 1/12th volt steps to allow accurate note values to be produced.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Johnella &amp; Elle Wanna Be Belles of the Inaugral Ball D.C. Trip!</h3>
<h3>Hello Wonderful Friends and Family</h3>
<p>I just learned yesterday via a message from the Director of Volunteers for the Presidential Inaugural Committee that I am being offered an opportuity to serve the President, First Lady and their guests at the Inaugural Ball the evening of January 21st.  It would be a once-in-a lifetime chance and a great first-time trip for both Johnella and myself to tour D.C., the Capitol, the monuments and museums and be a part of history. </p>
<ul>
<li>I am a City and County of San Francisco employee for the past dozen years and have been a strong Obama supporter ever since he wrote the book, ""The Audacity of Hope"". I believe he is a leader of our times, who's leadership style fosters openess, bipartinship and truly relating to the working class and middle class families, women, and all minority groups.  </li>
<li>I helped raise funds, campaign and even did a couple of nights of phone banking for the president this time around and got to meet, get to know and  learn what the constituents care about right now in America and how they believed voting for Obama's second term was the right choice.</li>
<li>Recently, I was named one of the ""100 Most Influential Filipinas in the U.S."" by the highly respected Filipina Women's Network/FWN</li>
<li>Also awarded November 2012, as a member of the decade by the board group I advise The Young Filipino Professional Association.  Helping, supporting and uplifting the board and its members for nearly a decade.</li>
</ul>
<p>This trip would be a celebration of the inspirational work that POTUS has done so far and again, continued support for what he has to do for the next four years.  Also, as a daughter of a Naval Officer and a woman who has continued the tradition in my family as a public servant, I would be honored to serve the committee, the President and his supporters at the inaugural ball and to celebrate his great presidency. </p>
<p>Most of all, I think it would be a wonderful, teachable moment for my daughter, Johnella, enriching her world and also be highly educational for her.  I would like to think when she grows older, she can picture herself as someone who can hold public office or be the President of the United States as well. Also, it would be poignant day of rememberance, on MLK Jr. Day, too for my biracial daughter.</p>

<h3>Elle's &amp; Jah Jah's Trip Essentials &amp; Our Gifts for Your Donations</h3>
<p>To help us get there, I am asking you to help me fund my travels expenses due to the short amount of time I need to make it over there across the country.</p>
<p>Figuring out last minute flight details, hotel accomodations, meals, snacks, bus/metro/cab fare and incidentals I need about $2000 for this dream inaugural trip to Washington D.C for us.  </p>
<p>To help me reach my goal, you'll get cool, commerative gifts, that I will pick-up while on my travels. They would be:</p>
<p>For $5, an inaugural ruler</p>
<p>For $10, an inaugral button</p>
<p>For $25, an inaugural tote bag</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Again, this would be a once in a lifetime event for me, not to mention, honestly, I haven't had a real vacation from career and being a mommy in a little over 5 years (as old as my kid!), so this would be welcome personal time with me, as I celebrate Obama's presidency and the first family plus spend, real bonding time with Jah Jah :)  Thanks so much in advance for anything you can contribute to my dream trip again to the Presidential Inauguration!</p>

<p>""Not our fault or our problem"", that seems to be what has become the relationship between the consumer, cell phone service providers, and the manufactures of the devices you own. Leaving you the consumer to clean up the mess of missing or deleted data, frustration in transferring from one device to another, or simply having questions left unanswered. If you have ever been frustrated or dreaded changing devices, the Charge Share Keylink is your solution! Having worked over a combined 30 years in the telecommunications field ourselves, we have seen first hand thousands of people angry and frustrated as their digital lives unraveled before their eyes. Most people can honestly say they keep their private and most important information on their phones. We've become accustomed to entrusting complete strangers to handle the task of transferring our most valuable and personal information. Unfortunately, that system has many flaws and it opens you up to having your privacy violated and your information lost or misused. We want to put the control and ease back into your hands with Charge Share Keylink. The Charge Share Keylink was developed for simplicity. With the constant theme of making sure it was developed to be 'so easy, our moms can use it', the hardware and software combination ensures that almost anyone at any technical level will enjoy the benefits it has to offer.</p>
<p>The Charge Share Keylink was developed for people who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Would like to be able to transfer battery charge from their smartphone, tablet or laptop to another smartphone, tablet or laptop</li>
<li>Lost information due to failed software updates (contacts, photos, text messages, notes, calender)</li>
<li>Lost information due to a defective phone</li>
<li>Had to go to a store to have their information transferred</li>
<li>Have duplicate contacts due to multiple email accounts syncing</li>
<li>Emails pictures one by one to their computer</li>
<li>Have gone through the agony of having to wipe out and then start from nothing to set up a device</li>
</ul><p>We now leave you with some considerations.</p>
<p>What if we told you this will work with most smartphones, no matter the carrier or network.</p>
<p>What if your information could be restored to your exact specific settings, even if a failed software download occurs, right down to the specific ring tone that you had set.</p>
<p>What if you never had to worry about a complete stranger transferring and going through your most personal information again.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>How Can Charge Share Enhance Your Life</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Power Transfer</strong>- For the first time ever, you will now have the ability to take battery charge from a smartphone, tablet, or laptop and transfer it to another smartphone. You will also have the ability to charge a single smartphone or multiple devices from any laptop, desktop, and any vehicle equipped with USB connection. You can even use your current home or car micro USB charger with your Charge Share Keylink. This will allow you to charge multiple devices at once.</li>
<li>
<strong>Data Transfer</strong>- Simple and easy, our application and hardware will never leave any of your personal information at risk by empowering you with the most content transfer features to date. Ability to make the transition from your old phone to your new phone a breeze. You will have the ability to transfer contacts, text, pictures, videos, music, calendar, notes and complete folders all in the privacy of your home, office, or on the go. You will have the ability to pick and choose which items you want to transfer, instead of the being forced with all or nothing. You will have the ability to transfer without internet connectivity, to ensure security and complete content transfer, making it the world's most secure transfer.</li>
<li>
<strong>Total backup</strong>- You will now have the ability to backup all contacts, text, pictures, videos, music, calendars, notes and folders to or from your laptop, desktop or tablet. This will serve as a hard copy of all your most personal information. This will also include a folder called Time Capsule in which content that is locked and in this place can not be deleted. Never become a victim of lost data due to software updates or user error again. You will have the option to backup your information to your hard drive, encrypted cloud storage, or both! This will also give you the ability to delete or merge duplicate contacts, social media accounts, and keep track of email logins and passwords from your smartphone, laptop, tablet or desktop. </li>
<li>
<strong>Bluetooth Search</strong>- Using Bluetooth (A2DP)- Charge Share will help make the panic of a misplaced phone or tablet a thing of the past. Charge Share has been designed with a built-in panic button that will send out a distress signal to your devices that are connected via Bluetooth. ALR will send a command to your smart devices to turn the volume up to the highest volume, vibrate and enable a flashing pattern on your screen. Giving you every opportunity to locate your device, even if it is set to silent or vibrate. The Charge Share Keylinks compact design was made in order to be used on key rings. ALR is reverse compatible, enabling you to have the ability to send a panic signal from a smartphone, tablet, or connected laptop to sound off your Charge Share Keylink and assist in the search of your missing keys. No more need to panic for your misplaced items that always go missing at the wrong times. (Range of Bluetooth is between 30-100 feet).</li>
</ul><h1>The Working Prototype</h1>
<div>
<p>The Charge Share Keylink that is shown in the video and photos is a working prototype. In order to ensure we could be confident in what was possible, we had to develop a prototype from spare chargers and smart device parts. It had to be small, it had to be useful, and it had to be able to work. It was constructed from scratch and consistently tested to ensure the functionality we strived for. We are pleased to say it exceeded all expectations, and paired with our software that has been developed, it is nothing short of spectacular. Both the software and hardware have patents pending. Now it's time to take it to the next stage and get this into your hands.</p>

Hi. It’s over two years since I started working on the JFK app,almost fifteen since I started creating the JFK wallchart, and almost fifty since I became fascinated by the assassination of John F Kennedy – well, maybe not quite fifty, but you know what I mean...
WHO KILLED JFK? won’t be just ‘another app’. As the video says, it will contain many thousands of words of information, hundreds of images and video clips – and will be stylish, attractive and easy to understand. Designed specifically to help you closely study the world’s most enduring conspiracy mystery in time for the 50th anniversary in November. The WHO KILLED JFK? app will be informational, educational and entertaining for both new recruits and seasoned researchers.

The WHO KILLED JFK? app is at an advanced prototype stage (as you can see in the video), but we still need your help to get it completed. Which is why we chose Indiegogo to reach you.
Depending on how much you kindly contribute, we’ll send you a pdf or hard copy of the wallchart that inspired the app, a copy of the JFK-related eBook thriller, HUNTINGDOG, or the app itself – providing, of course, that we receive enough funds to complete it!
If you can't contribute yourself but like the project please share with your friends or anyone you know who may be interested in helping out.

If you need any further information about the WHO KILLED JFK? app, just email me at hugh@jfkapp.com.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The Lifeboat is a real solution born out of real needs. The need for enhanced mobility and the need for increased personal security.
</p>
<h5 style=""text-align: left; background-color: #ecf0f1;""><ul><li>
<i>Enhanced Mobility</i><br/>
</li></ul></h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Even though we use power banks, we often forget to charge the power bank apart from forgetting to carry it with us. Further, the higher the capacity of the power bank, the less we remember to keep it charged for use in time. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
And, in the end, sometimes, all we need is a little bit of battery life to tell our families we are on the way home.
        </p>
<h5 style=""text-align: left; background-color: #ecf0f1;""><ul><li>
<i>Increased Personal Security</i><br/>
</li></ul></h5>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lifeboat was created as a way to keep our loved ones secure.
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
We cannot count on bracelets and other Bluetooth accessories or even Panic Button Apps on the mobile phone. In a real emergency, there will not be any time or presence of mind for fumbling or fiddling around trying to get things to work. Further, even low energy Bluetooth connections will end up sapping the mobile phone power not counting the reliability of the connection or the app.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Keeping the above issues in mind, we have made the Lifeboat to be the most convenient and easiest panic button functionality to use. </p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<h3 style=""background-color: #F9690E; line-height: 45px; line-height: 45px; font-weight: lighter; color: #ffffff;""> Why is the Lifeboat on Indiegogo?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
The Lifeboat is on Indiegogo not just to raise funds for production. The Lifeboat is here to earn your love and support to make it a reality.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
We look at this Indiegogo platform as an amazing opportunity to interact with potential users from all around the world, learn from the early adopters and prove ourselves worthy of your trust.
                 </p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<h3 style=""background-color: #F9690E; line-height: 45px; line-height: 45px; font-weight: lighter; color: #ffffff;"">How will the funds be utilised?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The first designs and the prototype are already completed. The patents have been applied for.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432149028/xtz9cvr5wlhyf8aqfcox.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 135px; height: 125px;""/></p>

<h3 style=""background-color: #F9690E; line-height: 45px; line-height: 45px; font-weight: lighter; color: #ffffff;"">Why Flexible Funding?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Indiegogo offers convenient (for you) payment options only with flexible funding. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As you may understand, the funding limit on this Lifeboat campaign does not cover the entire cost of the production and the limit has been kept lower on purpose. More than just the funding, we are looking at the number of orders as a measure of popular acceptance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
That aside, we will complete this project on our own regardless of the funding received. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
We hope by now that you understand the Lifeboat is a labor of love for us.

We, Vajra InfraTech Pvt.

We have clients all over the world and our products are known in the logistics and fleet management sectors. 
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
This may be our first foray in to the world of B2C (Consumer / Retail) electronics. But we are not new to the manufacturing process and are experienced in the area of GPS Vehicle and Asset Tracking hardware. 
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Honestly, the only risks we perceive at this stage are delays due to any holdups in the import of certain components and delays due to the certification process, especially the MFI approval (for the lightning connector option).

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our strength is that the entire process is being undertaken at our home base from design to manufacturing to packaging. Thus, ensuring our total control on the manufacturing process which is familiar territory for us. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hyderabad, India is a fast-growing technology hub with some of the world's leading technology companies based here.

Even though we use power banks, we often forget to charge the power bank apart from forgetting to carry it with us. Further, the higher the capacity of the power bank, the less we remember to keep it charged for use in time. 

And, in the end, sometimes, all we need is a little bit of battery life to tell our families we are on the way home.
        

Increased Personal Security

Lifeboat was created as a way to keep our loved ones secure.


We cannot count on bracelets and other Bluetooth accessories or even Panic Button Apps on the mobile phone. In a real emergency, there will not be any time or presence of mind for fumbling or fiddling around trying to get things to work. Further, even low energy Bluetooth connections will end up sapping the mobile phone power not counting the reliability of the connection or the app.

Keeping the above issues in mind, we have made the Lifeboat to be the most convenient and easiest panic button functionality to use. 


 Why is the Lifeboat on Indiegogo?

The Lifeboat is on Indiegogo not just to raise funds for production. The Lifeboat is here to earn your love and support to make it a reality.  

We look at this Indiegogo platform as an amazing opportunity to interact with potential users from all around the world, learn from the early adopters and prove ourselves worthy of your trust.
                 


How will the funds be utilised?
The first designs and the prototype are already completed. The patents have been applied for.
 
    
That's the final prototype above next to a standard matchbox to view in perspective.
The funds we raise in this campaign will go towards the following:
        






Why Flexible Funding?

Indiegogo offers convenient (for you) payment options only with flexible funding. 
As you may understand, the funding limit on this Lifeboat campaign does not cover the entire cost of the production and the limit has been kept lower on purpose. More than just the funding, we are looking at the number of orders as a measure of popular acceptance.

That aside, we will complete this project on our own regardless of the funding received. 

We hope by now that you understand the Lifeboat is a labor of love for us.
                 


The Production Timeline



Why we will Succeed?

We, Vajra InfraTech Pvt. Ltd., (http://www.vajrainfratech.com) are a company in the business of specialised B2B (Business to Business) IT solutions since 7 years. We have clients all over the world and our products are known in the logistics and fleet management sectors. 


This may be our first foray in to the world of B2C (Consumer / Retail) electronics. But we are not new to the manufacturing process and are experienced in the area of GPS Vehicle and Asset Tracking hardware. 


Honestly, the only risks we perceive at this stage are delays due to any holdups in the import of certain components and delays due to the certification process, especially the MFI approval (for the lightning connector option).



Manufacturing in Hyderabad, India, i.e., Home Base
Our strength is that the entire process is being undertaken at our home base from design to manufacturing to packaging. Thus, ensuring our total control on the manufacturing process which is familiar territory for us. 
Hyderabad, India is a fast-growing technology hub with some of the world's leading technology companies based here. We are happy to be in such a a vibrant hub for electronics manufacturing and ancillary activities and hence, we are absolutely confident of producing a quality product and delivering on time.

<p>ERGO is almost complete. All desks shown on our crowd-funding campaigns and in the product video were built on our production line. </p>
<p>1. Inventory risk: While we're already producing 600 desks, we don't know yet what the interest level from our backers is yet. Throughout the campaign, we'll monitor the number of orders closely and adjust our production as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>2. Supply chain risk: While we're confident that we have everything under control, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we’ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.</p>
<p>3. International shipping: We'd love to send ERGO all over the world, but shipping this 120-lb desk is pricey. When shipping to certain countries or areas, it could cost substantially more than what we anticipated.

ERGO is almost complete. All desks shown on our crowd-funding campaigns and in the product video were built on our production line. 
1. Inventory risk: While we're already producing 600 desks, we don't know yet what the interest level from our backers is yet. Throughout the campaign, we'll monitor the number of orders closely and adjust our production as quickly as possible.
2. Supply chain risk: While we're confident that we have everything under control, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we’ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.
3. International shipping: We'd love to send ERGO all over the world, but shipping this 120-lb desk is pricey. When shipping to certain countries or areas, it could cost substantially more than what we anticipated. When this happens, if the cost difference is high, we'll need your help to pay additional shipping.",42.0,7,"6 Campaigns

<p>It is currently based on the <a href=""https://webkit.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">QtWebKit</a> rendering engine which is getting dated and has various issues, described in more detail below.</p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>With this campaign, I hope being able to work full-time for a month (or more!) on qutebrowser. The goal is to add support for the newer <a href=""http://wiki.qt.io/QtWebEngine"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">QtWebEngine</a> backend, which is based on the <a href=""http://www.chromium.org/Home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chromium</a> project (like Google's Chrome browser).</div>

<div>This will make qutebrowser fit for the modern web and solve dozens of existing issues. In addition, it will bring lots of overall security, stability and performance improvements compared to the current QtWebKit backend.</div>

<div>
<h3>What QtWebEngine will get you</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px;font-weight: bold;line-height: 24px;"">Security</span><br/></p>
</div>
<div>QtWebEngine enforces <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HTTP Strict Transport Security</a>, which ensures HTTPS is used on websites that support it, protecting you from downgrade attacks.</div>
<div>The current backend also has <a href=""https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/19/webkitgtk-gets-security-updates/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/01/on-webkit-security-updates/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">other known security issues</a> that are fixed in QtWebEngine, which is updated much more regularly.</div>
<h4>Stability</h4>
<div>There are <a href=""https://blogs.gnome.org/mcatanzaro/2016/02/19/webkitgtk-gets-security-updates/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/issues/1289"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">various</a> <a href=""https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/issues/1163"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">qutebrowser</a> <a href=""https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/issues/1047"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">stability</a> <a href=""https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/issues/561"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">issues</a> for which QtWebKit is to blame. With QtWebEngine, all those problems will be gone, and so will be crashes experienced by many users on Twitter or Facebook.</div>
<h4>Future of QtWebKit</h4>
<div>QtWebKit <a href=""https://wiki.qt.io/New_Features_in_Qt_5.6#Removed_Modules"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">got removed in Qt 5.6</a>. While most Linux distributions will keep it around for a while, some are expected to drop it (or have already done so). This means qutebrowser will not run on those platforms anymore. With QtWebEngine, qutebrowser will be ready for the future, as QtWebEngine is <a href=""https://codereview.qt-project.org/#/q/project:qt/qtwebengine+OR+project:qt/qtwebengine-chromium,n,z"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">very actively developed</a> and will probably be so for years to come.</div>
<h4>Support for other engines</h4>
<div>I plan to keep QtWebKit support for the time being, as some Linux distributions (Debian/Ubuntu) don't package QtWebEngine as of yet.</div>
<div>Since the qutebrowser code will work with two different engines, it'll be easier to add support for additional backends. I'll definitely keep an eye on Mozilla's <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servo_%28layout_engine%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Servo</a> for the future.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Goal</h3> <p>My goal is to raise 3000€ to work on QtWebEngine support in qutebrowser full-time for a month.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Depending on where you live, this probably sounds like a lot of money.</p>
<p>Living in Switzerland is rather expensive, and what <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">you'd probably consider quite a good salary is really modest here.</span></p>
<p>Adjusting for the ""<a href=""http://location.rkh.im/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">location factors</a>"" (which I <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">believe are a quite reasonable combination of various sources), that amount</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> <a href=""http://location.rkh.im/calculator/DE;US;GB;CH/3k?time_unit=month&amp;base=CH"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">corresponds to</a>:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">1300 EUR (assuming you're living in Germany)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">1200 GBP</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">2300 USD</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>If I raise less or more money, I'll be able to work full-time on qutebrowser for a shorter or longer period of time, up to around 2.5 months.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>A few examples:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>3000 EUR is my goal, which means I'll be able to work <b>4 weeks</b> (20 days) full-time on qutebrowser.</li>
<li>If I only raise 1500 EUR, I'll be able to dedicate <b>2 weeks</b> to qutebrowser</li>
<li>If I raise 6000 EUR, I can work on qutebrowser for <b>a full two months</b>!</li>
</ul>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I'll also need to find a good trade-off between the (extra) money raised and the quality of stickers/t-shirts I can purchase. They become a lot cheaper in higher quantities - and if there is some extra money, I might choose to invest it in better t-shirts/stickers rather than working a day or two more.</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div>
<h3>What you'll get</h3>
</div><div>For any pledge level starting with <b>€5</b>, you'll be listed in a ""backers"" file which will be linked from the README.</div><div>For <b>€20</b> and above, you'll get 5 qutebrowser stickers to stick to your laptop, or anywhere else!</div><div>For <b>€60</b> and above, you'll get a qutebrowser t-shirt as well as 5 stickers. The t-shirt will be black or dark blue.</div><div>Both the t-shirt and the stickers will have the the <a href=""https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/blob/master/icons/qutebrowser-256x256.png"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">qutebrowser logo</a> on them, as well as ""qutebrowser.org"" and maybe its slogan, ""a vim-like browser"".</div><div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">With </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">€150</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, you'll sponsor a whole day of qutebrowser development, and you'll get a t-shirt and stickers as well. I'll organize a WebRTC/Google Hangout session with you (or IRC/mail if you prefer), to talk about what you like/dislike about qutebrowser, or anything else you'd like to talk about. You'll also be listed as a day sponsor in the backers file, optionally with an URL of your choice.</span><br/>
</div><div>For <b>€300</b>, you'll also get a WebRTC/Hangouts session (or IRC/mail if you prefer), and I'll talk to you about what qutebrowser issue is bugging you the most. I'll then (within reason) prioriti[zs]e that issue, and try to fix it as soon as possible after QtWebEngine support is implemented. Of course, you'll also get a t-shirt and stickers. You'll also be listed as a gold sponsor in the backers file, optionally with an URL of your choice.</div><div><br/></div><div>For the stickers and t-shirts, a small shipping fee is added (except for the €150/€300 perks). I can ship the stickers for 2€ worldwide. Shipping for the t-shirt is 5€ within the EU and 10€ worldwide, to be sure I can cover my costs.</div><div><br/></div><div>I'll also keep a public <b>development blog</b>, with the goal of posting an update with the current state and what I've worked on every 1-2 days.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>QtWebEngine support will be a lot of work, and a lot could possibly take more time than I estimate. I hope to get the biggest chunk out of the way, but it's certainly possible not everything listed in <a href=""https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/issues/666"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the issue</a> will be implemented after the month. I'll of course continue to work on qutebrowser (like I am already) in my free time after the campaign, focusing on getting QtWebEngine up to speed!</div>
<div><br/></div> <p>I've never printed and shipped t-shirts or stickers on this scale before, so I'll probably need some time to find a company which I can trust to provide a good quality. This is why the estimated shipping date is set to August, to ensure I have plenty of time to ensure neither you nor I am getting ripped off.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I'll probably have time from June to mid-September to work on qutebrowser, but I'll also have some other obligations (like the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/python-testing-sprint-mid-2016/x/9115941#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">python testing sprint</a>, from which qutebrowser will indirectly benefit too). This means there might be some small breaks in between. I'm confident I can make room for 1-3 months of development time (starting in June/July/August) without any issues though.</p>
<p>If the total amount raised is significantly more than 9000€, I'll work on qutebrowser 3 months this late summer and use the rest of the money to work on qutebrowser full-time during my university semester break next year.</p>

The campaign has now ended. If you missed it and still want shirts or stickers, please contact me, I might still have some left.
The development will start on 6th of May, and I set up a development blog where I'll blog daily-ish updates.

My name is Florian Bruhin, also known as The Compiler. I am the main developer of qutebrowser, a web browser with a keyboard-focused user interface inspired by the vim editor.

qutebrowser is a very active project with a big community: More than 60 people have contributed over 250 changesets (pull requests), and hundreds of people are actively using it. In the past 2.5 years, nearly 7500 changes (commits) were uploaded.






It is currently based on the QtWebKit rendering engine which is getting dated and has various issues, described in more detail below.


With this campaign, I hope being able to work full-time for a month (or more!) on qutebrowser. The goal is to add support for the newer QtWebEngine backend, which is based on the Chromium project (like Google's Chrome browser).

This will make qutebrowser fit for the modern web and solve dozens of existing issues. In addition, it will bring lots of overall security, stability and performance improvements compared to the current QtWebKit backend.


What QtWebEngine will get you
Security

QtWebEngine enforces HTTP Strict Transport Security, which ensures HTTPS is used on websites that support it, protecting you from downgrade attacks.
The current backend also has other known security issues that are fixed in QtWebEngine, which is updated much more regularly.
Stability
There are various qutebrowser stability issues for which QtWebKit is to blame. With QtWebEngine, all those problems will be gone, and so will be crashes experienced by many users on Twitter or Facebook.
Future of QtWebKit
QtWebKit got removed in Qt 5.6. While most Linux distributions will keep it around for a while, some are expected to drop it (or have already done so). This means qutebrowser will not run on those platforms anymore. With QtWebEngine, qutebrowser will be ready for the future, as QtWebEngine is very actively developed and will probably be so for years to come.
Support for other engines
I plan to keep QtWebKit support for the time being, as some Linux distributions (Debian/Ubuntu) don't package QtWebEngine as of yet.
Since the qutebrowser code will work with two different engines, it'll be easier to add support for additional backends. I'll definitely keep an eye on Mozilla's Servo for the future.
   Goal My goal is to raise 3000€ to work on QtWebEngine support in qutebrowser full-time for a month.

Depending on where you live, this probably sounds like a lot of money.
Living in Switzerland is rather expensive, and what you'd probably consider quite a good salary is really modest here.
Adjusting for the ""location factors"" (which I believe are a quite reasonable combination of various sources), that amount corresponds to:



1300 EUR (assuming you're living in Germany)


1200 GBP


2300 USD


If I raise less or more money, I'll be able to work full-time on qutebrowser for a shorter or longer period of time, up to around 2.5 months.

A few examples:


3000 EUR is my goal, which means I'll be able to work 4 weeks (20 days) full-time on qutebrowser.
If I only raise 1500 EUR, I'll be able to dedicate 2 weeks to qutebrowser
If I raise 6000 EUR, I can work on qutebrowser for a full two months!


I'll also need to find a good trade-off between the (extra) money raised and the quality of stickers/t-shirts I can purchase. They become a lot cheaper in higher quantities - and if there is some extra money, I might choose to invest it in better t-shirts/stickers rather than working a day or two more.


What you'll get
For any pledge level starting with €5, you'll be listed in a ""backers"" file which will be linked from the README.For €20 and above, you'll get 5 qutebrowser stickers to stick to your laptop, or anywhere else!For €60 and above, you'll get a qutebrowser t-shirt as well as 5 stickers. The t-shirt will be black or dark blue.Both the t-shirt and the stickers will have the the qutebrowser logo on them, as well as ""qutebrowser.org"" and maybe its slogan, ""a vim-like browser"".
With €150, you'll sponsor a whole day of qutebrowser development, and you'll get a t-shirt and stickers as well. I'll organize a WebRTC/Google Hangout session with you (or IRC/mail if you prefer), to talk about what you like/dislike about qutebrowser, or anything else you'd like to talk about. You'll also be listed as a day sponsor in the backers file, optionally with an URL of your choice.
For €300, you'll also get a WebRTC/Hangouts session (or IRC/mail if you prefer), and I'll talk to you about what qutebrowser issue is bugging you the most. I'll then (within reason) prioriti[zs]e that issue, and try to fix it as soon as possible after QtWebEngine support is implemented. Of course, you'll also get a t-shirt and stickers. You'll also be listed as a gold sponsor in the backers file, optionally with an URL of your choice.For the stickers and t-shirts, a small shipping fee is added (except for the €150/€300 perks). I can ship the stickers for 2€ worldwide. Shipping for the t-shirt is 5€ within the EU and 10€ worldwide, to be sure I can cover my costs.I'll also keep a public development blog, with the goal of posting an update with the current state and what I've worked on every 1-2 days.
    Risks & Challenges
QtWebEngine support will be a lot of work, and a lot could possibly take more time than I estimate. I hope to get the biggest chunk out of the way, but it's certainly possible not everything listed in the issue will be implemented after the month. I'll of course continue to work on qutebrowser (like I am already) in my free time after the campaign, focusing on getting QtWebEngine up to speed!
 I've never printed and shipped t-shirts or stickers on this scale before, so I'll probably need some time to find a company which I can trust to provide a good quality. This is why the estimated shipping date is set to August, to ensure I have plenty of time to ensure neither you nor I am getting ripped off.

I'll probably have time from June to mid-September to work on qutebrowser, but I'll also have some other obligations (like the python testing sprint, from which qutebrowser will indirectly benefit too). This means there might be some small breaks in between. I'm confident I can make room for 1-3 months of development time (starting in June/July/August) without any issues though.
If the total amount raised is significantly more than 9000€, I'll work on qutebrowser 3 months this late summer and use the rest of the money to work on qutebrowser full-time during my university semester break next year.

<h2>What It Does</h2>
<p>
	The IntelliBlue tag enables you to
	keep track of your valuable things and alerts you should you leave
	them behind or they are moved out of range from your smartphone. 
	This could be your young children, keys, luggage, bags, laptop and or
	laptop case and lots more.  Basically, anything you can attached the
	IntelliBlue tag to can be monitored by the IntelliBlue app on your
	smartphone.

<br/><p>
	Two-Way Alerting is an option that
	can be set on some or all of your  tags you are monitoring from your
	smartphone, so if a tag goes out of range, then not only does the
	smartphone audibly and visually alert you, but the tag audibly alerts
	too.  This enables you to put a tag in your jacket pocket or any
	where else on yourself and be alerted should you walk away from your
	smartphone... no more left behind phones after a business meeting or
	a night out with friends.
</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/702095/files/20140708063516-radar.png?1404826516"" src="""" style=""float: left; padding: 20px 20px 50px;""/>
	You can decide at what range a tag
	needs to move outside of before you are alerted, this can also be
	done on a per tag basis if so desired.
</p>
<p>
	Should you be alerted of an out of
	range tag, then you can simply use the IntelliBlue app with the built
	in tag finder to track down the wayward tag up to a maximum distance
	of 50m (160 ft).  Using a radar like system the app will guide you
	towards the proximity of the missing item.
</p>
<p>
	If you still cant find the item
	with the tag attached to it, then we can help with that too,  using
	the IntelliBlue Global Community (IGC) which is made up of all
	IntelliBlue apps installed and running on smartphones around the
	world.  You simply mark the tag as Missing on your app, this status
	is then sent to the IntelliBlue servers and broadcast immediately to
	the IGC to be on the look out for your tag.  The minute any other
	IntelliBlue app detects your tag nearby, the location is securely
	transmitted back to your app in the form of a notification, so even
	when an item is lost, there is still help available with finding it.
</p>
<p>
	Remote monitoring allows you to
	relay the tags your smartphone and the IntelliBlue app are monitoring
	to a secure IntelliBlue cloud account, which you can login to from
	any web browser or other mobile phone in the world and see in
	real-time what tag are currently being tracked by your smartphone. 
	You can also choose to share this real-time tracking information with
	others be sending them personal invites.  This feature could be
	really useful for parents and guardians wanting to keep tabs on young
	children perhaps with an older sibling or other family member or
	family friend.

<h2>The App</h2>
<p>
	The IntelliBlue app is designed to run on any Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy 
	capable smartphone, right now this is Apple iPhone devices from the 4S 
	onwards that are running IOS 7 and also Android smartphones running Android 
	version 4.3 or later. You should check with your manufacturer for guaranteed 
	computability, or contact us to check for you.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/702052/files/20140708060342-intelliBlue-phones.png?1404824622"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<p>
	Once downloaded and installed on
	your smartphone, you will be able to add tags to your monitor list,
	activate and deactivate each one as and when required, set the
	alerting type; one-way or two-way and set the range for the alerting
	to start, 10M, 20M etc.  Give each tag you add an easy to remember
	name, laptop bag, keys, bicycle and so on.
</p>
<p>
	The app will start automatically
	when your phone is turned on and will automatically form part of the
	IntelliBlue Global Community (IGC) mentioned earlier to help locate
	missing tags for other IntelliBlue community members and because of
	the use of Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy this will have an almost
	insignificant impact on your smartphone battery life.

<h2>The Tag</h2>
<p>
	The tags we are planning to
	initially use are 40mm x 40mm x 13.5mm and weight just 30g, although
	not the smallest tags available on the market today, they are very
	good at what they do, unlike some of the thinner smaller tags that
	don't seem to quite perform as they should.
</p>
<p>
	The tag uses a small coin battery
	for power that is simple to replace when required, which for average
	use should be around once every 12-18 months.
</p>
<p>
	We are working very closely with
	the hardware manufacturer at this time and are looking to enhance the
	second revision of the tag to make it lighter and perhaps a little
	smaller, also to add extra functionality and improved performance
	like waterproofing, longer life or self recharging battery and

In 2014 my girlfriend disappeared. 
It was 4am. She had gone out with some friends and had not come home. 
There had recently been a sexual assault on campus. I lay in bed, worried. 
I called for the millionth time. Straight to voicemail. Her phone is dead. 
Fast forward to the next day, she is fine. She fell asleep at her sisters. 
She apologizes for worrying me and brings me cookies. All is well. 
But I thought to myself there must be a better way. 
So I bought a power bank. It sucked. It was huge and inconvenient.
So I designed a small, thin one that could fit in a purse or a wallet comfortably.
Engineers laughed at me. Said it couldn't be done. 
Supplier after supplier said it was not possible, batteries are not that thin. 
Year after year I asked and was rejected.

Introduction
Optical microscopes magnify x1,000. Atom microscopes magnify x1,000,000. Building a biomedical atom microscope would revolutionize health research.

A Vision for the Future of Genomics Research
National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)
""...ideas were raised about analogous 'technological leaps'... if they could be achieved, they would revolutionize biomedical research and clinical practice.""
F.S. Collins et al., Nature, Vol. 422, No. 6934, 2003
 
 

In 2006, a supercomputer took 100 days to map 1 million atoms in the first simulation of a life form.  


Today, using an atom microscope, mapping 1 million atoms takes 5 minutes.

 
The Problem
Being a relatively new instrument, atom microscopes are presently built to map atoms of high-tech alloys and semi-conductors - they aren't designed for biological materials.  These microscopes are being used every day to discover new atomic structures and solve technology problems, but only for inorganic materials.  
In recognising the many incredible possibilites of this technology for fundamentally advancing medical research, I'm sure you'll agree that the atom microscope is not yet realising its potential!
 
The Solution
Microscope inventions are not sexy or celebrated, nor are they well-funded, but they underpin scientific revolutions!  Only 200 years ago medical doctors didn't wash their hands and the new theory of tiny 'germs' was ridiculed.  Its hard to believe in something you can’t see, huh?  A pioneer of this era is widely regarded as ‘the father of microbiology’; he was Dutch microscope builder Antonie van Leeuwenhoek.  
An example application:Proteins are the nanometre sized machines that control virtually all of the molecular functions for life -

 They serve as cleaners, builders, motors, messengers, and transporters in our cells. Each protein has a unique sequence of amino acids, which is encoded by a segment of DNA (called a gene).  A protein will fold into a unique and often complex three dimensional conformation which determines the function. 
We understand only a fraction of how proteins operate and how they control human health - this is because we simply struggle to see them!  An atom microscope would enable researchers to directly image, in full 3D, the atomic structure of proteins for the first time.
 
How you can get involved
Why? Across the globe science funding is facing a crisis:
""Science in America: Crisis Looming, Physicists Warn"" - Huffington Post""NIH Research Funding Faces ‘Unprecedented Threat’"" - American Association for Cancer Research""Scientists stage mock funeral outside parliament in funding protest"" - The Guardian""Funding freeze halts research"" - Sydney Morning Herald

You can be part of this exciting research and make it happen!  We are university academics running a national research facility for advanced microscopy & microanalysis - we are passionate about excellence in microscopy and science communication.  Crowd funding is awesome for supporting projects that people think matter.  These science / technology projects are inspirational:

Q: How do atom microscopes lead to discoveries? 
A: Let us show you through interpretive dance!

Winner of Science magazines 'Dance Your Ph.D.' competition!  It will be premiered at TEDx Brussels.

 
1955: Man's first image of the atom
Did you know: the pioneers of man’s first image of the atom didn’t get a Nobel prize?

The earliest version of today’s atom microscope (pictured above) gave man’s first image of the atom.  The year was 1955 and the atom was widely regarded as being too small to ever image.  At Penn State University, Ph.D. student Kanwar Bahadur (left) and supervisor Prof. Erwin Muller (right) had just completed their newly designed field-ion microscope.  The resulting magnification was x1,000,000!  This is literally a thousand times better than an optical microscope. 
Unsure whether to contribute?  Do it for Muller!  Wikipedia doesn't even have a picture on his profile!


Still unsure!?  Do it for Kanwar!  This Indian PhD student discovered the final step needed to achieve atomic resolution AND has Freddie Murcury's good looks.  

He was THE FIRST MAN to see the atom and he doesn't even have a wikipedia page.
 
Perhaps one day these pioneers will be recognised and celebrated for their achievements.
Common names for modern atom microscopes are: atom probe microscopy, atom probe tomography, atom probe field-ion microscopy and 3D atom probe.  How do atom microscopes work and what are some example publications?  Please see the following:

The Atom Microscope team
The project will be led by Prof. Simon Ringer, A/Prof. Filip Braet, and Dr. Peter Liddicoat.  Combining skills and expertise (see profiles for journal & book publications) in atom microscopy and biomedical research, the teams experience also includes: leadership in running a national research facility, diverse international collaborations, and science communication with the wider community.  
The project team collaborates widely with respected international experts and pioneers in microscopy and biomedical science; such as:
Dr. Thomas Kelly, Division Vice President for Atom Probe Technology and Operations, Cameca Instruments
Prof. Eddie Wisse, Department of Pathology, Maastricht University Medical Centre, The Netherlands
Dr. Michael Moody, Department of Materials, University of Oxford
Prof. Tomokazu Matsuura, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, Japan
Dr. Dave Larson, Director of Atom Probe Technology, Cameca Instruments
Prof. Dar-Bin Shieh, Institute of Oral Medicine and Department of Stomatology, National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan
A/Prof. Batiste Gault, Department of Materials Science and Engineering, McMaster University
 
The Biomedical Atom Microscope 
Three key features will be combined to build the first biology focussed atom microscope: specimen cryo-transfer, laser assisted imaging, and bio-informatics data processing.  The technologies for each feature have been successfully employed in different forms in a variety of instruments.  There are, of course, multiple approaches available to integrating the technologies that would be explored and optimised through the project. 

Atom microscopes have already demonstrated an existing capacity, albeit limited, for biological analysis.  In 2011, Gordon et al. published in Nature a study upon the nanoscale chemical tomography of buried organic–inorganic interfaces in the chiton tooth. This is an example of a ‘hard’ biological material study, the critical next step is to configure the atom microscope so that it can study nanoscale ‘soft’ materials – proteins, viruses, antibodies etc. 
 
Research in the cloud
A 21st century microscope is not a stand-alone instrument, rather, it requires orchestration of advanced imaging technologies, data storage facilities, and specialised data processing engines.  As part of the NeCTAR (National eResearch Collaboration Tool and Resources) we are currently building an atom microscope workbench.  The workbench will be accessible from anywhere as a research cloud.  The workbench will contain characterisation tools optimised for performance, publication quality figures, and the user-experience – including a developer platform to add new tools. The virtual lab will be hosted on existing high-performance computing infrastructure and available internationally.",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

For more information on different Windows editions, see <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/Compare"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/Compare</a>.</p><p><strong>Can I install another operating system on the Sirius A?</strong></p><p>The BIOS will be unlocked so theoretically any OS that runs on a x86-64 platform could be installed, including older version of Windows or Linux.However, alternative operating systems will need driver support, which may or may not exist, for all the hardware to fully function.Currently only Windows 10 will be supported via Ockel.</p><p><strong>Can I reinstall Windows 10 if something goes wrong?</strong></p><p>Yes, using an HDMI display and USB media you can do a Windows installation.A support page at the Ockel website and technical support team will be available once the Ockel Sirius A ships.</p><p><strong>Can I attach Thunderbolt 3 accessories to the USB-C port?</strong></p><p>While Thunderbolt 3 shares the same style of connector with USB-C it requires extra chips to enable it. The Sirius A currently does not include that and therefore only USB accessories will work.</p><p><strong>What type of display is included?</strong></p><p>The Full HD panel is still being sourced, however it will likely be an IPS LCD panel.</p><p><strong>Can I use a stylus with the display?</strong></p><p>A capacitive stylus should work with the touchscreen. However, the Ockel Sirius A does not include an active stylus digitizer for more precise location/pressure level detection.</p><p><strong>What type of HDMI port is included?</strong></p><p>The Sirius A includes Intel HD Graphics 405 integrated graphics.This chipset includes an HDMI 1.4 port.</p><p><strong>Can I connect to a wireless display/projector?</strong></p><p>The Sirius A includes an Intel Wi-Fi AC chipset that supports the Miracast standard.</p><p><strong>Can I expand the RAM?</strong></p><p>If you are interested in moving from 4GB to 8GB of RAM, please consider upgrading to the Ockel Sirius A Pro. Adding or changing memory separately is not an option.</p><p><strong>Can I expand the storage?</strong></p><p>Two options are available for expanded storage. Every Sirius A includes a microSDXC slot that supports a maximum of 2TB storage (currently only 400GB is available). The built-in storage is eMMC and cannot be upgraded post-purchase. If you would like to move from 64GB to 128GB of storage, please consider upgrading to the Ockel Sirius A Pro.</p><p><strong>Can I replace the built-in battery?</strong></p><p>While the battery can be serviced at a repair center, the Sirius A does not include a user serviceable battery. Replacements will we available at a reasonable cost.</p><p><strong>How can I charge the Sirius A?</strong></p><p>Two options are available- either AC or USB Type-C.Every Sirius A will ship with an included AC adapter that can be used to power the system and charge the battery. USB-C based chargers or battery packs can also be used.</p><p><strong>Are any of the full-size USB ports powered for use with external drives like port powered Western Digital Passport for instance?</strong></p><p>Yes, you will be able to attach portable harddrives that are powered over USB 2.0, 3.0 or Type-C. </p><p><strong><u>ORDERING QUESTIONS</u></strong></p><p><strong>How can I order more than one Sirius A?</strong></p><p>You're loving the Sirius A as much as we do! Unfortunately, currently the only way to order more than one Sirius A is by placing separate orders. This automatically means you’ll receive multiple packages.

We create products that combine unique designs with new functionalities.We see the mobile and desktop world growing towards each other and with that in mind we developed the Ockel Sirius A.We were able to come up with a design that includes an incredible amount of connection options in one single device, without handing in on portability.  The Ockel Sirius A runs all Windows programs. The majority of Android, iOS and Windows Mobile devices run on ARM compatible architectures, but this architecture cannot run the same software as laptops or desktop PC’s. And in case you have a mobile device that does run on the x86 compatible architecture, you often have to hand in on the options to connect peripherals. The Ockel Sirius A however doesn’t compromise on the architecture used to make your software run and it doesn’t sacrifice connectivity. The Sirius A and the Sirius A Pro are equipped with a full Windows 10 version (64-bit) and give you the real desktop experience with the benefits of a mobile device. The Sirius A is equipped with the latest WiFi AC and Bluetooth technology for fast and wireless connection, but also includes all the ports you want to have when you are working on a desktop PC:The Ockel Sirius A and the Ockel Sirius A Pro are equipped with powerful hardware components, ready for optimal performance.

 Every Ockel Sirius A and Ockel Sirius A Pro includes a fingerprint scanner!Results have shown that more than 55% of our backers would like to have a fingerprint scanner integrated in the Ockel Sirius A. Actually, it was the top requested feature after 8GB RAM, 128GB Flash eMMC Storage and Windows 10 Pro. Features which we already included in our Ockel Sirius A Pro version. Something that makes sense, since most of you will probably carry around their Ockel device and with all your personal data stored on it security is an extremely important issue.The fingerprint add-on is guaranteed for everyone who already joined us and for any future backer. Are there any additional cost for you? No!The small form factor of the Ockel Sirius A makes it hard to believe you are carrying your complete desktop PC with you. We designed the Sirius A in such a way that ventilation fans are not required. This unique feature combined with the flash storage means you can enjoy working in silence and benefit from ultra-low power consumption.The powerful hardware components of the Sirius A obviously generate heat. A regular passive cooling isn’t able to cool this heat. That's why we decided to create an eye-catching heat sink with the pattern of the Canis Major star constellation. This is the star constellation where the Sirius A star (yes, that's right, the Sirius A is a star!) can be found. This heat sink cools all the heat generated by the Ockel Sirius A without any fan. Every Ockel Sirius A comes with 64GB of internal (eMMC) flash storage. The Sirius A Pro comes with 128GB of internal (eMMC) flash storage. Do you require more storage space? Easily extend storage with a Micro SD-card, or connect your own external hard disk using the USB Type-C port or one of the two USB 3.0 ports.The Sirius A has an easy to reach Micro SD-card slot which (theoretically) supports Micro SD-cards up to 2TB. 128GB Flash Storage is the equivalent of 42500+ songs, 64000 images or 985 minutes of video!**(Average file size: 3mb for a song; 2mb for an image; 130mb 1 minute of HD-video recording) With the Sirius A you are able to access all your files, applications and make use of the full Windows 10 desktop experience even when you are away from your office or home, straight out of your pocket.The built-in battery and the full HD touchscreen ensure access to all of your files, wherever you are. The WiFi AC chip enables you to use apps and enter your files stored online.The 3.500 mAh battery has enough capacity to power your Sirius A up to 4 hours (casual use) without being connected to a power outlet.  We offer two versions of the Sirius A: 1. The Ockel Sirius A. Every Sirius A comes with a fully activated license of Windows 10 Home (64-bit), a sleeve and a power adapter.2. The Ockel Sirius A Pro. Every Sirius A Pro comes with a fully activated license of Windows 10 Pro (64-bit), a sleeve and a power adapter.An important note for all Dutch backers: Please use 'Netherlands' as the country of destination in the Indiegogo order process. If you are a reseller, business owner or other Sirius A enthusiast and you would like to buy more than 10 units, please contact us at sales@ockelcomputers.com for the options.  Do you want to use the Ockel Sirius A mainly for business or educational purposes and do you need Windows 10 Pro? Make sure to back our campaign with one of the Ockel Sirius A Pro perks. All perks available with the ‘Pro’ tag will come with a pre-installed version of Windows 10 Pro.The Ockel Sirius A Pro has the same dimensions, processor and other features as the Ockel Sirius A. In addition to that we upgraded the 4GB RAM to 8GB, 64GB eMMC to 128GB eMMC flash storage and last but not least the Ockel Sirius A Pro is running on Windows 10 Pro.Unlock enhanced management and security features with Windows 10 Pro If you choose for an Ockel Sirius A Pro you automatically have access to all the enhanced management and security features and options Windows 10 Pro offers. BitLocker, Dynamic Provisioning, Device Encryption and Windows Information Protection are a few examples of features builtinto Windows 10 Pro.Click here for the complete list of features of all Windows 10 versions. We reached the $500,000 mark! The Avanca team will now create a special Ockel Sirius A ToughGlass, so you can protect the display of your Ockel Sirius A.Avanca ToughGlass is made of top quality tempered Japanese glass, an ultra-thin (0.33mm) sheet of glass that you ‘glue’ to your device. The 9H (Mohs scale) scratch-free surface of the glass is extremely hard and easily resists keys or even a knife. In case you accidently drop your device, Avanca ToughGlass absorbs the impact of the shock, so your screen is less likely to break or burst.We are offering you this amazing product (retail price approximately 25 USD) for free! The shipment of all Ockel Sirius A & Ockel Sirius A Pro models has begun! You can’t accomplish the best results on your own. That’s why our team is made up of  technology addicts, geeks, marketeers and design wizards. We're Ockel, it's great to meet you! The Ockel team is supported by a large network of talented people. It's impossible to mention all of them, but we want to at least name a few.Our special advisor Paul Pardon has more than 30 years of experience in the computer market. He founded Laser Computer, one of Europe's largest and most well known computer brands back in the 80's. He connects Ockel Computers to the right engineers, suppliers and manufacturers and provides no-nonsense business feedback.The awesome Microsoft team offers us their support and knowledge when it comes to software development, licensing or any other question related to Windows 10.We've partnered up with artist, instrument maker and prototype builder Ming Hou Chen to create the best mock-ups and prototypes possible.With this diverse and experienced team and your support, we are confident we can bring this project to life!Our special thanks go out to the entire crew of Evenblij Film for helping us creating the top-notch crowdfunding video and to Laut Rosenbaum for his creative  mind and ultracool sketch of our definition of innovation. Ockel Computers is part of the same group of companies as Avanca, the first company founded by Tim and currently the fastest growing hardware company in the EMEA-region. Ockel Computers was raised with the same spirit as Avanca. In the past nine years we gained the experience and skills needed to launch Ockel and we have access to many of the essential resources needed to successfully bring this project to life: a warehouse, customer service and a network of top engineers and suppliers. At the same time, we have a great amount of freedom to innovate. Last year, the first products in the Ockel Sirius line – the Ockel Sirius B and the Ockel Sirius B Black Cherry – were introduced as crowdfunding campaigns and more than 460.000 dollars were raised to develop the two devices. The feedback and learnings from that project inspired us to create the Ockel Sirius A.We need your support to cover the development and production costs of the Ockel Sirius A. But, more important perhaps, is that you will contribute to a company that has many more ideas about doing things differently. If you, just like Ockel, are passionate about true innovation, join us! As with any hardware project, there are some risks and challenges.We are currently in the prototyping phase of the development process. We have already manufactured a first prototype and we’re currently working on the second one. In the next months we will develop a fully working prototype and in partnership with Microsoft we will be working on the software features, some of them exclusively built for the Ockel Sirius A.The Ockel team has a combined experience of 70 years in the manufacturing world, and together with our network we are confident that we can meet the timelines mentioned in our project. However, unexpected delays can occur due to manufacturing issues, component shortages, and other unforeseen challenges.The Sirius A project is not our first crowdfunding journey. We have gained experience in the past with successful projects on Indiegogo and Kickstarter and learned from our experiences. Our commitment to all of you is that we will make every effort to deliver you an innovative product, and we will communicate with you regularly along our journey of getting the Sirius A delivered to you! HARDWARE QUESTIONS What does x86-64 mean?The Sirius A runs on an Intel x86 platform in 64-bit mode.That means you can run a full desktop version of Windows and install any Windows programs.Unlike mobile phones with ARM processors, the Sirius A can run the same Windows applications as a traditional desktop.What Windows license is included?All Sirius A computers will ship with a fully activated license for Windows 10.The standard model includes Windows 10 Home while the pro model upgrades to Windows 10 Pro, and both have the 64-bit version installed.Why would I want Windows 10 Pro?While the Sirius A Pro includes other upgrades, one major difference is the change from Windows Home to Windows Pro.Only Windows Pro has certain business features enabled including joining a domain, running Bitlocker encryption, and the ability to defer updates. For more information on different Windows editions, see https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/Compare.Can I install another operating system on the Sirius A?The BIOS will be unlocked so theoretically any OS that runs on a x86-64 platform could be installed, including older version of Windows or Linux.However, alternative operating systems will need driver support, which may or may not exist, for all the hardware to fully function.Currently only Windows 10 will be supported via Ockel.Can I reinstall Windows 10 if something goes wrong?Yes, using an HDMI display and USB media you can do a Windows installation.A support page at the Ockel website and technical support team will be available once the Ockel Sirius A ships.Can I attach Thunderbolt 3 accessories to the USB-C port?While Thunderbolt 3 shares the same style of connector with USB-C it requires extra chips to enable it. The Sirius A currently does not include that and therefore only USB accessories will work.What type of display is included?The Full HD panel is still being sourced, however it will likely be an IPS LCD panel.Can I use a stylus with the display?A capacitive stylus should work with the touchscreen. However, the Ockel Sirius A does not include an active stylus digitizer for more precise location/pressure level detection.What type of HDMI port is included?The Sirius A includes Intel HD Graphics 405 integrated graphics.This chipset includes an HDMI 1.4 port.Can I connect to a wireless display/projector?The Sirius A includes an Intel Wi-Fi AC chipset that supports the Miracast standard.Can I expand the RAM?If you are interested in moving from 4GB to 8GB of RAM, please consider upgrading to the Ockel Sirius A Pro. Adding or changing memory separately is not an option.Can I expand the storage?Two options are available for expanded storage. Every Sirius A includes a microSDXC slot that supports a maximum of 2TB storage (currently only 400GB is available). The built-in storage is eMMC and cannot be upgraded post-purchase. If you would like to move from 64GB to 128GB of storage, please consider upgrading to the Ockel Sirius A Pro.Can I replace the built-in battery?While the battery can be serviced at a repair center, the Sirius A does not include a user serviceable battery. Replacements will we available at a reasonable cost.How can I charge the Sirius A?Two options are available- either AC or USB Type-C.Every Sirius A will ship with an included AC adapter that can be used to power the system and charge the battery. USB-C based chargers or battery packs can also be used.Are any of the full-size USB ports powered for use with external drives like port powered Western Digital Passport for instance?Yes, you will be able to attach portable harddrives that are powered over USB 2.0, 3.0 or Type-C. ORDERING QUESTIONSHow can I order more than one Sirius A?You're loving the Sirius A as much as we do! Unfortunately, currently the only way to order more than one Sirius A is by placing separate orders. This automatically means you’ll receive multiple packages. For orders of 10 units or more, please reach out to our Product Manager Jesper Baumgarten (jesper@ockelcomputers.com).Why is a different country showing when I am from the Netherlands?You probably filled-in 'Nederland', 'Holland' or 'The Netherlands' as your shipping country in the ordering process. Due to a small error in the ordering systems of Indiegogo the synonyms for 'Netherlands' are not recognized. Please reach out to us at support@ockelcomputers.com to resolve this issueHow can an early bird back upgrade from the Sirius A to the Sirius A Pro?When the pro model was announced, backers were emailed a special link to streamline the add-on process. If you did not receive the email or need a new copy, please contact support@ockelcomputers.com.What Micro SD specifications are needed? We advise to use a class 10 Micro SD card. However, the Ockel Sirius A is compatible with all Micro SD card versions up to 2TB. Will there be any import duties or costs?For EU backers, no import duties apply. For all other backers, the answer will vary based on your country. Even if there is no import tariff, the shipper may charge you a documentation fee which is typically small ($10 or less). Any standard internal taxes (VAT, state/county sales taxes, etc.) will apply to all backers based on your local laws.What will be the expected retail price?The expected retail price of the Sirius A will be $699 without shipping. During the Indiegogo campaign you will have to chance to order your Sirius A with a huge discount. Once our campaign is over the price will match the expected retail price. The expected retail price of the Sirius A Pro will be $799.How are the shipping costs calculated?Shipping costs vary on your shipping address. The Ockel Sirius A isn’t a cheap device. That’s why we offer a delivery service with track & trace, proof of delivery and insurance. Please note that any import duties that may apply to the Sirius A (only applies for backers outside of the EU) are not included in the shipping costs.Do you offer refunds to backers?In case you would like to drop-out of the campaign before we ship the Ockel Sirius A or Ockel Sirius A Pro, your contribution might be eligible for a refund. Please note that the full sum of your contribution will not be refunded: there are 10% in Indiegogo and payment fees that will be deducted in these cases, as we have had to pay these already. If you would like to request a refund, please reach out to us at: support@ockelcomputers.com. Make sure to include your  PayPal address and/or bank details in the refund request e-mail. PRESS QUESTIONSI’m from the press, who do I have to contact?You can reach out to our Marketing team (press@ockelcomputers.com) for all your press related questions or inquiries.

<p style=""text-align:justify;"">ION Glasses are the first-ever glasses — optical or sunglasses — which interact with your smartphone or tablet. They offer you several functions, such as notifications, remote control, alerts in case of loss and customization.</p>
<p style=""text-align:justify;"">All of this is possible because ION Glasses incorporate a Bluetooth 4.0 chip, a battery, a multi-color LED set, a buzzer and two buttons. All these components are inserted into one of the frame temples. But you will be the only one that knows it, because ION Glasses boast a fashionable and appealing design, whether used as optical glasses or as sunglasses.</p>

You will be the only one that sees it, and only you will know what it means. You only have to download the ION app, available in iOS and Android, and choose when and how you want the LEDs to turn on and let you stay on top of your smartphone or tablet activity.</p>

ION Glasses on the media!











































ION Glasses are the first-ever glasses — optical or sunglasses — which interact with your smartphone or tablet. They offer you several functions, such as notifications, remote control, alerts in case of loss and customization.
All of this is possible because ION Glasses incorporate a Bluetooth 4.0 chip, a battery, a multi-color LED set, a buzzer and two buttons. All these components are inserted into one of the frame temples. But you will be the only one that knows it, because ION Glasses boast a fashionable and appealing design, whether used as optical glasses or as sunglasses.













Even if your phone is on silent mode or in your bag or pocket, if someone calls you, or you receive a chat message, or an SMS, or an update in your social networks, or an e-mail, or an alarm for your date or meeting, ION will notify you privately through your pre-selected light code (you can set the color and the intermittence of the signal). You will be the only one that sees it, and only you will know what it means. You only have to download the ION app, available in iOS and Android, and choose when and how you want the LEDs to turn on and let you stay on top of your smartphone or tablet activity.








The buttons on  ION Glasses, can be used as a remote control to play your favorite music loaded in your smartphone or tablet.Turn the volume up and down or skip a song. Besides, ION Glasses give you the ability to control your smartphone remotely. You will also be able to pass slides in your presentations by simply pressing the button.









If you want, when your ION Glasses move outside a pre-specified radius from your smartphone or tablet … both will beep. And thanks to the radar function, you will be able to see through the screen of any of your devices the exact location of your ION Glasses.  You will also be able to make your smartphone beep by pushing the button on your ION Glasses or making your ION Glasses beep by pushing your smartphone.  This will help you avoid losing your gear at the worst moment.










You will be able to choose your personal notification code, so you’ll be the only one who knows what it means. But you will also be able to simply and easily customize the ION logo in your glasses with whatever light color you wish — or turn off the logo — depending how you feel each day.
The battery life on your ION Glasses averages about a week, depending on usage. You can recharge them just as you would any other mobile device. Your smartphone or tablet will warn you when the ION Glasses battery is getting low.









A Bluetooth 4.0 chip.
A battery, rechargeable through a micro-USB connection. The charge lasts between 3 and 10 days, depending on usage.
A multi-color LED set, only visible to the user (in terms of notifications), and which can also illuminate the logo.
A buzzer (for the beep alerts).
Two buttons (for remote control).
A printed circuit.

All these micro components are inserted into the right temple of the frame. But it will be unnoticeable to you and everybody else  since everything is perfectly and aesthetically hidden.












By definition, the wearable technology has to deserve to be worn. This is why we have been extremely demanding in terms of design. ION Glasses have been designed in collaboration with one of the leading professional Glasses manufacturers. These are glass frames that you would have chosen to wear. You can use it with optical graduated lenses or as sunglasses, featuring advanced sun protection.
The frame is made with a new revolutionary flexible and resistant material: TR90, also known as plastic titanium.








    So, you have your ION Glasses. But, what if you don’t use prescription lenses? Or maybe you would prefer sunglasses?No problem! You will find among the perks the possibility to choose this option, with premium UV protection green tinted organic crystals, or in blue mirror effect color.

Hello, my name is Emmanuel Arinze. I’m an IT Professional and part-time inventor resident in Voorhees, New Jersey.

Working out the functionality of Piknik took a bit of imagineering, but I finally figured it out. I built a couple of rough prototypes to prove the concept and then filed a patent application.
There’s nothing like a working prototype to get an inventor all fired up. Up till then you’re not really sure how your concept will work, or even if it will work at all.
Now Piknik is a dream slowly but surely coming to life. It is the first portable, pressurized beverage dispenser able to store and dispense an assortment of drinks from one easy to use device. Like all useful inventions, Piknik is all about providing convenience and alternatives to the user.
I believe Piknik will be useful in many different settings; tailgate parties, picnics, camping trips, meetings, family gatherings and more.

<p>Fuel Book comprises of a self-installable plug and play device and an app (Android, iOS and Windows phone) which together creates a Smart environment through the diagnostic port of the car (which can be found using the Fuel Book app). Once you connect the Fuel Book device to the car, launch the App and connect (through Bluetooth) to the device to open a new world of possibilities with your car such as Fuel Analysis, Diagnostics, Tag, Accident Prevention, Locating your car, Finding you a parking location, Opening of Doors/Trunk, Even starting your cars Engine all from a tap on your phone !</p>
<h3></h3><h2><strong>Did you miss the Indiegogo Campaign?</strong></h2><p><strong>Not to worry! </strong>Go to <a href=""http://www.myfuelbook.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.myfuelbook.com</a> and enlist yourself in the pre-order queue.</p><p>Thank you,<strong><br/>The Fuel Book Team</strong></p><b>Smart Environment with Apps:</b><div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1420987/files/20150427225042-fuelcover.jpg?1430200242"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
We found Fuel Book to have a greater potential, hence have launched an open SDK and App store for developers to create Fuel Book powered App’s and Accessories (imagine a rear view camera which also acts like a security cam).</div><div>
<h5>
<span style=""line-height: 26px; background-color: initial; font-weight: normal;"">Here are some of the features (Fuel Book Apps as we like to call it) which are readily available with Fuel Book and also provides visual data to the HUD.</span><br/>
</h5>
</div>
<div>
<h5>Fuel Analysis: </h5>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1405704/files/20150422055127-MY_FUEL_BOOK_1080P.mp4_snapshot_00.50__2015.04.22_18.15.03_.jpg?1429707087"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>Fuel Book will let you know at which point you'll run out of fuel based on your car's status and also display nearby ATM's and Fuel Stations (Gas Stations) before you run dry. It also sends a notification to your smart watch (tested with Android Wear and Pebble) so you can always stay updated. Fuel Book also add's new Fuel Stations into the map, e.g.; a person has filled up at a fuel station not available in the map, due to the rise in Fuel, fuel book knows you've filled up and prompts you to rate the Fuel station experience.</p>
<h5>Self-Diagnostics: </h5>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1405705/files/20150422055159-MY_FUEL_BOOK_1080P.mp4_snapshot_01.15__2015.04.22_18.17.08_.jpg?1429707119"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>Through Fuel Book's self-diagnostics feature users can diagnose their car and look into what's the problem such an exhaust clog, type of engine trouble, etc. It also provides the ability to generate a approx. cost evaluation for solving the problem if any exists.</p>
<h5>Dashboards: </h5>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1405743/files/20150422060931-dashboard.jpg?1429708171"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>You can easily create custom dashboards and share it with the Fuel Book community or download hundred's from the Fuel Book App store to add life to that plain old needle in your car. </p>
<h5>Tag: </h5>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1405711/files/20150422055318-MY_FUEL_BOOK_1080P.mp4_snapshot_01.02__2015.04.22_18.16.27_.jpg?1429707198"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>The Tag feature is targeted towards those travelling in groups so that you can know whether they are ahead or trailing behind.</p>
<h5>Black Box: </h5>
<p>The Fuel Book black box is like an aeroplanes black box. If you ever meet with an accident you can utilise Fuel Book as an alibi as it records your driving speed, gear shifts and break's every second. It also notifies the registered emergency number along with the GPS coordinate through an SMS or another Fuel Book user if your in the tag mode.</p>
<h5>Social Terrain Mapping: </h5>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1405713/files/20150422055347-MY_FUEL_BOOK_1080P.mp4_snapshot_01.30__2015.04.22_18.18.38_.jpg?1429707227"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>Wanted to take a path but not sure how the road is going to turn out ! Well with the Social Terrain Mapping of Fuel Book, all road bumps and speed breakers are stored through the experience of other Fuel Book users who had travelled previously through the same route. The Fuel Book notifies the driver to slow down when the Bump/Speed breaker is near and makes a noise if the user travels at a speed of 60 during night time.</p>
<h5>Smart Horn: </h5>
<p>With Smart Horn you can now know what's the hold-up on the Traffic Jam by sending a message to the user in the front asking what's the holdup. We're targeting smart horn at the hospital segment by equipping Fuel Book's in Ambulances to notify users in the path taken by the Ambulances to make way.</p>
<h5>AI Engine: </h5>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1405715/files/20150422055412-MY_FUEL_BOOK_1080P.mp4_snapshot_01.38__2015.04.22_18.18.55_.jpg?1429707252"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>The AI Engine is a backend driver analysis feature which runs silently in the Fuel Book’s background and sends user driving characteristics data to our 128bit encrypted cloud storage. In a layman’s perspective Fuel Book will know based on the driving data weather you will make a turn to the left or the right, or at what point in time you will accelerate and hit the brake.
By using the data, our AI engine analysis Fuel Book powered vehicles coming your way or near you  provides a Smart caution notification if it senses trouble.</p>
<p>Fuel Book’s AI Engine saves lives. We've completed beta tests with cab drivers and are now ready for a full launch.</p>

<h5>Fuel Book Powered HUD: </h5>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432013259/kahdv6ub9hp6chwydfky.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With the HUD, you can save battery on your smart phone and keep your eyes on the road all the time.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>During our testing we found certain cars have the diagnostics port enclosed behind a cover and it was even harder to get the GPS Lock hence we've placed the GPS on the HUD rather than the Fuel Book device since the GPS Lock time is 15 x Faster</li>
<li>The HUD will also save your phone's battery by not using the phone's inbuilt GPS and using the ping location provided by the HUD</li>
<li>You can custom design the HUDs appearance with the Fuel Book App and place the Apps whose notifications you wish to see</li>
<li>The HUDs Smart Assistant will respond to when asked with the hot word ""Fuel Book"", e.g; ""Fuel Book"" ""Where Am I"" (or) ""Nearest hotels in the area""</li>
<li>The colorful ePaper display with ambient sensor allows the HUD to be the brightest at any given time of the day</li>
<li>Boosted with a 2000 mAh battery the HUD is capable of providing 5 continuous days of vigorous usage and up to 10+ days on casual usage and with the solar cells in place you ca have a tangle free experience on drive.</li>
<li>The Smart Sensor automatically turns the HUD on only when the Car is started</li>
<li>You needn't be connected to the Fuel Book device for displaying device data such as Speed, Fuel Status and Diagnostics</li>

Did you miss the Indiegogo Campaign?Not to worry! Go to http://www.myfuelbook.com and enlist yourself in the pre-order queue.Thank you,The Fuel Book TeamSmart Environment with Apps:

We found Fuel Book to have a greater potential, hence have launched an open SDK and App store for developers to create Fuel Book powered App’s and Accessories (imagine a rear view camera which also acts like a security cam).

Here are some of the features (Fuel Book Apps as we like to call it) which are readily available with Fuel Book and also provides visual data to the HUD.



Fuel Analysis: 

Fuel Book will let you know at which point you'll run out of fuel based on your car's status and also display nearby ATM's and Fuel Stations (Gas Stations) before you run dry. It also sends a notification to your smart watch (tested with Android Wear and Pebble) so you can always stay updated. Fuel Book also add's new Fuel Stations into the map, e.g.; a person has filled up at a fuel station not available in the map, due to the rise in Fuel, fuel book knows you've filled up and prompts you to rate the Fuel station experience.
Self-Diagnostics: 

Through Fuel Book's self-diagnostics feature users can diagnose their car and look into what's the problem such an exhaust clog, type of engine trouble, etc. It also provides the ability to generate a approx. cost evaluation for solving the problem if any exists.
Dashboards: 

You can easily create custom dashboards and share it with the Fuel Book community or download hundred's from the Fuel Book App store to add life to that plain old needle in your car. 
Tag: 

The Tag feature is targeted towards those travelling in groups so that you can know whether they are ahead or trailing behind.
Black Box: 
The Fuel Book black box is like an aeroplanes black box. If you ever meet with an accident you can utilise Fuel Book as an alibi as it records your driving speed, gear shifts and break's every second. It also notifies the registered emergency number along with the GPS coordinate through an SMS or another Fuel Book user if your in the tag mode.
Social Terrain Mapping: 

Wanted to take a path but not sure how the road is going to turn out ! Well with the Social Terrain Mapping of Fuel Book, all road bumps and speed breakers are stored through the experience of other Fuel Book users who had travelled previously through the same route. The Fuel Book notifies the driver to slow down when the Bump/Speed breaker is near and makes a noise if the user travels at a speed of 60 during night time.
Smart Horn: 
With Smart Horn you can now know what's the hold-up on the Traffic Jam by sending a message to the user in the front asking what's the holdup. We're targeting smart horn at the hospital segment by equipping Fuel Book's in Ambulances to notify users in the path taken by the Ambulances to make way.
AI Engine: 

The AI Engine is a backend driver analysis feature which runs silently in the Fuel Book’s background and sends user driving characteristics data to our 128bit encrypted cloud storage. In a layman’s perspective Fuel Book will know based on the driving data weather you will make a turn to the left or the right, or at what point in time you will accelerate and hit the brake.
By using the data, our AI engine analysis Fuel Book powered vehicles coming your way or near you  provides a Smart caution notification if it senses trouble.
Fuel Book’s AI Engine saves lives. We've completed beta tests with cab drivers and are now ready for a full launch.
Park Track: 


Parked your car in a massively huge parking lot and have no clue where it is? well with Fuel Book you can utilize the park track feature to pin point the exact location of where you parked last and also the history of parks so that you can always go back if you had lost something along the way. Park Track also has an option to Publish your parking space along with attributes to know if it’s a Free parking space or not (with the cost) so that another user searching for a parking space can easily find the way.

Reward Points: 

Haven't you always wanted to challenge your neighbor based on your driving skills, mileage, location discovery, etc. Well with Fuel Book you can do that and so much more by even utilizing these points for Fuel Book store purchases and earning badges along the way. 
Fuel Book SDK's and Fuel Book powered Accessories: 
What we as a team have done is just the start, were inviting Developers and Hardware enthusiasts to develop and build Fuel Book App's and Accessories so that the possibilities are endless.


You can even unlock/start the engine/open the boot of your car with a knock on your phone or Smart Watch!


Fuel Book can receive simple alerts and notifications from if this then that (ifttt.com) or our web based RESTful endpoint. More adventurous developers can use the Fuel Book SDK and Hardware API, with its Arduino-like abstractions and simple C structure, to gain complete control of the car. 


Fuel Book Powered HUD: 

With the HUD, you can save battery on your smart phone and keep your eyes on the road all the time.

The HUD will also save your phone's battery by not using the phone's inbuilt GPS and using the ping location provided by the HUD
You can custom design the HUDs appearance with the Fuel Book App and place the Apps whose notifications you wish to see
The HUDs Smart Assistant will respond to when asked with the hot word ""Fuel Book"", e.g; ""Fuel Book"" ""Where Am I"" (or) ""Nearest hotels in the area""
The colorful ePaper display with ambient sensor allows the HUD to be the brightest at any given time of the day
Boosted with a 2000 mAh battery the HUD is capable of providing 5 continuous days of vigorous usage and up to 10+ days on casual usage and with the solar cells in place you ca have a tangle free experience on drive.
The Smart Sensor automatically turns the HUD on only when the Car is started

Our headphones are equipped with state-of-the-art technology. An ultra-broad frequency reach and the finest speaker driver give you the warm, deep and full sound experience you need to keep you going during a workout. We know an excellent bass beat is key during a run, bootcamp or heavy workout, so we partnered with top sound quality engineers to create the perfect sound.

A Bluetooth® connection is a bit like a data pipeline between your device and the D1 Switch Headset. This pipeline has a maximum width, so it can sometimes be difficult to flow large audio files through it. The aptX® technology solves the problem by reducing the size of the audio files so they can be squeezed through the wireless pipeline, but without affecting the sound quality. </span></p><p>The perfect fit and 3 in-ear tips of the D1 Switch create passive noise cancelation. Sounds of traffic and voices will be reduced to a minimum, giving you an optimal balance of the best sound experience and awareness of what's going on around you.</p><p>Nothing kills a workout more than a low battery. The D1 Switch Headset offers up to 6 hours of non-stop music and audio coaching. Even during a marathon training run or a killer workout you will be accompanied by your favorite songs and audio coaching. The maximum talk time is 8 hours. When the battery is low, simply use the included Micro USB cable to charge the battery within 1-2 hours.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449653489/kvtghqtlytee0uzokswf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449153323/tm3ffzxk8tmpjv8dj9kd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","We are excited to introduce the Avanca D1 Switch Headset: the first wireless sports headset that matches with any outfit. It's ultra-light, it's highly flexible and it's equipped with the best technology available to keep you going during a workout. Best of all, it has a unique color system so you can adapt the headphones to your style.Need a reason to get the D1 Switch? We give you 10!


Bloggers love our headsetTop-notch design

Our team has a combined experience of more than 60 years in product design, innovation, marketing and sales and we've partnered up with the finest engineers to create the D1 Switch Headset.

Flexible design for style and comfort
With a weight of approximately 3 match-boxes and an extremely flexible design, our headset offers 100% freedom of movement. You easily adjust the headset to the shape of your head and ears. You will not be bothered by a headset that slips off your head all the time or tangled cables getting in your way. Whether you are running, working on your burpees, practicing yoga or riding a bike, the D1 Switch is your ultimate workout buddy.The stylish in-ear earbuds are carefully designed to rest comfortably inside your ears and to maximize the sound output. The headset comes with 3 different sizes of earbuds, so you can make it fit exactly to your needs. First-class sound experienceThe Avanca D1 Switch Headset isn't only the coolest, lightest and most versatile sports headset, it also offers you the best audio experience possible. Our headphones are equipped with state-of-the-art technology. An ultra-broad frequency reach and the finest speaker driver give you the warm, deep and full sound experience you need to keep you going during a workout. We know an excellent bass beat is key during a run, bootcamp or heavy workout, so we partnered with top sound quality engineers to create the perfect sound. The D1 Switch is the best buddy for your bass-loving ears.We included the last generation Bluetooth® 4.0 BlueCore® CSR 8645™ with aptX®. A Bluetooth® connection is a bit like a data pipeline between your device and the D1 Switch Headset. This pipeline has a maximum width, so it can sometimes be difficult to flow large audio files through it. The aptX® technology solves the problem by reducing the size of the audio files so they can be squeezed through the wireless pipeline, but without affecting the sound quality. The perfect fit and 3 in-ear tips of the D1 Switch create passive noise cancelation. Sounds of traffic and voices will be reduced to a minimum, giving you an optimal balance of the best sound experience and awareness of what's going on around you.Nothing kills a workout more than a low battery. The D1 Switch Headset offers up to 6 hours of non-stop music and audio coaching. Even during a marathon training run or a killer workout you will be accompanied by your favorite songs and audio coaching. The maximum talk time is 8 hours. When the battery is low, simply use the included Micro USB cable to charge the battery within 1-2 hours.
Compatible with all Bluetooth devicesOur headset can be used with any Bluetooth device. Connect your smartphone, tablet or MP3-player in less than 20 seconds. You don’t need any additional software. The Bluetooth 4.0 BlueCore® CSR 8645™ chip enables a stable and safe connection.If your device supports Near Field Communication (NFC), things get even better, as the D1 Switch can be connected using NFC as well. Please note that the D1 Fixed versions (without switchable covers) do not support NFC as they are equipped with a CSR 8645™ chip. You'll need to use Bluetooth in order to connect your smartphone or tablet.The D1 Switch Headset remembers your connected device(s), so the next time you start to workout you will be ready to go in a few seconds. With a wireless reach of 10 meters / 33 feet you don’t have to worry about a deteriorating sound experience.
Single touch control
The D1 Switch Headset is extremely easy to operate. We've integrated two control panels. One to control the volume and a second one to forward or rewind songs. By separating the volume control from the song control, you don't have to worry anymore about accidently moving forward to the next song, when you were actually looking to pump up the volume.Built-in mic for callsThe headset automatically switches from music to call mode when someone is trying to reach you. Using the single touch control you can answer incoming phone calls without taking off your headphones. Encryption keeps your calls completely safe and the high-quality microphone enables you to speak at a normal volume. No need to scream or talk into your phone like a walkie-talkie!
Switchable Colors for Ultimate Freedom of Expression

The Avanca D1 Switch Headset is the world’s first wireless sports headset that adapts to your style in every way you can imagine. Match your headset to your outfit by simply swapping the covers of the headset. 

Whether you want a stylish soft color or a glamorous golden look: anything is possible with the D1 Switch Headset. We offer a variety of 19 colors as a kick-off here on Indiegogo, but we promise you we will add many more colors if you decide to back us and we reach our funding goal.

The idea for the D1 Switch Headset was born after we talked with sport bloggers and fans of Avanca about our D1 Sports Headset, our wildly popular headset with fixed covers, also available on Indiegogo (and ready for immediate shipment). We realized the days you are going for a run in your old baggy sweatpants are over. The D1 Switch Headset offers a perfect solution to those who want to be fashionable and sporty at the same time!



Weather-proof. Sweat-proof. Excuse-proof.The Avanca D1 Switch Headset is ideal for outdoor and sports activities in any weather condition. The IPx5-rating protects the ear buds from dust, rain and heavy sweating. The flexibility of the headset makes it easy to fold and store in your bag or pocket. We will include a free carrying pouch with any perk.

Meet the team

Tim, our founder and CEO quit his job in 2008 to pursue his dream: to create and sell innovative products with a stunning design and excellent performance. All our products share one feature that is the driving force behind everything we do: they are functional innovations.
A passion for Brazil inspired Tim to name the brand Avanca, derived from the Portuguese word ‘avançar’ which means ‘moving forward’. He asked Nathalie, our marketing director, to join him. They started from Tim's living room and moved to a 14 metre / 150 square feet office a couple of months later. In 2016, our team will pack moving boxes for the 5th time. Our company grows each day, but we strongly hold on to the spirit and vibe we had back then in that living room.
In the past 7 years we expanded our business to over 60 countries and successfully introduced dozens of products. These products aren't something we create on our own. Customer and blogger feedback and review panels have always been our focus. 



With this Indiegogo campaign we take our customer focus to the next level. We love to hear your ideas and thoughts. If you have any questions or comments, drop us a message at indiegogo@avanca.nl or use the comment section!

But how do they go further afield? Maps on smartphones today are unusable by the elderly - labels are too small and controls are too fiddly. Our Go &amp; Explore app will create custom map layers with senior-friendly features such as digital breadcrumbs, geo-fencing and clearly marked places of interest to help get seniors get out and get active! </span></p>

How to go beyond simple movement detection and fall detection without sacrificing battery life? We think the answer is in wearables and will be working with hardware partners to use Bluetooth to pair with special bracelets that incorporate accelerometers and dedicated alert buttons. </span></p>

Oh my goodness, you did it! You really did it! $54,001! We can't quite believe it.
Check out all the campaign updates here, and make sure to watch our latest video. None of this would be possible if it weren't for your generosity and support. Thank you SO so much!
Now, if you'll excuse us, we have a LOT of work to do! And we've never been more excited...
 

Thanks to the massive support from all of our fans, we SMASHED our $7,000 Dollar-4-Dollar matching campaign and we are SO close to hitting our goal! Just $5,500 in 3 days!
Please help us achieve (and maybe even exceed!) our goal so we can continue improving the lives of seniors through custom-designed smartphone apps. 
Your contributions will go toward:
i) Buying secondhand iPhone 3GSs so underserved seniors from Willing Hearts and Lions Befrienders can enjoy Silverline apps.
ii) Developing new and improved Silverline apps for seniors around the world.
We're all counting on your support in these last 3 days.  Thank you, and please contribute now!
  

Thanks to your support, our Dollar-4-Dollar Matching campaign was a huge success!  We'll be receiving the $7,000 from our generous anonymous donor and updating the campaign page soon.  Meanwhile, as at 15th April, the grand total raised to bring the smartphone revolution to seniors stands at over $43,000!  Great job!
 


In celebration of reaching 100 supporters and 50% of our total goal, we're offering a great new reward - the $149 COMBO PACK - featuring a refurbished, unlocked iPhone3GS (8GB or 16BG) with all updated Silverline apps pre-installed! 
 
You told us that many of your older friends and relatives don't have iPhones, but they would love to use Silverline apps. So we're offering the $149 COMBO PACK as a cheap and easy way to get both an iPhone3GS and updated Silverline apps. Just insert your own SIM card - then you're ready to go. Get your $149 COMBO PACK quick - only 50 are available!
 
Silverline is a new project that creates apps specifically designed for seniors. We have spent the last 18 months working with underserved seniors, providing them with donated second-hand smartphones and building apps to address their needs. It’s been amazing to see how this new technology has improved the quality of their lives. But we’re just scratching the surface. Now we want to bring this concept to all seniors - to our parents and grandparents - so they too can benefit from the smartphone revolution.

All the Silverline apps can be used anywhere in the world - and are optimized for the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore. The apps are currently available in English and Chinese (Mandarin), and will soon be available in other languages too.
 
United States Dollars (USD) are used for all contribution levels.
 



DISCOVER allows users to snap pictures of where they are or interesting things they see and documents them in a time orientated photo album. Each image is geo-tagged and time stamped automatically with the user given the option to describe each image. It is a wonderful way to document and share their activities through the day.
 


WELL BEING provides simple reminders for taking medicine, drinking water and doing exercise. It allows users to monitor their moods and watch videos providing simple health tips to implement in their daily routines. We are continuing to work with health authorities to create additional apps focused on keeping seniors happy and healthy. 
 


INSPIRE features daily headlines and human interest stories delivered in text, picture and video formats. These stories keep users informed of current events and raises their spirits through feel-good stories and uplifting quotes. 
 


CONNECT presents the contact list in a user-friendly and visual format. Using pictures of the contact as well as their name in text provides simple navigation to the visually impaired.
 


Simple icons for EMERGENCY assistance are just a tap of the finger away. In the case of a fall being detected or the phone remaining idle for more than a certain period of time, a message will be sent to ensure there is nothing wrong. If the message is not verified, a message will be sent to a caregiver's phone notifying them of the situation.
 
The Discover, Well Being, Inspire, Connect and Emergency apps you see above were developed to meet the needs of underserved seniors in Singapore. Our first users loved them, and we know you will too. So we kept the core functionality and re-designed them for all seniors by providing tailored content, more features and an improved look and feel.
 

We have our eye on the future, and we are excited to continue developing apps to improve the lives of seniors. Here are the next suite of apps we’ll be creating if we reach our funding goal. Of course, these apps are just the beginning. With your support, we will develop dozens of new apps over the next few years.
GO & EXPLORE - our Discover app gets seniors out of the house and snapping away on their cameras. But how do they go further afield? Maps on smartphones today are unusable by the elderly - labels are too small and controls are too fiddly. Our Go & Explore app will create custom map layers with senior-friendly features such as digital breadcrumbs, geo-fencing and clearly marked places of interest to help get seniors get out and get active! 
PERSONAL SECURITY - we believe it's important for seniors to feel secure both in the home and when out and about. How to go beyond simple movement detection and fall detection without sacrificing battery life? We think the answer is in wearables and will be working with hardware partners to use Bluetooth to pair with special bracelets that incorporate accelerometers and dedicated alert buttons. 
HEALTH & WELLBEING - we have a dedicated app for health and wellbeing, but we know that there is much more to do! We want to build improved reminders and a simplified medication tracking system that can handle the complicated medication regimes of senior citizens. 
CONNECTING WITH FAMILY - the most highly requested feature we’ve received is the ability to easily share photos and other memories. We want to make it simple to transfer images from your phone or connected social media accounts and have them appear directly on your loved one’s device. We’re also working hard on messaging systems that make it easy to communicate without poking about on tiny on-screen keyboards.
 


Silverline’s CARE PACK provides an underserved senior with everything he or she needs to take full advantage of the new apps and smartphone:

A secondhand iPhone 3GS sourced from a professional refurbisher who ensures the phone is fully functional and cleaned of the previous owner’s data 
A year-long data and voice plan 

All CURRENT AND FUTURE Silverline Apps, including Inspire, Connect, Well Being, Discover and Emergency and all future apps as they become available.

One-on-one smartphone training

We are providing the initial round of care packs to beneficiaries served by Lions Befrienders and Willing Hearts in Singapore. SingTel will provide the data and voice plan, and local volunteers will provide the training. We are working with other charities, volunteers and telecoms in USA, UK, HK and Australia to provide care packs to beneficaries in those countries too.
 
The Silverline apps are designed to run on older hardware, starting with the iPhone 3GS. We believe there’s plenty of life left in old hardware!
Hardware requirements: iPhone 3GS, 4, 4S or 5
Software requirements: iOS 5.x or later 
 
We've built the first suite of apps and received rave reviews from the first users. We’ve also created an amazing charity program in collaboration with SingTel and local charities. Now we need your help to take the next steps.
Funds contributed under the SUPPORTER PACK, APP PACKS, FAMILY PACK, CUSTOM PACK and CHAMPION PACK will be used to develop future Silverline apps.
Funds contributed under the CARE PACK, COMMUNITY PACK and SUPER COMMUNITY PACK will be used to provide underserved seniors with the apps and a refurbished smartphone.
Of course, reasonable costs will be used to provide contributors their rewards as listed.

<p>Pull out your smartphone. You probably have an app for navigation, your social networking, your favorite game, and a music app.  But <i>what if you could create great apps for all the great ideas you think about or the times you have said ""That was my idea; I thought of that before!"" – If only you knew how!   </i>YOU could be the one to build apps for your favorite restaurant, boutique, hair salon, home safety plan, inspirational quotes, or for your kids’ school.... There probably isn’t an app for many of those things, and the list goes on. See what I mean? The app market is WIDE OPEN! </p>
<p>With no knowledge and no simple instructions out there, it IS like learning a foreign language.</p>
<p><i>{The next two bullets are the main idea of this campaign}</i><br/></p>
<ul><li>What if there was a real platform that would let anyone build apps with absolutely <b>NO Programming or NO Coding Knowledge</b>? A platform that doesn't require any special computers, just your web browser! </li></ul>
<ul><li>Well we have just that! The iDockMobi Team wants to bring everyone to a new platform, exactly like that, and introduce them to building apps independently and for free! Everyone can familiarize themselves with the tools and <b>LEARN AT YOUR OWN PACE for FREE</b>! What's going to make our platform more special or better? FREE to learn first, then our Point &amp; Click, STEP by STEP Video Instructions along with superb customer support. <br/>

<p>From the owner: My desire to help others stems from when I was learning to build apps, there was very little support out there. I needed other app builders to help me with my small obstacles – like where is the doggone file after I download it?! Or I’m typing in this code perfectly but why won’t it work the way the instructions say?!  I needed a simple platform and a guide because starting from scratch easily gets frustrating and easily overwhelming. All the books and how-to-videos that promised easy instructions, didn’t give the basics from A-Z in layman’s terms because, frankly, “tech geeks” do not speak the same language as people who are new to app development. </p>
<p>The problem for people with no or very little background in apps becoming developers is three-fold: 1) Learning programming language like “Objective-C” and “Python” and “Ruby”… is TOO HARD!   2) You need support from people who have encountered the same problem you’re facing, and  3) There is no clear helpful Step-by-Step guide to help you simply get the hang of it! At this point, it's so easy to just Give Up! Just like we have done with so many other ventures, It's Too Hard!</p>
<p>I was one of many people who found themselves in between jobs and struggling to make ends meet on a monthly basis.  I knew for a while that I would have to come up with something to become dependent on myself and not depend on a paycheck from someone else, especially in this weak economy and awful job market. If you’re reading this, you’re probably feeling the same way! You may also be a business owner who is looking to have an app built but don't want to spend the $10,000 or more on someone else to make one for you! <i>All of you can be like me, I am now an App Developer who develops apps for download in the App Store, Google Play and Amazon Kindle. I design apps for client businesses and personal use.</i></p>
</div><p><b>My reason for this campaign</b>: I have a team of people who have been trained by me personally and a <b>Platform</b> that we are developing that we are ready and prepared <b>to provide to users to use, learn, design, and create apps for FREE!</b>  On this Platform you will be able to try out and learn app building with no time limits and NO COST and see if it's for you!</p><p>The biggest plus is that this platform <b>REQUIRES NO CODING KNOWLEDGE at all</b>. It will include strong technical support from a very knowledgeable team should you need them and plenty of <b>step-by-step, click-by-click instructions</b> for people who have no idea what they are doing. I’ve discovered that many people are afraid of building apps because of the difficulty in learning the many programming languages and with this platform, that difficulty is erased as no programming language is necessary. With the step-by-step instructions that we are creating those fears will be eased. Users will learn quickly because it uses point-and-click techniques and plain language. You will be able to <b>create apps not only for Apple iPhone and iPad but also for Google Play’s Android Market and Amazon Kindle all on the same platform! </b></p><p><i><b>And for those of you who do know some Objective C, JavaScript, jQuery, and or HTML5, don't worry as there is the capability to use your coding as well.</b></i></p><p><b>***An experienced developer can easily charge $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 or more to design and create an app.  However, with this platform you can do it yourself!  For rewards, specific backers of this project will receive information that would take users beyond just creating an app to promoting, marketing and selling their app to make money.

<p>We have minimized the risks and challenges with this project. Mainly because this is a proven platform in which a deal of my live apps have been created with.  </p>
<p>With my active years of experience with Apple and Android Development and a team of professionals whom I've personally trained and are now experts on this platform, we plan to be ready for anything should anything unforeseen arise.

<p>Thank you all in advance. </p>
</div></div>","Have you ever tried to create an App? I think that many people have thought about it and many have looked into building an app but quickly became totally confused and very intimidated by what they saw. 

Pull out your smartphone. You probably have an app for navigation, your social networking, your favorite game, and a music app.  But what if you could create great apps for all the great ideas you think about or the times you have said ""That was my idea; I thought of that before!"" – If only you knew how!   YOU could be the one to build apps for your favorite restaurant, boutique, hair salon, home safety plan, inspirational quotes, or for your kids’ school.... There probably isn’t an app for many of those things, and the list goes on. See what I mean? The app market is WIDE OPEN! 
With no knowledge and no simple instructions out there, it IS like learning a foreign language.
{The next two bullets are the main idea of this campaign}
What if there was a real platform that would let anyone build apps with absolutely NO Programming or NO Coding Knowledge? A platform that doesn't require any special computers, just your web browser! 
Well we have just that! The iDockMobi Team wants to bring everyone to a new platform, exactly like that, and introduce them to building apps independently and for free! Everyone can familiarize themselves with the tools and LEARN AT YOUR OWN PACE for FREE! What's going to make our platform more special or better? FREE to learn first, then our Point & Click, STEP by STEP Video Instructions along with superb customer support. 

Check out these two videos of what it would be like working on the Platform: 


The market for developing apps is still largely untapped, making it perfect for anyone looking for an opportunity to make a career change. Think of the stay-at-home mom, the out-of-work dad, or someone who wants to start a freelance app business!

<p>We are working on our own wearable augmented reality computing solutions.</p>
<p>At the moment our device is at the  design stage, but we are quite sure that we will manage to ship it to the backers who have chosen the 299$ option very soon, still in 2013.</p>
<p>The first batch of the devices is intended first and foremost for the greatest enthusiasts and fanatics of newest technologies.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of glasses, which appeared in the market recently, that offer the possibility of taking photos and recording videos.</p>
<p>We do not only bring a piece of amazing hardware to you but we would also like to focus  to the great extent on providing you with a bunch of amazing apps. And what is more, all that comes at very reasonable prices.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our device will:</p>
<p>* have transparent display,</p>
<p>* show you both the “real” and “augmented”  content at the same time,</p>
<p>* display information in a smartphone-like hands-free format,</p>
<p>* have the ability to take high quality photos</p>
<p>* have the ability to record 720p HD video</p>
<p>We are also working on software  which will enable the  glasses to:</p>
<p>* display weather, current time and date</p>
<p>* give directions (GPS for spatial and positional awareness)</p>
<p>* display received messages (texts, emails) (thanks to connection with your smartphone)</p>
<p>* Inform you about incoming calls</p>
<p>* have capability to interact with the Internet</p>
<p>* have capability to interact with social networking websites  (Facebook, Twitter)</p>
<p>* if our campaign is successful, we are planning to create at least one game in the nearest future</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other features:</p>
<p>* dual core CPU</p>
<p>* 512 RAM</p>
<p>* built-in microphone</p>
<p>* Gyroscope</p>
<p>* Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to connect with smart devices</p>
<p>* 5-megapixel camera which takes pictures and records 720p video</p>
<p>* 8 gigabytes of usable flash memory</p>
<p> </p>
<p>INTERFACE</p>
<p> </p>
<p> All backers  will have the decisive voice on how the basic interface should look like. We will do it here and via our Facebook Fanpage</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve been designing and working on our device as well as technology it requires for the past 5 months now and currently we're at a stage where we need your help to finish this project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Technologies necessary for creating system of this kind are already available. Compiling such system is not very difficult. We want to focus mainly on creating an interesting design and making right selection of the components and technologies so that the glasses could offer the best experience possible and be widely used. </p>
<p>Manufacturing is going to be one of the greatest challenges, and we need money that will mostly allow us to improve this process and provide for its costs and to cover the expenses of large component order.</p>
<p>Another challenge will be to work out reliable and attractive software therefore certain amount will be allocated for hiring of the programmers.</p>
<p>We also going to use some funds for research and development which will facilitate introducing interesting innovations.</p>
<p>We are convinced that with your support the first batch of the devices will be delivered in 2013.</p>
<p>It is hard to specify the exact date because at the moment it depends on a few essential factors. It should however happen in the last quarter of 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The risk:</p>
<p>Nobody can foresee the future and we can meet certain obstacles on our way, e.g. logistic, technological or legal issues. However, anybody who financially contributes to our project, can be sure their money is safe.</p>
<p>There are only 2 scenarios – delivery of the device or money refund.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The glasses will be available in few colour variants.</p>

<p> </p></div>","We are working on our own wearable augmented reality computing solutions.
At the moment our device is at the  design stage, but we are quite sure that we will manage to ship it to the backers who have chosen the 299$ option very soon, still in 2013.
The first batch of the devices is intended first and foremost for the greatest enthusiasts and fanatics of newest technologies.
There are several kinds of glasses, which appeared in the market recently, that offer the possibility of taking photos and recording videos.
We do not only bring a piece of amazing hardware to you but we would also like to focus  to the great extent on providing you with a bunch of amazing apps. And what is more, all that comes at very reasonable prices.
 
 
Our device will:
* have transparent display,
* show you both the “real” and “augmented”  content at the same time,
* display information in a smartphone-like hands-free format,
* have the ability to take high quality photos
* have the ability to record 720p HD video
We are also working on software  which will enable the  glasses to:
* display weather, current time and date
* give directions (GPS for spatial and positional awareness)
* display received messages (texts, emails) (thanks to connection with your smartphone)
* Inform you about incoming calls
* have capability to interact with the Internet
* have capability to interact with social networking websites  (Facebook, Twitter)
* if our campaign is successful, we are planning to create at least one game in the nearest future
 
Other features:
* dual core CPU
* 512 RAM
* built-in microphone
* Gyroscope
* Wi-Fi and Bluetooth to connect with smart devices
* 5-megapixel camera which takes pictures and records 720p video
* 8 gigabytes of usable flash memory
 
INTERFACE
 
 All backers  will have the decisive voice on how the basic interface should look like. We will do it here and via our Facebook Fanpage
 
We’ve been designing and working on our device as well as technology it requires for the past 5 months now and currently we're at a stage where we need your help to finish this project.
 
 
 Technologies necessary for creating system of this kind are already available. Compiling such system is not very difficult. We want to focus mainly on creating an interesting design and making right selection of the components and technologies so that the glasses could offer the best experience possible and be widely used. 
Manufacturing is going to be one of the greatest challenges, and we need money that will mostly allow us to improve this process and provide for its costs and to cover the expenses of large component order.
Another challenge will be to work out reliable and attractive software therefore certain amount will be allocated for hiring of the programmers.
We also going to use some funds for research and development which will facilitate introducing interesting innovations.
We are convinced that with your support the first batch of the devices will be delivered in 2013.
It is hard to specify the exact date because at the moment it depends on a few essential factors. It should however happen in the last quarter of 2013.
 
The risk:
Nobody can foresee the future and we can meet certain obstacles on our way, e.g. logistic, technological or legal issues. However, anybody who financially contributes to our project, can be sure their money is safe.
There are only 2 scenarios – delivery of the device or money refund.
 
 
The glasses will be available in few colour variants.
 

 
 
 
 

 

 


 

 
 

 

 

 
If you like our campaign, we count on your support in promoting our project online. Every share or mention about it on social platforms or forums is very important to us. It will help us develop better glasses.
Thank you all in advance for your interest!

<h1>The Only Remote You'll Ever Need</h1>
<p>Smart Remote gives you the ability to control any device via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or Infrared. It’s compatible with more than 25,000 devices, and we’re adding new devices &amp; services every day. You can check out the complete list of compatible brands in our FAQs.</p>

<h1>Point &amp; Control Technology </h1>
<p>We’ve pushed the boundaries of today’s technologies to build the ultimate solution. For the first time in history, we’ve integrated a precise indoor positioning system in a consumer electronic device. This breakthrough technology gives Smart Remote the ability to control tens of thousands of devices in a simple and intuitive way. Our patent-pending technology combines this indoor positioning system with 9-axis motion sensors to track Smart Remote’s exact position and orientation. This enables Smart Remote to know what it’s pointing at in 3D space. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Smart Remote users will have several options for controlling all the devices in their home.</p>
<p><b>1) Control Wi-Fi Devices In Other Rooms</b> </p>
<p>Smart Remote gives you the ability to control any Wi-Fi connected device on the same wireless network as Smart Remote, even if those devices are located in areas of your home other than where you installed your room sensors (aka your Smart Zone). All you need to do is set locations in your living room to point and control devices in other rooms. For example, you could set up Smart Remote to point at your fireplace to control the thermostat in your hallway, or you could point in the direction of your entry way or dining room to control the lighting in those rooms from your couch.</p>
<p><b>2) Install Smart Remote in Multiple Rooms </b></p>
<p>If you’d like to have a Smart Remote in more than one room, you can purchase and install as many Smart Remote kits as you like—living room, bedroom, office, kitchen, man cave, wherever. Each Smart Remote you purchase will only work in one Smart Zone, but fear not, your Smart Remote experience will continue to grow and get better with time. Read on.</p>
<p><b>3) Install New Smart Zones </b></p>
<p>By the end of 2017, we will provide an option to purchase additional room sensor kits to create new Smart Zones and expand use of the Smart Remotes you already own. We will also release a free software update that lets you use any Smart Remote you own in any Smart Zone in your house, not just the Smart Zone in which it was originally installed.</p>
<p><b>4) Use Smart Remote in Extended (Non-Smart) Zones </b></p>
<p>We're crowdfunding Smart Remote because we need your feedback and support to make this an exceptional product that you’ll enjoy using everyday. After receiving hundreds of comments and suggestions and lots of great input, we’re excited to announce our first community-driven feature—Extended Mode. When you take Smart Remote outside of its Smart Zone and carry it to other areas of your home, Smart Remote will automatically display all your devices and services in a selection carousel. You will be able to select and control any Wi-Fi device on the same network as Smart Remote, any Bluetooth device within range that Smart Remote is connected with, and any infrared device you point at after selecting it in the carousel. Every home environment is unique, so your Smart Zone(s) may actually extend beyond the room or rooms where you installed sensors.</p>

<p>For the first time ever, you can turn on your TV, dim the lights, control your Thermostat, check Weather and order an Uber in less time than it took you to read this sentence. This is what makes Smart Remote so unique. Just choose a location for every service you want to add—like your front door for Uber or your window for weather—and simply point toward each location to get instant access.</p>

<h1>Never Lose It</h1>
<p>Like you, we hate when we lose things. That’s why we’re fighting back against couch cushions, evil gnomes, mischievous children and general absent-mindedness. If there ever comes a time when you can’t find your Smart Remote, just press the lost and found button on the charging base to make it ring.</p>

<h1>Make It Yours</h1>
<p>Smart Remote has lots of cool features to make your connected home experience more convenient and enjoyable.</p>
<p><b>Group your lights together </b></p>
<p>Do you want to control all your living room lights at the same time? Or maybe specific groupings of lights? No problem! Just open up the Smart Remote app and create custom light groups. It lets you turn on/off, dim or change the color of multiple lights—all at once. When you point at any light in a group, you can use the selection carousel to either control the entire group or just control the individual light you are pointing at.</p>
<p><b>Create custom scenes </b></p>
<p>Smart Remote gives you the power to set the mood and control multiple devices at once. Want a little romance in the air? Then bring the lights down low and turn on some music with a single tap. Is it movie night? Then choose your movie scene to fire up your TV and media player and adjust all your lights to the color and brightness you prefer.</p>

<h1>How It All Started </h1>
<p>We began this journey in 2014 with a mission to connect people and their homes. There are several challenges with today’s smart home products: 1) They are too complicated for people to use 2) Every device comes with it’s own app or remote control 3) Nothing works seamlessly together. We wanted to build a product to solve these challenges and create something so simple that anyone could enjoy a connected home.</p>
<p>Designed in collaboration with of the most iconic and decorated French Design studios, eliumstudio, Smart Remote will be the heart of every connected home. Since 2014, we’ve made dozens of drawings, 3D printed prototypes and manufactured prototypes. Smart Remote made its first appearance at Techcrunch Disrupt in 2015, where we gave a live demo on stage using our first prototype in front of hundreds of journalists. A few weeks later, we showed the prototype version 2 at CES in Las Vegas in 2016.</p>

<p><strong>COMPATIBILITY - Is Smart Remote only compatible with newer devices?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Remote is compatible with a wide range of ""smart"" and ""non smart"" devices, regardless of the year they were manufactured. As long as these devices use one of the three communication technologies supported by Smart Remote - Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and IR - they ought to be compatible.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - What is it?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Remote is the world’s first 'context aware' remote control for your home. It lets you control (almost) anything in your smart home with just one touch. You just need to point at the device you want to control and it's screen adapts instantly.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - What is it for?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Remote is your ""one device, one touch"" solution to controlling all your devices at home. Smart Remote can control any device through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Infrared like your TV, media players and any audio/video equipment replacing all your existing remote controls. But Smart Remote is much more than just all other universal remote controls: it is the only remote that lets you control any connected device in your home while also letting you access your favorite services such as Uber, Lyft, IFTTT or weather forecast! For the first time in the history of electronics, you can use the same remote to turn on your TV, dim the lights and request an Uber, with a unified interface.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - How does Smart Remote know the device I am pointing to?</strong></p>
<p>The 3 room sensors provided in the starter kit allow for indoor positioning. Smart Remote combines an indoor positioning system with 9-axis motion tracking sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and compass) which means Smart Remote knows its location and orientation in space and therefore what you are pointing at in 3D. This is the first time a consumer electronic product integrates such a high precision indoor-positioning system.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - How does Smart Remote send the control commands to the device?</strong></p>
<p>Depending to the device, Smart Remote will send the controls via Infrared (IR), Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - How do you add a new device?</strong></p>
<p>Use the Smart Remote free iOS and Android app to add your devices, then use Smart Remote to locate each device in your room. Next time you point Smart Remote to that direction, you will be able to control it in one touch.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - How do you add a new service such as Uber?</strong></p>
<p>Use the Smart Remote free iOS and Android app to add your service such as Uber, you will be asked to login to your Uber account, then use Smart Remote to designate a location in your room such as a door for example. Just point at your door and Smart Remote will display the Uber order screen! You will be able to select your destination from a preconfigured list of destinations. And for extra security, you can set a 4-digit code which will be asked everytime you want to order an Uber with Smart Remote. We don't want your 4 year old kid to order a Premium Black Uber ;-)</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - What happens when several devices are close to each other?</strong></p>
<p>When objects are less than 20 in (50cm) from eachother, Smart Remote will display a carousel. It will feature the different devices so you can select which device you want to control.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - What if several devices are in same line of sight?</strong></p>
<p>By default, Smart Remote will control the device that is closest to you.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - How can you use Smart Remote with the IFTTT service?</strong></p>
<p>Use the Smart Remote app to add IFTTT service, then use Smart Remote to designate a location for the trigger. You can trigger any IFTTT recipe with one touch, by pointing at the location that you have designated. For example you can have a preset text message sent to someone, as you are about to leave your home, simply by pointing at your front door and tapping Smart Remote's screen once.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - Will I be able to group several lights or devices to control them all at once?</strong></p>
<p>Yes you will! We've built different features that will allow you to build your own experience at home: <br/>- Group lights: You have the ability using the App to group your lights together, then Smart Remote lets you turn on/off, dim or change the color of multiple lights—all at once. When you point at one of the grouped lights, the carousel on the Smart Remote let you either control the group of light all at once, or you can also select to control only the individual light you are pointing at.</p>
<p>- Scenes: With Scenes, you can control multiple devices and get access to multiple services simultaneously with a single touch. For example, you can create a scene for « Watch TV » that will turn on your TV, media player and dim you lights all at once. Use the app to create a new scene, then you can record all commands you would like to be sent in one touch.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - How does Smart Remote compare to universal remotes?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Remote is a lot more than a universal remote. We have redefined what a true Universal Remote Control should be and we made one for the home instead of limiting it to the A/V equipment. Traditional universal remotes are not smart and not seamless, they only focus on A/V equipment like TV, cable boxes, amplifiers/receivers... They are often limited by the number of buttons they have. And the more feature you want, the more buttons you get..., making them even more complicated to use. Smart Remote not only can control all your Audio/Video equipment but also all your connected devices in your home, and it even let you access to services like Uber or Weather forecast. And all that without a single button, just a high quality touch screen that adapts to the device you are pointing to - a truly magical experience!</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - Why do I need Smart Remote when mobile apps can already control smart devices?</strong></p>
<p>We do love our smartphones! They let us do so many things... Still, they are cumbersome for controling your TV and smart devices. Just to turn on a light, you need to unlock your phone, find the app, launch it, wait until it is launched, select the device you want to control, and then control it. That's at least 5 steps and 10s wasted just to turn on your light! Furthermore all modern TVs can be controlled by an App but everyone still use the TV remote because it is faster.</p>
<p>App overlaod is another problem. The more devices you have, the more frustrating it becomes with a Smartphone, switching from App to App. Furthermore, everyone in the home needs a Smartphone and all the Apps need to be installed and configured on same account...</p>
<p>Smart Remote allows anyone in the home to intuitively and **instantly** control TV, A/V equipment and all smart devices. Sorry you can’t do this with your Smartphone yet...</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT - Could you include your technology in smart phones in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Definitely, we want to make Smartphone even smarter. Our patented Point &amp; Control technology could be integrated in Smartphones and other controlling devices.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL - What types of devices can Smart Remote control?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Remote lets you control any device through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or Infrared. Smart Remote works with non-connected non-smart devices through Infrared like TV, receivers, A/V equipments, and connected home devices including connected light bulbs, smart thermostats, and Wi-Fi speakers.</p>
<p>• IR devices: Smart Remote uses infrared technology to control IR devices such as older TVs, set-top boxes, home cinemas, DVD/Blu-ray players, etc.</p>
<p>• Through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth: Lights, Thermostats, Speakers, Smart Hubs, Blinds, Services, Fans, Plugs, Cams, etc.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL - How do I charge Smart Remote? What is the battery life of Smart Remote?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Remote comes with a charging station. It plugs into a USB-C port and stands vertically on its charging base. Smart Remote uses an advanced rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery. A single charge allows for several days of normal usage. It takes about 2 hours to fully charge Smart Remote using the charging base (from 0 to 100%). <br/>We advise you put Smart Remote back on its charging base when you leave the room or when you are done controlling your home.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL - What's the controlling distance?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Remote can control devices which are at a distance of 30 ft to 90 ft (10m to 30m) depending on layout of the room, obstacles and walls materials.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL - Will there be updates to Smart Remote in the future?</strong></p>
<p>Oh yes! And this is the best part of Smart Remote. We will constantly update the software of Smart Remote and enhance it capabilities for free. We will add compatibilities with any new devices that comes out, we will also add new services and features. This is what we mean by the only remote you will ever need. With each new update, your Smart Remote will become smarter and allow you to do more!</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL - Does Smart Remote need to ""see"" the object to work?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Remote does not need to ""see"" a device to work when the device is controlled through Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>You can use Smart Remote to remotely close and open your garage door, without having to actually see it in your field of view. In the room where you placed the 3 sensors, designate a zone that is in the direction of your garage door.</p>
<p>And if your Nest thermostat is located in another room and you want to point at your fireplace to control your home heating, just add your Nest Thermostat using the App, and use Smart Remote to designate your fireplace as the location you want to point at to change your home temperature.</p>
<p>For devices that can only be controlled through IR: Smart Remote will need to see the device to be able to control it through IR. For devices that can only be controlled through Bluetooth: Smart Remote will need to be in close proximity with the device to be able to control it through BT due to the short range of BT.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL - What is the average time between point and display?</strong></p>
<p>There is no processing time between point and display. The screen adapts instantly whenever you point at a device.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL - Is the screen of Smart Remote customizable?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Remote will come with pre-defined screens at launch. New screens will then be available when we will start supporting new types of devices. Developpers that are part of our developing community will be able to fully customize the screen using the level 2 API/SDK (Software Development Kit) which will be available before end of 2017.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL - Is Smart Remote capable of learning Infrared (IR) commands from my existing remotes?</strong></p>
<p>No. We already have a huge database so it is more likely that your IR devices are already compatible. But if you realize you have an IR device that is not compatible, please get in touch: <a href=""mailto:support@sevenhugs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">support@sevenhugs.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL - Can I use Smart Remote to control multiple devices in more than one room?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Remote currently works in the room where the sensors are located.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL - What protocols and standards does Smart Remote support?</strong></p>
<p>Smart Remote supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and IR. Smart Remote also supports several smart home hubs such as SmartThings, Wink, Insteon so Smart Remote would also allow you to control Zigbee of Z-Wave devices though these supported hubs.</p>
<p><strong>TECHNICAL - How does it work with infrared controlled equipment located in a cabinet?</strong></p>
<p>For Infrared controlled equipment located in a cabinet for example, Smart Remote itself does not come with an extender, but it's an interesting accessory we can add in the future. <br/>As of now, you will be able to control it through 2 options: <br/>- there are a lot of great and cheap IR extenders on Amazon that you can use with Smart Remote <br/>- Smart Remote will be able to control the Logitech Harmony hub, that offers IR extenders capability and activity based control.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING - When does shipping begin?</strong></p>
<p>June 2017, the first batch of Smart Remote starter kits will be shipped to early-bird backers. Second and follow-on batch will ship in July 2017.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING - Where does it ship? How much is shipping?</strong></p>

  They Love Us

 



The Only Remote You'll Ever Need
Smart Remote gives you the ability to control any device via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or Infrared. It’s compatible with more than 25,000 devices, and we’re adding new devices & services every day. You can check out the complete list of compatible brands in our FAQs.

 

 

Point & Control Technology 
We’ve pushed the boundaries of today’s technologies to build the ultimate solution. For the first time in history, we’ve integrated a precise indoor positioning system in a consumer electronic device. This breakthrough technology gives Smart Remote the ability to control tens of thousands of devices in a simple and intuitive way. Our patent-pending technology combines this indoor positioning system with 9-axis motion sensors to track Smart Remote’s exact position and orientation. This enables Smart Remote to know what it’s pointing at in 3D space. 

 

 

 Control Your Entire Home

 
Smart Remote users will have several options for controlling all the devices in their home.
1) Control Wi-Fi Devices In Other Rooms 
Smart Remote gives you the ability to control any Wi-Fi connected device on the same wireless network as Smart Remote, even if those devices are located in areas of your home other than where you installed your room sensors (aka your Smart Zone). All you need to do is set locations in your living room to point and control devices in other rooms. For example, you could set up Smart Remote to point at your fireplace to control the thermostat in your hallway, or you could point in the direction of your entry way or dining room to control the lighting in those rooms from your couch.
2) Install Smart Remote in Multiple Rooms 
If you’d like to have a Smart Remote in more than one room, you can purchase and install as many Smart Remote kits as you like—living room, bedroom, office, kitchen, man cave, wherever. Each Smart Remote you purchase will only work in one Smart Zone, but fear not, your Smart Remote experience will continue to grow and get better with time. Read on.
3) Install New Smart Zones 
By the end of 2017, we will provide an option to purchase additional room sensor kits to create new Smart Zones and expand use of the Smart Remotes you already own. We will also release a free software update that lets you use any Smart Remote you own in any Smart Zone in your house, not just the Smart Zone in which it was originally installed.
4) Use Smart Remote in Extended (Non-Smart) Zones 
We're crowdfunding Smart Remote because we need your feedback and support to make this an exceptional product that you’ll enjoy using everyday. After receiving hundreds of comments and suggestions and lots of great input, we’re excited to announce our first community-driven feature—Extended Mode. When you take Smart Remote outside of its Smart Zone and carry it to other areas of your home, Smart Remote will automatically display all your devices and services in a selection carousel. You will be able to select and control any Wi-Fi device on the same network as Smart Remote, any Bluetooth device within range that Smart Remote is connected with, and any infrared device you point at after selecting it in the carousel. Every home environment is unique, so your Smart Zone(s) may actually extend beyond the room or rooms where you installed sensors.

Instantly Access Your Favorite Services
For the first time ever, you can turn on your TV, dim the lights, control your Thermostat, check Weather and order an Uber in less time than it took you to read this sentence. This is what makes Smart Remote so unique. Just choose a location for every service you want to add—like your front door for Uber or your window for weather—and simply point toward each location to get instant access.

 

Never Lose It
Like you, we hate when we lose things. That’s why we’re fighting back against couch cushions, evil gnomes, mischievous children and general absent-mindedness. If there ever comes a time when you can’t find your Smart Remote, just press the lost and found button on the charging base to make it ring.



Make It Yours
Smart Remote has lots of cool features to make your connected home experience more convenient and enjoyable.
Group your lights together 
Do you want to control all your living room lights at the same time? Or maybe specific groupings of lights? No problem! Just open up the Smart Remote app and create custom light groups. It lets you turn on/off, dim or change the color of multiple lights—all at once. When you point at any light in a group, you can use the selection carousel to either control the entire group or just control the individual light you are pointing at.
Create custom scenes 
Smart Remote gives you the power to set the mood and control multiple devices at once. Want a little romance in the air? Then bring the lights down low and turn on some music with a single tap. Is it movie night? Then choose your movie scene to fire up your TV and media player and adjust all your lights to the color and brightness you prefer.

 

What's In The Box
Each Smart Remote kit comes with a Smart Remote, charging base and 3 room sensors.

 

Simple Setup
It only takes a couple minutes to get Smart Remote up and running:

Download the free Sevenhugs Smart Remote app (iOS or Android) 
Install sensors in the room where you’d like to use Smart Remote, in line of sight with each other. For best performance, place them at least 7ft (2m) high on different walls and as far apart as possible. 
Add devices and services using the app and designate a location in your room for each device or service using Smart Remote 
Enjoy :)

The 3 room sensors can cover a room up to 1,000 sqft (100m2) in size and are also paintable.

 Smart Remote is available for iOS and Android.

 

To Infinity And Beyond 
With our open API and SDK, the possibilities for developers are endless.
Level 1 — Add New Devices (Available June 2017) 
Reuse existing UI and implement functions to control new connected devices. Our open API/SDK is made in Lua and based in C/C++ and lets you easily add new devices. Developers have access to communication interfaces (Wi-Fi, BT, BLE, IR). A first version has been released here: https://github.com/sevenhugs/smart-remote-sdk

Level 2 — Unleash Smart Remote’s Full Power (Available End of 2017) 
Create new use cases, gestures, screens and menus.  Gain access to a detailed specification interface (position and orientation, or specific events identified with the 9-axis accelerometer), and trigger specific actions and services.

 

Design and Specs

 

Stretch Goals 

 



 



How It All Started 
We began this journey in 2014 with a mission to connect people and their homes. There are several challenges with today’s smart home products: 1) They are too complicated for people to use 2) Every device comes with it’s own app or remote control 3) Nothing works seamlessly together. We wanted to build a product to solve these challenges and create something so simple that anyone could enjoy a connected home.
Designed in collaboration with of the most iconic and decorated French Design studios, eliumstudio, Smart Remote will be the heart of every connected home. Since 2014, we’ve made dozens of drawings, 3D printed prototypes and manufactured prototypes. Smart Remote made its first appearance at Techcrunch Disrupt in 2015, where we gave a live demo on stage using our first prototype in front of hundreds of journalists. A few weeks later, we showed the prototype version 2 at CES in Las Vegas in 2016.

 

 

 

Why Crowdfunding

Smart Remote is your ""one device, one touch"" solution to controlling all your devices at home. Smart Remote can control any device through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and Infrared like your TV, media players and any audio/video equipment replacing all your existing remote controls. But Smart Remote is much more than just all other universal remote controls: it is the only remote that lets you control any connected device in your home while also letting you access your favorite services such as Uber, Lyft, IFTTT or weather forecast! For the first time in the history of electronics, you can use the same remote to turn on your TV, dim the lights and request an Uber, with a unified interface.
ABOUT - How does Smart Remote know the device I am pointing to?
The 3 room sensors provided in the starter kit allow for indoor positioning. Smart Remote combines an indoor positioning system with 9-axis motion tracking sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and compass) which means Smart Remote knows its location and orientation in space and therefore what you are pointing at in 3D. This is the first time a consumer electronic product integrates such a high precision indoor-positioning system.
ABOUT - How does Smart Remote send the control commands to the device?
Depending to the device, Smart Remote will send the controls via Infrared (IR), Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.
ABOUT - How do you add a new device?
Use the Smart Remote free iOS and Android app to add your devices, then use Smart Remote to locate each device in your room. Next time you point Smart Remote to that direction, you will be able to control it in one touch.
ABOUT - How do you add a new service such as Uber?
Use the Smart Remote free iOS and Android app to add your service such as Uber, you will be asked to login to your Uber account, then use Smart Remote to designate a location in your room such as a door for example. Just point at your door and Smart Remote will display the Uber order screen! You will be able to select your destination from a preconfigured list of destinations. And for extra security, you can set a 4-digit code which will be asked everytime you want to order an Uber with Smart Remote. We don't want your 4 year old kid to order a Premium Black Uber ;-)
ABOUT - What happens when several devices are close to each other?
When objects are less than 20 in (50cm) from eachother, Smart Remote will display a carousel. It will feature the different devices so you can select which device you want to control.
ABOUT - What if several devices are in same line of sight?
By default, Smart Remote will control the device that is closest to you.
ABOUT - How can you use Smart Remote with the IFTTT service?
Use the Smart Remote app to add IFTTT service, then use Smart Remote to designate a location for the trigger. You can trigger any IFTTT recipe with one touch, by pointing at the location that you have designated. For example you can have a preset text message sent to someone, as you are about to leave your home, simply by pointing at your front door and tapping Smart Remote's screen once.
ABOUT - Will I be able to group several lights or devices to control them all at once?
Yes you will! We've built different features that will allow you to build your own experience at home: - Group lights: You have the ability using the App to group your lights together, then Smart Remote lets you turn on/off, dim or change the color of multiple lights—all at once. When you point at one of the grouped lights, the carousel on the Smart Remote let you either control the group of light all at once, or you can also select to control only the individual light you are pointing at.
- Scenes: With Scenes, you can control multiple devices and get access to multiple services simultaneously with a single touch. For example, you can create a scene for « Watch TV » that will turn on your TV, media player and dim you lights all at once. Use the app to create a new scene, then you can record all commands you would like to be sent in one touch.
ABOUT - How does Smart Remote compare to universal remotes?
Smart Remote is a lot more than a universal remote. We have redefined what a true Universal Remote Control should be and we made one for the home instead of limiting it to the A/V equipment. Traditional universal remotes are not smart and not seamless, they only focus on A/V equipment like TV, cable boxes, amplifiers/receivers... They are often limited by the number of buttons they have. And the more feature you want, the more buttons you get..., making them even more complicated to use. Smart Remote not only can control all your Audio/Video equipment but also all your connected devices in your home, and it even let you access to services like Uber or Weather forecast. And all that without a single button, just a high quality touch screen that adapts to the device you are pointing to - a truly magical experience!
ABOUT - Why do I need Smart Remote when mobile apps can already control smart devices?
We do love our smartphones! They let us do so many things... Still, they are cumbersome for controling your TV and smart devices. Just to turn on a light, you need to unlock your phone, find the app, launch it, wait until it is launched, select the device you want to control, and then control it. That's at least 5 steps and 10s wasted just to turn on your light! Furthermore all modern TVs can be controlled by an App but everyone still use the TV remote because it is faster.
App overlaod is another problem. The more devices you have, the more frustrating it becomes with a Smartphone, switching from App to App. Furthermore, everyone in the home needs a Smartphone and all the Apps need to be installed and configured on same account...
Smart Remote allows anyone in the home to intuitively and **instantly** control TV, A/V equipment and all smart devices. Sorry you can’t do this with your Smartphone yet...
ABOUT - Could you include your technology in smart phones in the future?
Definitely, we want to make Smartphone even smarter. Our patented Point & Control technology could be integrated in Smartphones and other controlling devices.
TECHNICAL - What types of devices can Smart Remote control?
Smart Remote lets you control any device through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or Infrared. Smart Remote works with non-connected non-smart devices through Infrared like TV, receivers, A/V equipments, and connected home devices including connected light bulbs, smart thermostats, and Wi-Fi speakers.
• IR devices: Smart Remote uses infrared technology to control IR devices such as older TVs, set-top boxes, home cinemas, DVD/Blu-ray players, etc.
• Through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth: Lights, Thermostats, Speakers, Smart Hubs, Blinds, Services, Fans, Plugs, Cams, etc.
TECHNICAL - How do I charge Smart Remote? What is the battery life of Smart Remote?
Smart Remote comes with a charging station. It plugs into a USB-C port and stands vertically on its charging base. Smart Remote uses an advanced rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery. A single charge allows for several days of normal usage. It takes about 2 hours to fully charge Smart Remote using the charging base (from 0 to 100%). We advise you put Smart Remote back on its charging base when you leave the room or when you are done controlling your home.
TECHNICAL - What's the controlling distance?
Smart Remote can control devices which are at a distance of 30 ft to 90 ft (10m to 30m) depending on layout of the room, obstacles and walls materials.
TECHNICAL - Will there be updates to Smart Remote in the future?
Oh yes! And this is the best part of Smart Remote. We will constantly update the software of Smart Remote and enhance it capabilities for free. We will add compatibilities with any new devices that comes out, we will also add new services and features. This is what we mean by the only remote you will ever need. With each new update, your Smart Remote will become smarter and allow you to do more!
TECHNICAL - Does Smart Remote need to ""see"" the object to work?
Smart Remote does not need to ""see"" a device to work when the device is controlled through Wi-Fi.
You can use Smart Remote to remotely close and open your garage door, without having to actually see it in your field of view. In the room where you placed the 3 sensors, designate a zone that is in the direction of your garage door.
And if your Nest thermostat is located in another room and you want to point at your fireplace to control your home heating, just add your Nest Thermostat using the App, and use Smart Remote to designate your fireplace as the location you want to point at to change your home temperature.
For devices that can only be controlled through IR: Smart Remote will need to see the device to be able to control it through IR. For devices that can only be controlled through Bluetooth: Smart Remote will need to be in close proximity with the device to be able to control it through BT due to the short range of BT.
TECHNICAL - What is the average time between point and display?
There is no processing time between point and display. The screen adapts instantly whenever you point at a device.
TECHNICAL - Is the screen of Smart Remote customizable?
Smart Remote will come with pre-defined screens at launch. New screens will then be available when we will start supporting new types of devices. Developpers that are part of our developing community will be able to fully customize the screen using the level 2 API/SDK (Software Development Kit) which will be available before end of 2017.
TECHNICAL - Is Smart Remote capable of learning Infrared (IR) commands from my existing remotes?
No. We already have a huge database so it is more likely that your IR devices are already compatible. But if you realize you have an IR device that is not compatible, please get in touch: support@sevenhugs.com.
TECHNICAL - Can I use Smart Remote to control multiple devices in more than one room?
Smart Remote currently works in the room where the sensors are located.
TECHNICAL - What protocols and standards does Smart Remote support?
Smart Remote supports Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and IR. Smart Remote also supports several smart home hubs such as SmartThings, Wink, Insteon so Smart Remote would also allow you to control Zigbee of Z-Wave devices though these supported hubs.
TECHNICAL - How does it work with infrared controlled equipment located in a cabinet?
For Infrared controlled equipment located in a cabinet for example, Smart Remote itself does not come with an extender, but it's an interesting accessory we can add in the future. As of now, you will be able to control it through 2 options: - there are a lot of great and cheap IR extenders on Amazon that you can use with Smart Remote - Smart Remote will be able to control the Logitech Harmony hub, that offers IR extenders capability and activity based control.
SHIPPING - When does shipping begin?
June 2017, the first batch of Smart Remote starter kits will be shipped to early-bird backers. Second and follow-on batch will ship in July 2017.

<li><strong>ORIGIN</strong></li>
</ul><p>      Hello! My name is Jacob Caro, I love and respect Video Games as a way of emotional expression, art and communication, I only have one goal: For others to enjoy my games. This isn't about profit, or money, I just want the opportunity to tell a story, a story that I've put my heart and soul into. I want a chance to make it a reality and have many people play and experience it. </p>
<p>      I'll explain a bit about how the project came to exist. I was a very lonely kid, I did not have many friends, a father, I sunk into Video Games with heavy narratives, story lines, I sunk into them, fell in love with the characters, the story, everything, the feeling of being so, immersed into a story was such a wonderful feeling, I want to give that feeling to others, many others, others of different race, religion, sex, anyone and everyone. The feelings of the writers touched me as a kid, people can be much more sincere when they're telling a story, that pure form of emotional expression is what I want to do, writing is the only way I can easily and clearly express myself to others, I desperately want the chance to do that.</p>
<p>      I also hope that when and if others play my games, that I can hope to inspire others as I was inspired before, and I hope that if I so happen to inspire someone, or multiple people, that they'll go on to inspire another, or multiple others.</p>
<p>      This is my dream, I am an eighteen year old boy living in Florida of the United States, the project's music composer is a man living in Sweden named ""Martin Barreby"" who has a dream of being a video game music composer, the character designer ""Melody Brown"" is a girl living in Canada who has always wanted to bean artist for games, the voice cast for the characters are trying their best to break into acting, I want to make my dreams a reality, while helping all the wonderful people helping me reach their dreams as well.</p>
<p>      I'll now supply some details on the actual game for you all!</p>

<p><strong>Name: </strong>Haze<br/><strong>Age: </strong>18<br/><strong>Voiced By: </strong><em>Samuel Drake</em></p>
<p><strong>Bio</strong><em>:</em> Haze is an eighteen year old punk that won't hesitate to tell someone <br/>       off to their face, be it a regular person, cop, or whoever.</p>
<p>   He enjoys rubbing people's faults in their faces, especially people that refuse<br/>   to accept them theirselves. Haze knows  who he is and isn't afraid to show<br/>   it, he rarely lets outside opinions affect him. Haze can see through most <br/>   people very well, almost perfectly. He doesn't believe in selfless action, or<br/>   sincerity so when he actually encounters individuals that have these traits he<br/>   tends to judge them all wrong.  </p>
<p>   After an accident that almost took her life, Haze grew very close to his<br/>   younger sister Clara, she is the only person he can even partially <br/>   emotionally level with. Haze is very protective of his sister, but doesn't <br/>   show it directly and instead tries to leave her snarky hidden warnings <br/>   about the crappy state of people disguised as one of his many complaints.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Name:</strong> </strong>Clara<br/><strong>Age: </strong>10<br/><strong><strong>Voiced By:</strong> </strong><em>Casey Chartier</em><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bio: </strong>Clara is a ten year old girl that's very bright and chipper almost all the<br/>      time. She usually only gets angry at Haze for being rude to people, <br/>      and ends up using ""Ass"" to describe him more than his actual name.</p>
<p>      Clara can be a little bratty sometimes but even when she tries to hold a<br/>      grudge with Haze she usually gives up on it pretty early on. Her favorite<br/>      meal is breakfast, and her favorite things TO have are <em>Juice, Jam, &amp; Eggs.</em> </p>

<p><strong><strong>Name:</strong> </strong>Craig<br/><strong><strong>Age:</strong> </strong>39<br/><strong><strong>Voiced By:</strong> </strong>Jonathan Cooke<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Craig is a middle aged police officer, he rarely has fun and works almost<br/>       constantly, even at home. He rarely loses his tired expression and<br/>       overworks himself daily. </p>
<p>      A case of an assault that gravely injured his wife was left unsolved, <br/>      causing him to act over obsessive with cases, further pursuing them long<br/>      after his colleagues have given up. His constant serious attitude, lack of <br/>      emotion, and robot like work ethic earned him the nickname of  ""Robo""<br/>      with the younger officers in his department.</p>
<p>      Underneath all his stress and emotional baggage rests a cop that just <br/>      wants desperately to help people and do his part. His selfless desire to<br/>      help and his own personal self interests do tend to blend together<br/>      uncontrollably a lot.

It works with AAA and C batteries so it is safe to use for anyone, including children. And if you want, you can flush the toilet manually as usual.Innodor es un pequeño dispositivo electro-mecánico que convierte un inodoro standard en un inodoro inteligente en 5 minutos. Funciona con baterías AAA y C por lo que su uso es seguro para cualquiera, incluso para los niños. Y si quieres, puedes descargar la cisterna manualmente como siempre.Unlike other systems on the market, Innodor detects really when the toilet is used for peeing or pooing and automatically flushes the toilet (complete or middle tank as needed) when the user finishes to use it.A diferencia de otros sistemas del mercado, Innodor detecta realmente cuándo se usa el inodoro para aguas menores o mayores y descarga la cisterna (completa o media descarga según sea necesario)  cuando el usuario termina de usarlo.Innodor is composed by 2 parts:Innodor se compone de 2 partes:
The header: this is the part that must be placed in the rear part of the bowl and is the sensor itself. It is designed to look similar to a classic ""air fresher"" so it will go unnoticed. It uses 3 AAA alkaline batteries with more than 1 year self life.
El cabezal: Esta parte se coloca en la parte trasera del inodoro y es el sensor en sí mismo. Está diseñado para parecer un ambientador de inodoro por lo que pasa desapercibido. Utiliza 3 pilas alcalinas AAA con una duración mínima de 1 año.  
The flusher: this is the part that goes into the tank so it is completely invisible. The system only needs to be fixed between the tank button nut and the tank cover from inside and screwed to the steam of the flush button. Nothing more. It is powered with 3 C alkaline batteries with more than 3.600 flush capability.

El pulsador: Es la parte que va dentro del depósito de agua por lo que es totalmente invisible. El sistema solo necesita ser fijado por la parte interna del tanque utilizando la tuerca del propio botón de la cisterna y atornillando un tornillo al vástago del botón de descarga. Nada más. Se alimenta de 3 baterías alcalinas C con una capacidad de más de 3.600 descargas.
 Why INNODOR / Por qué INNODOR
How many times do you go to a public toilet and find that someone forgot to flush the toilet? many many times, sure! sometimes could be a dismissal, other times the hurry, others.... who knows, but it happens very often unfortunately.¿Cuántas veces vas a un baño de uso público y te encuentras que alguien no ha tirado de la cadena del inodoro? muchas muchas veces, ¡seguro! algunas veces puede ser por un despiste, otras por las prisas, otras... quién sabe, pero el caso es que pasa muy a menudo desafortunadamente. That's the first reason why I started to design Innodor, but it was not the last. After analyzing different environments and situations, I found that there was a lot of cases where this system could be very helpful:Esta es la primera razón por la que empecé a diseñar Innodor, aunque no fue la última. Tras analizar diferentes entornos y situaciones, me di cuenta de que su uso podía ser muy beneficioso en muchos casos:
Children that are learning to flush the toilet but forget.                                     Niños que están aprendiendo a usar el inodoro pero se olvidan de tirar de la cadena.People with clueless memory like elderly, alzheimer, dementia, etc.         Gente con problemas de memoria, como ancianos, alzheimer, demencia, etc.
People with mobility problems like parkinson, wheelchair user, etc.          Gente con problemas de movilidad como parkinson, usuarios de silla de ruedas, etc.
Sites like bars, hospitals, restaurants, shopping centers, hotels, gyms... in other words, any where there isa public toilet!                                                          Sitios como bares, hospitales, restaurantes, centros comerciales, hoteles, gimnasios... en otras palabras, ¡cualquier sitio donde haya un baño público!
                    Also it gives some advantages speaking about the hygiene and it is eco-friendly:También presenta algunas ventajas relacionadas con la higiene además de ser respetuoso con el medio ambiente:
Controls the waste of water automatically selecting complete or middle flush of the tank as needed.                                                                                   Controla el gasto de agua ajustando automáticamente la descarga completa o parcial de la cisterna según sea necesario.
Maintains the toilet always clean and easier to clean.                                Mantiene el inodoro limpio y facilita la limpieza.
Improves the odour in the bathroom.                                                                   Mejora los olores en el baño.
As a touch-less system helps to avoid bacteria contamination.                         Al ser un sensor sin contacto ayuda a evitar contaminación bacteriana.
 If you have a cat as pet and you trained to use the toilet with litter-kwitter or CitiKitty systems you can use Innodor because it works fantastically well too!¡Si tienes un gato como mascota y le has enseñado a utilizar el Inodoro con el sistema litter-kwitter o CittyKitty puedes usar Innodor porque funciona fantásticamente bien! How it works / Cómo funcionaOther systems on the market basically ""understand"" that the toilet is being used when someone is near the toilet for X time and then flushes the thank. The problem of these systems is that they don't detect really if the toilet was used so, for example in small bathrooms, are completely unusable because you can be cleaning teeth and they understand that you are using the toilet.Otros sistemas del mercado básicamente ""entienden"" que el inodoro está siendo usado cuando alguien se sitúa cerca del mismo durante X segundos y entonces descargan la cisterna. El problema de estos sistemas es que no detectan si el inodoro se ha usado realmente por lo que, por ejemplo en baños pequeños, son completamente inservibles ya que puedes estar limpiándote los dientes y que el sistema interprete que has usado el inodoro. Innodor solves this problem by detecting really if the toilet was used and only flushes the tank after the user moves slightly from the front of the toilet. And as intelligent system, it knows when is needed to flush all or middle tank depending the use made. And you can flush the toilet manually as usual if desired.Innodor soluciona este problema detectando si el inodoro se ha usado realmente y solo realiza la descarga de la cisterna cuando el usuario se aleja ligeramente del frente del inodoro. Y como sistema inteligente, sabe cuando es necesario descargar todo el tanque o solo la mitad dependiendo del uso que se haya hecho. Y puedes tirar de la cadena manualmente como siempre si lo deseas.What is needed / Qué se necesitaA completely functional prototype is designed and fabricated so the next step is to start a preproduction serie of Innodor. This phase implies a lot of steps including injection molding, pcb fabrication, pcb assembly, system assembly, electromagnetic compatibility tests, electronic components, etc, etc, etc, so an estimation of the total cost was made to make this project alive. Se ha diseñado y fabricado un prototipo completamente funcional por lo que el siguiente paso es lanzar una preserie de Innodor. Esta fase implica muchos pasos en los que se incluyen la fabricación de moldes de inyección, fabricación y ensamblaje de circuitos, ensamblaje del sistema, pruebas de compatibilidad electromagnética, componentes electrónicos, etc, etc, etc, por lo que se ha realizado una estimación del gasto necesario para hacer realidad este proyecto.The most unavoidable and expensive step is the fabrication of the moulds for the plastic pieces of Innodor. 5 moulds are needed to fabricate all plastic parts with the cost of about 15.000-18.000 €. The electromagnetic compatibility tests (EMC) costs about 4.000-5.000 €. Apart from this, each Innodor kit needs obviously electric and electronic material to work so this one must be added to the total amount. In other hand, Indiegogo charges a 9% fee to the investment made by crowdfunders and paypal other 3,4% so keeping this in mind and trying to offer ""affordable"" perks, the final amount needed to cover the fabrication of a pre-serie is about 45.000 € and 450 units.El inevitable y más costoso paso es la fabricación de los moldes para Innodor. Son necesarios 5 moldes para fabricar todas las piezas de plástico con un coste entre 15.000-18.000 €. Las pruebas de compatibilidad electromagnéticas (EMC)cuestan unos 4.000-5.000 €. Además de esto, cada kit Innodor necesita material eléctrico y electrónico para funcionar por lo que esto se ha de añadir a la cantidad total. Por otro lado, Indiegogo aplica un 9% de comisión a las inversiones de los crowdfunders y paypal otro 3,4% por lo que teniendo en cuenta e intentando ofrecer colaboraciones ""asumibles"", la cantidad final que es necesaria para fabricar una pre-serie es de unos 45.000 € y 450 unidades.If it doesn't reach 100% / Si no llega al 100% As I explained before, Indiegogo and Paypal applies a total of 12,4% fee to all perks made by crowdfunders, in other words, Innodor project receives only the 87,6% of the each perk. This fact can affect the project in 2 ways:
If the campaign is completely funded each crowdfunder will receive the recompense kit/kits of Innodor as expected.
If the campaign is not funded each crowdfunder will receive a refund of the total amount arrived to the project (87,6%). For example, if you made a contribution with 99 € and the project doesn't reach the goal you will receive back 86,72 €.
Como he explicado antes, Indiegogo y Paypal  aplican una comisión total del 12,4% a todas las colaboraciones hechas por los ""crowdfunders"", en otras palabras, el proyecto Innodor solo recibe el 87,6% tha cada colaboración. Este hecho puede afectar de 2 maneras al proyecto:
Si la campaña se completa totalmente cada colaborador recibirá el kit/kits Innodor como recompensa como estaba previsto.
Si la campaña no se completa cada colaborador recibirá un reembolso de la cantidad total que ha llegado al proyecto (87,6%). Por ejemplo, si haces una contribución de 99 € y el proyecto no llega a su meta recibirás un reembolso de 86,72 €.
Inaid will make best effort to provide the reward but delivery it is not guaranteed.Gratefulness / AgradecimientosHope you like this project and help me promoting this idea around the world. As you know, the crisis hit terribly Spain and other countries so now is the time to really use the wit to continue forward. With a little of your help it may be possible to keep on my company and my job. And who knows, if things go well I could generate some jobs and help other people too.  Thank you so much for your time and interest!Espero que os guste  y me ayudéis a promocionar esta idea por todo el mundo. Como sabéis, la crisis ha golpeado terriblemente España y otros países por lo que ahora es el momento de utilizar el ingenio para salir adelante. Con un poco de vuestra ayuda puede ser posible mantener mi empresa y mi trabajo. Y quien sabe, si las cosas van bien podría generar algunos puestos de trabajo y ayudar a otra gente.

<p>Hi! My name is Scott Speed
and I am an educator and an entrepreneur. My entire adult life I’ve done both
in some capacity. I’m passionate about entrepreneurship and mentoring/educating youth. My
personal mission statement is to make a positive impact in the lives of others.
</p>
<p><b>The ""5 For Friend’s"" Story</b></p>
<p>I'm an entrepreneur but I
never thought about creating an app… </p>
<p>In March my wife, Jennifer, went
into pre-term labor at 5 months pregnant and gave birth to our 3<sup>rd</sup>
child, Love Speed. It was too early…Love did not make it. It was the most
devastating thing that either of us had ever experienced. </p>
<p>While grieving we received
an outpouring of support from family and friends by email, text message, and
Facebook. However, a handful of friends actually called to talk by phone and
that was so meaningful to me. </p>
<p>It felt so good to hear from
a few friends that at one time I used to either see or talk to frequently. It
was one of those conversations when we said to each other ""We shouldn't
have to wait for a time like this to talk”. Yes, we've communicated by text or
Facebook over the years but when I spoke to them by phone it felt as if we
hadn't communicated at all. It was a more meaningful experience actually
talking to them and hearing their voice. </p>
<p>After getting off the phone
with my good friend from college, Fran Misener, I immediately started thinking
about how we can use technology as a solution. A solution to help busy people
stay connected to the meaningful friendships they've developed
throughout life. A way to make it easy and convenient to ""Keep in
Touch"" with family and friends. </p>
<p>Within 20 minutes of that
conversation with Franny, “5 For Friends” was born. </p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/633383/files/20140608063519-5green.png?1402234519"" src="""" style=""width: 196.07462686567163px; height: 151px;""/></i></p><p></p>
<p>Do you ever feel like adult responsibilities make it hard to “keep in
touch” with family and close friends from the past as much as you would like? </p>
<p>Have you ever wanted to call and talk to an old friend but thought to
yourself, “it would take too much time to catch up”, so you didn't make the
call? </p>
<p>Do you ever find yourself playing phone tag when trying to talk to a
friend by phone? </p>
<p>Or finally, have you ever spoken to a friend or family member after an
unfortunate life event and thought to yourself, ""we should not have
to wait until a time like this to talk?” </p>
<p>If you would enjoy “Keeping in Touch” with family &amp; friends by phone
periodically but don’t have a lot of time to talk then ""5 For Friends"" was
designed for you!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is “5 For Friends”?</b></p>
<p>""5 For Friends"" is a social
networking mobile app <span>that makes it easy and convenient to “Keep in Touch”! </span></p>
<p>Your friends and
family will know when…</p><p></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>You are available to talk</p>
<p>          o<span>  </span>You can pre-schedule or instantly indicate your availability. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>You have time to talk.</p>
<p>          o<span> 
</span>The app is designed for conversations that will only last 5 minutes.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>You feel like talking.</p>
<p>          o<span> 
</span>They can only call you when your profile
indicates “I Got 5”. </p>
<p>Everyone is busy.
However we all have short windows of free time in our daily schedules that can
be used to connect with Friends in a more meaningful way than just a text message or a comment
on Facebook. </p><p>With 5 For Friends you simply invite all of your REAL Friends and Family, people who you genuinely want to talk to from time to time, to download the app. Then whenever you want to talk you simply open the app to see who is available or make yourself available and wait to connect. Never get a voicemail or play phone tag again!</p>

Hi! My name is Scott Speed
and I am an educator and an entrepreneur. My entire adult life I’ve done both
in some capacity. I’m passionate about entrepreneurship and mentoring/educating youth. My
personal mission statement is to make a positive impact in the lives of others.

The ""5 For Friend’s"" Story
I'm an entrepreneur but I
never thought about creating an app… 
In March my wife, Jennifer, went
into pre-term labor at 5 months pregnant and gave birth to our 3rd
child, Love Speed. It was too early…Love did not make it. It was the most
devastating thing that either of us had ever experienced. 
While grieving we received
an outpouring of support from family and friends by email, text message, and
Facebook. However, a handful of friends actually called to talk by phone and
that was so meaningful to me. 
It felt so good to hear from
a few friends that at one time I used to either see or talk to frequently. It
was one of those conversations when we said to each other ""We shouldn't
have to wait for a time like this to talk”. Yes, we've communicated by text or
Facebook over the years but when I spoke to them by phone it felt as if we
hadn't communicated at all. It was a more meaningful experience actually
talking to them and hearing their voice. 
After getting off the phone
with my good friend from college, Fran Misener, I immediately started thinking
about how we can use technology as a solution. A solution to help busy people
stay connected to the meaningful friendships they've developed
throughout life. A way to make it easy and convenient to ""Keep in
Touch"" with family and friends. 
Within 20 minutes of that
conversation with Franny, “5 For Friends” was born.   

Do you ever feel like adult responsibilities make it hard to “keep in
touch” with family and close friends from the past as much as you would like? 
Have you ever wanted to call and talk to an old friend but thought to
yourself, “it would take too much time to catch up”, so you didn't make the
call? 
Do you ever find yourself playing phone tag when trying to talk to a
friend by phone? 
Or finally, have you ever spoken to a friend or family member after an
unfortunate life event and thought to yourself, ""we should not have
to wait until a time like this to talk?” 
If you would enjoy “Keeping in Touch” with family & friends by phone
periodically but don’t have a lot of time to talk then ""5 For Friends"" was
designed for you!

What is “5 For Friends”?
""5 For Friends"" is a social
networking mobile app that makes it easy and convenient to “Keep in Touch”! 
Your friends and
family will know when…
· 
You are available to talk
          o  You can pre-schedule or instantly indicate your availability. 
· 
You have time to talk.
          o 
The app is designed for conversations that will only last 5 minutes.
· 
You feel like talking.
          o 
They can only call you when your profile
indicates “I Got 5”. 
Everyone is busy.
However we all have short windows of free time in our daily schedules that can
be used to connect with Friends in a more meaningful way than just a text message or a comment
on Facebook. With 5 For Friends you simply invite all of your REAL Friends and Family, people who you genuinely want to talk to from time to time, to download the app. Then whenever you want to talk you simply open the app to see who is available or make yourself available and wait to connect. Never get a voicemail or play phone tag again!
5 For Friends Demo * Please note. This is a beta rendering, not a finished product. What Problems Does “5 For Friends” Solve

5 For Friends is Intelligent

You will never get a voicemail again when you feel
like talking to a friend or family member. Never play Phone Tag again!

5 For Friends is Efficient
You will never second-guess making a call because
you’re worried about being on the phone too long. After a ""30 seconds remaining"" warning, the call ends with a polite message at 5 minutes!

5 For Friends Strengthens
Relationships
The app makes it easy to call and verbally
congratulate friends during special moments in their lives. There is nothing
like feeling someone’s smile through the phone!


When do you have “5 For Friends”?
-  On your daily commute to and from
work.
- 
On
weekends during naptime for the children.
- 
While
making a quick trip to the grocery store. 
-  At soccer practice while you wait
for your child. 
With “5 For Friends” a
30-minute commute would allow you to connect and actually talk to six friends. The
possibilities are endless!

Friends” in the comments!

<p><strong>Notable design advantages</strong></p>
<p>- High efficiency</p>
<p>- Quiet operation</p>
<p>- Ease with which it can be used in almost any environment.</p>
<p>This compatibility with alternative and renewable energy sources has become increasingly significant as the price of electricity and conventional fuels rises, as well as concerns such as peak oil and climate change.</p>
<p><strong>Global Environmental Concerns</strong></p>
<p>While simply turning off household electronic devices can save each household thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide each year, it is not necessarily practical.</p>
<p>A study by the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm reveals the fact that our love affair with electronics is contributing almost as much to global warming pollution as the entire airline industry. The study shows that the combined telecommunication, media and entertainment sectors are responsible for roughly 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions, as compared to 4-5% for the airline industry when all of its supporting infrastructure is included.</p>
<p>This can be broken down to 1.3% for the IT and telecommunications sector and 1.7% for the media and entertainment sector. Together the two sectors contribute some 1.4 billion tons of CO2 equivalent emissions, based on 2007 data. That wasn’t very long ago, but long enough for some segments, such as cell phones to grow by an additional 50% since then.</p>
<p>While device efficiency continues to improve, it remains to be seen whether that will ever be enough to keep up with the enormous number of new users coming online every day.</p>
<p>According to an article in Discover published in 2010, a stunning 57% of all the energy produced in the US is wasted, through inefficiencies and losses in the system. Clearly this remains an enormous opportunity to improve those sectors that are contributing in double-digit percentages to our carbon footprint, such as transportation and buildings. Using information technology for data collection and control and to generally work smarter in these sectors surely will provide savings far in excess of the additional power required.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt=""e-reader CO2 emmisions"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/323/720/bf7a089047b9e184e2d41acbc1408c89_large.jpg?1357181960"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<div class=""template asset""><strong> e-reader CO2 emmisions</strong></div>
<p>Digital delivery of content for e-readers is a rapidly expanding market. Many assume that, because trees aren't being cut down and used to manufacture paper for books, e-readers (including the Kindle™, Nook™, iPad™, and the like) are a greener way to read books and magazines. But a broader look at the use of these devices that includes the life-cycle of the e-readers themselves paints a much bleaker picture about how green they really are.</p>
<p>Considering the carbon emissions for an average adult reader who reads 6.5 books per year. Paperback books have a footprint of 26 kilograms (over 57 pounds) of CO2, as compared to just under 70 grams (about 0.15 pounds) for the e-reader. But the tables are turned drastically when the carbon footprint of the reader is added in. The carbon footprint for this average reader is almost identical (130 kilograms or 285 pounds) when expanded over 5 years.</p>
<p>But how many people still use 5-year old electronic devices? Assuming a 2-year replacement cycle, the chart shows that the iPad™ carbon footprint outstrips that for the print reader, and even the more efficient iPad2 has more than double the emissions over a 5 year period. High-volume readers and those who hold on to their electronic devices for longer periods may make the e-reader a more suitable choice, but technological alternatives aren't always all their proponents would like consumers to believe.</p>
<p><strong>How much does it currently cost me to charge my devices without the Sentry™ Power Pad?</strong></p>
<p>The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) found that it cost $1.36 for the electricity needed annually to power a tablet or just under $3 if you are a heavy user and need juicing up every day.</p>
<p>EPRI’s lab tests reveal that each iPad™ model consumes less than 12 kWh of power in a year -- based on a full charge every other day. Meanwhile, running an iPhone 5 will result in a power cost of $.41 annually at 3.8 kWh.</p>
<p>Apple has sold more than 67 million iPads since 2010, so EPRI calculations put the energy use of all iPads ever sold at 590 GWh. It is widely assumed that this number will triple over the next two years; this consumption is the near equivalent of two 250 megawatt power plants operating at 50 percent capacity, the analysis estimates.</p>
<p>This equates to roughly 787 GWh (787,000,000 Kilowatt-hours) annually or the equivalent of anyone of the following results(according to epa.gov):</p>
<p>555,268 Metric Tons of CO2 - Carbon Dioxide or CO2 Equivalent</p>
<p>Annual greenhouse gas emissions from 115,681 passenger vehicles.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions from 62,249,759 gallons of gasoline consumed.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions from 1,291,321 barrels of oil consumed.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions from 7,324 tanker trucks’ worth of gasoline.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions from the electricity use of 83,124 homes for one year.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions from the energy use of 28,578 homes for one year.</p>
<p>Carbon sequestered by 14,237,637 tree seedlings grown for 10 years?</p>
<p>Carbon sequestered annually by 455,138 acres of pine or fir forests.</p>
<p>Carbon sequestered annually by 4,287 acres of forest preserved from deforestation.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions from 23,136,160 propane cylinders used for home barbeques.</p>
<p>CO2 emissions from burning 2,386 railcars’ worth of coal.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions avoided by recycling 207,965 tons of waste instead of sending it to the landfill.</p>
<p>Annual CO2 emissions of 0.157 coal fired power plants.</p>
<p><em>In 2009, a total of 457 power plants used coal to generate at least 95% of their electricity (EPA 2012). These plants emitted 1,614,625,638.1metric tons of CO2 in 2009.</em></p>
<p><em>Carbon dioxide emissions per power plant were calculated by dividing the total emissions from power plants whose primary source of fuel was coal by the number of power plants. 1,614,625,638.1 metric tons of CO2 × 1/457 power plants = 3,533,098 metric tons CO2/power plant</em></p>
<p><strong>The Solution Is Clear</strong></p>

</div>
<div id=""risks"">
<p>Similar to many <span>Indiegogo</span> projects, we face several key risks and challenges in sparking this revolution in free energy. The primary risks for us include:</p>
<p><strong>ENGINEERING</strong></p>
<p>To achieve the level of simplicity in user experience that we have, we have to design and engineer a very complex system. We have taken two key steps to ensure our engineering success. 1) We have formed an amazing team of engineers and designers, and 2) we test our products with an obsession for perfection. In the last year, we have built prototypes, we will have a run of beta machines with significant user testing, and we keep enormous amounts of data to guide our future work.</p>
<p><strong>SUPPLY CHAIN AND LOGISTICS</strong></p>
<p>Many <span>Indiegogo</span> campaigns can encounter problems when taking their prototypes to production. This includes issues finding suppliers and engineering products for mass-production. Smooth execution is absolutely essential to overcoming such risks. We take this lesson seriously and have been working for months negotiating with suppliers, testing component quality, and building a team that can execute on our promises. Our plans are nearly in place, and we now mainly require the resources to execute them.</p>
<p><strong>TEAM</strong></p>
<p>Finding the right people is a challenge for any endeavor. Success in alternative energy sectors requires a team of talented, passionate, and motivated designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs. We have already formed a truly remarkable team, but we will have to bring in more team members to realize this dream. In fact, we are actively looking for new members to join UAT and hit the ground running!

We are first and foremost innovators. We are looking to change and more importantly improve the world through technology. We have typically focused on military and government products/services in the areas of greentech, biotech and intelligence.
 
We are looking to expand into the civilian market segments by bringing relevant high quality tech to retail markets. We love the Indiegogo platform because it gives us something we rarely get, feedback on a large scale. By utilizing Indiegogo to fund projects we can readily discuss with you, the consumer, what tech you like and what tech you would like to see more of. This is very exciting to us as it creates a collaborate effort among all of us sharing this planet. We can work together to improve the globe environmentally and geopolitically. We cant wait to get started with you.
 
We Need Your Help!
 
We have designed, redesigned and reimagined Sentry™ many times during the past 12 months, pouring countless hours into thinking about the user experience, the technical aspects of the project and how to deliver the world's smartest and cleanest power source to you at an affordable price point. You can help bring The UAT Sentry™ Alternative Power System-Civilian Power Pad (SAPS-CPP) to the world by being the very first to own them!
What is UAT Sentry™ Alternative Power System-Civilian Power Pad?
The UAT Sentry™ Alternative Power System-Civilian Power Pad is a thermodynamic silent power supply that does not need to be charged or plugged in. Ever! Our civilian Sentry™ can use ambient temperature and conductive heat exchange from your tablet to generate electricity to power your electronic devices. Utilizing cyclic compression and expansion or more specifically, a closed-cycle regenerative thermodynamic power system.
Notable design advantages
- High efficiency
- Quiet operation
- Ease with which it can be used in almost any environment.
This compatibility with alternative and renewable energy sources has become increasingly significant as the price of electricity and conventional fuels rises, as well as concerns such as peak oil and climate change.
Global Environmental Concerns
While simply turning off household electronic devices can save each household thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide each year, it is not necessarily practical.
A study by the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm reveals the fact that our love affair with electronics is contributing almost as much to global warming pollution as the entire airline industry. The study shows that the combined telecommunication, media and entertainment sectors are responsible for roughly 3% of all greenhouse gas emissions, as compared to 4-5% for the airline industry when all of its supporting infrastructure is included.
This can be broken down to 1.3% for the IT and telecommunications sector and 1.7% for the media and entertainment sector. Together the two sectors contribute some 1.4 billion tons of CO2 equivalent emissions, based on 2007 data. That wasn’t very long ago, but long enough for some segments, such as cell phones to grow by an additional 50% since then.
While device efficiency continues to improve, it remains to be seen whether that will ever be enough to keep up with the enormous number of new users coming online every day.
According to an article in Discover published in 2010, a stunning 57% of all the energy produced in the US is wasted, through inefficiencies and losses in the system. Clearly this remains an enormous opportunity to improve those sectors that are contributing in double-digit percentages to our carbon footprint, such as transportation and buildings. Using information technology for data collection and control and to generally work smarter in these sectors surely will provide savings far in excess of the additional power required.

 e-reader CO2 emmisions
Digital delivery of content for e-readers is a rapidly expanding market. Many assume that, because trees aren't being cut down and used to manufacture paper for books, e-readers (including the Kindle™, Nook™, iPad™, and the like) are a greener way to read books and magazines. But a broader look at the use of these devices that includes the life-cycle of the e-readers themselves paints a much bleaker picture about how green they really are.
Considering the carbon emissions for an average adult reader who reads 6.5 books per year. Paperback books have a footprint of 26 kilograms (over 57 pounds) of CO2, as compared to just under 70 grams (about 0.15 pounds) for the e-reader. But the tables are turned drastically when the carbon footprint of the reader is added in. The carbon footprint for this average reader is almost identical (130 kilograms or 285 pounds) when expanded over 5 years.
But how many people still use 5-year old electronic devices? Assuming a 2-year replacement cycle, the chart shows that the iPad™ carbon footprint outstrips that for the print reader, and even the more efficient iPad2 has more than double the emissions over a 5 year period. High-volume readers and those who hold on to their electronic devices for longer periods may make the e-reader a more suitable choice, but technological alternatives aren't always all their proponents would like consumers to believe.
How much does it currently cost me to charge my devices without the Sentry™ Power Pad?
The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) found that it cost $1.36 for the electricity needed annually to power a tablet or just under $3 if you are a heavy user and need juicing up every day.

<p>It’s a micro-SD-card; it’s a “NFC-capable”/Contactless-card; its “Beam-Card”!</p>
<p>Don’t have one of the newest and COSTLY smartphones that comes with NFC/Contactless communication Ability? Not to worry! With NFC-Beam Card EVERY phone (both old and new) with a microSD slot can be retrofitted with “Beam” Contactless Technology. Now you too can “Bump” phones to exchange data, “Beam” contactless payment and much more!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>With present day technologies moving forward at light speeds, and new innovations and technologies being invented, we all see lots of new devices and gadgets with awesome capabilities. These new devices and gadgets come with a medium to high price-tag/cost, and not everyone can readily “foot the bill” to get these new gadgets with new features, even though we all want those features.</p>
<p>These new gadgets also make us aware that our current gadgets are becoming “old school”, because they do not have the new technologies, features and capabilities that the new ones bring with them. Some updates and upgrades can be performed on our current-gadgets to keep them in vogue and up to speed with the new-gadgets, but not all kind of upgrades are possible, especially not “hardware upgrades”.</p>
<p>One simple example/device that comes to mind is the mobile phone. Today’s mobile phone is called a “smart” phone; few years ago, a mobile phone was simple called a “Phone”, “mobile phone” or “cell-phone”, but with the technology, features and capabilities that today’s phones ""pack"", it has to be “smart”.</p>
<p>One feature/capability in today’s Smartphone that’s becoming a trend and the “talk of the town” is the Contactless/Near-Field-Communication feature. We’ve all heard of it, and we know what it’s about, some people more than others. (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication</a> gives a good brief explanation and insight). Only the latest smartphone’s come ready with Contactless/NFC technology, and since the Contactless/NFC Technology actually requires certain hardware-microchips to be embedded in the smartphone, it is not possible to perform an “upgrade” on “current and older” phones, at least up until now, thanks to the “Beam-Card”.</p>
<p>With Beam-Card any and all current and older phones with a SD-card-slot (standard, mini or micro) can be easily and readily equipped and retrofitted with the Contactless/Short Range Wireless Technology! Now, everyone can “Bump” phones and “Beam” data, with their current and old phones, without having to buy a brand new (and costly) phone! The Opportunities made possible by Beam-Card are endless! We’ll touch on the possibilities below.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[IMAGE HERE - Beam Card Applications]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The image above outlines some of the various applications of Beam-Card.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT</h2>
<p>We have come a long way since the ideas for the product came to us and now we need your help and support to manufacture the Beam Card product and take it to the world. We'll ensure you get the Beam Card from the first batches out of manufacturing, and before anyone else does.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>PRIORITY APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION</h2>
<p>Currently, contactless payments is the major area/field in which Contactless/NFC technology is focused on, so because of this, we have focused our priority development/implementation for the Beam-Card on the contactless payments area/field, and will work on enabling other Application areas and prospects in the near future.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WANT DEVELOPERS ACCESS?</h2>
<p>For our donors/contributors and early supporters ONLY, for only $100, we will give you one developer’s license/access to the product’s developers-codes you need without restrictions (except as necessary and to prevent misuse); so go ahead and donate/support today with only $100 for this awesome “time limited” access offer!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>WHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE USED FOR?</h2>
<p>The funds will be used for manufacturing the Product mainly (i.e. Beam Card), to cover shipping and logistics from the manufacturer’s factory, and to complete the Software/Apps that will interface with the product on phones.</p>
<p>If the funding goal is reached and exceeded, the additional funds will allow us to quickly commence working on enabling other Application areas and functionality of the Beam-Card, thereby allowing users to perform other possible functions.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>PRODUCTION SCHEDULE AND DELIVERY</h2>
<p>We have a working product and are ready for manufacturing. Pending successful funding, we should be able to have the factory/manufacturing-run begin within One to Two months from when we receive funding. Manufacturing and Packaging should take about a Month, and shipping will be right afterwards. We anticipate and aim to get products to our supporters and contributors by Nov/Dec 2013.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h2>WHAT ARE THE RISKS?</h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">With all technology there are always risks, and one of the main risk/issue which we have is that of the capacity/capability of present day’s technology when it comes to achieving the possible functionality(ies) and memory capacity which we intend, on the very-small form-factor of the micro-SD-card; (basically, it gets more difficult to achieve a higher memory space while also having the micro-chip(s) onboard the micro-SD-card necessary in order to provide the contactless/NFC-related feature). In addition, we are at a position/point where another main issue for us is the delay/lack of the available sufficient funding to manufacture and get the project/product to the market, and thus officially launch our company; (basically in order to keep manufacturing costs reasonable, we need to attain certain manufacturing quantities).</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO TO HELP?</h2>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We know it is not always possible to contribute funds, but you can help us considerably if you can share, forward and post our campaign link to your networks via Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit or any other social media outlet. If you do contribute funds, we would be additionally grateful to you if you would still help us forward and post our campaign link to your social networks.</p>

We’ll touch on the possibilities below.
 
[IMAGE HERE - Beam Card Applications]
 
The image above outlines some of the various applications of Beam-Card.
 
WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT
We have come a long way since the ideas for the product came to us and now we need your help and support to manufacture the Beam Card product and take it to the world. We'll ensure you get the Beam Card from the first batches out of manufacturing, and before anyone else does.
 
PRIORITY APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION
Currently, contactless payments is the major area/field in which Contactless/NFC technology is focused on, so because of this, we have focused our priority development/implementation for the Beam-Card on the contactless payments area/field, and will work on enabling other Application areas and prospects in the near future.
 
WANT DEVELOPERS ACCESS?
For our donors/contributors and early supporters ONLY, for only $100, we will give you one developer’s license/access to the product’s developers-codes you need without restrictions (except as necessary and to prevent misuse); so go ahead and donate/support today with only $100 for this awesome “time limited” access offer!
 
WHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE USED FOR?
The funds will be used for manufacturing the Product mainly (i.e. Beam Card), to cover shipping and logistics from the manufacturer’s factory, and to complete the Software/Apps that will interface with the product on phones.
If the funding goal is reached and exceeded, the additional funds will allow us to quickly commence working on enabling other Application areas and functionality of the Beam-Card, thereby allowing users to perform other possible functions.
 
PRODUCTION SCHEDULE AND DELIVERY
We have a working product and are ready for manufacturing. Pending successful funding, we should be able to have the factory/manufacturing-run begin within One to Two months from when we receive funding. Manufacturing and Packaging should take about a Month, and shipping will be right afterwards. We anticipate and aim to get products to our supporters and contributors by Nov/Dec 2013.
 


WHAT ARE THE RISKS?
With all technology there are always risks, and one of the main risk/issue which we have is that of the capacity/capability of present day’s technology when it comes to achieving the possible functionality(ies) and memory capacity which we intend, on the very-small form-factor of the micro-SD-card; (basically, it gets more difficult to achieve a higher memory space while also having the micro-chip(s) onboard the micro-SD-card necessary in order to provide the contactless/NFC-related feature). In addition, we are at a position/point where another main issue for us is the delay/lack of the available sufficient funding to manufacture and get the project/product to the market, and thus officially launch our company; (basically in order to keep manufacturing costs reasonable, we need to attain certain manufacturing quantities).


WHAT ELSE CAN YOU DO TO HELP?
We know it is not always possible to contribute funds, but you can help us considerably if you can share, forward and post our campaign link to your networks via Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Reddit or any other social media outlet. If you do contribute funds, we would be additionally grateful to you if you would still help us forward and post our campaign link to your social networks.
Thank you very much for your support.

</h3><p><b>Hello!
Thank you for checking us out.</b></p>
<p>We are creating this loyalty software program + app because I
discovered the need for it while running my restaurant. I have a lot of beer to
sell (37 taps) but don’t have an exciting way to track purchases and reward people for
trying them. We do fundraisers quite often and have great specials but it can
be difficult to get the word out and get the turnout we would like. Imagine
having a loyalty program and app where several businesses in your town post all the great stuff
they have going on. And when you travel you can find all of those great things
too. The more KlubHub is used the better tool it will become for businesses and
the community. </p>
<p>There are other loyalty apps
out there but not like this one. This one serves a few purposes.</p>
<p>For customers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lets you earn rewards where you shop.</li>
<li>Lets you explore specials, sales and events in
     your area and where you travel.</li>
<li>Lets you see where you rank loyalty-wise with everyone
     else who shops where you do.</li>
<li>Never carry or lose punchcards or loyalty cards again.</li>
<li>Store all your loyalty points in one place, your phone.</li>
<li>Just click one button to have points awarded to your account.</li>
<li>And in version 2, much more will be added. Anyone that
     contributes will get updates and will be offered the opportunity to give
     us suggestions.</li>
</ul><p>For businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share your specials, sales and events effectively.</li>
<li>Reward your most loyal customers.</li>
<li>Reach new customers.</li>
<li>Access customer analytics with our comprehensive dashboard.</li>
<li>And in version 2, much more will be added. Anyone that
     contributes will get updates and will be offered the opportunity to give
     us suggestions.</li>
</ul><p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>So here is the deal. We are raising
this money to pay for the development of the loyalty software program + app. It started out as just a beer
club app to increase beer sales at my restaurant, Loggers Tap House, and share
it with other bars around the US and the rest of the world. But from the
original idea, it grew into something much better and more expensive to make.
At this point I’m out of money and would really like to get this app finished
up. It is set to launch at the end of September.</p>
<p>I truly believe this is going to be
a great app for small businesses and their communities. In addition to being a
business owner I am a part time business advisor providing free business advice
for folks in my community. I’m also working on a “buy local” website to help
foster community development.</p>
<p>Here is what you get. We want to
work with you. We are just a couple of guys with a good idea but we want to
take you on the journey with us. Every contributor will be on our thank you
page on our website and will be kept up-to-date on this adventure. Those who contribute
a little more will get an “I funded KlubHub” window decal. Those who increase
their contribution will get an “I funded KlubHub” t-shirt. Those contributing
$50 or more will earn free app time for their business or their favorite business.
The prize for the biggest level contribution is an opportunity to go whitewater
rafting with me, my dad, and a friend of yours. Of course that isn’t completely
selfless. I haven’t gone rafting in two years now. I spent all last summer
working on the new restaurant and I’m still struggling to make that work. This
would be a great opportunity for us all to get out and have some fun.</p><p>Goal: $30,000</p><p></p><p>Stretch Goal: $60,000. We are well on our way to developing the requirements for
version two. We’d like to get it going just after the release version one. We’ll
tell our contributors all about the great plans that we have for this loyalty
software program + app. A hint is that it will involve a lot of community
features and addition features for business owners.</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Vikram, my buddy and partner in
KlubHub, and I have several community based project ideas. This project will
afford us the opportunity to start moving forward on those as well. We are
excited to help small businesses and their communities in the US where I served
14 years in the Army, in India where Vikram lives, and the rest of the world.</p>
<p>With your help, this fantastic
journey will begin.</p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The biggest challenge we face is
spreading the word about this app. There are a whole lot of retailers in the US
alone, 3 million actually. But we’ve got some ideas. We’ve put a marketing plan
together. Come on this journey with us and we’ll share with you.</p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Can’t
contribute financially? I completely understand but there are opportunities to
help. Spread the word for us. Indiegogo has some great sharing tools. Share our
YouTube video. Share on Facebook and Twitter. </p>
<p>Again,
thank you so much for taking the time to check out our project.</p></div>","Hello!

they have going on. And when you travel you can find all of those great things
too. The more KlubHub is used the better tool it will become for businesses and
the community. 
There are other loyalty apps
out there but not like this one. This one serves a few purposes.
For customers:

Lets you earn rewards where you shop.
Lets you explore specials, sales and events in
     your area and where you travel.
Lets you see where you rank loyalty-wise with everyone
     else who shops where you do.
Never carry or lose punchcards or loyalty cards again.
Store all your loyalty points in one place, your phone.
Just click one button to have points awarded to your account.
And in version 2, much more will be added. Anyone that
     contributes will get updates and will be offered the opportunity to give
     us suggestions.
For businesses:

Share your specials, sales and events effectively.
Reward your most loyal customers.
Reach new customers.
Access customer analytics with our comprehensive dashboard.
And in version 2, much more will be added. Anyone that
     contributes will get updates and will be offered the opportunity to give
     us suggestions.
What
We Need & What You Get
So here is the deal. We are raising
this money to pay for the development of the loyalty software program + app. It started out as just a beer
club app to increase beer sales at my restaurant, Loggers Tap House, and share
it with other bars around the US and the rest of the world. But from the
original idea, it grew into something much better and more expensive to make.
At this point I’m out of money and would really like to get this app finished
up. It is set to launch at the end of September.
I truly believe this is going to be
a great app for small businesses and their communities. In addition to being a
business owner I am a part time business advisor providing free business advice
for folks in my community. I’m also working on a “buy local” website to help
foster community development.
Here is what you get. We want to
work with you. We are just a couple of guys with a good idea but we want to
take you on the journey with us. Every contributor will be on our thank you
page on our website and will be kept up-to-date on this adventure. Those who contribute
a little more will get an “I funded KlubHub” window decal. Those who increase
their contribution will get an “I funded KlubHub” t-shirt. Those contributing
$50 or more will earn free app time for their business or their favorite business.
The prize for the biggest level contribution is an opportunity to go whitewater
rafting with me, my dad, and a friend of yours. Of course that isn’t completely
selfless. I haven’t gone rafting in two years now. I spent all last summer
working on the new restaurant and I’m still struggling to make that work. This
would be a great opportunity for us all to get out and have some fun.Goal: $30,000Stretch Goal: $60,000. We are well on our way to developing the requirements for
version two. We’d like to get it going just after the release version one. We’ll
tell our contributors all about the great plans that we have for this loyalty
software program + app. A hint is that it will involve a lot of community
features and addition features for business owners.
The
Impact
Vikram, my buddy and partner in
KlubHub, and I have several community based project ideas. This project will
afford us the opportunity to start moving forward on those as well. We are
excited to help small businesses and their communities in the US where I served
14 years in the Army, in India where Vikram lives, and the rest of the world.
With your help, this fantastic
journey will begin.
Risks
& Challenges
The biggest challenge we face is
spreading the word about this app. There are a whole lot of retailers in the US
alone, 3 million actually. But we’ve got some ideas. We’ve put a marketing plan
together. Come on this journey with us and we’ll share with you.
Other
Ways You Can Help
Can’t
contribute financially? I completely understand but there are opportunities to
help. Spread the word for us. Indiegogo has some great sharing tools. Share our
YouTube video. Share on Facebook and Twitter. 
Again,
thank you so much for taking the time to check out our project.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<br/><p>BPM stands for Business
Process Management. According to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process_management"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>, is a field in operations management that focuses on improving
corporate performance by managing and optimizing a company's business processes.</p>
<p>For better understanding I
will provide a simple example. Let's take into account the following scenario:</p>
<p>Your company has to request
new office items because you are running out of inventory.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><img align=""right"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/980764/files/20141102184530-Depositphotos_42406489_original_2.jpg?1414982730"" src="""" style=""width: 312px; height: 207px; margin-left: 5px;""/><b>Without </b>a BPM application,
person ""A"" has to fill a form for the new request. This form will be sent
to person ""B"" who authorizes, denies or requests modifications to
this form. It's probably that you will end with a lot of printed forms and
delayed task because person ""A"" makes a lot of mistakes and forgets
all assigned tasks.</p>
<p>Even if person
""A"" makes everything fine, you cannot control what he is doing, if he
is overloaded, identify and optimize bottlenecks in daily tasks, and other
important things to improve the company performance.</p>

With </b>a BPM Application,
person “A” inputs the information in the application, a task will be assigned
to person “B” who authorizes, denies or requests modifications to the information.
When modifications are required, person ""A"" can do modifications
directly in the application and send the task several times to person
""B"" for authorization. When the request is authorized, person “A”
will be able to print a PDF document which is automatically filled by the
application. In addition, you can control which tasks are delayed and send
reminders to users who have pending tasks.

<a href=""#campnavigation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(go back to menu)</a><div>
<p></p>
<p>SimplifyMe is a web BPM application which allows
users to design and execute business processes with their own business rules,
entirely from any major web browsers without requiring the installation of
additional plugins. It uses codeigniter as a framework and other technologies
such as bootstrap, jquery, datatables, jsplumb, among others.</p>

<h2><b>Why this BPM Application is different from others? </b></h2>
<a href=""#campnavigation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(go back to menu)</a>
</div>
<div>
<br/><p>There are a lot of BPM applications, maybe more
than 100 hundred, so why you should select this one? Here you have a list of
main key features (in parenthesis you will find the quantity of application
that might accomplish partially or completely the feature described):</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Mobile ready (10 ~ 15):</strong> this application was build
using bootstrap framework, which is the most famous tool to make any website
adapt to any screen resolution. More than 80% of current websites use it.

<li><span><strong>Interconnection with other system (15 ~ 25):</strong> you
can connect your business processes with other systems like your inventory,

<p></p>
<p>There are 0 (zero!!) BPM applications for $3

What is BPM? 
(go back to menu)
BPM stands for Business
Process Management. According to Wikipedia, is a field in operations management that focuses on improving
corporate performance by managing and optimizing a company's business processes.
For better understanding I
will provide a simple example. Let's take into account the following scenario:
Your company has to request
new office items because you are running out of inventory.



Without a BPM application,
person ""A"" has to fill a form for the new request. This form will be sent
to person ""B"" who authorizes, denies or requests modifications to
this form. It's probably that you will end with a lot of printed forms and
delayed task because person ""A"" makes a lot of mistakes and forgets
all assigned tasks.
Even if person
""A"" makes everything fine, you cannot control what he is doing, if he
is overloaded, identify and optimize bottlenecks in daily tasks, and other
important things to improve the company performance.




With a BPM Application,
person “A” inputs the information in the application, a task will be assigned
to person “B” who authorizes, denies or requests modifications to the information.
When modifications are required, person ""A"" can do modifications
directly in the application and send the task several times to person
""B"" for authorization. When the request is authorized, person “A”
will be able to print a PDF document which is automatically filled by the
application. In addition, you can control which tasks are delayed and send
reminders to users who have pending tasks.


What is SimplifyMe BPM? 

(go back to menu)

SimplifyMe is a web BPM application which allows
users to design and execute business processes with their own business rules,
entirely from any major web browsers without requiring the installation of
additional plugins. It uses codeigniter as a framework and other technologies
such as bootstrap, jquery, datatables, jsplumb, among others.


Why this BPM Application is different from others? 
(go back to menu)


There are a lot of BPM applications, maybe more
than 100 hundred, so why you should select this one? Here you have a list of
main key features (in parenthesis you will find the quantity of application
that might accomplish partially or completely the feature described):



Mobile ready (10 ~ 15): this application was build
using bootstrap framework, which is the most famous tool to make any website
adapt to any screen resolution. More than 80% of current websites use it.
Thanks to this, you will be able to design and execute your business processes
from any device, even from your smart phone.
Manage from the web (5 ~ 10): you can design your
business processes, process logic, business rules, grant access to users,
interconnect other system with your business processes without requiring the
installation of additional plugins or “client – server” applications, and other
cool features, all from the web.
Interconnection with other system (15 ~ 25): you
can connect your business processes with other systems like your inventory,
credit bureaus system, etc.

Very low cost per user (1 ~ 5): you will have
access to all application features with prices starting from only $3 dollars monthly per user!!!

Very light application (1 ~ 5): it can runs without
problems in your personal computer, acting like server for other users. It runs
in any major operating system such as Windows, Linux-based OS like OS X,
Ubuntu, etc.



There are 0 (zero!!) BPM applications for $3

business rules, interconnect those processes with other systems, and other
features, all from your favorite web browser from any device (desktop, laptop,
  tablet or smartphone) from any place of the world. Again, there are 0!!

What are the modules? 

(go back to menu)


It has two main modules:

Executer: allows end users execute any process designed in the backend by the expert users. It has additional functionalities such as notifications, graphical status.
Administrator: allows expert users design process definitions, business rules, connect external sources, manage users and system configuration and other functionalities.



What we need?
(go back to menu)


Our goal is to reach $50,000.00. 


Contract a PHP developer and Web Designer for 6 months to finish the missing functionalities and improve the usability.
Contract a designer for the application details.
Buy two desktop computers and two monitors for local development.
Buy a desktop computer to be used as server for local development and testing environment.
Buy Zend Server licenses to detect possible slow queries or code problems.
Rent a VPS to upload a demo where contributors will be able to see and use the application.


If we reach $75,000.00 we will:



Develop module to create html web forms (example: a form to register customer information, product information, assign products to customer, etc).

Develop module to manage documents.


Do we have a demo?
(go back to menu)



Yes. The following videos show how to create a process definition, functions, diagrams, business rules, external sources and PDF Form usage.
Note: The videos are in the gallery section. You should see these videos in HD because I did not use zoom. Sorry for that. If you did not like the music I added, sorry for that too, I selected random music from youtube's video administrator.

<p><em><strong>The LapDogg</strong></em> is Simply Awesome!!! We designed and created this product out of a neccessity to operate our mobile phone, IPod, IPad, and PS3 gaming device hands-free. As we began our search almost two years ago we initially thought that there had to be something on the market that would meet the need of somehow holding our devices. Unfortunately and fortunately, everything we found required the individual to be stationary......either sitting, standing still, or laying down. As a result of our fruitless search, we set out to come up with a product that would allow the user to be mobile. Afterall, we live in an extremely mobile and ""On the Go"" society. Simply put, we feel the..... <em><strong>The LapDogg</strong></em> will revolutionize the mobile device industry around the world. Whether you're a master texter, watch videos, gaming, or surfing the internet on your phone or IPad/Kindle,<em><strong> The LapDogg</strong></em> will serve all of your needs.

<p><strong><em>More Background Story</em></strong> I see the LapDogg revolutionizing how we utilize our mobile and gaming devices. I thing the Lapdogg will become an industry standard and seen as essential as a protective or decorative case that almost every phone has. Smart phones and PDA's were once a luxury upgrade for most users whereas we now see Smart Phones offered with Pre-Pay accounts.  Today, Smart Phones and PDA's account for almost 60% of all phones sold throughout the United States.  But make no mistake, the LapDogg will definitely be a global infestation. Ultimately, we see the LapDogg as a crucial device that will stimulate a more productive society. If we are to think about the multitude of occasions where we have abandoned completing a task or responding to an email until we can have access to a laptop or PC.   Because of the tedious and perceived time required when attempting to complete or engage in a task that will take an elongated time period, the LapDogg will encourge and stimulate you because of the comfort of operating your device virtually hands-free.</p>
<p>At this point in the project we have exhausted all known avenues of funding (Meaning.....our parents and friends) and we need some help to make this dream a reality. Through our research and knocking on doors, we have found that in order to keep control over the development, production and material quality, we will need IndieGoGo's help with $17,000 to get this project off the ground and into stores. This will fund the the first production-run of 4600 devices, some marketing, and other incidentals needed to bring this product to market. I hope that through the many business contacts, social media blasts, and a potential professional athletes’ endorsement of the LapDogg will become the next Croc or wireless Bluetooth earpiece. This project is our passion and in many ways.........our life. The impact on society and our lives will be astronomical!!! I can see nurses, lab technicians, physicians, teachers, warehouse workers, and just about every profession able to capitalize and benefit from the LapDogg.  Beyond all of the professional applications, we can only imagine the millions, and possibly billions, of young kids, tweens, and young adults utilizing the LapDogg for their portable gaming devices.</p>
<p>If we are to calculate and think about the prospect of the number of LapDogg's being sold over the next couple of years and imagine that if only a tenth of a percent (that's point zero one!) purchase one LapDogg.  we feel this WILL be a million dollar business inside of a year and a BILLION dollar business in a matter of a few years.........if not sooner.  About a week ago, we saw a story about the woman who invented a product for women called ""SPANX"".  It's sort of like a girdle!!  Her business is now worth over a BILLION DOLLARS!!!!!  We CAN do this.  I want to thank all of you from the very bottom of our hearts and we appreciate any help you can give.  Every Little Bit Counts!!!!</p>

The LapDogg is Simply Awesome!!! We designed and created this product out of a neccessity to operate our mobile phone, IPod, IPad, and PS3 gaming device hands-free. As we began our search almost two years ago we initially thought that there had to be something on the market that would meet the need of somehow holding our devices. Unfortunately and fortunately, everything we found required the individual to be stationary......either sitting, standing still, or laying down. As a result of our fruitless search, we set out to come up with a product that would allow the user to be mobile. Afterall, we live in an extremely mobile and ""On the Go"" society. Simply put, we feel the..... The LapDogg will revolutionize the mobile device industry around the world. Whether you're a master texter, watch videos, gaming, or surfing the internet on your phone or IPad/Kindle, The LapDogg will serve all of your needs. Also, you can detach the shaft and use as a traditional holster/belt clip as well !!!

<p>Let the Tangle that you use, speak about your personality.</p>
<p>The things that we wear reflects our personality. With everything that we use, we are making a statement to the world about what kind of person we are. Some of us are sports enthusiasts, some of us are coldplay fans, some of us are geeks, some of us are cooks .. all of us are something and love something. We associate them with our personalities. Something we want the world to know. Let your Tangle show how cool you are. </p>
<p>Every Tangle has its own personality by virtue of its design that reflects the personality of the designer/maker and its user.</p>
<p>You can get Tangles in designs that reflects your style, personality and interests. Maybe you might want a Pink Floyd Tangle, maybe a Ferarri Tangle, maybe a Meme Tangle. Show the world what you love. </p>

We think the precision of cut can be made better so that the Tangle would look a lot more classy and would feel better. The new die punch is a lot more precision and will last longer. It is expected to cost $2000-3000. </span><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">The money that you give will go into making the product a lot more finished and top notch.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">The rest of the money will go towards building a search engine for maker parts. We want to build a search engine just for makers so that it will become easier for you to make something.</span></p>
<p>We have tested the Tangle for over 9 months and are happy with its performance. Your money will help us make Tangle more polished and finished. Each of the designs that you submit for Tangle will give the Tangle a personality of its own that reflects its maker and user.</p>

<p>This is our story!</p>
<p>My name is Alex. I am the dude sitting on the right of the picture. On the left of the picture is Arun. Both of us are batchmates from the Department of Engineering Design, IIT Madras. After graduating from IIT in 2012, we decided to take a year off instead of taking a job. We thought we could do better than that ! We wanted to explore what is it that we really want to do.So for exactly one year we have been experimenting.</p>
<p>Both of us have a lot of interest in product design and making 'things'. The products that we have built might not be perfect but one day we will get there. Some of the projects that Arun worked on are</p>

<p>One of the things that we noticed is that, all our work has always stayed at the project stage. None of them got to the market. Both of us wanted to build a product that can be taken to the market. So we came us with 'Tangle'. This is our attempt to see if we can build a very simple product, so simple that you can make it at home if you are in so much of a need.</p>
<p>Both of us want to pursue our interests of designing products but the paths that we chose to experiment are different. Arun has decided to pursue a PhD in CMU Robotics Institute, while I decided to pursue entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>In the last one year of our experimental life, one thing we came across is the maker culture. We figured out that there is a community of people who love making stuff, just like we do. As part of my entrepreneurial journey, the company I want to build is for the makers. At makeystreet we are building a search engine for maker parts. One of the problem that we as makers have experienced is that, it is very hard to find and discover parts for what we build. We validated the need with makers around us. The money that we generate from sales of 'Tangle' will go to funding this company.</p>

<h2><img alt=""How we made Tangle .. "" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://makeystreet.blob.core.windows.net/heading/10.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""How we made Tangle .. ""/></h2>
<p>A lot of really awesome people have attempted solving the problem of tangled earphones before us. Some of them are really cool. The reason why we decided to build a solution ourselves is that we could not find any product easily available that works for earphones that we were comfortable with. So we decided to build a product that is so easy to build that you can hack one yourself at home. Also we noticed that a many of the products that exist in the market are designed for certain specific earphones or is are inbuilt with the  earphones. We wanted to make a solution that works for as many earphones as possible.</p>
<p>While we were at it, we thought why not make it completely customizable so that it can reflect our personality. We are makers and wanted the Tangle to reflect our maker personality so that we will be able to strike a conversation with other makers. Then we realized that everyone would want a Tangle that reflects their personality. And the designer Tangle was born !</p>

<h3>What is the notch on the Tangle for?</h3>
<p>Did we tell you that Tangle works for pretty much any earphone that you can think about? Well the notch is for making Tangle work with earphones that have a mic on the cord or for asymmetric earphones. For such earphones you will need to make a cut along the notch into the oval hole. Along the new cut that you made, you can pass the earphone end of the cord into the oval holes so that the specific earphone works with Tangle.</p>
<h3>Why are there 4 circular holes?</h3>
<p>After winding the earphone, you can pass the plug-end through any consecutive 2 holes out of the 4 circular holes in a stitching pattern. This will keep it in place. Due to varying lengths of earphone cord, you would never know where they end. </p>

If you want a Tangle, we will ship it to you. If you are based in US or India, the shipping cost is included. Shipping Tangle to any other country will be $5. If you are residing outside India/US, please dont forget to add $5 as shipping amount.
If you are ordering Tangle as a swag for your event, shipping cost will be dependent on how many tangles you order.

Sometimes frustrations require immediate solutions. If you cant wait for us to ship the Tangles to you, you can make one yourself. Refer to the instructions here on how to make a Tangle - http://www.instructables.com/id/Tangle-prevent-your-earphones-from-getting-tangl/?ALLSTEPS

We have applied for a patent for the product, but being makers ourselves, we absolutely encourage you to make one for yourself. 


Simple solution for tangled earphone problem
A fashion gadget that reflects your personality
An opportunity to support Makeystreet - search engine for maker parts

 


If you are a regular user of earphones and are frustrated with tangled earphones, then Tangle is for you!!
We dug deep into the problem of tangled earphones and and found that in order to untangle earphones, it requires the user's focused attention, which means that the user will be distracted from her original work for a few minutes. This is what creates the frustration. 
Our solution for Tangled earphones does not require your focused attention to use an earphone. Tangle is designed to be so simple to use that you can take your earphones out and listen to music without loosing focus on your primary task.
 

 
Tangle is designed to be universal. We have tried our best to design the product to work with every earphone in the market. Having tested Tangle with a lot of earphones we can say that Tangle works for almost all earphones. 
 
This is not a earphone based solution to tangled earphones. Neither is this a solution that works only for certain kinds of earphones. It works for your favourite earphones. You don't have to part with earphones that you already own. Rejoice !! 

 
If you have more than one earphone that you use on occasions, you can use Tangle to organize and store your earphone when not in use.
 

 

Tangle is completely customizable.
You can make Tangles for others to use. If you want to make a designer Tangle drop us a mail at alex@makeysteet.com
 
  
 
Let the Tangle that you use, speak about your personality.
The things that we wear reflects our personality. With everything that we use, we are making a statement to the world about what kind of person we are. Some of us are sports enthusiasts, some of us are coldplay fans, some of us are geeks, some of us are cooks .. all of us are something and love something. We associate them with our personalities. Something we want the world to know. Let your Tangle show how cool you are. 
Every Tangle has its own personality by virtue of its design that reflects the personality of the designer/maker and its user.
You can get Tangles in designs that reflects your style, personality and interests. Maybe you might want a Pink Floyd Tangle, maybe a Ferarri Tangle, maybe a Meme Tangle. Show the world what you love. 
pick your designer Tangles from - http://www.makeystreet.com/tangle

Once you have selected your reward, pick your Tangles from http://www.makeystreet.com/tangle. 

If you are looking for a new and innovative way to brand your event/company/business, then use Tangle. Everyone uses some kind of earphones on daily basis. Give your customers a Tangle with your branding on it. We strongly believe Tangle is better branding tool than Tshirts because your customers don't wear your Tshirt everyday, while they are likely to carry your Tangle everywhere with them.
Let your customers show you their love for your brand.
 
The above image is that of the Tangle that we made for a TEDxKids event at Coimbatore, TN, India.

At Makeystreet, we are trying to design a maker revolution. The problem that we are addressing is ""How do makers find and discover parts for the projects that they are working on"". We as makers had a hard time finding parts for the projects that we used to work on. At Makeystreet, we want to make life easier of the maker in you.

Let out the maker in you !! 
We strongly believe that, if we empower more people to be makers, then these makers can go around and solve many challenges and problems in this world, that the  coorporates don't want to. The money that we raise will also go into funding this startup. Help us design a maker revolution.
If choose ""Support Makeystreet"" reward, you will be acknowledged as one of the early supporters of Makeystreet. 

Specifically a lot of the money will go into redesigning the die-punch. We did a die-punch for $200 with which we made the  TEDxKids@rspuram Tangles. Although the audience at TEDxKids@rspuram loved Tangle, we were not happy with the quality of the cut that we made for them. We think the precision of cut can be made better so that the Tangle would look a lot more classy and would feel better. The new die punch is a lot more precision and will last longer. It is expected to cost $2000-3000. The money that you give will go into making the product a lot more finished and top notch.
The rest of the money will go towards building a search engine for maker parts. We want to build a search engine just for makers so that it will become easier for you to make something.
We have tested the Tangle for over 9 months and are happy with its performance. Your money will help us make Tangle more polished and finished. Each of the designs that you submit for Tangle will give the Tangle a personality of its own that reflects its maker and user.

This is our story!
My name is Alex. I am the dude sitting on the right of the picture. On the left of the picture is Arun. Both of us are batchmates from the Department of Engineering Design, IIT Madras. After graduating from IIT in 2012, we decided to take a year off instead of taking a job. We thought we could do better than that ! We wanted to explore what is it that we really want to do.So for exactly one year we have been experimenting.
Both of us have a lot of interest in product design and making 'things'. The products that we have built might not be perfect but one day we will get there. Some of the projects that Arun worked on are


Page Flipper  
MaPaMan

Water saving toilet 

 
Some of the projects that I worked on are


Magic Karpet - Intuitively controlled electric skateboard -
Solar lanterns for kerosene replacement
CNC foam cutter

Instructables link 


One of the things that we noticed is that, all our work has always stayed at the project stage. None of them got to the market. Both of us wanted to build a product that can be taken to the market. So we came us with 'Tangle'. This is our attempt to see if we can build a very simple product, so simple that you can make it at home if you are in so much of a need.
Both of us want to pursue our interests of designing products but the paths that we chose to experiment are different. Arun has decided to pursue a PhD in CMU Robotics Institute, while I decided to pursue entrepreneurship.
In the last one year of our experimental life, one thing we came across is the maker culture. We figured out that there is a community of people who love making stuff, just like we do. As part of my entrepreneurial journey, the company I want to build is for the makers. At makeystreet we are building a search engine for maker parts. One of the problem that we as makers have experienced is that, it is very hard to find and discover parts for what we build. We validated the need with makers around us. The money that we generate from sales of 'Tangle' will go to funding this company.
 
Alex J V (Echo) Co-creator Tangle, Founder Makeystreet alex@makeystreet.com

A lot of really awesome people have attempted solving the problem of tangled earphones before us. Some of them are really cool. The reason why we decided to build a solution ourselves is that we could not find any product easily available that works for earphones that we were comfortable with. So we decided to build a product that is so easy to build that you can hack one yourself at home. Also we noticed that a many of the products that exist in the market are designed for certain specific earphones or is are inbuilt with the  earphones. We wanted to make a solution that works for as many earphones as possible.
While we were at it, we thought why not make it completely customizable so that it can reflect our personality. We are makers and wanted the Tangle to reflect our maker personality so that we will be able to strike a conversation with other makers. Then we realized that everyone would want a Tangle that reflects their personality. And the designer Tangle was born !

<li>
<b>Flights</b> between D.C. and Seattle <b>($670)</b> </li> <li>Amtrak <b>transportation</b> between Seattle and Vancouver <b>($80)</b><br/>
</li> <li>Accommodations at <b>hostels</b> in those cities <b>($90)</b>
</li>
</ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>What You'll Get<br/>
</h3> <p>But I wouldn't expect you to chip in for nothing! With help from several of you, I've brainstormed a few perks that let YOU get creative with your reward:</p><p><b>One-Offs:</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Piggyback Jack ($3)</b> gets you a free ride on my shoulders. I'd use it to get myself carried to the starting line in a World Cup match, except I can't carry myself on my own shoulders...<br/><br/>Or can I?<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>A Literal Shout-Out ($3)</b> gets any words you want said at any volume you want them heard. Want me to proclaim your greatness at a regional tournament? Want Bane to whisper your name in a seeker's ear? Done.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>""Imagine Me &amp; You..."" ($6)</b> gets you a customized photo op with yours truly—even mid-match, if we can pull it off. I'm game.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p><b>Original Work:</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>Bane the Bard ($6-15)</b> taps into my penchant for poetry, commissioning a piece that can be read aloud or kept and treasured. Your choice.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Speech! Speech! ($30-50)</b> brings me on board as a creative consultant and wide-eyed performer for any situation where you require some hype. Teams and spectators from Miami to Valhalla—and the other students in my master's classes at Virginia Tech—can vouch for my work.<br/>
</li>
</ul><p><b>One-on-One Time:</b></p><ul>
<li>
<b>""...and You &amp; Me"" ($30)</b> buys us an afternoon or evening date. So long as it doesn't involve gory movies or my fear of heights, I'm up for anything.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Train with Jack ($50)</b> could be a workout at your gym, a workshop session with your writing, or some practice for you and/or your team on the pitch. My experience is varied, and my time can be yours.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Jack of All Trades ($100)</b> is a pure business transaction—your cash for my sweat. Moving? Landscaping? Chopping firewood? Bring it on.</li>
</ul><p></p><h3>Piggyback Rides for Everyone<br/>
</h3>...and did I mention that <b>THESE PERKS STACK?</b><p></p><p>Any contribution above the <b>$3 tier</b> will get you at least a free perk from that level: piggyback ride or shout-out, it's yours, <i>gratis</i>.</p><p>For buying in at the <b>$30</b> or <b>$50 tier</b>, you can choose one extra perk from either the <b>$3 </b>or <b>$6 tier</b>—so a short form poem or photo op is in play, as well.</p><p>And for funding me at the <b>$100 tier</b>, you'll get your choice of three extra perks from the <b>$3</b>, <b>$6</b>, and/or <b>$15 tiers.</b> Maybe I'll cut your grass, trim your hedges, help you move, then go home and write you a love letter.</p><p>(Maybe you'll want to buy me lunch that day to make sure it's a <i>good</i> letter.)<br/></p><ul></ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Terms &amp; Conditions<br/>
</h3> <p> I'm hoping that fulfilling these perks is going to be as fun as thinking them up. (Except for ""Jack of All Trades,"" which will probably suck. But that's okay!)<br/><br/>With that said, the flip side of these open-ended items is a pair of disclaimers:<br/></p> <ul>
<li>
<b>Expiration:</b> Any perk you purchase is completely transferable and will never expire until it's fulfilled. I'll try my hardest to give everyone their money's worth as soon as possible, by the end of the upcoming quidditch season at the latest...<br/><br/>And if I'm not able to do so, you'll be entitled to a full refund—and I'll <i>still</i> owe you the perk, free of charge. (Like I said, most of them seem fun.)<br/><br/>
</li> <li>
<b>Transportation:</b> Perks that require me to be present will be easier to fulfill in a timely manner within the state of Virginia, and no transportation assistance will be necessary.<br/><br/>Outside of Virginia, I'm willing to travel to any neighboring state (i.e. North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland, or Delaware) with help, or to meet up somewhere. We can work it out.<br/><br/>Beyond that, unfortunately, I'm unable to accept requests for perks—unless they can be fulfilled at a tournament I'll be attending! I hope to attend several regional tournaments and World Cup this season, so don't let geography deter you from buying me.<br/>
</li> </ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>Unconditionally: Thank You!<br/>
</h3>If you're unable to help me fund this trip, I totally understand. (Hell, if funding things was something I could do off-hand without a second thought, I wouldn't be selling myself for three-dollar piggyback rides.)<br/><br/>By linking to this site, you can still do me a no-cost solid toward Burnaby.<br/><br/>And if you <i>did</i> pick a perk, I owe you. Literally. Maybe something strange, maybe something fun, maybe something I would've done for free (sucker!) — and I'll try to be worth it.<br/></div>","""Your money and infrastructure have been important...""[Photos courtesy of Michael E.

Flights between D.C. and Seattle ($670)  Amtrak transportation between Seattle and Vancouver ($80)
 Accommodations at hostels in those cities ($90)

  What You'll Get
 But I wouldn't expect you to chip in for nothing! With help from several of you, I've brainstormed a few perks that let YOU get creative with your reward:One-Offs:

Piggyback Jack ($3) gets you a free ride on my shoulders. I'd use it to get myself carried to the starting line in a World Cup match, except I can't carry myself on my own shoulders...Or can I?


A Literal Shout-Out ($3) gets any words you want said at any volume you want them heard. Want me to proclaim your greatness at a regional tournament? Want Bane to whisper your name in a seeker's ear? Done.


""Imagine Me & You..."" ($6) gets you a customized photo op with yours truly—even mid-match, if we can pull it off. I'm game.

Original Work:

Bane the Bard ($6-15) taps into my penchant for poetry, commissioning a piece that can be read aloud or kept and treasured. Your choice.


Speech! Speech! ($30-50) brings me on board as a creative consultant and wide-eyed performer for any situation where you require some hype. Teams and spectators from Miami to Valhalla—and the other students in my master's classes at Virginia Tech—can vouch for my work.

One-on-One Time:

""...and You & Me"" ($30) buys us an afternoon or evening date. So long as it doesn't involve gory movies or my fear of heights, I'm up for anything.


Train with Jack ($50) could be a workout at your gym, a workshop session with your writing, or some practice for you and/or your team on the pitch. My experience is varied, and my time can be yours.


Jack of All Trades ($100) is a pure business transaction—your cash for my sweat. Moving? Landscaping? Chopping firewood? Bring it on.
Piggyback Rides for Everyone
...and did I mention that THESE PERKS STACK?Any contribution above the $3 tier will get you at least a free perk from that level: piggyback ride or shout-out, it's yours, gratis.For buying in at the $30 or $50 tier, you can choose one extra perk from either the $3 or $6 tier—so a short form poem or photo op is in play, as well.And for funding me at the $100 tier, you'll get your choice of three extra perks from the $3, $6, and/or $15 tiers. Maybe I'll cut your grass, trim your hedges, help you move, then go home and write you a love letter.(Maybe you'll want to buy me lunch that day to make sure it's a good letter.)  Terms & Conditions
  I'm hoping that fulfilling these perks is going to be as fun as thinking them up. (Except for ""Jack of All Trades,"" which will probably suck. But that's okay!)With that said, the flip side of these open-ended items is a pair of disclaimers: 

Expiration: Any perk you purchase is completely transferable and will never expire until it's fulfilled. I'll try my hardest to give everyone their money's worth as soon as possible, by the end of the upcoming quidditch season at the latest...And if I'm not able to do so, you'll be entitled to a full refund—and I'll still owe you the perk, free of charge. (Like I said, most of them seem fun.)
 
Transportation: Perks that require me to be present will be easier to fulfill in a timely manner within the state of Virginia, and no transportation assistance will be necessary.Outside of Virginia, I'm willing to travel to any neighboring state (i.e. North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, Maryland, or Delaware) with help, or to meet up somewhere. We can work it out.Beyond that, unfortunately, I'm unable to accept requests for perks—unless they can be fulfilled at a tournament I'll be attending! I hope to attend several regional tournaments and World Cup this season, so don't let geography deter you from buying me.
   Unconditionally: Thank You!
If you're unable to help me fund this trip, I totally understand. (Hell, if funding things was something I could do off-hand without a second thought, I wouldn't be selling myself for three-dollar piggyback rides.)By linking to this site, you can still do me a no-cost solid toward Burnaby.And if you did pick a perk, I owe you. Literally. Maybe something strange, maybe something fun, maybe something I would've done for free (sucker!) — and I'll try to be worth it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
