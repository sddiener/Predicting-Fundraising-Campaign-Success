<b>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE </b><b>FOUNDATION ?</b>
</h3>The Wearable Artificial Kidney Foundation is an IRS approved Charitable Organization that has been formed for the purpose of both raising awareness to the plight of Dialysis patients and addressing several unmet needs in the treatment of Dialysis patients. The object of its research goals are:<div>
<br/><p>• Improve the quality of life of Dialysis patients and reduce their mortality.</p>
<p>• Provide a clinical solution for treating small children that require chronic Dialysis. Today, many infants and small children cannot receive chronic hemodialysis because their blood volume is too small. The miniaturized size of the WAK<b>™</b> will, for the first time, allow babies to be dialyzed on a chronic basis.</p>
<p>The Foundation will be doing so by <b>funding the neccesary research, including FDA human clinical trials on the Wearable Artificial Kidney, which has already had successful human clinical trials in Italy and the United Kingdom.</b></p>

</div></div>","Zen Honeycutt, Founder of Moms Across America and an international speaker seen on CNN, C-SPAN, and Dr. Oz, spoke to Monsanto’s 800 Shareholders at their headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri in January. With the help of the Organic Consumers Association and John Harrington of Harrington Investments ( a shareholder), Zen was able to represent Harrington at the meeting. Thanks to Zen's impassioned plea, a referendum giving shareholders access proxy to vote on their Board of Directors passed with a 53% ""Yes"" vote! This was an historic meeting in which a mom was able to speak up on behalf of her children – and children around the world – addressing the impact of the toxic chemicals created by Monsanto. [Read or listen to the full account: www.momsacrossamerica.com/blog] Later the same day, The Wall Street Journal, one of the most-trusted financial papers in the world, wrote an article about Monsanto’s Shareholders Meeting. They quoted Zen:Representing – and delivering – our voicesThis campaign will provide the funding to send Zen Honeycutt to the largest chemical companies in the world and speak at their shareholder meetings on behalf of our children, their mothers, and American citizens. Zen's proven ability to speak with her heart – boldly and clearly –  is opening eyes across America to the dangers of toxic herbicides and GMOs. First and foremost, Zen is a concerned mother, which makes her voice that much more authentic, powerful and passionate. Zen's goal is to have every shareholder in the room reconsidering their investment, and the company considering a new direction. If she speaks for a referendum to guide the company in a new direction, she intends to get it passed.
$8000 will cover trips to at least five other companies (such as DOW, Dupont, Syngenta, BASF and Bayer) with a $1500 budget per trip: 

$500 per flight; 


$200 for hotel for 2 nights; 


 $100 for meals; 


$200 for babysitting;

$500 speaker fee (after other costs covered)

Funds needed for buying at one stock share of each company, and

Funds needed for creating binders of scientific studies to present at the meeting. 
Any additional funds will go towards attending  more meetings and support the publication of Zen's upcoming book ""Unstoppable Love,"" the story of her journey for health, freedom and our cause to continue to raise awareness about GMOs.
From Zen's forthcoming book, ""Unstoppable Love"":

are beginning with a basic premise :  being a manager is a major responsibility with a important impact on many lives. The problem is there are a lot of bad ones. This adds up to an enormous, mostly untold, human cost. We want to tell those stories. Life is short and a big part of it is at work or indirectly affected by work.

What do we plan to do with the money?</b></h2></b></b><p>""Rotten Manager"" is a company dedicated to improving the world’s collective work experience by building better managers.</p>
<p>In support of our shared vision, Rotten Manager is designing an application that will act as an employee advocate and neutral facilitator – we call it “MaNudger”.  Whether they are a good manager or a bad manager, MaNudger will gently nudge managers to be a little better with simple bite sized advice powered by anonymous feedback from employees. We can all benefit from a little competition and data driven nudge in the right direction from time to time, but especially Managers.</p>

</div><div><br/></div><div><b><h2><b>COLLECTIVE POWER:</b></h2></b></div><div>We know the chance of raising much money for this type of product idea (hr technology) through crowdfunding is small <b>(but we'd love it if you prove this wrong). Every $1 is a vote for better managers and it say's collectively WE ARE STRONGER THAN YOU, AND WE WON'T PUT UP WITH THIS.</b> We are trying to offer everyone some creative way to get involved and get something back in return. For now a gang people shoving in the right direction would be an awesome way to start this company! </div><div><br/></div><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">

</h4><h4><br/></h4><p>1.
Have you ever had a bad manager? Given some basic ground rules**, will you share your story with us? Hate writing. Start with ""You might be a Rotten Manager if... and just bullet out your thoughts""</p>
<p>2.
If you share our passion for creating better managers, will you share our campaign with your friends and on social media? #rottenmanager</p>
<p>3. Have a little fun with us and contribute to our ability to solve the manager problem at the same time by buying a ""Monumental Manager Memento"" or choosing some other support option we provide. Even $20 helps us know someone cares and helps to build momentum on the campaign.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2><b>If you are a Manager</b></h2><div>You probably know how difficult it is to be a good manager. If you are good, you know your flaws and you inherently want to get better. Maybe you wish you had a simple anonymous feedback device already. Maybe you want to be an early adopter of our ""MaNudger"".</div><div><b><br/></b></div><div>
<h2 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>If you work in Human Resources</b></h2>If you work in HR, we have a prototype numbers driven solution that you can test now and you will get a chance to be the first in the world to have it. Take a look at our workshop + data option. These are great deals we worked up for this campaign.</div><div><br/></div><h2><b>What
we’re offering for your support</b></h2><div>
<p>1. Gratification in being on the forefront to make the world a better place to work.</p>

</div></div>","Say NO to bad managers and YES to good managers with $1 & a tweet. See perks for for more fun or suggest your own.At Rotten Manager, we
are beginning with a basic premise :  being a manager is a major responsibility with a important impact on many lives. The problem is there are a lot of bad ones. This adds up to an enormous, mostly untold, human cost. We want to tell those stories. Life is short and a big part of it is at work or indirectly affected by work. We think helping to create more good managers is a problem worth working on. So we are building a feedback app for managers so they know where they stand relative to other managers, and so they can get better!  We explain this more below.For now, we'll boil the ask down, any money at all you provide is a vote for better managers, and/or a social media shout out would go a long way to help us build momentum. Examples:""You might be a #RottenManager if (insert your thought)"" @ http://igg.me/at/rottenmanager "" or ""My boss (insert name) is NOT A #RottenManager. Support more good managers like her with $1 and a tweet @ http://igg.me/at/rottenmanager""""Bad managers lookout, #RottenManager is coming for you @ http://igg.me/at/rottenmanager ""Feel free to get creative.(We would not suggest you post any specific details about a current manager, however we would be happy to do so for you anonymously : use stories@rottenmanager.com)
Why are we raising money? What do we plan to do with the money?""Rotten Manager"" is a company dedicated to improving the world’s collective work experience by building better managers.
In support of our shared vision, Rotten Manager is designing an application that will act as an employee advocate and neutral facilitator – we call it “MaNudger”.  Whether they are a good manager or a bad manager, MaNudger will gently nudge managers to be a little better with simple bite sized advice powered by anonymous feedback from employees. We can all benefit from a little competition and data driven nudge in the right direction from time to time, but especially Managers.
 
COLLECTIVE POWER:We know the chance of raising much money for this type of product idea (hr technology) through crowdfunding is small (but we'd love it if you prove this wrong). Every $1 is a vote for better managers and it say's collectively WE ARE STRONGER THAN YOU, AND WE WON'T PUT UP WITH THIS. We are trying to offer everyone some creative way to get involved and get something back in return. For now a gang people shoving in the right direction would be an awesome way to start this company! 
Other specific ways you can help:If you've ever had a Manager
We have our own views, but we want your thoughts on what makes a good or bad manager? You might be a Rotten Manager if...
1.
Have you ever had a bad manager? Given some basic ground rules**, will you share your story with us? Hate writing. Start with ""You might be a Rotten Manager if... and just bullet out your thoughts""
2.
If you share our passion for creating better managers, will you share our campaign with your friends and on social media? #rottenmanager
3. Have a little fun with us and contribute to our ability to solve the manager problem at the same time by buying a ""Monumental Manager Memento"" or choosing some other support option we provide. Even $20 helps us know someone cares and helps to build momentum on the campaign.If you are a ManagerYou probably know how difficult it is to be a good manager. If you are good, you know your flaws and you inherently want to get better. Maybe you wish you had a simple anonymous feedback device already. Maybe you want to be an early adopter of our ""MaNudger"".
If you work in Human ResourcesIf you work in HR, we have a prototype numbers driven solution that you can test now and you will get a chance to be the first in the world to have it. Take a look at our workshop + data option. These are great deals we worked up for this campaign.What
we’re offering for your support
1. Gratification in being on the forefront to make the world a better place to work.
2. Some really fun tokens of manager appreciation / depreciation that you can do with as you please. Throw them in a drawer, send them to a manager, give them to your children, or to a local neighborhood dog... whatever.
3. If you have a Rotten Manager, or did at one time, relief in knowing people care and you are not alone. 
4. A chance for someone in your organization to win THE WORLD'S WORST or WORLD's BEST BOSS AWARDS*

<p>Hi, My name is Dave Spencer, and I am the founder of the <b>Earthathon Relay</b>.  <br/></p>To be honest, I created the relay as a way to keep myself motivated to run during a time of financial struggle, when I simply could not afford to run in any of the local race events...they were just too expensive. <br/><br/>Not only did creating the relay motivate me to run, but in less than a year the relay has also motivated 1,500 others all around the world to run, walk, hike or jog more frequently.  We need your help to keep this momentum going!!!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Our Goals</h3> <p>We want to motivate and encourage as many people as possible to exercise more frequently. So we are raising funds for Marketing and Business Development.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Branding</b> - Our goal is to make the Earthathon Relay well-known.</li>
<li>
<b>Marketing</b> - Launch new campaigns on social media.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Sponsors</b> - Seek corporate sponsors.</li>
<li>
<b>Charities</b> - Team up with charities to help fundraise for specific causes.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Go Green</b> - Encourage Earthathon runners to clean up our environment, for example, run/walk to work, or pick up trash and recyclables found along the running trails. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440018532/tu3vkg7bx4ym55wjwstg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><ul>
</ul>
<h3>More Perks for Members<br/>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>The relay is <b>FREE</b> to participants. <br/>
</li>
<li>There is also an optional annual Membership. Members get perks.  With adequate funding, members could be offered more perks.  For example a t-shirt, tank-top and/or running medal (see below).</li>
<li>
<b>Apparel</b> - The Earthathon Relay currently offers print on demand apparel, but we'd like to find ways to make them more affordable, or a perk of membership.<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439955999/xkwf4gauaa5zxf6tqt9v.png"" src="""" style=""width: 456.628px; height: 255px;""/></p> <br/><ul><li>
<b>Medals</b> - The Earthathon Relay currently offers ""virtual"" medals, but our goal is to make these ""virtual"" medals ""reality"".  The more medals ordered the better the price, so we'd like to use some of the fundraising dollars to order medals and offer them at an affordable cost to participants, or as a perk of membership.<br/>
</li></ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1439955809/zvcqlht0wgbdpoh5ztac.png"" src="""" style=""width: 454px; height: 454px;""/></p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Impact</h3> <p>Together we can make a big difference in the world around us:</p> <ul> <li>This project is a global relay with the opportunity to have a big impact.  What if we somehow encouraged thousands of people to run/walk to work rather than drive?  Or pick up trash and recyclables along the running trails.  Not only is this an opportunity to start a health and fitness revolution, but we can also help ""green up"" our environment.<br/>
</li> <li>This project started out with a single run and a tweet.  It has grown significantly within its first year.  And all indicators are that it is going to continue to grow as more and more people learn about it.<br/>
</li> <li>Get involved.  Be a leader.  Be a motivator.  Donate your time, your effort, or a few dollars to the project, and together we can make a big difference.  If nothing else, I hope you will at least consider joining the relay and then maybe tell a friend about it.<br/>

Hi, My name is Dave Spencer, and I am the founder of the Earthathon Relay.  To be honest, I created the relay as a way to keep myself motivated to run during a time of financial struggle, when I simply could not afford to run in any of the local race events...they were just too expensive. Not only did creating the relay motivate me to run, but in less than a year the relay has also motivated 1,500 others all around the world to run, walk, hike or jog more frequently.  We need your help to keep this momentum going!!!
  Our Goals We want to motivate and encourage as many people as possible to exercise more frequently. So we are raising funds for Marketing and Business Development.


Branding - Our goal is to make the Earthathon Relay well-known.

Marketing - Launch new campaigns on social media.


Sponsors - Seek corporate sponsors.

Charities - Team up with charities to help fundraise for specific causes.


Go Green - Encourage Earthathon runners to clean up our environment, for example, run/walk to work, or pick up trash and recyclables found along the running trails. 





More Perks for Members


The relay is FREE to participants. 

There is also an optional annual Membership. Members get perks.  With adequate funding, members could be offered more perks.  For example a t-shirt, tank-top and/or running medal (see below).

Apparel - The Earthathon Relay currently offers print on demand apparel, but we'd like to find ways to make them more affordable, or a perk of membership.


 
Medals - The Earthathon Relay currently offers ""virtual"" medals, but our goal is to make these ""virtual"" medals ""reality"".  The more medals ordered the better the price, so we'd like to use some of the fundraising dollars to order medals and offer them at an affordable cost to participants, or as a perk of membership.




Our Impact Together we can make a big difference in the world around us:  This project is a global relay with the opportunity to have a big impact.  What if we somehow encouraged thousands of people to run/walk to work rather than drive?  Or pick up trash and recyclables along the running trails.  Not only is this an opportunity to start a health and fitness revolution, but we can also help ""green up"" our environment.
 This project started out with a single run and a tweet.  It has grown significantly within its first year.  And all indicators are that it is going to continue to grow as more and more people learn about it.
 Get involved.  Be a leader.  Be a motivator.  Donate your time, your effort, or a few dollars to the project, and together we can make a big difference.  If nothing else, I hope you will at least consider joining the relay and then maybe tell a friend about it.

</h3><h3><b>Urns of Charaka: The Hope Door to Wellness</b></h3>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Wellness and my own personal journey in this venture..</b></p>
<p>As per the
World Health Organization, Wellness is ""...a state of complete physical,
mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or
infirmity."" Unfortunately, in a world where
we can’t go for a day without contact with chemicals and toxins present in our
food, water, the air we breathe and our surroundings... maintaining wellness
becomes a challenge! And to top it all the great amount of physical, mental and
emotional stress caused by our lifestyle and life choices! </p>
<p>Having lived
most of my life under stress and ailments and never being quite a 100% in my
personal or professional life, I embarked on a personal wellness journey two
years ago. As I started seeing a huge transformation in my own health and
experience of life, it turned into a venture where I realized that everyone
needs and deserves to experience this way of being. For the past one year, the
R&amp;D team of Urns of Charaka (UOCH) has created 100% Natural &amp; Organic Ayurvedic
Products and Programs for Holistic Wellness through Detox, De-stress and
Rejuvenation. We now need your help and<a href=""#68078569"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Click to Continue &gt; by Provider""> funding<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a> with the next stages –
packaging, final testing, setting up the manufacturing unit, working capital
and setting up the E-commerce portal. We would like to thank you with our products
and programs in return for your generosity and contribution!</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Ayurveda
&amp; Wellness</b></p>
<p>Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest
holistic (whole-body) healing systems that originated thousands of years ago in
India. Ayurveda is recognized by the WHO and is one of the most recognized and
widely practiced disciplines of alternative medicine in the world. </p>
<p>It is based on the belief that health and
wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. The
primary focus of Ayurveda is to promote good health, rather than fight disease.
Thus it is not only a comprehensive medical system but also a way of living and
the very concept of ""<i>mind, body and
spirit</i>"" originates from Ayurveda.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Our
Products</b></p>
<p>Our entire product range is <i>100% natural and organic</i>. We have only
used natural/herbal preservatives because artificial preservatives and chemicals
not only mar the essence of the product but also end up doing more harm than
good. The products comprise of the following:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Ayurvedic Herbs &amp; Food
Ingredients</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Herbal Infusions</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>External application Products</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Our
Approach &amp; Programs</b></p>
<p>In Ayurveda, it is the TRIDOSHAS - VATA,
PITTA &amp; KAPHA; their properties, functions, imbalances, vitiations with
respect to MIND-BODY that interpret all normal, abnormal and diseased
conditions. The principle and methods to attain back the balance of TRIDOSHA -
is the underlying principle of treating, managing and healing all conditions of
the body. When the TRIDOSHAS are balanced then the body, mind and soul are in
harmony and we are in a state of wellness. Our products and programs strive to
achieve the same.</p>
<p>We offer programs around: <i>Detox, De-stress &amp; Rejuvenation</i>; that
are the mainstay of Wellness. The 2-5 day programs are holistically designed to
include using our <i>Wellness Products</i> along
with your recommended <i>Ahaar (Nutrition), Dincharya
(Day’s routine)</i> as per your Mind-Body type. 
They will kick-start your way to Wellness and allow you to experience a
healthier &amp; happier state of being. </p>
<p><b><i>Detox
Program (Shodhana)</i></b> - This program is
designed to get rid of unrequired 
by-products, toxins from your system by assessing the Dosh-Dushya
Imbalance. Detox in Ayurveda is not just the Liver-Kidney detox but clearing of
digestive system, blood purification, channel clearing and mind clearing. A
detoxifying regime at regular intervals for even a seemingly healthy individual
is beneficial in maintaining the vitality of the body. <i>The Detox Program packet will include: Detoxification Products, Detox Diet
Chart, Day’s Routine Chart as per your Mind-Body (Dosha) type for the duration
of the program.</i></p>
<p><b><i>De-stress
Program (covered under Rogaghna and Shaman)</i></b>-
It is not the situation but the reaction to a situation that causes stress. And
it is reflected in your physical, mental and emotional being. This program will
address the root causes of your reactions that result into stress. It will
equip you with the calm and balance to handle and manoeuvre when faced with
various stress-inviting situations. Furthermore, our de-stress products can be
readily used whenever you need them to ground and calm you and do away the
damage caused by day to day stress. <i>The
De-stress Program packet will include: De-stressing Products, Diet Chart, Day’s
Routine Chart as per your Mind-Body (Dosha) type for the duration of the
program.</i></p>
<p><b><i>Rejuvenation
Program (Urjaskar-Rasayan</i></b><b>)</b>
- Ahaar digestion forms <i>Rasa</i> and <i>Oja</i> or the vital force of the body is
derived as a result of this process .Oja is central to rejuvenation as it
determines our body’s vitality and immunity. Our Rejuvenation products and
programs will enhance your <span>body’s
resistance to disease, increase vitality and slow down the ageing process. The
combination of internal and external application products will leave you feeling
stronger, healthier and younger externally and internally. <i>The Rejuvenation Program packet will
include: Rejuvenating Products, Diet Chart, Day’s Routine Chart as per your
Mind-Body (Dosha) type for the duration of the program.</i></span></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Testimonials
for our Products and Programs  </b><i>(These products were
crafted in our R&amp;D lab and given to people who volunteered to use them
individually or take one of our programs)</i></p><p><i><br/></i></p>
<p>I started the detox program with much
contemplation but am very pleased with the results. I was surprised to see that
it helped me with my digestive system when I was experiencing irregular bowel
movement and even the laxative was not properly helping. The results of the
detox products were not instant as with any natural product but really amazing
as my bowel movement is now regularized. The products, the diet and the daily
routine recommendations are making me feel lighter and healthier. I believe the
clearing of toxins is also showing on my face as it looks clearer and
brighter.  I felt more energetic after 3
days into the program. And I also feel that the body is fitter... I had been experiencing
some aches in my legs/calves and also shoulders for a while and I am not
feeling much of that after the program. The infusions and the food ingredients
are great tasting unlike most ayurvedic products and I am continuing to have
them even after finishing the program. I also like that the program is holistic
for the entire body inside out. I love the texture of bath products and they
make me feel so light and fresh especially after a long day.  </p>
<p><b><i>--Kriti, 52
years, Female</i></b></p><p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p>I was planning to take some spa time so I
jumped at the Rejuvenation Program. But it turned out to be way more than
that.... After 5 days, I feel stronger and more energetic from inside. I feel
that I have increased stamina to do more. The herbal infusion tasted great with
honey. The face and body products feel quite luxurious in texture and
fragrance. Since the products are completely natural and very unique, it felt
like someone has hand-crafted them for me. </p><p>The results on my face and body were
amazing too. The rejuvenation ubtan was wonderful. Not only did it reduce the size of my pores, it had a great fragrance and a soft texture unlike anything I have used as scrub or ubtan. It leaves the face supple and never dry. It gives a certain glow that people seem to notice. I also get the feeling that it is lightening my dark spots. I can say more over a longer period of use! Since the program was customized as per my body-mind type, I felt
that everything suited me really well... whether it was the face and body
products or those for internal use. I feel refreshed and ready to take on
things I had been postponing!</p>

Wellness and my own personal journey in this venture..
As per the
World Health Organization, Wellness is ""...a state of complete physical,
mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or
infirmity."" Unfortunately, in a world where
we can’t go for a day without contact with chemicals and toxins present in our
food, water, the air we breathe and our surroundings... maintaining wellness
becomes a challenge! And to top it all the great amount of physical, mental and
emotional stress caused by our lifestyle and life choices! 
Having lived
most of my life under stress and ailments and never being quite a 100% in my
personal or professional life, I embarked on a personal wellness journey two
years ago. As I started seeing a huge transformation in my own health and
experience of life, it turned into a venture where I realized that everyone
needs and deserves to experience this way of being. For the past one year, the
R&D team of Urns of Charaka (UOCH) has created 100% Natural & Organic Ayurvedic
Products and Programs for Holistic Wellness through Detox, De-stress and
Rejuvenation. We now need your help and funding with the next stages –
packaging, final testing, setting up the manufacturing unit, working capital
and setting up the E-commerce portal. We would like to thank you with our products
and programs in return for your generosity and contribution!
Ayurveda
& Wellness
Ayurveda is one of the world's oldest
holistic (whole-body) healing systems that originated thousands of years ago in
India. Ayurveda is recognized by the WHO and is one of the most recognized and
widely practiced disciplines of alternative medicine in the world. 
It is based on the belief that health and
wellness depend on a delicate balance between the mind, body, and spirit. The
primary focus of Ayurveda is to promote good health, rather than fight disease.
Thus it is not only a comprehensive medical system but also a way of living and
the very concept of ""mind, body and
spirit"" originates from Ayurveda.
Our
Products
Our entire product range is 100% natural and organic. We have only
used natural/herbal preservatives because artificial preservatives and chemicals
not only mar the essence of the product but also end up doing more harm than
good. The products comprise of the following:
· 
Ayurvedic Herbs & Food
Ingredients
· 
Herbal Infusions
· 
External application Products
Our
Approach & Programs
In Ayurveda, it is the TRIDOSHAS - VATA,
PITTA & KAPHA; their properties, functions, imbalances, vitiations with
respect to MIND-BODY that interpret all normal, abnormal and diseased
conditions. The principle and methods to attain back the balance of TRIDOSHA -
is the underlying principle of treating, managing and healing all conditions of
the body. When the TRIDOSHAS are balanced then the body, mind and soul are in
harmony and we are in a state of wellness. Our products and programs strive to
achieve the same.
We offer programs around: Detox, De-stress & Rejuvenation; that
are the mainstay of Wellness. The 2-5 day programs are holistically designed to
include using our Wellness Products along
with your recommended Ahaar (Nutrition), Dincharya
(Day’s routine) as per your Mind-Body type. 
They will kick-start your way to Wellness and allow you to experience a
healthier & happier state of being. 
Detox
Program (Shodhana) - This program is
designed to get rid of unrequired 
by-products, toxins from your system by assessing the Dosh-Dushya
Imbalance. Detox in Ayurveda is not just the Liver-Kidney detox but clearing of

address the root causes of your reactions that result into stress. It will
equip you with the calm and balance to handle and manoeuvre when faced with
various stress-inviting situations. Furthermore, our de-stress products can be

Testimonials
for our Products and Programs  (These products were
crafted in our R&D lab and given to people who volunteered to use them
individually or take one of our programs)
I started the detox program with much
contemplation but am very pleased with the results. I was surprised to see that
it helped me with my digestive system when I was experiencing irregular bowel
movement and even the laxative was not properly helping. The results of the
detox products were not instant as with any natural product but really amazing
as my bowel movement is now regularized. The products, the diet and the daily
routine recommendations are making me feel lighter and healthier. I believe the
clearing of toxins is also showing on my face as it looks clearer and
brighter.  I felt more energetic after 3
days into the program. And I also feel that the body is fitter... I had been experiencing
some aches in my legs/calves and also shoulders for a while and I am not
feeling much of that after the program. The infusions and the food ingredients
are great tasting unlike most ayurvedic products and I am continuing to have
them even after finishing the program. I also like that the program is holistic
for the entire body inside out. I love the texture of bath products and they
make me feel so light and fresh especially after a long day.  
--Kriti, 52
years, Female
I was planning to take some spa time so I
jumped at the Rejuvenation Program. But it turned out to be way more than
that.... After 5 days, I feel stronger and more energetic from inside. I feel
that I have increased stamina to do more. The herbal infusion tasted great with
honey. The face and body products feel quite luxurious in texture and
fragrance. Since the products are completely natural and very unique, it felt
like someone has hand-crafted them for me. The results on my face and body were
amazing too. The rejuvenation ubtan was wonderful. Not only did it reduce the size of my pores, it had a great fragrance and a soft texture unlike anything I have used as scrub or ubtan. It leaves the face supple and never dry. It gives a certain glow that people seem to notice. I also get the feeling that it is lightening my dark spots. I can say more over a longer period of use! Since the program was customized as per my body-mind type, I felt
that everything suited me really well... whether it was the face and body
products or those for internal use. I feel refreshed and ready to take on
things I had been postponing!
--Monika, 29 years, Female
I have great positive feedback to share for
your products. The De-stress Infusion has excellent aroma... It reminded me of
when it rains after a hot spell. It had a very pleasant after taste. No honey
was required. And yes it is very calming! I also used the foot soak after a tiring day at work. It refreshed me while helping me with the pain and tiredness in my feet. I was ready to go out for dinner with my family in an hour. :)

<h3>The Challenges:</h3>
<div>Children need recurring donations to withstand their treatment during the long periods (years) they fight cancer.<br/><br/>Our main main challenge is getting consistent donations for children every month. <br/><br/>Many people donate one month only and we have to find more people to donate on next months.<br/><br/>This leaves children helpless again.<br/><br/>There are 7,000 new children with cancer each year in Mexico. So this becomes a major challenge because there are thousands of children to help.<br/><br/>

<p>In order to help 25 kids each month we need to raise $3,000 USD.</p>
<div>
<p>All donations will be used to buy and deliver the supplement to kids directly in Mexico City and we will keep you posted with pictures and videos once we donate the supplement.</p>
<p>The more time kids take this supplement and implement all their medical 
treatments as told by the doctors, the better odds of surviving they 
have. <br/><br/>Just as their medical treatments that last for many years,
 the supplement should be given to them at the same time throughout 
months or years so that they have a better chance of surviving during 
their treatments.<br/><br/>With our $3,000 goal, we can help children for 
one month. But as explained before, we need to keep doing this every 
month to really help them.<br/></p>

Besides knowing that you are helping us change the world, you will have some choices on cool rewards as thank yous.There are some challenges that lay ahead of us.  Sourcing our quality ingredients and making sure they always meet our standards will not be easy.  Being able to get through all the tape nessecary to be able to put a non-gmo verified stamp on there, as well as the gluten free stamp is not going to be easy.  There are veggie burgers out there already and have an established name.  However, all these challenges are worth the pay off.  Having the confidence that the burger you are feeding your familiy(that they love eating) meets all your high standards for food is worth it.  Knowing the food you provide causes the least amount of harm possible, might make it taste that much better.  Veg in a Box is looking forward to the challenge of establishing our name and building customer confidence in us so that when you see our name, you know that product meets the standards of great taste, as well as being plant based, soy free, gluten free, and non G.M.O.  Vegalution is the beginning, and you can be a part of it.  You can help change the diet of the world, but it has to taste amazing!  You can make the world you want to see, and make sure it is everything you want it to be for future generations.  Yes, eating a burger can change the world, one delicious plant based bite at a time.  The Vegalution will need funds to grow and accomplish all of its goals, however if you are not able to help with funding but still want to make a difference, please share!  Share our campagian, share our story, just tell someone about our name and help us get the word out.  We need your help to make this happen, and it might be the one person you tell about us that makes all the difference!  Every hundred people, well thats a dollar in change, so lets change the world one bite at a time.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Yes, you might have to get a little creative, but there is <i>always </i>a way. <br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As soon as I found out about the <b><i>Holistic Health Coach Training Program</i></b> offered by the <a href=""http://www.integrativenutrition.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Institute for Integrative Nutrition</a> (IIN), I knew it was for me. ""That's it"", I thought, ""<i>this</i> is what I want to do"". <b><i>Yes</i></b>. I got so excited about the program that I put on Amy Winehouse (don't judge) and danced around the kitchen. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">After calming down a bit and speaking with several IIN graduates, I proceeded to enroll in the program starting in September. I told myself I would find a way to pay for it between now and then because if I really wanted to do it (and I really do), I would find a way to make it happen.</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436674295/sjh86luarvutag9nhtrk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">At first, I was disappointed to learn that IIN does not offer any scholarships to its students. Paying for the program ""out of pocket"" would be a <i>huge </i>stretch for me (ok, let's be honest, totally impossible) after having lived and worked in the land of the devaluating peso, i.e. Argentina, for the last six years. Charging it on my credit card crossed my mind - what the hell, at least I would earn a lot of frequent flyer miles, right? And I could always take out a loan if I absolutely had to (and I will), but considering I still owe money from my undergraduate studies, I would prefer to avoid it at all costs. And then I had an idea! </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>What if I created a crowdfunding campaign to offer my holistic health services to supporters at discounted rates in exchange for their contributions? That way, I could not only pay my tuition but also return my backers' investments in a meaningful way <i>and </i>jumpstart my professional career as a health coach before my classes even begin.</b></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">It just seemed like a win-win-win situation. So here I am, offering you <b>guided meditations</b>, <b>yoga classes</b>, <b>weekend cleanses</b>, <b>1-on-1 holistic health coaching consultations and programs</b>, <b>homemade farm-to-table meals</b> and more in exchange for your support. I am even offering myself up as a <b>personal chef for the weekend</b> to the most financially generous backers (yes, my meat loving friends, you would have to go vegetarian for two days). You can also make a straightforward donation to my campaign without selecting a perk if you so wish. The choice is yours!</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Sometimes things that look like road blocks turn out to be blessings in disguise. So, thank you IIN for not offering scholarships - this is <i>so </i>much better and on so many levels. I have again been reminded that you just have to trust that things always work out the way they are meant to because, well, they always do. That being said, maybe this isn't the final answer to my predicament, but it feels right, so I'm going with it and surrendering myself to this <i>Indiegogo </i>campaign. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Oh, and before anyone gets too excited - this program<i> is</i> based in New York City but is now conducted entirely online and can be completed from just about anywhere, so no, I am not planning to move to NYC.

<p><b>MORE ABOUT HOLISTIC HEALTH COACHING AND <i>IIN</i></b></p>
<p>Some of you may be wondering, ""what exactly does a health coach do anyways?"" Good question.</p>
<p>Health coaches are mentors who work with clients to meet their health goal(s) and increase their overall health and happiness by addressing <i>all </i>aspects of wellness, including diet, exercise, relationships, career, spirituality and more. Rather than simply treating symptoms as Western doctors often do, health coaches challenge their clients to dig deeper and tap into their inner wisdom in order to a) identify the <i>root cause</i> of the health issue in question and b) make real, lasting changes.</p>
<p>I have realized through my own healing journey that <b>we all intuitively know what it is we need to heal </b>- it's a matter of learning how to access this information. There are of course many practices which aid us in uncovering this sacred knowledge we carry inside, many of which I have experimented over the years, but I have found health coaching to be a particularly effective method. </p>

<p>I thought for years that I was eating and living in a ""healthy"" way, but the truth is that there is no one way that works for everyone. My personal experience working with health coach Stefanie Kleinburd of <a href=""http://luzfemenina.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Luz Femenina</a> helped me to look inside and re-evaluate things. I made several changes to my diet and lifestyle, and I have never felt better and more in tune with who I am. </p>
<p>So, it should come as no surprise that I want to help others find the same kind of healing I have found by becoming a certified health coach myself.

</div></div>","THE CAMPAIGNI am a firm believer that if you truly want something, there is always a way to get it. Yes, you might have to get a little creative, but there is always a way. As soon as I found out about the Holistic Health Coach Training Program offered by the Institute for Integrative Nutrition (IIN), I knew it was for me. ""That's it"", I thought, ""this is what I want to do"". Yes. I got so excited about the program that I put on Amy Winehouse (don't judge) and danced around the kitchen. After calming down a bit and speaking with several IIN graduates, I proceeded to enroll in the program starting in September. I told myself I would find a way to pay for it between now and then because if I really wanted to do it (and I really do), I would find a way to make it happen.At first, I was disappointed to learn that IIN does not offer any scholarships to its students. Paying for the program ""out of pocket"" would be a huge stretch for me (ok, let's be honest, totally impossible) after having lived and worked in the land of the devaluating peso, i.e. Argentina, for the last six years. Charging it on my credit card crossed my mind - what the hell, at least I would earn a lot of frequent flyer miles, right? And I could always take out a loan if I absolutely had to (and I will), but considering I still owe money from my undergraduate studies, I would prefer to avoid it at all costs. And then I had an idea! What if I created a crowdfunding campaign to offer my holistic health services to supporters at discounted rates in exchange for their contributions? That way, I could not only pay my tuition but also return my backers' investments in a meaningful way and jumpstart my professional career as a health coach before my classes even begin.It just seemed like a win-win-win situation. So here I am, offering you guided meditations, yoga classes, weekend cleanses, 1-on-1 holistic health coaching consultations and programs, homemade farm-to-table meals and more in exchange for your support. I am even offering myself up as a personal chef for the weekend to the most financially generous backers (yes, my meat loving friends, you would have to go vegetarian for two days). You can also make a straightforward donation to my campaign without selecting a perk if you so wish. The choice is yours!Sometimes things that look like road blocks turn out to be blessings in disguise. So, thank you IIN for not offering scholarships - this is so much better and on so many levels. I have again been reminded that you just have to trust that things always work out the way they are meant to because, well, they always do. That being said, maybe this isn't the final answer to my predicament, but it feels right, so I'm going with it and surrendering myself to this Indiegogo campaign. Oh, and before anyone gets too excited - this program is based in New York City but is now conducted entirely online and can be completed from just about anywhere, so no, I am not planning to move to NYC. Sorry mom![More information about health coaching and the IIN program is included at the bottom of this page, in case you're interested in learning more.]THE PERKS""Perks"" is the name Indiegogo gives to the items mentioned above that I would like to offer to you in exchange for your support. You can find a description and the value of each perk on the right-hand side of your screen. I don't want your contribution to my campaign to simply be an investment in my education; I want it to be an investment in your health, no matter how small. Even if it's just a healing quote or a 10-minute guided meditation, I want you to reward yourself because you deserve it. Go ahead, indulge yourself. Perks can also be given to deserving friends, family members and/or co-workers as gifts. All perks are one hundred percent transferable. And of course, if you have any questions at all, please contact me immediately. I would love to hear from you.
DONATIONS
If you are not looking to take advantage of the perks, you also have the option to make a straightforward monetary donation in the amount of your choosing. Perks can also be combined with donations.

Spread the word. Share my campaign with others and/or keep me in mind in the future if you cross paths with someone who could benefit from health coaching and other holistic health services, such as yoga and meditation. 



Send love. Share a little piece of your heart with me. It is more than enough, I promise.

It is a versatile product which will keep you hydrated, visible and connected. No matter where you are, this bottle is here to help you with your city life and adventures in the wild. Bright H2O bottle is designed with the single most important goal of cyclist safety. Every day, on an average, there are two bicycle related accidents. Similar stats threaten the safety of pedestrians, hikers, joggers, wheel-chaired and segways. Over a third of these accidents are caused by cyclists being stuck by a car during dark (un)lighted conditions. As cyclists ourselves, we have always taken these risks very seriously. While designing Bright H2O, we also strongly thought about including the cell phone alerts. During long bicycle rides, we must either stay disconnected or make stops to check our phones. Taking your hands off the handle bar or being distracted with the notifications can be dangerous. We decided to come up a distinctive way to make cycling a safe and enjoyable experience without.  While thinking of ways to make cycling safe, we focused on modernizing familiar devices involved during a bicycle ride. Everyone always carries a water bottle when going for a ride or commuting on a bicycle. Transforming the water bottle to increase visibility seemed like the most obvious choice. Today, we are glad to introduce you to our latest product called Bright H2O Bottle, world’s first smart illuminated water bottle which keeps you visible to the traffic and stay connected.With Bright H2O’s ability to set custom notifications, you can be caught up on your phone alerts and directional navigation with a quick glance at your water bottle. When riding during poor visibility hours like dusk, dawn or night, it is extremely difficult to judge if the traffic has noticed you. Bright-H2O has a special brightness intensity to make you visible whether you are in traffic during a bright sunny day or a dark-quiet neighborhood street.

<h3>It is Essential</h3>
<p>I am Emily Byrd and my mission in life is to <i>empower</i> and <i>inspire</i> others. I do this most powerfully through teaching yoga. This incredible practice has been transformative to my life, healing my body physically, building strength, flexibility, creating so much space that I can feel makes a difference; offering a deeper connection with my mind, body and spirit, healing my heart, awakening my passion and igniting my inner True North Star. At my Level Two Baptiste teacher training this past October, I listened very intently and heard the message: <strong>""This is your work.""</strong> Teaching, Leading, Sharing this incredible practice is what I am meant to do in my life, this is my absolute truth.</p>
<p>The time is <u>NOW</u> to elevate our community, to have a physical place that is our vibrant home - where we are all committed to be <i>in the work</i> supporting each other in our parallel journeys. A <strong>home</strong> where we have <strong>transformative practices</strong>, <strong>build community</strong>, <strong>host programs</strong>, <strong>workshops</strong> and <strong>trainings</strong> that <strong><i>uplift</i></strong>, <i><strong>empower</strong></i> and provide catalyst for <i><strong>change</strong></i>, <strong><i>in lives</i> and <i>the</i><span> </span><i>world</i>.</strong> </p>
<p>I am opening a studio to create this space of <strong>transformation</strong> and <strong>connection</strong> and I need your help. As I am funding this on my own, there are a few crucial parts to our studio that we <i>must</i> have to operate in our fullest potential. The magnitude of your contribution will help us offer a safe, beautiful, energy-efficient space with infrared heat; facilitating a huge impact and change in the bodies, minds, heart and lives of all those who practice at Community Power Yoga.</p>

<p><i><strong>What is Infrared Heat and Why is it Important?</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>​</strong>Infrared Heat <strong>HEATS</strong> <strong>OBJECTS</strong>, rather than heating the air; just as the sun heats the Earth and everything on it, this is exactly how Infrared Heating systems work! Forced air systems, baseboards, space heaters, etc. heat the air, and this heat can be lost in drafts, gusts, and in colder weather months, thus requiring the need to be replaced more often than heat that is created by Infrared Heating systems, which use medium to long FIR (Far Infrared energy) to heat objects.</li>
<li>
<strong>ENERGY EFFICIENT</strong>: this technology <i>saves so much on energy costs</i> (nearly 40%-60%) to the studio, as well as <i>the</i> <i>environment!</i>
</li>
<li>
<strong>BENEFITS</strong> <strong>to the</strong> <strong>BODY</strong>:<ul>
<li>
<strong>SWEAT</strong> out the toxins!</li>
<li>
<strong>LOSE WEIGHT</strong> - by practicing Power Yoga, with this high tech heat source, you will increase your metabolism and burn fat (..in addition to shedding EMOTIONAL baggage!)</li>
<li>
<strong>REJUVENATE</strong> the <i>skin</i>, <i>muscles</i> and <i>bones</i>, resulting in a <i>relaxed</i>, <i>energetic,</i> <i>renewed</i> <i>body</i> after each time you practice!</li>
<li><strong>IMPROVED &amp; INCREASED BLOOD CIRCULATION</strong></li>
<li>
<strong>Increased</strong> <strong>FLEXIBILITY</strong> - Warm muscles are <i>3x more able!</i>

<p>There are many toss games out there and of course the most popular are beer pong and corn hole.  While playing these games at a party with a basketball game on tv, the light bulb turned on and Giant Pong came about.  So what is Giant Pong?</p>
<p>Giant Pong consists of 2 buckets and a regular size basketball.  Using a regular size basketball was the most important part of this game for me because it gives the player the same feel as shooting into a regular basketball hoop.  Also, the buckets are approximately the same diameter as a regulation hoop.</p>
<p>So how do you play Giant Pong?  First you fill the buckets with water.  Then set the buckets 13 feet apart.  There are 2 players on each side.  Players shoot from behind the bucket and score 2 points if it makes it in the opposite bucket.  If a player's shot comes off the rim, the defense scores 1 point if they catch the ball before it touches the ground.  And if you tip and spill the bucket, you automatically lose!</p>
<p>So in order for us to bring Giant Pong to you, we need your help.  Our manufacturer is ready to go once we are successfully funded.  So please checkout our perks and be part of the Giant Pong success!  Thank you so much for your support!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Millions of people young and old are battling the daily challenge to swallow a pill. Our grandparents, our young children become stressed and upset. Just the thought of taking a pill is stressful. Because of these challenges, many people choose not to take medication when needed. This poses health problems on top of health problems. PACE has the cure to bring peace of mind and happiness to taking medication.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>My experience with the Solves electrolyte strips has been completely positive. For the most part, I find that I get similar benefits as with drinking a Gatorade, but faster, without the unneeded sugar, and at a fraction of the cost. If I feel that I need a boost when exercising (or even just when feeling groggy at work), I'll take a strip and fairly quickly feel more energized and less dehydrated. Doing the same with Gatorade<br/>would be much harder on my wallet and waistline. </i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>I've also found the strips very useful if I ever have a headache from having one too many the night before. A couple of strips and a big glass of water and I quickly start to feel better and ready to get on with my day.</i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>I went through my initial order quite quickly (partly from giving away packs to friends who loved them) and happily ordered more.

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Between doing hot yoga regularly and not eating the best diet some days I end up with severe cramps in my feet and lower legs to the point that I cannot stand. Within 3 minutes of taking the Solves electrolyte strip the cramps are completely gone. Before the strips I would take ibuprofen that was largely ineffective and it would take hours for the pain to subside. I now keep the Solves Electrolyte strips at the bedside for when the cramps hit in the middle of the night. This brings me to another major bonus of the strips, you do not need a large glass of water to take the strips. Place them on your tongue and within minutes relief. With other electrolyte products  I have to stir for a few minutes to dissolve the crystals or wait for the tablet to dissolve. Finally, the Solves Strips taste great! </strong></i></p>

<p><strong>What is an OTF strip?</strong></p>
<p>Call it what you want; dissolvable strips, film strips, oral strips, medical strips, but the technical term is Oral Thin Film strips (OTF). OTF strips have been around for 15 years, however, it wasn't until recently that they advanced enough to be able to hold higher amounts of medical ingredients to be useful. OTF's are small, thin strips containing medical and/or nutraceutical ingredients. An OTF can be placed on the tongue or inside the cheek, where it dissolves within seconds. Once dissolved, it is absorbed into the oral mucosa of the cheek, which contains rich layers of cells and blood vessels. This area can pull the molecules of active ingredients into the bloodstream and throughout your body.</p>
<p><strong>What's special about OTF?</strong></p>
<p>What makes an OTF strip so incredible is the way the active ingredient is absorbed into the body. It is absorbed primarily through the Oral Mucosa and more specifically the Buccal Mucosa which is the rich layer of cells and blood vessels in the cheeks. This area along with the sublingual area, which is the major salivary glands, can pull the molecules of the active ingredient into the blood stream incredibly fast. This results in much quicker absorption and ultimately creates a faster reaction. What this means for patients taking an OTF strip is the potential of relieving symptoms faster than a pill or liquid and in most cases without upsetting the stomach or Gastro Intestinal tract (GI-tract).</p>
<p><strong>Why is an OTF strip more ideal than a pill or liquid?</strong></p>
<p>The answer is simple – it dissolves quickly, it tastes better, and it’s far easier to take than choking down a pill. </p>
<p><strong>What are Solves Strips®?</strong></p>
<p>Solves Strips® are the evolution of wellness within the pharmaceutical and nutraceutical industry. Solves Strips® are OTF strips, that dissolve quickly, taste great, and are easy to take. Therefore eliminating the need for pills or liquid medications. Contact our Solves Service Team to learn more about Solves Strips®.</p>
<p><strong>Why take Solves Strips® over other strips on the market?</strong></p>
<p>Solves Strips® have taken OTF strip technology to the next level, benefiting individuals, their families, and medical practitioners alike. Solves Strips® technology has surpassed the competition with the ability to place medical and nutraceutical ingredients of various sizes and still have plenty of “room” left to include fun, delicious flavors. In other words, Solves Strips® are designed for maximum effectiveness and taste better than pills or other strips while being compact, and quick dissolving. This makes Solves Strips® great for children, elderly, and basically everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Where can I get Solves Strips®?</strong></p>
<p>You're already closer than you think – you will soon be able to buy them right off Solves website. Just click on the Buy Now tab in the navigation link to discover products that are coming soon, and find a location near you.</p>
<p><strong>Where can you take Solves Strips®?</strong></p>
<p>Be it home, the office, school, the gym, you can use strips anywhere, anytime. Solves Strips® were created to make taking medicine and supplements easy, especially for those who hate swallowing pills and liquid medicines.</p>
<p><strong>How do you take Solves Strips®?</strong></p>
<p>Just place it on the inside of your cheek, or on the tongue and let the strip dissolve -It's just that easy. Don't worry it tastes great!</p>
<p><strong>Do Solves Strips® taste like medicine?</strong></p>
<p>Bleh. No, that is the beauty of Solves Strips®. While most medicines produce a bitter taste, with Solves Strips® technology you only get delicious, great tasting flavor. We wouldn't want to take it either if it tasted like medicine. </p>
<p><strong>Who can take Solves Strips®?</strong><br/>Solves Strips® are specifically designed to allow anyone from ages 2 to 104 the ability to take their doctor advised medications and supplements, comfortably. This includes children, elderly, adults, athletes, health care practitioners, individuals who struggle with swallowing or choking disorders and everyone else!</p>
<p><strong>Are Solves Strips® ideal for Dysphagiac patients?</strong></p>
<p>There is a large population of individuals who have life-altering difficulty swallowing, and for those, the idea of a pill that could potentially get stuck in your throat is daunting. This condition known as Dysphagia affects over 20% of all people and even more so in the aging population. Truth be told, the number of people that just don’t like swallowing pills is unmeasurable so pharmaceutical companies have various ways to get medicine into the body. Pills, liquids, injections, IV fluid, topical creams, slow release patches, are all some of the delivery options. Nothing has really been as convenient as a pill or liquid until now.</p>
<p><strong>Who should take Electrolytes?</strong></p>
<p>Those who especially benefit from Electrolyte restoration include: -Seniors, who are generally more susceptible to dehydration than healthy adults and are often reluctant to drink much water because going to the bathroom is difficult. -People taking prescription drugs or supplements that list dry mouth or dehydration as a side effect. -People with chronic GI conditions who have trouble absorbing or retaining fluids. -Children, who are more susceptible to dehydration, especially if they experience vomiting, diarrhea, or excessive sweating caused by heat, fever, or exertion. -Athletes to use before, during or after a workout.</p>

 wants to help people with a vastly improved alternative to pills and liquid medications, on an Oral Thin-Film (OTF) platform. This is a small, thin strip that sticks on your tongue or inside your cheek, and dissolves, releasing ingredients into your body.
The failure to swallow pills is a common and important barrier to medication administration for children and their parents.  20 to 40 percent of children are unable to and 40 percent of American adults have difficulty swallowing a standard size pill. As a result, nearly 10 percent will stop taking medications earlier than prescribed.
Over 140 million Americans suffer from pill fatigue 
and now together we can change that!
GET INVOLVED - GET REWARDED
 







 

We've met with all the major retailers and they all love our electrolyte product but want it to taste sweeter rather than salty for more general use.  In fact, they liked the idea so much they asked for more types of products,
 ""Build us a whole line"".
So that's what we are doing, 
and
that's where YOU can help.
 

 


 
In short,  Solves Strips®  is changing the way people take medication, making the experience easier, taste better, and more pleasant.  No more getting pills stuck in your throat, or needing a glass of water to swallow, or tilting your head back rapidly to help slide them down. 

Millions of people young and old are battling the daily challenge to swallow a pill. Our grandparents, our young children become stressed and upset. Just the thought of taking a pill is stressful. Because of these challenges, many people choose not to take medication when needed. This poses health problems on top of health problems. PACE has the cure to bring peace of mind and happiness to taking medication.

We already have a product online for kids called 
Solves Strips® Pediatric Electrolyte.  www.solvesstrips.com. 
When kids get sick they throw up easily losing fluids and electrolytes.  We consulted with Doctors for the right amount of electrolytes to use during these frustrating times for parents. This strip has a larger dose of sodium and potassium, making it salty, and was designed to get electrolytes back into their system so they can then sip water without sugary drinks that might make them throw up again.

My experience with the Solves electrolyte strips has been completely positive. For the most part, I find that I get similar benefits as with drinking a Gatorade, but faster, without the unneeded sugar, and at a fraction of the cost. If I feel that I need a boost when exercising (or even just when feeling groggy at work), I'll take a strip and fairly quickly feel more energized and less dehydrated. Doing the same with Gatoradewould be much harder on my wallet and waistline. 
I've also found the strips very useful if I ever have a headache from having one too many the night before. A couple of strips and a big glass of water and I quickly start to feel better and ready to get on with my day.
I went through my initial order quite quickly (partly from giving away packs to friends who loved them) and happily ordered more. Especially at the bulk pricing it was very inexpensive and worth it for me.Marcus Rocque

Between doing hot yoga regularly and not eating the best diet some days I end up with severe cramps in my feet and lower legs to the point that I cannot stand. Within 3 minutes of taking the Solves electrolyte strip the cramps are completely gone. Before the strips I would take ibuprofen that was largely ineffective and it would take hours for the pain to subside. I now keep the Solves Electrolyte strips at the bedside for when the cramps hit in the middle of the night. This brings me to another major bonus of the strips, you do not need a large glass of water to take the strips. Place them on your tongue and within minutes relief. With other electrolyte products  I have to stir for a few minutes to dissolve the crystals or wait for the tablet to dissolve. Finally, the Solves Strips taste great!

""My 6 year old son was sick with a flu and so I gave him the Solves Strips pediatric electrolyte. It dissolved quickly, and he even gave me a thumbs up.""

Having my Solve Strips is equally as important as having my Nikes! With as much; weights, kickboxing, soccer and spin I do I need to keep hydrated and keep my electrolytes up! Also being a bikini competitor I love that these little strips are only 15g sodium where sports drinks are anywhere from 250-400g sodium!

""These new and easy to use strips dissolve quickly, taste great and contain no sugar or carbs. I love how portable they are and easy to carry in your bag!  Whenever my son is sick and I am worried about him being dehydrated I use the strips instead of the drinks he hates. No more complaints! ""Angela van Tijn, OneSmileyMonkey.com

""New Pediatric Electrolyte Strips from Solves Strips are the easiest way to get kids to take their medicine! They’re portable, taste great, and dissolve quickly, so they’re ideal for kids who don’t like taking pills (that’s pretty much all of them, right?)"" Olivia Lasting, This West Coast Mommy

""Sometimes, life can be difficult, but everything is made better by all the cool new inventions on the market that make things quick and easy for us. One of those such inventions really HAS to be Solves Strips! A small, thin film that you stick directly on your tongue, Solves Strips makes taking medications THAT much easier! Simply pop one in your mouth, and quickly take your medications without all the icky bitter tastes!"" Christina Anthis, The HippyHomemaker

What is an OTF strip?
Call it what you want; dissolvable strips, film strips, oral strips, medical strips, but the technical term is Oral Thin Film strips (OTF). OTF strips have been around for 15 years, however, it wasn't until recently that they advanced enough to be able to hold higher amounts of medical ingredients to be useful. OTF's are small, thin strips containing medical and/or nutraceutical ingredients. An OTF can be placed on the tongue or inside the cheek, where it dissolves within seconds. Once dissolved, it is absorbed into the oral mucosa of the cheek, which contains rich layers of cells and blood vessels. This area can pull the molecules of active ingredients into the bloodstream and throughout your body.
What's special about OTF?
What makes an OTF strip so incredible is the way the active ingredient is absorbed into the body. It is absorbed primarily through the Oral Mucosa and more specifically the Buccal Mucosa which is the rich layer of cells and blood vessels in the cheeks. This area along with the sublingual area, which is the major salivary glands, can pull the molecules of the active ingredient into the blood stream incredibly fast. This results in much quicker absorption and ultimately creates a faster reaction. What this means for patients taking an OTF strip is the potential of relieving symptoms faster than a pill or liquid and in most cases without upsetting the stomach or Gastro Intestinal tract (GI-tract).

It offers sleep monitoring -- a good night of sleep is so important for kids!, an alarm, the time, date, and temperature. You can even review the accumulated data and set the display through your computer or app, which includes a personalized signature function for formatting it just the way your child likes! It comes with an adjustable two-toned band that is 259mm in length. We offer 9 colors, enough for every child in the family to have their own! 
One for the adults, too!We haven't revolutionized the fitness tracker -- we save that work for maternity care -- but we have brought one to you at a great price!  Our basic tracker is iOS 7.0 and Android 4.3 compatible with USB charging and some great features. It has step and distance measurement, calorie and sleep management, time display, event and call reminders, sedentary alerts, an alarm, and much more. And there are 5 bright colors available for you to choose from. Keeping track while on the goWant something that is truly multi-function? Then our smart watches are for you! This has SO many features. You're going to love it!Our smart watch has Bluetooth capability, an HD display, touch screen, two-way anti lost (find your phone OR your watch!) You can sync it with social media, play MP3/MP4, take pictures with the camera and self-timer. It also has a compass and the features of a fitness tracker. Choose from one of three stylish colors. 
Fun for the whole family!Fitness is best when it's a family affair. That's why we offer the family pack with 2 kids trackers, an adult fitness tracker, and a smart watch. There is something for everyone!

<p style=""text-align: left;"">It then sends that information to a specially developed smartphone app - and the app informs you how much liquid you have left in your hydration pack. It's just like viewing an electronic fuel gauge.<span><br/></span></p>

<h3>Hydrate Mate: The Answer to an age old problem:</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The question: How can I tell how much I have drunk from my hydration pack and how much I liquid I have left (without having to stop and take my pack off?)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The debate between which is better, ""handhelds"" or ""hydration packs"", has raged for centuries (according to our research it dates back to 23 AD with the works of the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder...unless our Latin is not quite as strong as we like to think!)</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>It is widely agreed that hydration packs are far more comfortable and can hold more liquid more easily than bottles, but that they have one major draw back. You cannot tell how much liquid you are drinking, nor how much you have left.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This is a real problem for many reasons:</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(a) There is the danger issue: If you are out in the middle of nowhere without easy access to more water - you need to be sure to drink enough to sustain you but not so much that you run out with miles still to go.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(b) There is the efficiency issue: If you are in a race and have a check point coming up soon, why carry loads of excess water when you can drink it and refill shortly?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(c) There is the maximising training and performance issue: If you know how much you are drinking from your pack, you can maximise both your training and your performance.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>(d) There is the anxiety issue: the constant worry of whether you are drinking enough or too much, can you have more now or should you be conserving?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Hydrate Mate is the solution. </div>
<div><br/></div>

<h3>How Will You Hydrate Mate?</h3>
<br/>
</div></div>","Award Winning Gadget Keeps Sports Enthusiasts Perfectly Hydrated
The world’s first electronic fuel gauge and app for hydration bladders -  monitor and maintain hydration levels on the move
Simply put, Hydrate Mate is a device which connects to your hydration bladder and monitors how much liquid you are drinking and how much you have left. 
It then sends that information to a specially developed smartphone app - and the app informs you how much liquid you have left in your hydration pack. It's just like viewing an electronic fuel gauge.
The app also keeps track and monitors the amount of liquid you are drinking.







Hydrate Mate: The Answer to an age old problem:

The question: How can I tell how much I have drunk from my hydration pack and how much I liquid I have left (without having to stop and take my pack off?)

The debate between which is better, ""handhelds"" or ""hydration packs"", has raged for centuries (according to our research it dates back to 23 AD with the works of the Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder...unless our Latin is not quite as strong as we like to think!)

It is widely agreed that hydration packs are far more comfortable and can hold more liquid more easily than bottles, but that they have one major draw back. You cannot tell how much liquid you are drinking, nor how much you have left.

This is a real problem for many reasons:

(a) There is the danger issue: If you are out in the middle of nowhere without easy access to more water - you need to be sure to drink enough to sustain you but not so much that you run out with miles still to go.

(b) There is the efficiency issue: If you are in a race and have a check point coming up soon, why carry loads of excess water when you can drink it and refill shortly?

(c) There is the maximising training and performance issue: If you know how much you are drinking from your pack, you can maximise both your training and your performance.

(d) There is the anxiety issue: the constant worry of whether you are drinking enough or too much, can you have more now or should you be conserving?

Hydrate Mate is the solution.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As passionate rope jumpers ourselves, we've found that rope bags have generally been an afterthought. So, we decided to do something about it and have created a bag specifically designed for jump ropes. We wanted it to hold all our ropes, plus the other items we use (gloves etc.), and we wanted to be able to use it for all ropes, regardless of whether they have detachable handles or not.</p>
<p>This campaign will help get our first production run completed, and enable us to provide more colours (if you'd like them), and also expand our range of Go Gear and Go Jump products. We're starting with a 2-Rope bag and a 4-Rope bag, both in grey or yellow.</p>
<p>We genuinely believe that jump rope is the best all-round exercise that you can do. We hope that by making it easier for you to keep your ropes organised, take them with you, and keep them protected, more people will take up this awesome activity, and get more out of life -- as it has done for us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have selected a small manufacturer in Thailand who is able to produce a great product, and treats their employees well. This makes production cost slightly higher than other manufacturing countries, but we'd much rather have a great product and make sure our supply chain is fair, than get the cheapest product possible. We have travelled to Thailand (and will continue to do so on a regular basis) to meet our supply chain team and make sure that we can produce a top quality product, that treats all members fairly (including you, the customer!)</p>
<p>We need more than $5,000 USD to get us started and get the economies of scale for us to produce high quality bags at fair prices. That's why we have offered a huge number of discounted perks to get as many bags into the jump rope community as possible. Over 200 bags are being heavily discounted, so get in quickly before the best deals are gone. Please be aware that there will be $10 USD added to your perk for shipping from Thailand, unless you've managed to get in early and chosen the free shipping perk of your choice. Also, please be aware that ropes are <u>not</u> included.</p>
<p>While we are extremely confident that we'll reach our target, if we don't, we'll still produce the bags that have been ordered through this campaign, but we won't produce more than those orders. That means that you can have confidence that you <u>will</u> receive your Go Jump Rope Bag, even if we don't meet our target. Unfortunately, it will also mean that only those who have ordered will get the opportunity to use this amazing bag.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As fellow rope jumpers, we know how much of a positive impact jumping rope can have on your health and well-being. We want to make it easy for you to store your ropes in an organised way, make them easy to travel around with, and keep them protected.</p>
<p>If we can help people like you to better manage your ropes, we're sure we can get more people jumping and grow this amazing, supportive community.</p>
<p>We can't wait to show you our new Go Jump Rope Bag and we think you'll be just as happy as we are with them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with all new projects, there are some risks that we need to be aware of, and we've put measures in place to reduce these risks.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Product Delays - </strong>As we are using a small manufacturer (to ensure fairness and quality), there is a risk that the shipping date may change. We'll be keeping you informed about the progress of the manufacturing and expected shipping dates as we proceed. Our manufacturer has given us a provisional completion time of 2 months from placement of order, so with our 1 month campaign and 2 month manufacturing time, we expect that you'll have your bag in about 3 months. If we get to our target earlier than expected, we'll place the order earlier, and let you know when that happens.</li>
<li>
<strong>Product Quality (pre-delivery) -</strong> We have had multiple companies produce samples for us, and we have selected a manufacturer that understands what we need in our products. We have a very good relationship with our manufacturer and have been working closely to ensure that the bags are produced to a very high quality standard. We will also be travelling to Thailand to inspect and make sure that the products meet this high standard. As well as our own inspection, we have engaged a third party to inspect every bag before it is shipped, as the third and final quality check, before you open your package at home. </li>
<li>
<strong>Product Quality (post-delivery) - </strong>While we have established a rigorous quality control process above, we understand that at some point, a defective item might slip through. That's why we offer a 12 month warranty on all materials and manufacturing, so you can feel confident that our products will go the distance. If your bag is defective, we'll fix it or replace it at no charge to you. We also offer a 12-month satisfaction guarantee, so if you're not happy with your Go Jump Rope Bag, return it to us, and we'll refund you the purchase price of the bag.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shipping - </strong>Because our bags are produced in Thailand, we'll be shipping them from there too. This way, we can keep costs down by avoiding import duties and taxes in most countries. This does mean however, that shipping could take from 7-10 days from order. You will receive a tracking number for your order, so that you can keep up-to-date on your package's location, but we won't be able to offer 2-day shipping. We'll also be keeping a close eye on shipping times and will change the shipping company if it is not up to standard. </li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Do you know a rope jumper who might be interested in our bag? Make sure to share this campaign with them so they can enjoy the benefits of our tailor-made jump rope bag. Just use the share tools above to share the jump rope love!</p>

This makes production cost slightly higher than other manufacturing countries, but we'd much rather have a great product and make sure our supply chain is fair, than get the cheapest product possible. We have travelled to Thailand (and will continue to do so on a regular basis) to meet our supply chain team and make sure that we can produce a top quality product, that treats all members fairly (including you, the customer!)
We need more than $5,000 USD to get us started and get the economies of scale for us to produce high quality bags at fair prices. That's why we have offered a huge number of discounted perks to get as many bags into the jump rope community as possible. Over 200 bags are being heavily discounted, so get in quickly before the best deals are gone. Please be aware that there will be $10 USD added to your perk for shipping from Thailand, unless you've managed to get in early and chosen the free shipping perk of your choice. Also, please be aware that ropes are not included.
While we are extremely confident that we'll reach our target, if we don't, we'll still produce the bags that have been ordered through this campaign, but we won't produce more than those orders. That means that you can have confidence that you will receive your Go Jump Rope Bag, even if we don't meet our target. Unfortunately, it will also mean that only those who have ordered will get the opportunity to use this amazing bag.

The Impact
As fellow rope jumpers, we know how much of a positive impact jumping rope can have on your health and well-being. We want to make it easy for you to store your ropes in an organised way, make them easy to travel around with, and keep them protected.
If we can help people like you to better manage your ropes, we're sure we can get more people jumping and grow this amazing, supportive community.
We can't wait to show you our new Go Jump Rope Bag and we think you'll be just as happy as we are with them.

Risks & Challenges
As with all new projects, there are some risks that we need to be aware of, and we've put measures in place to reduce these risks.


Product Delays - As we are using a small manufacturer (to ensure fairness and quality), there is a risk that the shipping date may change. We'll be keeping you informed about the progress of the manufacturing and expected shipping dates as we proceed. Our manufacturer has given us a provisional completion time of 2 months from placement of order, so with our 1 month campaign and 2 month manufacturing time, we expect that you'll have your bag in about 3 months. If we get to our target earlier than expected, we'll place the order earlier, and let you know when that happens.

Product Quality (pre-delivery) - We have had multiple companies produce samples for us, and we have selected a manufacturer that understands what we need in our products. We have a very good relationship with our manufacturer and have been working closely to ensure that the bags are produced to a very high quality standard. We will also be travelling to Thailand to inspect and make sure that the products meet this high standard. As well as our own inspection, we have engaged a third party to inspect every bag before it is shipped, as the third and final quality check, before you open your package at home. 

Product Quality (post-delivery) - While we have established a rigorous quality control process above, we understand that at some point, a defective item might slip through. That's why we offer a 12 month warranty on all materials and manufacturing, so you can feel confident that our products will go the distance. If your bag is defective, we'll fix it or replace it at no charge to you. We also offer a 12-month satisfaction guarantee, so if you're not happy with your Go Jump Rope Bag, return it to us, and we'll refund you the purchase price of the bag.

Shipping - Because our bags are produced in Thailand, we'll be shipping them from there too. This way, we can keep costs down by avoiding import duties and taxes in most countries. This does mean however, that shipping could take from 7-10 days from order. You will receive a tracking number for your order, so that you can keep up-to-date on your package's location, but we won't be able to offer 2-day shipping. We'll also be keeping a close eye on shipping times and will change the shipping company if it is not up to standard.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Steady Shot™</h2>
<p>Steady Shot is a patented insulin injection aid that makes injecting insulin, rotating injection sites, and injecting while traveling easy and comfortable. Steady Shot was designed to improve the lives of diabetics by making day-to-day life easier and reducing the risk of lipohypertrophy, a condition that can occur when patients inject in the same area for an extended period of time. </p>
<p>Steady Shot makes rotating injection sites easy by stabilizing the needle, allowing for one-handed injections, and control of the injection depth. You simply attach Steady Shot to your insulin pen and perform an injection like normal, but with the added stability and depth control of Steady Shot. Steady Shot attaches to all major insulin pen needles.</p>

<p>My name is Shawn and I am Type I diabetic.</p>
<p>Whenever I eat carbs or my blood sugars are high, I need to inject insulin. Many days I feel like I am eating constantly, which means injecting insulin constantly as well. For 3 years it wasn’t a problem. But when I started to notice pain and bruising in my abdomen and thighs from not rotating injection sites, a condition called lipohypertrophy, I knew something needed to change.</p>
<p>My doctor always told me to rotate injection sites to avoid these problems, but being my stubborn self I didn’t because my arms, back, and butt were much more difficult to reach than my abdomen and thighs. Realizing this pain and bruising was now part of my new reality, I wanted to do something about it. I wasn’t willing to accept lipohypertrophy, so I built a simple guide with a recessed needle that would stabilize the insulin pen for easy one-handed use. Steady Shot was born. After 3D printing a few prototypes for use with my insulin pen, I was finally able to rotate to sites which I previously couldn’t reach and provide relief to my over injected areas. For the first time, I could use my left hand to inject and reach the far left side of my body. I could comfortably inject in my arms, lower back, and butt. After rotating for some time, my bruising started to fade and injections in my abdomen slowly got less painful. Now, I don’t have bruising or pain at all.​</p>
<p>I’ve been using different versions of Steady Shot for over 3 years. My own experience, paired with the feedback of others, has helped me improve the design. Injectors have found Steady Shot easier than traditional injections, felt less pain when injecting, improved dexterity for elderly injectors, have found rotating injection sites easier, and have found injections easier when pregnant or traveling. Untrained caregivers can properly insert the needle at 90 degrees safely into the subcutaneous tissue every time.​</p>
<p>Such a simple little device has drastically changed my life so I created this company to get Steady Shot in the hands of other injectors. 7.3 million Americans inject insulin and 38% have lipohypertrophy. With Steady Shot, it doesn’t have to be this way for the 2.8 million people suffering. While in college, I worked hard with a startup generator at UW-Madison, called Discovery to Product, whom helped fund the commercialization of Steady Shot and provide mentorship. After a long journey, Steady Shot is now available. I’m excited to hear injectors feedback after giving Steady Shot a try. I know Steady Shot will improve others' lives just like it has mine!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Problem: Lipohypertrophy</h2>
</div>
<p>30 million people in the United States have diabetes. 7.3 million inject insulin. 2.8 million of these people have lipohypertrophy. Lipohypertrophy occurs when fatty lumps appear on the surface of the skin in patients who routinely perform insulin injections. </p>
<p>For diabetic patients, lipohypertrophy may be aesthetically displeasing, but it can also affect the rate at which insulin is absorbed and can lead to inconsistent blood glucose results. Blood sugars that are out of a healthy range can cause retinopathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Thank you! I tried my arm by myself for the FIRST time. Incredible. 10/10 LOVE</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I was diagnosed with diabetes a little over a year ago, and haven’t started pumping yet. With this I take a long acting insulin and fast acting insulin before meals. I haven’t been too adventurous when it comes to injection sites. Just my stomach, and I’ve tried my thigh a couple times. If I’m doing any other site, someone else does it for me because I HATE doing injections one handed. My first time trying the steady shot, I did my first EVER shot in my arm by myself, and it was SO easy. I love this product so much already and it really helps promote site rotation for people like me that are stubborn switching from their favorite spot. My tummy can finally have a break!!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Issac</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""That was really good!! No tears, minimum resistance. All around happy with how the injection went. :) One happy mumma and baby bear!! Before when I went to use this type of needle I had to pin Issac (who was 3 at the time) down, literally lock him with my legs and use one arm to hold him down and inject. This was horrible for both me and Issac. I’m very relieved that @mysteadyshot has helped!! Yes he was a bit unsure but he still let me and this is an amazing gold star for us today!! Thank you Steady Shot""</p>

<li>Harder to reach the recommended back of the arm</li>

<li>Difficult to inject at a 90 degree angle</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Under the Arm</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579465850/l5efkscufpuy12p8ur4q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to reach the recommended back of the arm</li>
<li>More likely to inject insulin in subcutaneous tissue, which is recommended by healthcare professionals. </li>
<li>Easy to inject at a recommended 90 degree angle</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why inject in the back of the arm?</strong></h3>
<p>Insulin should be injected in fatty tissue. There is much more fatty tissue in the back of the arm compared to side of the arm. If Steady Shot is injected in the muscle tissue, insulin can absorb too quickly and lead to health complications. </p>

<p>I really like the steady shot, it is so simple and easy to use! I’m going to bring it to show my diabetes educators next time I go in! It has allowed me to use different sites I didn’t feel comfortable using before! I can now use arms on my own without asking others for help! I would absolutely recommend it to a friend. I have gained a lot more useable sites with the steady shot! It’s such a great device that is simple to use! I’ve always liked to pinch my sites and using arms alone not being able to pinch them terrified me! I can now do it on my own with ease!</p>

Steady Shot is a patented insulin injection aid that makes injecting insulin, rotating injection sites, and injecting while traveling easy and comfortable. Steady Shot was designed to improve the lives of diabetics by making day-to-day life easier and reducing the risk of lipohypertrophy, a condition that can occur when patients inject in the same area for an extended period of time. 
Steady Shot makes rotating injection sites easy by stabilizing the needle, allowing for one-handed injections, and control of the injection depth. You simply attach Steady Shot to your insulin pen and perform an injection like normal, but with the added stability and depth control of Steady Shot. Steady Shot attaches to all major insulin pen needles.





 
Our Story

My name is Shawn and I am Type I diabetic.
Whenever I eat carbs or my blood sugars are high, I need to inject insulin. Many days I feel like I am eating constantly, which means injecting insulin constantly as well. For 3 years it wasn’t a problem. But when I started to notice pain and bruising in my abdomen and thighs from not rotating injection sites, a condition called lipohypertrophy, I knew something needed to change.
My doctor always told me to rotate injection sites to avoid these problems, but being my stubborn self I didn’t because my arms, back, and butt were much more difficult to reach than my abdomen and thighs. Realizing this pain and bruising was now part of my new reality, I wanted to do something about it. I wasn’t willing to accept lipohypertrophy, so I built a simple guide with a recessed needle that would stabilize the insulin pen for easy one-handed use. Steady Shot was born. After 3D printing a few prototypes for use with my insulin pen, I was finally able to rotate to sites which I previously couldn’t reach and provide relief to my over injected areas. For the first time, I could use my left hand to inject and reach the far left side of my body. I could comfortably inject in my arms, lower back, and butt. After rotating for some time, my bruising started to fade and injections in my abdomen slowly got less painful. Now, I don’t have bruising or pain at all.​
I’ve been using different versions of Steady Shot for over 3 years. My own experience, paired with the feedback of others, has helped me improve the design. Injectors have found Steady Shot easier than traditional injections, felt less pain when injecting, improved dexterity for elderly injectors, have found rotating injection sites easier, and have found injections easier when pregnant or traveling. Untrained caregivers can properly insert the needle at 90 degrees safely into the subcutaneous tissue every time.​
Such a simple little device has drastically changed my life so I created this company to get Steady Shot in the hands of other injectors. 7.3 million Americans inject insulin and 38% have lipohypertrophy. With Steady Shot, it doesn’t have to be this way for the 2.8 million people suffering. While in college, I worked hard with a startup generator at UW-Madison, called Discovery to Product, whom helped fund the commercialization of Steady Shot and provide mentorship. After a long journey, Steady Shot is now available. I’m excited to hear injectors feedback after giving Steady Shot a try. I know Steady Shot will improve others' lives just like it has mine!
 
The Problem: Lipohypertrophy

30 million people in the United States have diabetes. 7.3 million inject insulin. 2.8 million of these people have lipohypertrophy. Lipohypertrophy occurs when fatty lumps appear on the surface of the skin in patients who routinely perform insulin injections. 
For diabetic patients, lipohypertrophy may be aesthetically displeasing, but it can also affect the rate at which insulin is absorbed and can lead to inconsistent blood glucose results. Blood sugars that are out of a healthy range can cause retinopathy, neuropathy, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease. 

It takes lipohypertrophy 2-3 months to heal. One Steady Shot lasts for 6+ months.
 
Late Stages of Lipohypertrophy:


 



 
The Impact Steady Shot Will Have


Steady Shot has the potential to help millions of injectors reduce their risk of developing lipohypertrophy and lessen their risk of further health complications developing. 
 
With Steady Shot Injectors Can Now:

Inject with their non-dominant hand
Easily rotate injection sites and rest their over used injection sites
Inject at the proper depth and angle
Be less likely to bend or break a needle
Learn injections with less fear
Inject easeir with arthritis and dexterity issues

 

 
How Steady Shot Works

         



             

 
1) Attach Steady Shot to your needle and press Steady Shot into your fat:

2) Administer your dose 



 
Why Injectors Love Steady Shot


There are no products on the market that help diabetics reach new injection sites
2.8 million people have lipohypertrophy and need help rotating injection sites
Easier for newly diagnosed, elderly and caregivers.
Easier for caregivers, school nurses and nurses in training. 
More stability and less pain

Thank you! I tried my arm by myself for the FIRST time. Incredible. 10/10 LOVE
I was diagnosed with diabetes a little over a year ago, and haven’t started pumping yet. With this I take a long acting insulin and fast acting insulin before meals. I haven’t been too adventurous when it comes to injection sites. Just my stomach, and I’ve tried my thigh a couple times. If I’m doing any other site, someone else does it for me because I HATE doing injections one handed. My first time trying the steady shot, I did my first EVER shot in my arm by myself, and it was SO easy. I love this product so much already and it really helps promote site rotation for people like me that are stubborn switching from their favorite spot. My tummy can finally have a break!!
 


Issac
""That was really good!! No tears, minimum resistance. All around happy with how the injection went. :) One happy mumma and baby bear!! Before when I went to use this type of needle I had to pin Issac (who was 3 at the time) down, literally lock him with my legs and use one arm to hold him down and inject. This was horrible for both me and Issac. I’m very relieved that @mysteadyshot has helped!! Yes he was a bit unsure but he still let me and this is an amazing gold star for us today!! Thank you Steady Shot""
 
Steady Shot lets you use the ""under the arm"" technique
 
Over the Arm


Harder to reach the recommended back of the arm
More likely to inject insulin in muscle tissue, which is not recommended
Difficult to inject at a 90 degree angle

 
Under the Arm


Easy to reach the recommended back of the arm
More likely to inject insulin in subcutaneous tissue, which is recommended by healthcare professionals. 
Easy to inject at a recommended 90 degree angle

 
Why inject in the back of the arm?
Insulin should be injected in fatty tissue. There is much more fatty tissue in the back of the arm compared to side of the arm. If Steady Shot is injected in the muscle tissue, insulin can absorb too quickly and lead to health complications.

""My @mysteadyshot came in the mail two days ago I have been loving it!! It makes shots in public and in the car so much easier and no more asking Matt or my parents to reach sites for me :).""

  

 

Kristen
I really like the steady shot, it is so simple and easy to use! I’m going to bring it to show my diabetes educators next time I go in! It has allowed me to use different sites I didn’t feel comfortable using before! I can now use arms on my own without asking others for help! I would absolutely recommend it to a friend. I have gained a lot more useable sites with the steady shot! It’s such a great device that is simple to use! I’ve always liked to pinch my sites and using arms alone not being able to pinch them terrified me! I can now do it on my own with ease!

<h3>We all know we're experiencing a crisis ""unprecedented in our lifetime."" As a country, and at a global scale, we're scrambling for solutions. Please join our efforts to support the production and provision of clinically-effective</h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">LOW COST VENTILATORS</h2>
<p>UPDATE: We’re privileged to announce with your continued support VentLife was able to submit our pre-EUA documents to the FDA this weekend. Stay tuned for what we have ahead! </p>
<p>I'm Elliot - I received a call from UCLA's Jennifer McCaney (executive director of their BioDesign program) and Glen Meyerowitz, an engineer at graduate school at UCLA who spent 5 years as a rocket scientist at Space X, and we knew, with the experience in our networks that we had to be doing something in response to the (unnecessary) suffering being caused by Coronavirus.</p>
<p>We've founded Ventlife.org, a non-profit, to prototype, produce and provide low cost ventilators to address this emergency until someone tells us to stop. </p>
<p>I'm no stranger to urgent healthcare projects for people in need - I've been involved in projects that created<strong> <a href=""http://www.aflacchildhoodcancer.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">social robot ducks for kids with cancer</a> </strong>across the U.S. I've produced projects that sent a team to Sudan to<strong> <a href=""https://youtu.be/SDYFMgrjeLg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3D-print prosthetic limbs for child victims of war</a></strong>, that <a href=""https://youtu.be/LtSCemhpIWk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>enabled a farmer with ALS/Motor Neurone Disease to communicate independently</strong></a> via ocular recognition technology and I<strong> <a href=""https://ems-media-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/videos/converted/1445/4990/401511275_1_ems720p.mp4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">introduced an Eye-Examination App called PEEK to a brand (Sony) to help cure blindness</a></strong> around the globe (<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/peek-retina-help-fight-avoidable-blindness/x/84742#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">one of IndieGogo's most successful healthcare fundraising efforts</a> ever).</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Though all these projects were important, and inspired other behaviors that benefited humanity, <u>never have I been involved in a project that could save lives in real time</u>. </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>There is a dire need for more ventilators.</strong></h3>
<p>Partnerships between Ford&amp;GE, GM&amp;Ventec and Tesla&amp;Medtronic in the United States are answering the call and ramping up production, and various universities like MIT, Rice &amp; UFL are engaged in innovating in the hopes that each can help. This is all great. And more is necessary.</p>
<p>Coronavirus patients in critical care often need to stay on ventilators for 2 weeks and even our biggest hospitals might be lucky to have 200 units on hand. The numbers are not pretty. The <a href=""https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gm-signs-490m-contract-under-120943782.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GM ventilators will cost the government about $16,000 each</a>, other existing full-feature ventilators cost $30,000 to $50,000 each. That means:-</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>$1 million currently funds way less than 100 ventilators. </u></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>So - What if we could raise $1 - 2 million to prototype &amp; provide 1,000+ life-saving ventilators.</u></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>That is our goal. </u></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>It's also just our starting line. </u></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Clinicians in this innovative country shouldn't have to choose who will live and who will die based on limited resources.</u></h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Due to severely limited resources, strained healthcare workers <strong>are currently</strong> triaging care to select which patients will live and which will die. We aim to provide lifesaving equipment to clinicians so they never need to make such choices again and so they can properly perform their jobs.</p>
<p>The UCLA team with whom we're collaborating is working at speed to finish its prototype. Fortunately, the university has a simulation lab on campus at which we can do testing. With the consultation of doctors working on the front lines of COVID-19 care, the team is constantly tweaking and testing.</p>
<h3>Cost</h3>
<div>
<div>The estimates we've received from potential production partners is that it will take several hundred thousand dollars to take Glen's prototype at UCLA from a test model to a clinically relevant product.  We're hoping this campaign can raise enough funds for at least the first 100 ventilators and set-up the tooling, machining and sourcing necessary to create the ventilators on an ongoing basis. </div>
<div> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>A clinically effective ventilator </strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>produced by known medical device manufacturers </strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>at around $1,000 </strong></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>would be a game changer.</strong></h3>
<div> </div>
</div>
<p><strong>From our modeling and the public numbers available, we know we can have a meaningful impact even if we're able to fund the production of just 600 - 2000 ventilators. You can help us get this into production.</strong></p>

Though all these projects were important, and inspired other behaviors that benefited humanity, never have I been involved in a project that could save lives in real time.

The estimates we've received from potential production partners is that it will take several hundred thousand dollars to take Glen's prototype at UCLA from a test model to a clinically relevant product.  We're hoping this campaign can raise enough funds for at least the first 100 ventilators and set-up the tooling, machining and sourcing necessary to create the ventilators on an ongoing basis. 
 
A clinically effective ventilator 
produced by known medical device manufacturers 
at around $1,000 
would be a game changer.
 

From our modeling and the public numbers available, we know we can have a meaningful impact even if we're able to fund the production of just 600 - 2000 ventilators. You can help us get this into production.

<p>In 2004, Charles
and Cindy (Casey) Holman were determined to find answers about an unusual and
debilitating condition, Morgellons Disease that had infected Cindy. The Charles
E. Holman Morgellons Disease Foundation (aka The New Morgellons Order) was
founded with commitment to honesty and integrity as an organization. The goals
were then and remain today to fund scientific research, promote public
awareness and to educate the medical community by providing objective research with
scientific merit.  Officially receiving
the status of 501(c) 3 nonprofit in January 2007, the organization's name was
amended with the IRS to include Charles E. Holman to honor our founder for the
work he had begun. Charles passed away in 2007 from heart related issues and
did not have Morgellons. Cindy Casey-Holman, RN serves as the Director of The
CEHMDF and continues to lead the fight for Morgellons patients everywhere. In
2014, we completed the process becoming officially The Charles E. Holman
Morgellons Disease Foundation. This name more fully reflects and encompasses
our mission and vision regarding our works toward effective treatment of
patients and a cure to have a world without Morgellons disease.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, the strength and
recognition of our organization have grown significantly. The CEHMDF is  recognized as the leading primary source for
scientific information regarding Morgellons Disease.  We are listed on the Rare Disease Registry of
the NIH. Attendance at our annual medical-scientific conference on Morgellons
disease has multiplied exponentially.  We
are humbled and honored by this demonstration of trust and confidence in the
work we have done and continue to do.  We

</h4>
<p>Morgellons Disease (MD) is a
multi-system illness uniquely characterized by the formation of unusual fibers
within the skin. MD is a debilitating, painful and life impacting condition
consisting of slow-healing skin lesions, overwhelming fatigue, GI disturbances
and an array of neurological deficits. Patients with Morgellons may shed
unusual appearing particles from the skin described as fibers, sand or
seed-like, black specks, or crystallized particles.</p>
<p>The distinguishing characteristic of
Morgellons Disease (MD) is the presence of microscopic subcutaneous fibers
sometimes referred to as filaments within the skin. Lighted microscopy (60-x
minimum) enables the visualization of these unusual fibers, often-colored red,
blue, black, white or clear, embedded in open skin lesions as well as their
presence beneath intact skin.</p>

<p>Morgellons disease is a complex and misunderstood condition by most in
the traditional mainstream medical communities. 
Lack of knowledge and clinical research perpetuates untruths about the
very real infectious etiology of this disease. 
Patients are unnecessarily delayed in gaining access to an accurate
diagnosis and effective treatment to relieve their suffering as well as disease
progression.  </p>
<h4>
<b><i>             Establishing Morgellons as an infectious disease <br/></i></b><b><i>    takes an over-abundance
of reproducible scientific evidence.  <br/></i></b><b><i>                   We
have successfully begun the work.</i></b>
</h4>
<p>We adhere strictly to science. Researchers
from two esteemed universities, Oklahoma State University-Center for Health
Sciences in Tulsa, OK and the University of New Haven in West Haven, CT as well
as an international team of independent scientists<span> volunteer their time to perform state-of-the-art
scientific research.  Compilation of the
works from these scientists is submitted for peer-review and, ultimately, accepted
for journal publication.  Using
research as key</span> <span>evidence in establishing
Morgellons as a true physiological disease is the fundamental approach for
recognition and acceptance of this condition.</span></p>
<p>Since the emergence of
Morgellons in about 2002, the questions of <i>‘Where
to go for help?’</i> and <i>‘What do people
do?’</i> have echoed throughout the world.  Each day the
volunteers of The CEHMDF respond to cries from people across the US and
worldwide dealing with symptoms of this disease.  Many have lost everything since becoming sick
... their jobs and financial security to provide for themselves,
their homes, friends and family.   Some
people have had CPS take their children (assigning a Munchausen's by proxy
label to them).  Some even resort to taking their own lives, having lost
all hope and nowhere to turn.  Most doctors are perplexed as well and do not
know how to help.</p>
<p> In 2011, scientists
searching for an infectious cause in Morgellons disease finally found promising
leads.  In 2012-2103, research began to scratch
the surface of the mystery, revealing that pathogenic bacteria were indeed
involved.   In 2014 to the present, CEHMDF
Funded Research has shown:</p>
<p><span>---  </span>The Morgellons fibers/filaments are composed of human
keratin and collagen<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">    produced by keratinocytes/fibroblasts in the skin in

<p><span>---  </span>Most patients receiving
evaluation and treatment for Borrelia by knowledgeable medical providers have
improvement of the Morgellons symptoms;</p>
<p>---Morgellons disease is not an
imagined or delusional mental condition.  Borrelia
affects the central and peripheral nervous systemcould cause behavior changes and psychiatric manifestations esp. if left
untreated.  Some Morgellons patients
experience behavioral changes possibly due to untreated Borrelia.</p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Through the years, we have seen the sustaining power of
humanity in the stories of the many who suffer with Morgellons.  This research is critical in establishing Morgellons
as a true infectious disease.  The
evidence will give credence to the voices of those who have endured the worst
that medicine currently has to offer.The failure to acknowledge and the
compliancy towards the serious underlying cause of Morgellons symptoms have
horrible consequences as we have seen.  Our
goal is to provide credible and replicable scientific research on Morgellons
disease to place this condition firmly on the medical map.  Ultimately, this
will enable all patients who suffer with this disease to have access to
appropriate medical care and will pave the road for more effective treatment.</p>
<p>The CEHMDF continues to advance the
research and recognition of Morgellons.  Throughout this past
year, with your support, we have funded research for numerous
scientists. A comprehensive paper authored by a team of international
researchers was published in BMC Dermatology.  Further research by this
team continues and we expect additional publications soon.  Research at
University of New Haven under direction of Eva Sapi, PhD continues and we hope
this brings yet another scientific publication on the topic of Morgellons to
the peer reviewed medical literature.  Morgellons research at Oklahoma
State University, under the direction of Randy Wymore, PhD continues and
we expect a publication of their findings will soon be
available.  All of these efforts take an incredible amount of time and
money.  Your support makes it possible.</p>
<p>Additional academic researchers who wish to explore
a variety of aspects of Morgellons disease have recently approached the CEHMDF.
 At the recent ILADS conference in October, scientists from the U.S. and
Europe expressed a sincere interest in helping to investigate this
disease. We would love to participate in these offers but currently do not
have the funding to do so.</p>
<p>We need to expand our educational outreach in order
to bring in more clinicians who will better understand Morgellons and
provide optimal treatment to patients.  We are accomplishing
this objective by setting up booths at medical conferences, holding
our own annual medical-scientific conference and by providing interested
physicians with educational materials and DVDs from our annual
conference.  In addition to our need for research funding, we currently
need funding to support videotaping of our conference and for the
printed materials that we provide to educate health care providers.  </p>

Lack of knowledge and clinical research perpetuates untruths about the
very real infectious etiology of this disease. 
Patients are unnecessarily delayed in gaining access to an accurate
diagnosis and effective treatment to relieve their suffering as well as disease
progression.  

             Establishing Morgellons as an infectious disease     takes an over-abundance
of reproducible scientific evidence.                     We
have successfully begun the work.

We adhere strictly to science. Researchers
from two esteemed universities, Oklahoma State University-Center for Health
Sciences in Tulsa, OK and the University of New Haven in West Haven, CT as well
as an international team of independent scientists volunteer their time to perform state-of-the-art
scientific research.  Compilation of the
works from these scientists is submitted for peer-review and, ultimately, accepted
for journal publication.  Using
research as key evidence in establishing
Morgellons as a true physiological disease is the fundamental approach for
recognition and acceptance of this condition.
Since the emergence of
Morgellons in about 2002, the questions of ‘Where
to go for help?’ and ‘What do people
do?’ have echoed throughout the world.  Each day the
volunteers of The CEHMDF respond to cries from people across the US and
worldwide dealing with symptoms of this disease.  Many have lost everything since becoming sick
... their jobs and financial security to provide for themselves,
their homes, friends and family.   Some
people have had CPS take their children (assigning a Munchausen's by proxy
label to them).  Some even resort to taking their own lives, having lost
all hope and nowhere to turn.  Most doctors are perplexed as well and do not
know how to help.
 In 2011, scientists
searching for an infectious cause in Morgellons disease finally found promising
leads.  In 2012-2103, research began to scratch
the surface of the mystery, revealing that pathogenic bacteria were indeed
involved.   In 2014 to the present, CEHMDF
Funded Research has shown:
---  The Morgellons fibers/filaments are composed of human
keratin and collagen    produced by keratinocytes/fibroblasts in the skin in
response to an infection;
---  4 bacterial species have been identified in Morgellons
samples;
---  Borrelia spirochetes have been identified abundantly
in every Morgellons    sample.
---  Most patients receiving
evaluation and treatment for Borrelia by knowledgeable medical providers have
improvement of the Morgellons symptoms;
---Morgellons disease is not an
imagined or delusional mental condition.  Borrelia
affects the central and peripheral nervous systemcould cause behavior changes and psychiatric manifestations esp. if left
untreated.  Some Morgellons patients
experience behavioral changes possibly due to untreated Borrelia.
               Our Record Speaks and Shows Our Commitment

   

                                                           


The Impact
 
Through the years, we have seen the sustaining power of
humanity in the stories of the many who suffer with Morgellons.  This research is critical in establishing Morgellons
as a true infectious disease.  The
evidence will give credence to the voices of those who have endured the worst
that medicine currently has to offer.The failure to acknowledge and the
compliancy towards the serious underlying cause of Morgellons symptoms have
horrible consequences as we have seen.  Our
goal is to provide credible and replicable scientific research on Morgellons
disease to place this condition firmly on the medical map.  Ultimately, this
will enable all patients who suffer with this disease to have access to
appropriate medical care and will pave the road for more effective treatment.
The CEHMDF continues to advance the
research and recognition of Morgellons.  Throughout this past
year, with your support, we have funded research for numerous
scientists. A comprehensive paper authored by a team of international
researchers was published in BMC Dermatology.  Further research by this
team continues and we expect additional publications soon.  Research at
University of New Haven under direction of Eva Sapi, PhD continues and we hope
this brings yet another scientific publication on the topic of Morgellons to
the peer reviewed medical literature.  Morgellons research at Oklahoma
State University, under the direction of Randy Wymore, PhD continues and
we expect a publication of their findings will soon be
available.  All of these efforts take an incredible amount of time and
money.  Your support makes it possible.
Additional academic researchers who wish to explore
a variety of aspects of Morgellons disease have recently approached the CEHMDF.
 At the recent ILADS conference in October, scientists from the U.S. and
Europe expressed a sincere interest in helping to investigate this
disease. We would love to participate in these offers but currently do not
have the funding to do so.
We need to expand our educational outreach in order
to bring in more clinicians who will better understand Morgellons and
provide optimal treatment to patients.  We are accomplishing
this objective by setting up booths at medical conferences, holding
our own annual medical-scientific conference and by providing interested
physicians with educational materials and DVDs from our annual
conference.  In addition to our need for research funding, we currently
need funding to support videotaping of our conference and for the
printed materials that we provide to educate health care providers.  


   
What We Need From You... 
The CEHMDF is a 501 © nonprofit, all volunteer
organization.   CEHMDF does not pay
salaries or  receive any grants and
relies solely upon the donations you provide to fund research projects,
medical providers’ educational programs and patient support-outreach programs.
 In order to continue this very important work we are counting on your
help.  Please help us continue this very costly research. We are so
close. Thousands of  people throughout
the world are waiting.  Our scientists
and researchers need your support.
As 2015 comes to an end, we ask that you will

<p></p>
<p>75% to 90% of all doctor’s office visits are due to stress
related ailments and complaints, with OSHA estimating stress costing American
industry alone more than $300 billion a year.</p>
<p><b>Why is breathing so important?</b> Beyond keeping us alive, how
we breathe can have a huge impact on our stress levels and physiology.
Breathing is one of the few body functions we have both conscious and
unconscious control over. <b>Specific ways of breathing have been proven to calm
the nervous system and lower stress</b>. And posture can directly affect the
quality of our breathing, as well as impact back pain. Prolonged office sitting in front of a computer can take a serious toll on the quality of your breathing and posture, fueling stress.</p>
<p>Prana makes it easy to harness the power of good breathing
and posture for many healthy benefits. <b>Prana can trigger a relaxation response
within two minutes of use.</b> It is a 100% drug free stress relief device.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>How does Prana work?</h2>
<p></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://oi66.tinypic.com/10n6r81.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p></p>
<p>Prana is the first activity tracker to combine three critical body function measures to comprehensively improve the quality of breathing for
maximum stress fighting results. <b>These measures are diaphragmatic breathing,
posture, and breath patterns.</b> Prana's advanced algorithms uniquely integrate these measures in a clear actionable way. Our app provides both <b>passive tracking and active training strategies </b>to improve how we breathe. Passive tracking monitors your breathing and posture in the background, occasionally warning you to adjust your breath or body pose. Our active training provides a fully interactive gamified experience to make it easy and fun to retrain breathing for many lasting
benefits. </p>

<p>Prana lowers stress by rapidly triggering your body’s relaxation response (also known as the parasympathetic response). The <b>parasympathetic response</b> is the opposite of fight or flight mode which many of us get chronically locked into. Having your bloodstream constantly flooded with stress hormones and adrenaline can contribute and worsen many serious health issues including:   </p>
<ul><li>Heart disease</li></ul>
<ul><li>Hypertension</li></ul>
<ul><li>Digestive disorders</li></ul>
<ul><li>Panic attacks</li></ul>
<ul><li>Lowered immune function and infection</li></ul>
<ul><li>Erectile dysfunction</li></ul>
<ul><li>Insomnia</li></ul>
<ul><li>Depression</li></ul>
<ul><li>Headaches</li></ul>
<ul><li>Diabetes</li></ul>
<ul><li>Asthma and <b>COPD (this additional application of Prana is discussed below)</b>
</li></ul>
<ul><li>Systemic inflammation</li></ul>
<p>Nearly every system of your body is susceptible to the ravages of stress. Proper breathing is a natural non-drug way to rapidly tap into your body’s built-in stress reduction mechanism (see this <a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/relaxation-techniques-breath-control-helps-quell-errant-stress-response"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.health.harvard.edu/mind-and-mood/relaxation-techniques-breath-control-helps-quell-errant-stress-response"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Harvard article</a> on how good breathing lowers stress). <b>Prana is designed to make such stress-busting breathing accessible to everyone. </b></p>

<p>While you're sitting, Prana normally functions in the background. It only alerts you if it detects signs of stressful breathing or poor posture. When we are stressed, we tend to breathe faster and more shallow, with breathing often shifting to the chest from the belly, which Prana can detect. Poor posture in turn can limit air flow into the lungs, further disrupting our breathing pattern, and contribute to back pain. Prana can notify either by a gentle on-device buzz, or through a smartphone alert, that it’s time to improve breathing or posture or both.</p>

<p>Our active training mode allows you to participate in short game sessions (2 to 3 minutes) to consciously train the quality of your breathing. <b>This is where you can rapidly experience a relaxation response.</b></p>
<p>You start a game session whenever you feel like it. You can use it as a therapeutic tool to reduce stress, anxiety, and even stop a panic attack. And you can use it to retrain and learn better breathing habits. Our app can be set to alert you to start a training session (a tune-up) whenever passive tracking results are less than optimal (i.e. poor breathing or posture have been detected for an extended period of time).</p>
<p>As in the video below, the game works by tracking your real-time breathing as you fly through a colorful Zen garden. The goal is to collect flowers by carefully controlling inhalations and exhalations to follow the target breath pattern, while maintaining good posture. <b>You directly control the game character with your breathing</b>, with the bird flying higher as you inhale, and lower as you exhale (by means of a live Bluetooth connection between Prana and your smartphone). Staying within the flower pattern means you are breathing in the right way for the selected pattern. Good posture activates the forward scrolling motion. With our anti-stress pattern, you can feel calmer in as little as two minutes.</p></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;"">      <div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FB2M52-puJ0Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DB2M52-puJ0Y&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FB2M52-puJ0Y%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><h2>Sitting and Standing</h2>

<div><h2>Prana Optimizes Breathing</h2></div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>Prana is designed not only to lower stress, but to optimize
our breathing for the full spectrum of long term health benefits. It is the
only wearable that looks at respiration not as an isolated signal, but
holistically in connection with two critical biomechanical functions which
affect the quality of breathing: Diaphragmatic breathing and posture.
<b>Diaphragmatic breathing together with the proper breath pattern have been shown
to more effectively activate our relaxation response than simply trying to slow respiration rate.</b> And posture can directly impact the quality of our breath
patterns. This is why we have integrated these three measures to give a
complete picture of our breathing, and for maximizing stress reduction. Our system is fully transparent so that you can see in real-time that breath tracking is accurate and actually working.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>Diaphragmatic Breathing</h2>
<div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/482/965/60952716c60b38b350d73cd63e0f9797_original.png?v=1427064431&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=0f06ac392ff70729ca58e3722ad1a2a7"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Prana is the first
wearable specifically designed to monitor and train diaphragmatic (belly)
breathing, the most natural and healthy way to breathe, which has been
disrupted by modern stresses. For most today, the source of breathing has
shifted upwards, with chest or accessory muscles being used to inflate the
lungs. This shallow, stressed, and unnatural form of breathing neglects the
lower lobes of our lungs, which have up to 7 times the oxygen carrying
capacity. The benefits of diaphragmatic breathing have been emphasized by
ancient traditions for thousands of years, and supported by many recent medical
studies. Prana helps to restore this healthy natural form of breathing--utilizing more of our lung capacity--by providing
a sensor which detects and helps guide the movement of our diaphragm, and an app which both
warns and proactively trains us to breathe in this manner.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Posture</h2>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453497712/uumzsspxgcott1h7ukgq.png"" src="""" style=""width: 494px;height: 274px;""/></p></figure><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/></figure><p>A strong connection between posture and breath has been emphasized by many traditions for thousands of years, including Yoga Pranayama. The basic idea is that good posture facilitates good breathing. This idea is now supported by a number of recent studies and research. For example, <a href=""http://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1381307359_Hojat%20and%20mahdi%20PDF.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.academicjournals.org/article/article1381307359_Hojat%20and%20mahdi%20PDF.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this research paper</a> found a significant relationship between a particular seated posture and the quality of pulmonary function. These researchers found that in slumped sitting, spirometric measurements of forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, and peak expiratory flow were all significantly decreased compared to a normal upright seated posture. Our posture affects the distribution of weight of visceral organs on our diaphragm, which affects its mobility when breathing. Prana's advanced algorithms are able to disentangle breathing from posture to provide a posture-corrected breathing signal, all from one location on the body. Prana warns us when our posture can be improved, and our app understand how different postures impact breathing.</p>
<p>There are many additional benefits of good posture which Prana helps support, including preventing back problems and muscular pain, less fatigue (since muscles are used more efficiently), decreased stress on joints, ligaments and the spine, as well as improving our appearance.</p>
</div>
<h2><br/></h2>
<h2>Breath Patterns </h2>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A breath pattern goes far beyond what can be captured by a
simple summary statistic such as respiration rate. It is defined by how we
breathe over time, with parameters such as inhalation time, depth, retention,
smoothness, exhalation time, and time between breaths. Recent studies have
found that the patterns we employ, both consciously and unconsciously, can have a major impact. For example, <b>research has found that prolonging
exhalation times versus inhalation can help to more rapidly trigger the
relaxation response</b> and a feeling of calmness (by means of more efficiently
stimulating the Vagus nerve, also known at the Pneumogastric nerve). Prana provides and trains these types of relaxation response patterns, including a pattern called called 4-7-8 (inhale for 4
seconds, hold breath for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds) which has been shown as highly effective in curbing <b>anxiety attacks</b> in as little as just a few minutes (a
great possible alternative to Xanax and other addicting benzodiazepine drugs).
Other patterns have been found to increase energy (controlled rapid breathing
for a short duration), while others are very good for enhancing concentration
(such as a popular pattern from Yoga Pranayama called Sama Vritti, emphasizing
equal controlled inhalation and exhalation times).</p>

<p>Prana has been designed to make it clear and easy to unlock the benefits of following specific breathing patterns. Our app offers two primary ways to visualize your real-time breath pattern: our game mode (previously discussed), and our clinical mode. Our game mode again shows the contours of the target breath pattern against a carefully timed scrolling background, with your breathing directly controlling the movement of the game character through the pattern. Our <b>Clinical Mode</b> provides a more in-depth timeline interface for tracking 10 distinct breath stats, posture, and displaying real-time breath patterns, as well as scoring each breath with respect to a target breath pattern. </p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<div><b>Why does it matter how we breathe?</b></div>
<div>Beyond keeping us alive, how we breathe affects many aspects of our health. In particular, proper breathing is a gateway for rapidly triggering the relaxation response (parasympathetic response) which helps to put the body and mind into a deeply calmed state. Many of us are spending far too much time with our sympathetic nervous systems cranked up (fight or flight mode), which can worsen many serious health conditions.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Aren't respiration rate trackers already available?</b></div>
<div>Very few in the broader wearables space, and Prana goes much deeper than simply providing a respiration rate. It uniquely integrates three critical measures for assessing the true quality of our breathing: diaphragmatic breathing, posture, and breath patterns. By providing this complete picture of breathing, along with a gamified app training program, we believe we are offering something truly new and needed in the wearables space today.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b>Can't I just do breathing exercises?</b></div>
<div>Sure, but most people find it quite difficult and boring to commit to doing so for any extended period of time. Prana offers an engaging new way to learn healthy breathing habits while charting your progress over time. Prana also functions as a coach, giving you immediate visual feedback so that you know you are breathing in a proper way, along with maintaining good posture.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Does Prana track breathing and posture while walking?</b></span><br/>
</div>
<div>When you sit, Prana tracks breathing and posture. And when you stand and walk around, it switches to activity/step tracking. The reason and strategy behind this is that the quality of our breathing/posture are much more susceptible to being compromised when we sit for prolonged periods of time compared to standing, and this is the main problem that Prana is striving to address (average office worker sits nearly 6 hours a day). When we are active and walking, we are already doing something good for our health, so we felt this was not the optimum time to be alerting the user. Additionally, when active, respiration rate naturally increases, so using that as one of the indicators of stress is not as valid as when sitting.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p><b>How can Prana measure posture from the waistband near the belly?</b></p>
<p>Prana started off as a belt, monitoring the posture component with a separate sensor positioned near the lower back. But turns out you can also measure posture from the belly and lower abdominal area. You can try it for yourself. Slouch and then sit upright and notice how the angles in that area change significantly. The challenge is that this signal is confounded with diaphragmatic breathing signals, and that's a big part of what we've been working on to disentagle.</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">How is Prana's battery charged?</b><br/></p>
</div>
<div>Prana uses a lithium ion rechargeable battery, requiring charging about every 7 days. We started with a wired charging station, but eventually found an effective design for integrating a QI wireless charging system, so our wearable is completely wireless for maximum convenience.</div>

Stress and Breathing Connection

75% to 90% of all doctor’s office visits are due to stress
related ailments and complaints, with OSHA estimating stress costing American
industry alone more than $300 billion a year.
Why is breathing so important? Beyond keeping us alive, how
we breathe can have a huge impact on our stress levels and physiology.
Breathing is one of the few body functions we have both conscious and
unconscious control over. Specific ways of breathing have been proven to calm
the nervous system and lower stress. And posture can directly affect the
quality of our breathing, as well as impact back pain. Prolonged office sitting in front of a computer can take a serious toll on the quality of your breathing and posture, fueling stress.
Prana makes it easy to harness the power of good breathing
and posture for many healthy benefits. Prana can trigger a relaxation response
within two minutes of use. It is a 100% drug free stress relief device.

How does Prana work?



Prana is the first activity tracker to combine three critical body function measures to comprehensively improve the quality of breathing for
maximum stress fighting results. These measures are diaphragmatic breathing,
posture, and breath patterns. Prana's advanced algorithms uniquely integrate these measures in a clear actionable way. Our app provides both passive tracking and active training strategies to improve how we breathe. Passive tracking monitors your breathing and posture in the background, occasionally warning you to adjust your breath or body pose. Our active training provides a fully interactive gamified experience to make it easy and fun to retrain breathing for many lasting
benefits. 




Prana lowers stress by rapidly triggering your body’s relaxation response (also known as the parasympathetic response). The parasympathetic response is the opposite of fight or flight mode which many of us get chronically locked into. Having your bloodstream constantly flooded with stress hormones and adrenaline can contribute and worsen many serious health issues including:   
Heart disease
Hypertension
Digestive disorders
Panic attacks
Lowered immune function and infection
Erectile dysfunction
Insomnia
Depression
Headaches
Diabetes
Asthma and COPD (this additional application of Prana is discussed below)

Systemic inflammation
Nearly every system of your body is susceptible to the ravages of stress. Proper breathing is a natural non-drug way to rapidly tap into your body’s built-in stress reduction mechanism (see this Harvard article on how good breathing lowers stress). Prana is designed to make such stress-busting breathing accessible to everyone.

Prana Wearable and App


                   
Prana includes:

An elegantly designed clip-on device worn on the waistband, featuring a stylish metallically finished case, measuring only 1.25” X ¼” for a comfortable and non-obtrusive wearable experience (black version available with stretch goal 1), Bluetooth LE connection to your smartphone
Wireless charging base
A mobile app with cutting edge patent pending algorithms seamlessly unifying diaphragmatic breathing, posture, and breath patterns
For both iOS & Android





Passive Tracking

While you're sitting, Prana normally functions in the background. It only alerts you if it detects signs of stressful breathing or poor posture. When we are stressed, we tend to breathe faster and more shallow, with breathing often shifting to the chest from the belly, which Prana can detect. Poor posture in turn can limit air flow into the lungs, further disrupting our breathing pattern, and contribute to back pain. Prana can notify either by a gentle on-device buzz, or through a smartphone alert, that it’s time to improve breathing or posture or both.
      


 Active Training (Gamified)


Our active training mode allows you to participate in short game sessions (2 to 3 minutes) to consciously train the quality of your breathing. This is where you can rapidly experience a relaxation response.
You start a game session whenever you feel like it. You can use it as a therapeutic tool to reduce stress, anxiety, and even stop a panic attack. And you can use it to retrain and learn better breathing habits. Our app can be set to alert you to start a training session (a tune-up) whenever passive tracking results are less than optimal (i.e. poor breathing or posture have been detected for an extended period of time).
As in the video below, the game works by tracking your real-time breathing as you fly through a colorful Zen garden. The goal is to collect flowers by carefully controlling inhalations and exhalations to follow the target breath pattern, while maintaining good posture. You directly control the game character with your breathing, with the bird flying higher as you inhale, and lower as you exhale (by means of a live Bluetooth connection between Prana and your smartphone). Staying within the flower pattern means you are breathing in the right way for the selected pattern. Good posture activates the forward scrolling motion. With our anti-stress pattern, you can feel calmer in as little as two minutes.      Sitting and Standing
Prana recognizes when you sit or stand. While you sit, Prana analyzes your breath patterns, diaphragmatic breathing, and posture. When you stand or walk, Prana automatically switches to standing mode where it functions as a step tracker. We employ this strategy because the quality of breathing is most vulnerable to disruption while sitting and being inactive, especially during stressful times.



Prana Optimizes Breathing


Prana is designed not only to lower stress, but to optimize
our breathing for the full spectrum of long term health benefits. It is the
only wearable that looks at respiration not as an isolated signal, but
holistically in connection with two critical biomechanical functions which
affect the quality of breathing: Diaphragmatic breathing and posture.
Diaphragmatic breathing together with the proper breath pattern have been shown
to more effectively activate our relaxation response than simply trying to slow respiration rate. And posture can directly impact the quality of our breath
patterns. This is why we have integrated these three measures to give a
complete picture of our breathing, and for maximizing stress reduction. Our system is fully transparent so that you can see in real-time that breath tracking is accurate and actually working.


Diaphragmatic Breathing




Prana is the first
wearable specifically designed to monitor and train diaphragmatic (belly)
breathing, the most natural and healthy way to breathe, which has been
disrupted by modern stresses. For most today, the source of breathing has
shifted upwards, with chest or accessory muscles being used to inflate the
lungs. This shallow, stressed, and unnatural form of breathing neglects the
lower lobes of our lungs, which have up to 7 times the oxygen carrying
capacity. The benefits of diaphragmatic breathing have been emphasized by
ancient traditions for thousands of years, and supported by many recent medical
studies. Prana helps to restore this healthy natural form of breathing--utilizing more of our lung capacity--by providing
a sensor which detects and helps guide the movement of our diaphragm, and an app which both
warns and proactively trains us to breathe in this manner.

Posture
A strong connection between posture and breath has been emphasized by many traditions for thousands of years, including Yoga Pranayama. The basic idea is that good posture facilitates good breathing. This idea is now supported by a number of recent studies and research. For example, this research paper found a significant relationship between a particular seated posture and the quality of pulmonary function. These researchers found that in slumped sitting, spirometric measurements of forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, and peak expiratory flow were all significantly decreased compared to a normal upright seated posture. Our posture affects the distribution of weight of visceral organs on our diaphragm, which affects its mobility when breathing. Prana's advanced algorithms are able to disentangle breathing from posture to provide a posture-corrected breathing signal, all from one location on the body. Prana warns us when our posture can be improved, and our app understand how different postures impact breathing.
There are many additional benefits of good posture which Prana helps support, including preventing back problems and muscular pain, less fatigue (since muscles are used more efficiently), decreased stress on joints, ligaments and the spine, as well as improving our appearance.


Breath Patterns 



A breath pattern goes far beyond what can be captured by a
simple summary statistic such as respiration rate. It is defined by how we
breathe over time, with parameters such as inhalation time, depth, retention,
smoothness, exhalation time, and time between breaths. Recent studies have
found that the patterns we employ, both consciously and unconsciously, can have a major impact. For example, research has found that prolonging
exhalation times versus inhalation can help to more rapidly trigger the
relaxation response and a feeling of calmness (by means of more efficiently
stimulating the Vagus nerve, also known at the Pneumogastric nerve). Prana provides and trains these types of relaxation response patterns, including a pattern called called 4-7-8 (inhale for 4
seconds, hold breath for 7 seconds, exhale for 8 seconds) which has been shown as highly effective in curbing anxiety attacks in as little as just a few minutes (a
great possible alternative to Xanax and other addicting benzodiazepine drugs).
Other patterns have been found to increase energy (controlled rapid breathing
for a short duration), while others are very good for enhancing concentration
(such as a popular pattern from Yoga Pranayama called Sama Vritti, emphasizing
equal controlled inhalation and exhalation times).

Visualized Breath Patterns and Stats
Prana has been designed to make it clear and easy to unlock the benefits of following specific breathing patterns. Our app offers two primary ways to visualize your real-time breath pattern: our game mode (previously discussed), and our clinical mode. Our game mode again shows the contours of the target breath pattern against a carefully timed scrolling background, with your breathing directly controlling the movement of the game character through the pattern. Our Clinical Mode provides a more in-depth timeline interface for tracking 10 distinct breath stats, posture, and displaying real-time breath patterns, as well as scoring each breath with respect to a target breath pattern. 



Here are the real-time stats we track:




Respiration rate


Inhalation time


Exhalation time (both absolute and relative)


Breath retention


Time between breaths


Breath uniformity (smoothness)


Diaphragm excursion


Posture


Adjusted inhalation depth relative to posture


Frequency of full breaths


Tidal volume



Benefits beyond Stress Reduction
Our app offers a library of dozens of distinct breath patterns/exercises for active training. Popular patterns include ""Wake Up"", ""Focus"", and ""Wind Down"", which translate to different breathing exercises from traditions around the world, such as Yoga Pranayama, Buteyko, Tai Chi, 4-7-8, and many others. While stress reduction is our primary application--and we offer precise breath patterns to achieve that--our library of breathing patterns supports other applications, including:

Lowering blood pressure and heart rate 
Increasing energy
Improving focus
Helping to fall sleep
Strengthening the immune system
Helping with chronic pain
Improving mood
Improving heart rate variability (HRV) 
Even patterns for helping medical conditions such as Asthma, COPD, migraines, and irritable bowel syndrome.  




COPD
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is
the 3rd leading cause of death in the United States. Beyond reducing stress, we single out COPD as an
application where Prana can offer significant assistance. It is well known that a high percentage of
sufferers of COPD have compromised diaphragm function. By specifically training diaphragmatic
breathing, Prana can help COPD patients strengthen their diaphragm to breathe
in a more effective way, potentially offering significant relief.


Below is a video of a COPD patient trying Prana for the
first time (this is with an earlier belt-version of Prana, though our pod version functions in the same way). Within seconds, he
was able to shift his breathing to his diaphragm, and receive immediate visual
real-time feedback that he was doing it in the correct way. Here is an excerpt
of his comments:
“This would really be great to teach me how to breathe from
my abdomen. I’m a really shallow breather... I feel it would be a great tool to
help people learn how to breath properly.”

Timeline and History of Development




We started our mission way back in November of 2012, first conducting extensive research to learn as much as possible about the science of breathing, how it impacts our stress and health, and then designing a suite of new patent pending algorithms to address the unique challenges of tracking diaphragmatic breath, posture, and activity all from a single point on the waistband. We have built countless prototypes along the way, starting with a belt approach, and slowly improving and evolving our capabilities to shift to our single pod which can track all these features from one location.
September 2014—clip-on hardware prototypes fully functional 
May 2015 —major upgrades to Prana algorithms and software 
August 2015—Extensive user testing completed
December 2015— publication of our 204 page patent application
January 2016—Launch of Indiegogo Campaign
June 2016—Target delivery date of Prana to our Indiegogo backers

FAQ
Why does it matter how we breathe?
Beyond keeping us alive, how we breathe affects many aspects of our health. In particular, proper breathing is a gateway for rapidly triggering the relaxation response (parasympathetic response) which helps to put the body and mind into a deeply calmed state. Many of us are spending far too much time with our sympathetic nervous systems cranked up (fight or flight mode), which can worsen many serious health conditions.

Aren't respiration rate trackers already available?
Very few in the broader wearables space, and Prana goes much deeper than simply providing a respiration rate. It uniquely integrates three critical measures for assessing the true quality of our breathing: diaphragmatic breathing, posture, and breath patterns. By providing this complete picture of breathing, along with a gamified app training program, we believe we are offering something truly new and needed in the wearables space today.

Can't I just do breathing exercises?
Sure, but most people find it quite difficult and boring to commit to doing so for any extended period of time. Prana offers an engaging new way to learn healthy breathing habits while charting your progress over time. Prana also functions as a coach, giving you immediate visual feedback so that you know you are breathing in a proper way, along with maintaining good posture.


Does Prana track breathing and posture while walking?

When you sit, Prana tracks breathing and posture. And when you stand and walk around, it switches to activity/step tracking. The reason and strategy behind this is that the quality of our breathing/posture are much more susceptible to being compromised when we sit for prolonged periods of time compared to standing, and this is the main problem that Prana is striving to address (average office worker sits nearly 6 hours a day). When we are active and walking, we are already doing something good for our health, so we felt this was not the optimum time to be alerting the user. Additionally, when active, respiration rate naturally increases, so using that as one of the indicators of stress is not as valid as when sitting.



How can Prana measure posture from the waistband near the belly?
Prana started off as a belt, monitoring the posture component with a separate sensor positioned near the lower back. But turns out you can also measure posture from the belly and lower abdominal area. You can try it for yourself. Slouch and then sit upright and notice how the angles in that area change significantly. The challenge is that this signal is confounded with diaphragmatic breathing signals, and that's a big part of what we've been working on to disentagle.
How is Prana's battery charged?

Prana uses a lithium ion rechargeable battery, requiring charging about every 7 days. We started with a wired charging station, but eventually found an effective design for integrating a QI wireless charging system, so our wearable is completely wireless for maximum convenience.",30.0,6,"1 Campaign

Travel & lodging not provided.We will also offer a charitable perk, where every donation of a certain amount will fund one unit of the product to be sent to a developing country, where the much of the population is affected.  We are looking to partner with ProjectCure.org, (ranked by Forbes as one of the 20 Most Efficient Large U.S. Charities) as our conduit to those in need.  We will also be offering handmade bracelets, made by a General Hospital Soap star, who has recently launched a line of artisan products.We will also be offering luxury beach and bath towels - free of any logos or branding.In addition to those unique perks, we will also offer merchandise to represent the product’s character, Garr – including but not limited to t-shirts and a plush, stuffed likeness of the character that can be used as a coping tool for children dealing with cold sores, to help them feel that they have a champion to comfort them while their body fights the virus back.  Even if your own children do not get cold sores, you certainly know of someone’s child who does.  Although the ingredients are natural, the product will not be recommended for children under the age of 12.  Garr, The (stuffed) Cold Sore Warrior, will be there for moral support until they are old enough to enjoy the benefits of the product itself.If Root does not reach its entire goal with this campaign, it will run a second campaign until the goal is met.  If a second campaign is not successful, Root will revisit the offer made by the previously interested investors, in exchange for equity.  We will keep working at it until the product is launched.  As a last resort, Root has a quote with a manufacturer that will do a run with a much smaller initial quantity at a much higher cost per unit.  This will not be ideal for margins, but creates a fail-safe for a launch by winter, which is the peak season for cold sores.The ImpactCold Sores and the virus that causes them may not be life threatening in most cases, but they are prolific, painful, affect daily life, and make the sufferer feel powerless, as there is no cure.  The lowest estimate of people affected is 7 out of 10. Current methods used to address the virus and/or its symptoms of expression exist as anti-viral pharmaceutical prescriptions from a doctor and over the counter products (OTC).  Prescription antiviral medicines (e.g. acyclovir [Zovirax], famciclovir [Famvir], and valacyclovir [Valtrex]) are prescribed for episodic treatment or suppressive treatment.  Episodic treatment requires that the antiviral be taken when a reactivation and expression of the virus (outbreak) occurs and is no longer taken when the symptoms are gone.  Suppressive treatment, generally recommended for those who experience frequent outbreaks, requires that the antiviral be taken daily to suppress the virus from reactivation.  Suppressive treatment with prescription antivirals is not 100% effective in suppressing reactivation.  Antivirals used episodically or to suppress cannot stop future outbreaks, do not claim to prevent the expression of the virus, but claim to shorten the duration of the expression, or lessen the frequency in which outbreaks occur.Not all who have the virus that causes cold sores have access to prescription drugs, and paying regularly for a prescription used to treat a condition that will continue in perpetuity but is not (in most cases) life threatening, is not a cost that can be absorbed by all socioeconomic groups.  As shown in the data below, there are millions affected in several developing countries.  It can be inferred that prescription medicines are not easily accessed for those populations. Once the company becomes self-sustaining, I will continue to seek out good-will channels to provide the product to people in these countries free of charge (beyond what's provided from perks).

http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/20... With the increase in pursuits of healthy living, coupled with the intention of decreasing consumption/exposure to chemicals, and widespread notions of pharmaceutical companies having hidden agendas, there is a growing population of people resistant to contact with chemicals and to taking prescription drugs.  In part, these notions have contributed to a movement toward homeopathic methods.  Over the counter products currently available make claims to either provide relief of symptoms of an outbreak, to shorten healing time, or both. The OTC product currently with the largest market share, is an ointment/cream as the medium for the chemical docosanol.  This cream calls attention to the symptoms expressed on the face because of the product’s highly visible nature – in spite of efforts to be more discreet by creating other product lines that combine its core product with skin-colored bandages to camouflage the cream. The figure below presents data from 2014.  The OTC product with the most market share shortens the healing time of a cold sore.  Garr provides a natural, more effective way to enable the body to defend itself from a cold sore.Risks & ChallengesOne of the first obstacles facing the product is visibility within a sales platform that is completely internet based.  While the online platform simplifies other challenges, it is easy for products to get lost in a sea of information and other products with established brand recognition.  Root is fortunate to have some brand ambassadors with media exposure due to their professions, who have already agreed to give the product blasts on their social media. We are also hoping that the 3D animation is edgy enough to get some viral traction and views. Ultimately, we will need to spend some money on marketing efforts in order to ensure visibility, and we are still exploring which avenues are the best fit for the brand.  For example, Sirius Radio’s Comedy Central (channel 95) has the type of tone that we would initially see as a fit.An inevitable future challenge will be increasing regulations for the 30 billion dollar supplement industry.  As the regulatory environment evolves with the booming supplement industry, Root should be ahead of the eight ball with its near-term entry to the market.  As Root grows and Garr, The Cold Sore Warrior(TM) gains visibility and market share, we anticipate Root having the position and the resources to evolve alongside regulatory bodies as they begin to increase and tailor their oversight efforts and measures.A good challenge that we hope Root will face is how to transition to the right management team, once the product begins to outgrow current management – yours truly.  Additional team members are already teed up to assume posts once revenue is generated – including a Marketing Director with years of experience in the supplement industry.  Still, an effective product in a huge market, that has the capability of disruption, has the capacity to ‘blow up.’  It will be important to proactively assemble a talented, relevant team that has the reach and specific industry experience to carry the torch and take the product into the big leagues.Other Ways You Can HelpThank you for taking the time to explore Root, LLC and meet Garr, The Cold Sore Warrior(TM)!  Even if you decide not to back us and become part of the Root family, we would be very grateful if you would use those Indiegogo share tools and pass the information on to anyone you know who deals with cold sores.  The whole reason this effort began was to make sure that others had the chance to fight back a cold sore.  The formula/method in Garr’s defense works and can truly change the life of a person who struggles with the threat of cold sores.  It changed mine.",1.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h2><strong>There is a Global Antivenom Crisis. </strong></h2>
<p>Snake bites kill over 100,000 people a year, and leave another 150,000 permanently disabled. Major manufacturers of antivenoms are discontinuing their products, as snake bites preferentially affect less lucrative developing world markets. The antivenoms that exist are developed using crude serological extracts from sheep that have been injected with snake venom. These traditional antivenoms are usually specific to only one snake, produce inflammation reactions in the patients, are cruel to animals, vary in quality by batch, and can only be administered once, as the second administration produces an life-threatening immune reaction against the horse/donkey proteins. The sheep antibodies contain less than 5% antivenom antibodies and are digested into Fab fragments with short half-lives, therefore requiring multiple expensive injections, and the antibodies have not been engineered for stability, meaning that the antivenom can spoil in areas without refrigeration where it is often needed.</p>
<h3><strong>The World Needs a fully human, thermostabilized, universal antivenom. </strong></h3>
<p>A human bit by a snake will generate fully human antibodies against the snake venom, providing some protection in a subsequent exposure. For the past 16 years, Tim Friede has been boosted over 700 times with snake venom, including over 200 snake bits from live snakes. Over the course of these boosts, he has developed a remarkable immunity to snakes that would be ordinarily lethal, including cobras, taipans, black mambas, diamondback rattlers, and many others. He is resistant to a genetically diverse panel of snakes spanning the Americas, Asia, Africa, Australia, and Europe, indicating that he has affinity matured broadly neutralizing antibodies that can recognize and neutralize all snake venoms. Research on his blood have identified extremely elevated IgG4 anti-sera against snake venoms and a generally elevated IgG. Tim's blood contains the instructions for a universal, fully human antivenom.</p>
<p><strong>How we'll do it ...</strong></p>
<p>Tim had some of his blood drawn and sent it to Jake's labs. From there at Jake's labs, Ray extracted the RNA from his B cells and amplified the DNA that encodes his antibodies. Ray then converted that DNA into an antibody display technology to both read millions of his antibodies with genomic sequencing technologies as well as mine through his antibodies.</p>
<p>In Q2 of 2018, we at Mithros Bioscience will use a robotics platform to search through Tim's blood to look for the binders against venoms from all major snake species. From there we will narrow it down to a minimum set of concentrated fully human antibodies. </p>
<h3>This will act as an antivenom for the entire world.</h3>
<p>Allowing a single dose that provides complete protection for all patients and greatly reduce costs.</p>

To this end, we aim to implement Four Pillars of Care: high-oxygen hyperbaric therapy, hormone replacement therapy, life coaching/psychotherapy, and ketamine infusion treatment. Peer-reviewed academic research has proven these methods more effective than the treatments being utilized at this time. Although our personal experiences as veterans and first responders first led us to pursue this endeavour, our ultimate objective is to draw upon recent scientific breakthroughs to revolutionize the way that mental health issues are treated in this country.</p>
<p>The founders of the Invictus Institute, Sam Peterson and Jeffrey Haugland, are both combat veterans who have suffered from PTSD, TBI and Depression. They are seeking to bring patient-focused care to the treatment of mental health. In addition to providing access to more effective treatments, </p>
<p>The ultimate vision for the Invictus Institute is to provide access to more effective care, as well as, influencing policy change in the field of mental health. We will track the results of our treatment protocols through the use of pre and post treatment QSPECT scans, provided by our partner Cerescan. QSPECT scans are pivotal to our mission for two reasons. Our patients will be able to see the results of the treatments they have undergone in a visual representation. With this visualized data insurance companies and policymakers will no longer be able to ignore the quantifiable effects of more effective mental health care. </p>
<p>By donating to our cause you will be bringing us one step closer to providing patients suffering from these disorders hope!

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We are seeking $75,000 to aid in the startup costs of establishing our first clinic. This money will go towards a downpayment on a multi-place hyperbaric chamber($50,000) as well as the purchasing of monitoring equipment and infusion pumps for ketamine infusions($10,000) as well the cost of clinic accreditation and an electronic records system. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal the funds raised will go towards the purchasing of equipment that is necessary for daily operations. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Everyone in this country is affected by mental illness. it is estimated that 1 in 4 Americans suffers from some form of mental illness. With the recent explosion of mass shootings in our country, it is clear that we are in dire need of a better solution to our mental health problem. We believe that we can provide a solution by changing the process by which mental health disorders are treated. Our goal is to change the world! and we are asking for YOUR help! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The largest hurdle that we face is funding, we already have a team of licensed clinicians who are ready to step into clinical treatment rolls once we have established our first location. </p>
<p>We will be tackling the issue of funding in a number of ways but crowdfunding is our first choice for fundraising. Other sources of funding include private investors, donations and loans. </p>

<p style=""color: rgb(201, 158, 100);"">​WHAT THE HELL?</p>
<p>CIRCL is a social distancing box. Due to its simple use and its efficiency, it prevents close contact between two individuals at less than 6 feet (2m) by signalling the presence of the other by an audible signal. CIRCL helps to change habits today for a certain future, more than 6 feet (2m) away from the other.</p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">WHO'S CIRCLING FOR?</p>
<p>CIRCL offers a solution for effective social distancing. It is therefore suitable for all spaces with many people, such as schools, offices, warehouses, retirement homes or even for your children and teenagers.</p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">WHY USE IT?</p>
<p>Setting up an effective social distancing allows our companies to perpetuate work quickly while reducing health risks. Thus, using CIRCL is a commitment to the protection of individuals in the workplace or elsewhere.</p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">DOES CIRCL WORK ANYWHERE ?</p>
<p>Yes, Circl works everywhere, both indoor and outdoor. Even in a noisy surrounding, the alarm will warn you if someone is too close to you.</p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">DO I NEED TO DOWNLOAD A MOBILE APPLICATION?</p>
<p>No, Circl works fully when you unpack it. If you want to extend the detection features, then you can download the mobile App CIRCL ME.</p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">HOW'S PRODUCTION GOING?</p>
<p>Initially, our project was not what it is today, but in view of the current pandemic, we thought it useful to transform it in favour of social distancing. Thus, our production line has already been launched and our first boxes are ready for use. We can therefore ensure delivery as early as July.</p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">WHY THIS CAMPAIGN?</p>
<p>Launching this crowdfunding campaign allows us to have enough pre-sales so that we can launch the final production. In the meantime, we are finishing the packaging and the mobile application.</p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">WHAT IS THE MOBILE APPLICATION?</p>
<p>Our team is currently developing a mobile application available on the Play Store as well as on the App Store in parallel with CIRCL. It will allow to set the minimum distance between each box which is 6 feet (2m) by default. In addition, the application will be able to update CIRCL in a few seconds when new features are available. </p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">HOW TO CONFIGURE IT?</p>
<p>We wanted to make CIRCL an easy to use tool to make it accessible to anyone. Just press the power button and it will be immediately recognized by all the other CIRCLs around it. To turn it off, nothing could be simpler, just press the power button again for 3 seconds. </p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY USED?</p>
<p>In order to extend the battery life, we decided to use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This safe and reliable radio technology allows each CIRCL box to detect all the other boxes around it, without the need to synchronize them beforehand.</p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">WHAT ABOUT THE BATTERY?</p>
<p>For efficient use, the included battery lasts for three months. CIRCL uses CR2477 batteries, easily found on the market for about $1.5. CIRCL comes with one CR2477 battery. </p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">IS THE DATA PROTECTED?</p>
<p>CIRCL emits weak BLE radio signals to operate. No location data is stored in CIRCL. It does not communicate with the mobile application, unless you want. Your data is therefore secure.</p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">EXTRA CHARGES?</p>
<p>No additional fees apply after the purchase of CIRCL. All you need are spare batteries, which cost about $1.5.</p>
<p style=""color:#c99e64;"">AFTER THE COVID?</p>
<p>After the covid-19, CIRCL lends itself to many uses, such as setting up a panic button that will alert your loved ones in the event of an attack. This functionality can be added to CIRCL thanks to our mobile application.</p>
<p> </p>

CIRCL is delivered with its battery, and we provide a lanyard for each CIRCL to makeit wearable.

 

Our team is currently developing an application that allows CIRCL to be updated in just a few seconds when a new feature is available. For example, CIRCL a panic button will be available on CIRCL to alert relatives or contact the authorities in case of an assault, without having to take your phone out.
As you can see, CIRCL can continually reinvent itself to allow users to continue to use it.
The application will be available on the App store as well as on the Play Store.

CIRCL was initially not the social distancing project it is today. We decided in March 2020 to evolve our project into the one it is today in order to propose an effective solution to the COVID-19 crisis.
CIRCL is now ready for production, pre-order it and get in july !

​WHAT THE HELL?
CIRCL is a social distancing box. Due to its simple use and its efficiency, it prevents close contact between two individuals at less than 6 feet (2m) by signalling the presence of the other by an audible signal. CIRCL helps to change habits today for a certain future, more than 6 feet (2m) away from the other.
WHO'S CIRCLING FOR?
CIRCL offers a solution for effective social distancing. It is therefore suitable for all spaces with many people, such as schools, offices, warehouses, retirement homes or even for your children and teenagers.
WHY USE IT?
Setting up an effective social distancing allows our companies to perpetuate work quickly while reducing health risks. Thus, using CIRCL is a commitment to the protection of individuals in the workplace or elsewhere.
DOES CIRCL WORK ANYWHERE ?
Yes, Circl works everywhere, both indoor and outdoor. Even in a noisy surrounding, the alarm will warn you if someone is too close to you.
DO I NEED TO DOWNLOAD A MOBILE APPLICATION?
No, Circl works fully when you unpack it. If you want to extend the detection features, then you can download the mobile App CIRCL ME.
HOW'S PRODUCTION GOING?
Initially, our project was not what it is today, but in view of the current pandemic, we thought it useful to transform it in favour of social distancing. Thus, our production line has already been launched and our first boxes are ready for use. We can therefore ensure delivery as early as July.
WHY THIS CAMPAIGN?
Launching this crowdfunding campaign allows us to have enough pre-sales so that we can launch the final production. In the meantime, we are finishing the packaging and the mobile application.
WHAT IS THE MOBILE APPLICATION?
Our team is currently developing a mobile application available on the Play Store as well as on the App Store in parallel with CIRCL. It will allow to set the minimum distance between each box which is 6 feet (2m) by default. In addition, the application will be able to update CIRCL in a few seconds when new features are available. 
HOW TO CONFIGURE IT?
We wanted to make CIRCL an easy to use tool to make it accessible to anyone. Just press the power button and it will be immediately recognized by all the other CIRCLs around it. To turn it off, nothing could be simpler, just press the power button again for 3 seconds. 
WHAT IS THE TECHNOLOGY USED?
In order to extend the battery life, we decided to use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). This safe and reliable radio technology allows each CIRCL box to detect all the other boxes around it, without the need to synchronize them beforehand.
WHAT ABOUT THE BATTERY?
For efficient use, the included battery lasts for three months. CIRCL uses CR2477 batteries, easily found on the market for about $1.5. CIRCL comes with one CR2477 battery. 
IS THE DATA PROTECTED?
CIRCL emits weak BLE radio signals to operate. No location data is stored in CIRCL. It does not communicate with the mobile application, unless you want. Your data is therefore secure.
EXTRA CHARGES?
No additional fees apply after the purchase of CIRCL. All you need are spare batteries, which cost about $1.5.
AFTER THE COVID?
After the covid-19, CIRCL lends itself to many uses, such as setting up a panic button that will alert your loved ones in the event of an attack. This functionality can be added to CIRCL thanks to our mobile application.",22.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3><b><i>Founder / CEO, Paul Francis, invented the first resistive exercise device in space for NASA</i></b></h3>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Inventor Paul Francis was in the coffee shop below his office reading an article about NASA searching for a solution to prevent astronauts from losing bone density and muscle mass during long duration space flights. Francis believed his SpiraFlex resistive technology could be the answer. He contacted the Chief Medical Officer at NASA and was invited to give a presentation at Johnson Space Center, which led to his SpiraFlex team developing the first Resistive Exercise Device (iRED) for use in space. So far, over 50 crewmembers on the International Space Station have kept in shape using his patented SpiraFlex technology.  </div>

</div></div>","Get Fit & Lean Where You Are Right Now! Imagine a total body gym that only weighs 2 lbs, yet produces up to 25 lbs of smooth resistance that feels like free-weights — and folds up to fit in your pocket or carry bag!The OYO Gym is powered by our patented SpiraFlex® resistance technology used to keep NASA astronauts in shape on the International Space Station.  World's only exercise device that applies resistance to both sides of muscle groups in one motion, building a balanced body in half the time. Combining strength with movement, without weight or momentum, our portable gym is the new way to get fit where you are right now! The OYO Gym is the ""heavy duty"" second generation of our popular DoubleFlex, featuring more resistance and cable extension — and this gym folds up to fit in your pocket or carry bag. What makes the OYO Gym superior to other fitness equipment like free-weights and resistance bands?Free-weights work great but are not portable, and trying to control momentum can cause joint pain. Resistance bands produce progressive resistance (like rubber bands), which means the muscle is only fully activated at the end of the movement. SpiraFlex resistance is smooth and linear like free-weights, without the weight or momentum. SpiraFlex FlexPacks rated at 5 and 10 lbs. snap onto the OYO Gym, providing up to 25 lbs. of smooth resistance (feels like more, as you can't use momentum like weights), yet this gym weighs less than 2 lbs. The OYO Gym is the only device that provides abduction and adduction resistance during a single exercise movement, building a balanced body more efficiently. Also, since the DoubleFlex does not use gravity, a much wider range of functional exercises is possible in all planes of movement. Whether you are an athlete or just beginning to exercise, the OYO Gym can help you achieve your fitness goals right now, where you are!The OYO Gym PRO wirelessly connects our OYO Coaching App for iPhone (iOS) for real time pace coaching, rep counting and tracking of workouts. No matter which perk level you choose, iOS backers can download our free OYO Coaching App for the iPhone from the Apple App Store to stream video workouts and do the OYO 10 Week Challenge. OYO Gym PRO users can connect wirelessly to the app for real-time coaching and rep-counting. If your mobile device is on a platform other than Apple iOS, you can still stream workouts on our website or on our Vimeo channel. 


OYO Fitness Director Nick Bolton discusses the benefits of the DoubleFlex.
 


 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



The OYO Gym provides SpiraFlex resistance to opposite sides of muscle groups during each DOUBLEFLEX movement, in all planes of motion, building a balanced body in less time. 
 

Fitness Director Nick Bolton has created a range of workout programs for all fitness levels: from 5-minute targeted workout snacks, to full-body HIIT programs that will push you to your limits. 
Our yoga and Pilates programs add strength and flexibility to classic routines, and our Walking and Pump & Pedal workouts add strength training to daily cardio activities.   
Our OYO Coaching App (available for free download for Apple  iOS) offers new workout programs to Get Fit and Lean, while tracking progress to help get you into the best shape of your life.  
The included Exercise Wall Chart demonstrates step-by-step how to perform 75 exercises. 

 
 




  
Fitness Director Nick Bolton developed DoubleFlex workout and nutrition programs for all fitness levels, which were used in his highly successful 10-Week DoubleFlex Challenge Program. Using the original first generation DoubleFlex 3 to 5 times per week and following nutrition guidelines, 15 participants lost an average of 17 pounds and 19 inches in just 10 weeks.
The OYO Gym feels like free-weight or cable machine resistance, yet weighs less than 2 pounds. You can skip the crowded and expensive health club, and enjoy a total body workout at your convenience. 
 

 





This campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped over 5,000 creators make their projects a reality.



 

 

 
Founder / CEO, Paul Francis, invented the first resistive exercise device in space for NASA

 
Inventor Paul Francis was in the coffee shop below his office reading an article about NASA searching for a solution to prevent astronauts from losing bone density and muscle mass during long duration space flights. Francis believed his SpiraFlex resistive technology could be the answer. He contacted the Chief Medical Officer at NASA and was invited to give a presentation at Johnson Space Center, which led to his SpiraFlex team developing the first Resistive Exercise Device (iRED) for use in space. So far, over 50 crewmembers on the International Space Station have kept in shape using his patented SpiraFlex technology.  
 
 

 

OYO Fitness creates innovative fitness solutions to enable you to get fit On Your Own — helping you meet and beat life’s challenges.
OYO integrates SpiraFlex technology into fitness products that are lightweight, compact, and provide the same benefits as training with free weights.   
Studies show that resistance training not only builds bone density, lean muscle, and burns fat — you will also feel better, look younger, and live longer!


 

  


Paul Francis left the architectural profession to become an inventor (over 20 US and 32 foreign patents so far), launching products in the hardware, personal care and fitness industries. He has also licensed SpiraFlex resistance technology to Nautilus Inc. to power their top of the line home gym, the Bowflex Revolution. 
Francis founded OYO Fitness to integrate SpiraFlex into On Your Own fitness solutions that fit into your fast paced lifestyle. Can't make it to the gym? No problem.

<p>To give a brief example of one of our apps (""Emotion Charades""), the autistic adult or child sees an emoji floating on either side of the partner's face, and tilts her/his head to chose the one that matches the facial expression, for a reward.  Meanwhile, the software automatically monitors her/his performance as well as anxiety or stress level. (Learn more about this app, and our others, down below.)</p>

<p>Afterward, every response, all timings, and even measures of stress and anxiety can be accessed in your web account. It is like automatic session notes for the therapist or teacher, and it includes more data than any person could record during a session. For a parent, you can view past progress and predict the future. </p>
<p>The user is <strong>not</strong> expected to wear the system all day. It is like piano lessons (but more fun), or sports practice (but can be done at home): to be practiced about <strong>30 minutes per day</strong>. </p>
<p>It <strong>feels like a video game</strong> but is <strong>clinically proven</strong> to address daily challenges of autism. </p>
<p>We aim to help people with autism be understood, not cured; accepted, not isolated; empowered, not forced. As we say it, we aim to ""<strong>empower every brain</strong>""!</p>
<p><i>A note on language</i>: people prefer different words (<i>e.g.</i> ""<strong>autistic</strong>"" vs ""<strong>with autism</strong>""; or how to describe ""functioning"" levels). At Brain Power, we try to switch among them. We don't want to offend anyone. We just want to do good science and help deserving people improve their lives! </p>

<li>Google Glass is a very technologically advanced,  and its ""heads-up"" nature makes <strong>it uniquely suited to instructive apps centered around social skills</strong>.</li>
<li>However, <i>Glass costs $1500</i>. </li>
<li>This is by far the largest part of our price, and it is for Google, <strong>not for us.</strong>

Rather, or in addition, we see success in terms of broadly useful features such as self-confidence, sense of self, agency, and decreases in anxiety. We have clinically observed decreases in ADHD symptoms following Empowered Brain sessions. We have observed flourishing of confidence in children and young adults in their regular lives (outside of sessions with the system) that has made their parents cry in joy.  </p><p>All of the Empowered Brain modules are engineered for users to teach themselves life skills crucial for happy self-sufficiency, and to generalize these skills into everyday life.

Typically a teacher, therapist, or other practitioner would write notes manually after a session. These evaluations are necessarily subjective, and rooted in the practitioner’s particular clinical experience. Our system automatically generates session notes, and they include things like second-by-second accounts of body posture and attention that could not be noted by a human observer; and evaluations can made relative to all the people using the system in the world. </p><p>After your child/client uses any of our apps or games, you can go to the web portal for a very detailed analysis of: a) the current game, b) long term progress, and c) predictions for the future. </p><p>For instance, how many hundreds of times your child looked away in an hour, when she/he correctly guessed an emotion, levels of measured stress at every moment, minutes spent rocking, which graphics or music or rewards were most preferred, etc, etc. </p><p> </p><h3>A) Current game and real time data the user can see.</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><u><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.brain-power.com/wp-content/uploads/Brain_Power_CF__portal_data_progression__v1.gif"" src=""""/> </strong></u></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Example report from a single session from a live clinical trial session.</i></p><p>The system updates the data second-by-second, so you can have a real-time report on the progress of your child during that particular session, as shown in the image above.</p><p> </p><h3>B) Monthly data report of the user’s progress.</h3><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><u><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.brain-power.com/wp-content/uploads/Brain_Power_CF__portal_data_progression__v2.gif"" src=""""/></strong></u></i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Example of a progress report over the course of a month.</i></p><p>The system saves the information of your child’s progress for each game session on a monthly basis.

For instance, our founder drove around the country in an RV two years ago - visited families in West Virgina,  for example, and autism clinics in Missouri, and residential (24/7 care) facilities in Tennessee, and many more. He slept in the RV, in Walmart parking lots.  The goal was to immerse in the community, and learn. </p><p>We have learned, among many other things, that neither the healthcare system nor the educational system can meet all your needs.

However, it may take time.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/7xgCS0rypeI?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Video from one of our stops on the RV trip. See children delight in using </i>Empowered Brain<i> for the first time. (On the RV trip, the CEO and several team members drove around the country and visited families and clinics far outside our usual zone.)</i></p><p>Empowered Brain represents a totally new technology. It is clinical-grade, it was created by a large team of highly-trained professionals -- and it is the first wave. Technology prices always start high, which is the bad news; but the good news is that they always come way down in price. As we built this company, we learned more about why this happens. There are many reasons. To create something like this takes the coordinated work of many, many talented people, and many costs including salaries, legal fees, infrastructure, rent, computers, clinical trials, government fees, and so much more.</p><p>Also, since most people do not have their own Google Glass, we need to include one in our package. The price of Google Glass was set by Google - at $1500. We cannot control that. Luckily, it is a fantastic device, and we have selected it after trying many alternatives. </p><p>Eventually, however, the up-front costs like clinical trials and initial development will be repaid. Device prices will come down and devices will be more common. Accordingly we will bring prices down even further. </p><p>For now, we are doing the best we can to keep prices low even in this first wave, yet somehow we must pay our staff, and the other costs mentioned above.</p><p>Additionally, we created a payments plan, in response to many parents who asked for it. This allows you to pay over time. This means we bear more of the cost and risk, but it means your burden is lower, and we want to help in that way. </p><p>Also, many families find funds available that can help them, for instance from health savings accounts, local charities, Medicaid, Elks and Freemasons and other orders, school technology funds, and more. </p><p>However, if this is still out of reach, please stay in touch over the year and years. With time, we will find other ways to get something to you and to other families like yours.

On Indiegogo every purchase must be paid in a single transaction, immediately. Also, everything must be complete before the end of the campaign (Dec 22) and there is no option to continue after that.  This is just the nature of pre-order or crowdfunding campaigns on Indiegogo. <strong>Therefore, we needed to be creative</strong> to respond to your requests!</p><ol>
<li>We separated the price into 4 payments or installments!</li>
<li>We applied a very significant discount (temporarily!) to introduce this offer. </li>
</ol><p>In order to work with the Indiegogo system, we put a single ""Partial Payment"" item into the list of available items. To make all 4 payments, you would simply get this item 4 times. This offers the most flexibility, for the largest range of families. Here is how it works:</p><ul>
<li>If you purchase the ""Partial Payment"" option, you are in the system! Congratulations!</li>
<li>That single payment is like a ""down payment"" and it guarantees your place in line so that you will get the Empowered Brain system eventually.</li>
<li>You still need to make the remaining 3 payments, but there are some options.</li>
<li>If all 3 payments are completed within the duration of the campaign, you own Empowered Brain system (yay!) and you are a VIP. You will get yours first - before any other group. <ul><li>You will also receive a <strong>bonus </strong>of VIP training on your new system, and special support.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>To state it again, all you need to do in order to join the Brain Power mission and be guaranteed to get this science-based, engaging augmented-reality system for autism, is to make that first payment now. </li>
<li>There won't be another chance to order it for a while. (After the campaign we want to get back to the science and the speaking with families, rather than all this campaigning!) </li>

<li>A new Google Glass unit in the original box</li>
<li>Science-based apps that run on Google Glass</li>
<li>A companion app for phones and tablets (iOS/Apple or Android)</li>
<li>One parent/teacher account on our cloud-hosted web portal, with ongoing progress reports for each child and predictions of developmental progress</li>
<li>Three “child” accounts on the portal with gameplay data, high scores, and social sharing, <ol><li>School packs and the therapist pack include many more child accounts</li></ol>
</li>
<li>Software updates and patches forever</li>
</ol><p> </p><h3>What skillset does Empowered Brain address?</h3><p>Empowered Brain’s apps are engineered to empower users to teach themselves life skills crucial for happy self-sufficiency. For example, Emotion Charades is a game that helps teach emotion identification. The Player looks through the Google Glass screen and sees emojis on either side of their partner’s face. With a quick head tilt, he/she chooses which emoji correctly matches their partner’s facial expression, and earns gems. Unlike with other emotion-learning apps in which the Player is looking down at a tablet or phone, our software encourages social interaction with other people, keeping the Player heads-up and hands-free.</p><p>Drawing on everyone’s natural desire to play, the apps are played like video games - but they are based on brain science, and draw on the decades of validated success of behavioral interventions for autism.</p><p>BTW, our system is designed to be used for 30 min to an hour a day: your child/student will not have to wear it all day to benefit.</p><p> </p><h3>I’m a Therapist or Teacher. Will Empowered Brain replace my job? Or make it better?</h3><p><strong>You are not replaceable</strong>!  But you do probably spend a lot of your time documenting observations in sessions and following up on behaviors between visits.  The Empowered Brain system essentially takes your notes for you, including ones that weren’t possible before - accurately detailing each time the child looks at you or Mom, the duration of stimming episodes, accuracy of emotion decoding, awareness of a new environment, and even heart and breathing rates during the lessons.</p><p>Empowered Brain even allows you to review and monitor your clients’ progress between sessions - and because the apps feel like games, your client is more likely to perform. Our goal is to complement your efforts, and help you engage and encourage skill development more efficiently for more clients.</p><p> </p><h3>I’m a parent - can Empowered Brain replace certain therapies?</h3><p>Empowered Brain is designed to carry on where therapist visits leave off, making it easier and more likely for your child to practice certain key skills.  It also allows the therapist to monitor progress remotely and for each visit. If your child improves more rapidly and consistently because of Empowered Brain, it gets him/her on a track to self-sufficiency more rapidly and makes the therapist’s job more efficient.</p><p>The system is designed to unlock more power from each therapist visit via better and more engaged practice between visits, closer monitoring, and science-based activities that are designed to speed up progress.  In this way, you can get more value from the dollars spent or therapy sessions used, and advance your child further on the path of self-sufficiency and integration.</p><p> </p><h3>Will this work for my unique child?</h3><p>We have tested our system with hundreds of children and adults on the autism spectrum!</p><p>Parents are routinely surprised by the fact that their child can tolerate Google Glass and our software, and are even more surprised at how rapidly and easily they learn to use it.  Many times in our clinical trial sessions or informal tests, the child is teaching the parent how to use the system within a few minutes! We’ve studied this formally and scientifically during clinical trials in a wide age range, across the autism spectrum. Papers from Stage 1 of our trials are starting to emerge in peer-reviewed scientific and medical literature.  For instance, see the following papers [<a href=""https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fped.2017.00145/full"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1</a>] [<a href=""http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/14/165514"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2</a>] [<a href=""http://mhealth.jmir.org/2017/9/e140/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3</a>] [<a href=""http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/08/06/164335"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">4</a>]</p><p>We cannot guarantee it will work for your unique child, but based on our experience, there is a much better chance than you may think.</p><p> </p><h3>Isn’t Google Glass dead?</h3><p><strong>No</strong>! Please see the details further up in this campaign page.</p><p>(The quick answer is: they released a new version of Google Glass just this summer, proving the program is continuing (which we already knew), and Brain Power was selected as one of their few official distribution partners. We are one of the very few companies who can sell Glass!  Also, other manufacturers aside from Google are releasing smartglasses, so there are additional options.)</p><p> </p><h3>Will Empowered Brain be possible for my child to wear? She/he doesn’t even like sunglasses.</h3><p>Well, what do sunglasses do for your child? They mostly put a high-contrast boundary in peripheral vision, where the glasses leave off and the bright sunlight crashes in. That’s neither pleasant nor sensible, and the long-term benefits of wearing sunglasses are relatively remote to a child.</p><p>With our glasses, you might become a cartoon character, or a way to earn gold stars and points! The world seems different and more fun, and is on kids’ terms. Our glasses are also a vehicle toward the things that matter so dearly to a child, such as fitting in, getting a date, being invited, and eventually getting a job.</p><p>Ultimately that might seem a lot more valuable to a child than sunglasses. And in the end, any minor inconvenience of wearing something may be outweighed by its benefit, in the same way people ultimately learn to wear shoes or clothing. But again, don’t take our word for it -- take a look at our videos and published papers!</p><p> </p><h3>Can adults also benefit from using Empowered Brain?</h3><p><strong>Yes</strong>. Our current apps span a range of functioning levels and ages, and the apps in development will extend that range even further. For instance, many of us adults can benefit from coaching in subtleties such as knowing when to look at people,  knowing what they’re feeling, and knowing how to mirror back their facial expressions at precisely the right time to make them feel valued and heard. Also, stay tuned for some exciting developments in the works, including job training and job coaching for adults on the spectrum.</p><p> </p><h3>Is it comfortable to wear for hours?</h3><p><strong>You don’t have to!</strong></p><p>Think of this like piano lessons. You carry neither your piano nor teacher all day with you, but a half hour or hour a day of concentrated practice teaches the brain needed skills, and goes a long way!</p><p>That being said, the device is comfortable and light; and in our scientific studies no major negative effects were reported.</p><p> </p><h3>Can one system be used by multiple family members?</h3><p><strong>Yes</strong>. Like many families use a single computer or iPad for several children, you can give them each a chance to use our apps and benefit in their own customized way. With your parent account you can create up to 3 child accounts (more for teacher or therapist accounts).  Each child's game progress is stored separately -- this way, they can even have a competition! That being said, some children may want or need their own system, much as they may want their own phone or iPad. </p><p> </p><h3>Is it hard to set up and use? And do I need to sign up for anything else to use my system (like one has to sign up for phone service to use a phone?)</h3><p><strong>No</strong>. Setup is quick. Instructions and short “how-to” videos are in your parent/teacher account. You can connect Glass to the internet via WiFi or your phone.</p><p> </p><h3>What is the warranty or return policy?</h3><p>If our software is malfunctioning we will deliver patches remotely to fix it. If it cannot be fixed remotely, we will accept the device back and fix the software. If the hardware breaks, we cannot fix the hardware -- it is all sealed and self-contained like a phone so it is not serviceable and we are not hardware engineers. We cannot issue refunds of your orders. However, when you receive Empowered Brain you will have 15 days to test it, and to return it for a refund if it does not work for you. </p><p>Every dollar you help raise translates directly to helping children and adults on the spectrum. </p><p> </p><h3>Is the system trying to “normalize” people with autism?</h3><p><strong>No</strong>. At Brain Power we are deeply respectful of people on the autism spectrum, and of each human being’s right and desire to independently express his or her own personality. There is no one normal and there is no one right way to be. We already have multiple apps for multiple types of skills and are making more.  We try to make very different experiences for different challenges, and we focus on challenges that affect everyone (but generally affect people on the spectrum more).</p><p>At the core, our mission is about happy self-sufficiency, and about empowering you and your child to unlock the prodigious power of every brain.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511974949/fli7wy4mfke7get69cpr.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">CLINICALLY PROVEN</h2><p> </p><p>The scientific team at Brain Power has previously authored several dozen peer-reviewed papers in high-impact medical journals, including <strong><i>Science</i></strong> and <strong><i>Nature Neuroscience</i></strong>.</p><p>Below are some of the papers from the first part of Stage 1 of the Empowered Brain clinical trials. They include the first appearance in the scientific literature of the new version of Google Glass (the Enterprise Edition), and  the first appearance of autism-related work on any version of  Glass. The papers clinically demonstrate that Empowered Brain is a safe, feasible, and tolerable approach to aid children and adults on the autism spectrum. They also show that the system can function for individuals aged 4 to 24 and older, speaking and non-speaking, in clinic and at school.</p><p> Additional papers are emerging soon - stay tuned! </p><p> </p><p><strong>Tolerable across the spectrum:</strong></p><ul><li>Keshav NU, Salisbury JP, Vahabzadeh A, and Sahin NT.

Introducing the ""Empowered Brain"" System for Autism

The World’s First Wearable Social-Emotional Skills Coach for People with Autism
The Empowered Brain™ system by Brain Power aims to empower children and adults all along the autism spectrum to teach themselves practical life skills, and assess their progress numerically.  

 
Based on brain science from MIT and Harvard, these apps facilitate life skills such as language, emotional understanding, eye contact, control of behaviors, conversation skills, meltdown prevention, social connection, self-confidence, perspective-taking, and more. The system can help people with autism to better understand, interact with, and enjoy the world around them. These are the skills for self-sufficiency, and we believe that The Soft Skills are the Hard Skills&trade;!
Empowered Brain apps run on Google Glass, which is a very impressive wearable computer. When you wear Glass, you can still see the world around you. Yet you also see (and hear) our social apps at the same time: through the see-through computer screen, and ""bone-conduction"" speaker. This is fundamentally better than an iPad or phone, because with those, your child is looking down and locked in another world. Empowered Brain keeps the wearer (such as your child) heads-up, hands-free, and engaged with the social world!

 

 
To give a brief example of one of our apps (""Emotion Charades""), the autistic adult or child sees an emoji floating on either side of the partner's face, and tilts her/his head to chose the one that matches the facial expression, for a reward.  Meanwhile, the software automatically monitors her/his performance as well as anxiety or stress level. (Learn more about this app, and our others, down below.)

 

 
Afterward, every response, all timings, and even measures of stress and anxiety can be accessed in your web account. It is like automatic session notes for the therapist or teacher, and it includes more data than any person could record during a session. For a parent, you can view past progress and predict the future. 
The user is not expected to wear the system all day. It is like piano lessons (but more fun), or sports practice (but can be done at home): to be practiced about 30 minutes per day. 
It feels like a video game but is clinically proven to address daily challenges of autism. 
We aim to help people with autism be understood, not cured; accepted, not isolated; empowered, not forced. As we say it, we aim to ""empower every brain""!
A note on language: people prefer different words (e.g. ""autistic"" vs ""with autism""; or how to describe ""functioning"" levels). At Brain Power, we try to switch among them. We don't want to offend anyone. We just want to do good science and help deserving people improve their lives! 
Empowered Brain provides value for parents, therapists, teachers, schools, practitioners, and of course people on the spectrum.  Read more to learn how it can apply to you. 
 
Patents pending worldwide. 
 
We are ready to empower you!


 



You may have heard rumors about Glass or wondered about the future of the device. The good news is that Google released a new version of Glass a few months ago. We even published the first scientific research paper that shows the new Glass. Further details are down below.  Also, our software can run on the dozens of other smartglasses that have recently emerged. Thus, one way or another Empowered Brain is here to stay!




 
In case you wondered! (Brief answers to questions we often hear are in the graphic below.)
 

 
More information is in the FAQ at the bottom of the page.
  



Brain Power has been in over 250 articles and TV appearances around the world, 
 


We have partners for success! We are amazingly fortunate for their support. (Additional partners listed  down below.)

Empowered Brain will ship with a suite of social-emotional learning apps, including the 3 that are explained in the main video at the top of this page.  These focus on 1.) decoding emotions, 2.) looking at people when they speak, and 3.) managing the stress and anxiety of transitions. They also address self-confidence, attention, learning mindset, social-referencing, and self-regulation. 

These three Empowered Brain apps have already been through clinical trials in children and adults with autism. Results from these successful clinical trials have been published in peer-reviewed medical research journals (see the references section near the bottom of this page for more details).  
Please see the main video (click the video-thumbnail at the top of this page) for more about each app and to see the system in action with families touched by autism. 

An additional set of apps is scheduled for release shortly, as described even further below. You will receive all the apps that are available at the time of shipping, as well as perpetual patches and updates to them. 

 

Empowered Brain includes several components that work together:

Smartglasses - Google Glass
Science-based apps that run on Glass
A companion app for iOS or Android
One parent/teacher account on our cloud-hosted web portal
“Child” accounts on the portal, with gameplay data, high scores, and social sharing
Software updates and patches 

All components of the Empowered Brain system work together seamlessly.

Autism, and our technology, are of interest to many notable people.(Pictures are not specific endorsements.)



 
Above: A few of the hundreds of autistic adults and children who have successfully used the Empowered Brain glasses and software by Brain Power. We have worked with young and old, speaking and non-speaking, around the country and the world. 
Will my unique child be able to use it? Our years of experience with hundreds of children and adults all along the spectrum suggest the answer is likely yes. We have  published  peer-reviewed scientific papers showing Empowered Brain is safe, and is usable by autistic individuals across a broad range of ages and speaking / functioning abilities.Parents are routinely surprised their children will wear these augmented-reality glasses even if they won't wear sunglasses. It may be because these glasses convert people's faces into cartoons, play their favorite music, and turn interacting with others into a rewarding video game.Our Founder, and the Brain Power team, are deeply committed to bringing this award-winning, technology-based yet human-centric approach to every family touched by autism. That being said, there are some facts we would like to explain briefly.
Google Glass is a very technologically advanced,  and its ""heads-up"" nature makes it uniquely suited to instructive apps centered around social skills.
However, Glass costs $1500. 
This is by far the largest part of our price, and it is for Google, not for us.

Also, we somehow must cover costs of engineering a world-class, clinical-grade product, and the salaries of our engineers, doctors, scientists, educators, and others -- several of whom identify as autistic. 
Yet, out of our desire to reach families, we are offering heavy discounts on the basic package, and creative installment payments plans. Thus, you can pay less, and over time!
 Brain Power's apps focus on useful and universal skills such as emotional understanding, empathy, eye contact, anxiety and stress management, attention, awareness of environment, transitions, communication skills, habits, and various cognitive skills. We take a very practical approach, and we have met with many, many families in great detail and have brought out tools into their homes and schools. Importantly, success and progress are measured not just in terms of the specific skill in each app, such as emotion decoding or eye contact. Rather, or in addition, we see success in terms of broadly useful features such as self-confidence, sense of self, agency, and decreases in anxiety. We have clinically observed decreases in ADHD symptoms following Empowered Brain sessions. We have observed flourishing of confidence in children and young adults in their regular lives (outside of sessions with the system) that has made their parents cry in joy.  All of the Empowered Brain modules are engineered for users to teach themselves life skills crucial for happy self-sufficiency, and to generalize these skills into everyday life. We have studies how students in the classroom setting, for instance, apply the skills they learn from Empowered Brain to the rest of their schoolwork and social interactions at school.All of this is made possible by advanced artificial intelligence and augmented reality inside our patent-pending software. However, the experience to the user (and parent/therapist) is very smooth and simple, and does not feel complicated or ""academic"". The goal is to empower the user to express more of the raw intelligence, or brain power, she or he already has (but which can sometimes be locked in or masked). Founder, Dr. Ned Sahin, often says that Brain Power ""uses artificial intelligence to unlock natural intelligence.""Our apps are designed somewhat like video games, drawing on our natural desire to play and to compete. You can see some of them in action in the campaign video at the top of this page.What makes our Empowered Brain apps unique is that they are also based on brain science and the principles of a modern movement known as ""serious gaming"". The ""gamification"" of learning and even clinical therapy has been scientifically demonstrated to have a profound positive effect, even in people who don't traditionally play games. Empowered Brain now runs on all Android smartglasses. This means that we have a long future and can adapt our system to new devices that emerge. That being said, we have selected Google Glass as the smartglasses of choice, after testing with many alternatives.  You will receive a brand-new Google Glass unit in the original factory box.  It is NOT Fragile!    Empowered Brain is easy to use and we will train you ahead of time to make sure everything is smooth and great. 
Your Google Glass unit is unlocked, and can be used anywhere in the world
It is easy to use and we will supply how-to videos and web-casts 
You will soon be teaching other people, and watching the delight in their faces.
Glass will pair with iPhones as well as Android phones. Also, you can use it on WiFi as a completely stand-device. It does not need to be paired with a phone.
Our software is also easy to use.
Hundreds of people with autism have used and enjoyed it, as have their families. 
Our clinical trials have demonstrated the system is very usable, across much of the spectrum. 
A heart-breaking question that parents of children with autism have vocalized to us many times is: “What would happen to my child once I am gone?”. These and other questions are what make us take our work so deeply seriously, day and night. We are committed to working dilligently, and scientifically, for your family and families like yours, to give answers and to inspire well-grounded hope. Empowered Brain measures numerical data and can give you a report on progress each day. This empowers you to know how your child is doing, and to make predictions about the future, grounded in real data. We also have recently developed a set of apps and tools that focus on job-preparedness and then job coaching. Stay tuned for more information. We know that having a job is probably the highest form of dignity and self-sufficiency, and we are committed to helping people gain employment. Brief video explaining the Emotion Charades app. (Click above to play video.)New England Cable News - Interview with founder Dr. Ned T.

These form a job-coaching and job readiness platform, and are suitable for individuals who are a bit older and/or are ready for this deeply important life transition.Anxiety and Stress. Two of our next apps focus on reducing stress and anxiety. They can even work with non-speaking and anxiety-prone individuals. They use artificial intelligence, and patented methods for detecting biomarkers of stress. Daily Activity Assist. For younger individuals or those working on foundational skills, we have an app that assists some of the simple daily tasks such as brushing teeth; and it makes them wildly fun and motivating.In short, Empowered Brain includes benefits for young children all the way to adults, and people who do not speak all the way to  people employed at technology companies. Stay tuned for announcements about these newest apps. There is a lot we are ready and able to do! Yet, we need your help to get there. Together, we can rewrite the future of autism! Please, Empower Us!Empowered brain offers an unprecedented way to evaluate your child’s (or your) performance and progress. Typically a teacher, therapist, or other practitioner would write notes manually after a session. These evaluations are necessarily subjective, and rooted in the practitioner’s particular clinical experience. Our system automatically generates session notes, and they include things like second-by-second accounts of body posture and attention that could not be noted by a human observer; and evaluations can made relative to all the people using the system in the world. After your child/client uses any of our apps or games, you can go to the web portal for a very detailed analysis of: a) the current game, b) long term progress, and c) predictions for the future. For instance, how many hundreds of times your child looked away in an hour, when she/he correctly guessed an emotion, levels of measured stress at every moment, minutes spent rocking, which graphics or music or rewards were most preferred, etc, etc.  A) Current game and real time data the user can see. Example report from a single session from a live clinical trial session.The system updates the data second-by-second, so you can have a real-time report on the progress of your child during that particular session, as shown in the image above. B) Monthly data report of the user’s progress.Example of a progress report over the course of a month.The system saves the information of your child’s progress for each game session on a monthly basis. It presents the information to you all in the same place. C) Total data report of all sessions plus user’s potential growth. Example of a performance report that is mapping the potential growth of the user.The system saves the child’s data from each of the sessions played, provides a detailed report on his or her progress, and provides information on the child’s potential growth, based on  previous performance.The cloud-based web portal is advanced beyond anything that currently exists. Parents often tell us it finally gives them the visibility and insight they have always wanted, and the reassurance of numerical, objective data. They appreciate that the assessment and criteria won't change if they move to a new town or new school, whereas in the past whenever they had a new doctor or teacher the whole evaluation process could start again from scratch. Therapists (BCBA's, OT's, SLP's, etc) tell us that the idea of automatically-generated session notes, with more detailed data than ever possible, is transformative for their practice. They also say that being able to offer this advanced (yet easy-to-use) technology differentiates them from their competitors.  Brain Power has been humbled and honored to receive a wide range of international as well as community-specific awards:

 You have found us on Indiegogo and you might be wondering why we are here.IndieGoGo is often called a ""crowd funding"" platform, and we are most interested in the ""crowd""!  We want to reach you, our community, and find ways to make a difference in the lives of thousands of families we might not ever otherwise meet. That is why we are so interested in the ""crowd"". You can hep with this goal by posting this page in parents' groups on social media; and on your own pages. Each voice matters to us, and matters deeply. The main use of this site is to allow pre-orders of our clinically-tested product. After careful scientific work and lots of time spent immersed in family and classroom and clinical settings with the people we wish to benefit, we are opening orders to the general public! It is an exciting time. Also, Indiegogo is convenient in that it allows us to have a digital ""storefront"" and it manages all the hassles of online selling, for us. Please have a read of this site and we hope you will get the system for your family. We ship worldwide. One thing about Indiegogo: we can only keep a campaign open for a few weeks. That is just the way it works. After that, all the selling is over, and the discounts are gone. Therefore, the time for you to get the Empowered Brain system is very limited.If you have further questions, please contact us at empower@brain-power.comWe elected to use Indiegogo as a way to allow pre-orders of our Empowered Brain product. Pre-Orders pay for the expensive hardware (Google Glass) and some of the software development we have already done.Our team of PhD's, MD's, engineers, artists, and more have invested in it for years. We believe Empowered Brain is an extraordinary and cutting-edge product for your family. We have a clear roadmap to finalize it and get it to you. We are looking forward to serving your family's needs. We have witnessed and can feel many of the struggles you may be going through. For instance, our founder drove around the country in an RV two years ago - visited families in West Virgina,  for example, and autism clinics in Missouri, and residential (24/7 care) facilities in Tennessee, and many more. He slept in the RV, in Walmart parking lots.  The goal was to immerse in the community, and learn. We have learned, among many other things, that neither the healthcare system nor the educational system can meet all your needs. We know it is painful, and that some products and services are out of your reach. Our founder personally wants our product to reach every family in the world. However, it may take time.Video from one of our stops on the RV trip. See children delight in using Empowered Brain for the first time. (On the RV trip, the CEO and several team members drove around the country and visited families and clinics far outside our usual zone.)Empowered Brain represents a totally new technology. It is clinical-grade, it was created by a large team of highly-trained professionals -- and it is the first wave. Technology prices always start high, which is the bad news; but the good news is that they always come way down in price. As we built this company, we learned more about why this happens. There are many reasons. To create something like this takes the coordinated work of many, many talented people, and many costs including salaries, legal fees, infrastructure, rent, computers, clinical trials, government fees, and so much more.Also, since most people do not have their own Google Glass, we need to include one in our package. The price of Google Glass was set by Google - at $1500. We cannot control that. Luckily, it is a fantastic device, and we have selected it after trying many alternatives. Eventually, however, the up-front costs like clinical trials and initial development will be repaid. Device prices will come down and devices will be more common. Accordingly we will bring prices down even further. For now, we are doing the best we can to keep prices low even in this first wave, yet somehow we must pay our staff, and the other costs mentioned above.Additionally, we created a payments plan, in response to many parents who asked for it. This allows you to pay over time. This means we bear more of the cost and risk, but it means your burden is lower, and we want to help in that way. Also, many families find funds available that can help them, for instance from health savings accounts, local charities, Medicaid, Elks and Freemasons and other orders, school technology funds, and more. However, if this is still out of reach, please stay in touch over the year and years. With time, we will find other ways to get something to you and to other families like yours. We are truly committed to ""empower every brain""!PAYMENT PLANSeveral parents told us that it is difficult to order the system with a single transaction, and also that the total cost is difficult in this Holiday time of year. We listened!Indieogogo itself does not offer any ""payment plans"", for instance where you can pay off the purchase over a long period of time. On Indiegogo every purchase must be paid in a single transaction, immediately. Also, everything must be complete before the end of the campaign (Dec 22) and there is no option to continue after that.  This is just the nature of pre-order or crowdfunding campaigns on Indiegogo. Therefore, we needed to be creative to respond to your requests!
We separated the price into 4 payments or installments!
We applied a very significant discount (temporarily!) to introduce this offer. 
In order to work with the Indiegogo system, we put a single ""Partial Payment"" item into the list of available items. To make all 4 payments, you would simply get this item 4 times. This offers the most flexibility, for the largest range of families. Here is how it works:
If you purchase the ""Partial Payment"" option, you are in the system! Congratulations!
That single payment is like a ""down payment"" and it guarantees your place in line so that you will get the Empowered Brain system eventually.
You still need to make the remaining 3 payments, but there are some options.
If all 3 payments are completed within the duration of the campaign, you own Empowered Brain system (yay!) and you are a VIP. You will get yours first - before any other group. You will also receive a bonus of VIP training on your new system, and special support.

To state it again, all you need to do in order to join the Brain Power mission and be guaranteed to get this science-based, engaging augmented-reality system for autism, is to make that first payment now. 
There won't be another chance to order it for a while. (After the campaign we want to get back to the science and the speaking with families, rather than all this campaigning!) 
 Consider asking friends and family to order one or more of the Payment perks for you.  Some parents have put this on their wish-list as a great Holiday gift. Some parents have done this as a way to ask for a small loan.  Don't worry - we will keep track of everything and make sure the contribution makes its ways to your family. (It is easiest if the contributor puts your name in the ""contribution appearance"" section on the form, but it is not necessary. ) Learn more about the features of our advanced hardware and custom-coded software in  Empowered Brain:“Rumors of my demise are much exaggerated...”  ~Bemused Glass Breaking News - Glass is Still Alive! Google Glass, version 2 (known as “Glass Enterprise Edition”) was announced to the public in July of 2017! Prior to the announcement, we have long tested our software on Enterprise Edition, e.g. during our clinical trials, to assure it runs properly on both versions. The results are good news -- for Empowered Brain and for the whole “smartglasses” product category. The heads-up computer category is here to stay. We are committed to a future in which technology helps people connect, and overcome challenges.  Hot Fact - Brain Power is a Glass Partner!Brain Power is an official partner of Google (or rather of the Glass team at X, as it is now known)! We were selected based on our long-standing relationship built since the early days of the Google Glass Explorers Program. Now we are one of the very few groups who can sell you Glass - whether Explorer Edition, or Enterprise Edition. Please see:   https://x.company/glass/partners/  We have coded our software to run on many different platforms.We have done the hard work. We have many, many units ready to finalize and ship to you. Join us on the exciting last stages of our journey. Help us to empower you! We have been featured in over 250 press or TV appearances. For more information, visit www.brain-power.com/press Feel free to connect or to view some of us on LinkedIn:Ned T. Sahin  PhD   |   Arshya Vahabzadeh  MD   |   Anthony Sossong  MD  Hear what a few of our team members have to say: Everyone on our team is strongly committed to our mission and firmly believes in the system. At the moment, we are excited to have a group of PhDs, MDs, skilled engineers, videographers, artists, marketers, and more in our growing team. We actively hire people on the autism spectrum. These members of our team are fully integrated and included. They provide us with amazing feedback and contribute substantially to the development of our company!Julie, graphic artist at Brain Power, on the autism spectrum, working with the CEO and other team members.  Dr. Ned Sahin and the Brain Power team have developed deep relationships and partnerships with some major companies and research universities in the relatively short life of the company:   What is included in Empowered Brain?Empowered Brain includes:
A new Google Glass unit in the original box
Science-based apps that run on Google Glass
A companion app for phones and tablets (iOS/Apple or Android)
One parent/teacher account on our cloud-hosted web portal, with ongoing progress reports for each child and predictions of developmental progress
Three “child” accounts on the portal with gameplay data, high scores, and social sharing, School packs and the therapist pack include many more child accounts

Software updates and patches forever
 What skillset does Empowered Brain address?Empowered Brain’s apps are engineered to empower users to teach themselves life skills crucial for happy self-sufficiency. For example, Emotion Charades is a game that helps teach emotion identification. The Player looks through the Google Glass screen and sees emojis on either side of their partner’s face. With a quick head tilt, he/she chooses which emoji correctly matches their partner’s facial expression, and earns gems. Unlike with other emotion-learning apps in which the Player is looking down at a tablet or phone, our software encourages social interaction with other people, keeping the Player heads-up and hands-free.Drawing on everyone’s natural desire to play, the apps are played like video games - but they are based on brain science, and draw on the decades of validated success of behavioral interventions for autism.BTW, our system is designed to be used for 30 min to an hour a day: your child/student will not have to wear it all day to benefit. I’m a Therapist or Teacher. Will Empowered Brain replace my job? Or make it better?You are not replaceable!  But you do probably spend a lot of your time documenting observations in sessions and following up on behaviors between visits.  The Empowered Brain system essentially takes your notes for you, including ones that weren’t possible before - accurately detailing each time the child looks at you or Mom, the duration of stimming episodes, accuracy of emotion decoding, awareness of a new environment, and even heart and breathing rates during the lessons.Empowered Brain even allows you to review and monitor your clients’ progress between sessions - and because the apps feel like games, your client is more likely to perform. Our goal is to complement your efforts, and help you engage and encourage skill development more efficiently for more clients. I’m a parent - can Empowered Brain replace certain therapies?Empowered Brain is designed to carry on where therapist visits leave off, making it easier and more likely for your child to practice certain key skills.  It also allows the therapist to monitor progress remotely and for each visit. If your child improves more rapidly and consistently because of Empowered Brain, it gets him/her on a track to self-sufficiency more rapidly and makes the therapist’s job more efficient.The system is designed to unlock more power from each therapist visit via better and more engaged practice between visits, closer monitoring, and science-based activities that are designed to speed up progress.  In this way, you can get more value from the dollars spent or therapy sessions used, and advance your child further on the path of self-sufficiency and integration. Will this work for my unique child?We have tested our system with hundreds of children and adults on the autism spectrum!Parents are routinely surprised by the fact that their child can tolerate Google Glass and our software, and are even more surprised at how rapidly and easily they learn to use it.  Many times in our clinical trial sessions or informal tests, the child is teaching the parent how to use the system within a few minutes! We’ve studied this formally and scientifically during clinical trials in a wide age range, across the autism spectrum. Papers from Stage 1 of our trials are starting to emerge in peer-reviewed scientific and medical literature.  For instance, see the following papers [1] [2] [3] [4]We cannot guarantee it will work for your unique child, but based on our experience, there is a much better chance than you may think. Isn’t Google Glass dead?No! Please see the details further up in this campaign page.(The quick answer is: they released a new version of Google Glass just this summer, proving the program is continuing (which we already knew), and Brain Power was selected as one of their few official distribution partners. We are one of the very few companies who can sell Glass!  Also, other manufacturers aside from Google are releasing smartglasses, so there are additional options.) Will Empowered Brain be possible for my child to wear? She/he doesn’t even like sunglasses.Well, what do sunglasses do for your child? They mostly put a high-contrast boundary in peripheral vision, where the glasses leave off and the bright sunlight crashes in. That’s neither pleasant nor sensible, and the long-term benefits of wearing sunglasses are relatively remote to a child.With our glasses, you might become a cartoon character, or a way to earn gold stars and points! The world seems different and more fun, and is on kids’ terms. Our glasses are also a vehicle toward the things that matter so dearly to a child, such as fitting in, getting a date, being invited, and eventually getting a job.Ultimately that might seem a lot more valuable to a child than sunglasses. And in the end, any minor inconvenience of wearing something may be outweighed by its benefit, in the same way people ultimately learn to wear shoes or clothing. But again, don’t take our word for it -- take a look at our videos and published papers! Can adults also benefit from using Empowered Brain?Yes. Our current apps span a range of functioning levels and ages, and the apps in development will extend that range even further. For instance, many of us adults can benefit from coaching in subtleties such as knowing when to look at people,  knowing what they’re feeling, and knowing how to mirror back their facial expressions at precisely the right time to make them feel valued and heard. Also, stay tuned for some exciting developments in the works, including job training and job coaching for adults on the spectrum. Is it comfortable to wear for hours?You don’t have to!Think of this like piano lessons. You carry neither your piano nor teacher all day with you, but a half hour or hour a day of concentrated practice teaches the brain needed skills, and goes a long way!That being said, the device is comfortable and light; and in our scientific studies no major negative effects were reported. Can one system be used by multiple family members?Yes. Like many families use a single computer or iPad for several children, you can give them each a chance to use our apps and benefit in their own customized way. With your parent account you can create up to 3 child accounts (more for teacher or therapist accounts).  Each child's game progress is stored separately -- this way, they can even have a competition! That being said, some children may want or need their own system, much as they may want their own phone or iPad.  Is it hard to set up and use? And do I need to sign up for anything else to use my system (like one has to sign up for phone service to use a phone?)No. Setup is quick. Instructions and short “how-to” videos are in your parent/teacher account. You can connect Glass to the internet via WiFi or your phone. What is the warranty or return policy?If our software is malfunctioning we will deliver patches remotely to fix it. If it cannot be fixed remotely, we will accept the device back and fix the software. If the hardware breaks, we cannot fix the hardware -- it is all sealed and self-contained like a phone so it is not serviceable and we are not hardware engineers. We cannot issue refunds of your orders. However, when you receive Empowered Brain you will have 15 days to test it, and to return it for a refund if it does not work for you. Every dollar you help raise translates directly to helping children and adults on the spectrum.  Is the system trying to “normalize” people with autism?No. At Brain Power we are deeply respectful of people on the autism spectrum, and of each human being’s right and desire to independently express his or her own personality. There is no one normal and there is no one right way to be. We already have multiple apps for multiple types of skills and are making more.  We try to make very different experiences for different challenges, and we focus on challenges that affect everyone (but generally affect people on the spectrum more).At the core, our mission is about happy self-sufficiency, and about empowering you and your child to unlock the prodigious power of every brain.  CLINICALLY PROVEN The scientific team at Brain Power has previously authored several dozen peer-reviewed papers in high-impact medical journals, including Science and Nature Neuroscience.Below are some of the papers from the first part of Stage 1 of the Empowered Brain clinical trials. They include the first appearance in the scientific literature of the new version of Google Glass (the Enterprise Edition), and  the first appearance of autism-related work on any version of  Glass. The papers clinically demonstrate that Empowered Brain is a safe, feasible, and tolerable approach to aid children and adults on the autism spectrum. They also show that the system can function for individuals aged 4 to 24 and older, speaking and non-speaking, in clinic and at school. Additional papers are emerging soon - stay tuned!  Tolerable across the spectrum:Keshav NU, Salisbury JP, Vahabzadeh A, and Sahin NT.

<div>This device was created out of one fathers actions to ensure his child's health, when nothing else could. When his son fell ill for long periods of time, it was concluded that the bacteria that was causing his ailments was found in the fridge. After months of trying to find a solution in vain, a chance encounter with an expert microbiologist led to a collaboration which resulted in the invention of The Fridgmate. <a href=""http://www.rocklauncher.com/2016/01/17/story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Follow this link to see the entire story.</a><br/>

<div>More than a year of research went into developing The Fridgmate, led by a team of scientists and microbiologits. The Fridgmate works on a dual mode smart sterilization technique;  releasing precisely calculated amounts of ozone in conjunction with anion burst which use their electric charge to eliminate odour causing material in the air. This is the safest and most efficient method to remove bacteria, as it leaves no chemical residue that can further contaminate or harm your food. Fridgmate uses a smart sterilization algorithm developed to ensure near total sterilization while maintaining a safe concentration of ozone.</div>

<p>Ozone sterilization is used all over the world. Because ozone has a powerful bacteria repressing outcome, it is also used in granary and meat freezing capacities to increase the shelf life of food. The Fridgmate specifically targets psychrophile bacteria - microorganisms that live and thrive in very cold temperatures. Some well-known examples include salmonella, listeria and staphylococcus aureus. These bacteria are responsible for countless illnesses worldwide each year. When these bacteria are left to thrive in your fridge, foods stored in the affected area can end up contaminated, causing various illnesses.</p>

<p>You also have the option to Deep Sterilize your fridge. You simply need to remove all the product from within the fridge and engage this feature on your device. We recommend this is done once a month.</p>

<p><b>1. Will the cold and wet environments in the refrigerator affect the life span of the product?</b></p>
<p>The manufacturing material of Fridgmate is stainless steel ozone anion generator. It can function for more than 5 years under cold and wet conditions.</p>
<p>The internal structure of the Fridgmate is sealed and moisture-proof, which achieves IP65 moisture-resistant.</p>
<p>Fridgmate can function well for a long time when it is placed between -10 to 10 degree Celsius.</p>
<p><b>2. How do I know whether the sterilization is effective of not?</b></p>
<p>First, we focus on 6 categories of bacteria for professional testing. The most authoritative Chinese testing organizations, Guangzhou microbiological testing center released a report and we filmed the testing process in a video. Currently, we aim to kill the Psychrophile in the refrigerator and Fridgmate results excellent with 96.26% sterilization rate, which is the worldwide highest figure result.</p>
<p>Second, the food stored in the refrigerator is fresher with longer preservation period and there is no longer peculiar smell after putting Fridgmate in the refrigerator. This well shows that our product is effective in sterilization.</p>
<p><b>3. Is it effective in eliminating the peculiar smell of the refrigerator? </b></p>
<p>There are two ways to eliminate the peculiar smell of the refrigerator. First, we can remove the organic components with strong oxidation of ozone. Second, with the use of anion, it will help shoot down the airborne dust or small particles which emit odors.</p>
<p><b>4. How long can Fridgmate help to extend the foods’ lifespan?</b></p>
<p>We conducted an experiment using a refrigerator in laboratory to compare the food preservation period with the use of Fridgmate. The result showed that with Fridgmate, the lifespan for strawberries were prolonged for 5 days, lettuce were prolonged for 10 days, chili were prolonged for 14 days and orange were prolonged for 21. Different food products have various preservation period extensions. </p>
<p><b>5. Can I put Fridgmate in my car to eliminate the peculiar smell? </b></p>
<p>Fridgmate is researched and designed for the conditions and bacteria survival of the refrigerator. If you put it in your car, as the ozone concentration, air humidity and concentration of negative ions are not enough in car, thus Fridgmate would not be able to function well. Therefore, we would recommend you to use it in refrigerator only. </p>
<p><b>6. Although ozone can help with sterilization, inhaling too much ozone is harmful to human, how should I avoid this problem?</b></p>
<p>Having 0.1ppm of ozone in an environment for more than eight hours will be harmful to the human. On the contrary, inhaling a small amount of ozone would be beneficial to the human. For example, when there are thunderstorms, the ozone concentration in the atmosphere is about 0.04ppm, which is completely harmless. The core competitiveness of Fridgmate is its precise control of ozone emissions, ensuing the ozone concentration overflow is always less than 0.018ppm.</p>
<p><b>7. How does Fridgmate extend the lifespan of perishable foods?</b></p>
<p>Fridgmate will automatically release the right amount of ozone and anions according to the internal volume of refrigerator. This can effectively inhibit the metabolism of food and to inhibit the microbial pathogens from breeding. It also helps prevent food degradation and inhibit the generation of mildew.</p>
<p><b>8. Which layer of the refrigerator should I put to achieve optimal effect? Is it better to put it near the outside area to make ozone function well? Are there any positioning requirements? </b></p>
<p>As the weight of ozone is 1.66 times to atmosphere, the air flow will slowly sink in overall trend. Therefore, we recommend putting it in the uppermost layer of refrigerator compartment. </p>
<p><b>9. Is ozone harmful to the materials such as the plastic and seal bag in refrigerator? </b></p>
<p>The internal manufacturing material of refrigerator is usually plastic while the seal bags are usually silicone in nature. These materials will not have any chemical reaction with ozone.</p>
<p><b>10. My fridge has 2 separate fresh room, shall I buy 2pcs Fridgmate?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we suggest you buy 2pcs, we have the right perk for you. If the fresh rooms are not separate, one Fridgmate is enough.</p>

We upgraded the battery used in the Fridgmate, the actual battery endurance can be up to 50-90 days, depends on the capacity of your fridge. If you have a 500L fridge, the battery of Fridgmate lasts 50 days.



Fridgmate is a smart sterilizer made for your fridge to solve the above problems.







Fridgmate is a smart sterilizer device made especially for refrigerators. Using a dual mode sterilization approach, it works to destroy over 96% of bacteria that thrive in cold temperatures. These bacteria cause foul odors, food spoilage and can lead to gastrointestinal ailments, food poisoning and even types of stomach cancer.


In conjunction with a dedicated app that functions to monitor the conditions in your fridge, you have total control over how the product works. After one initial set up, you have the option of monitoring the functionality of the Fridgmate or you can leave this smart tool to work its magic without further interaction from you. 
Benefits:




It eradicates over 96% of the harmful bacteria that thrive in your refrigerator; 


It helps keep your refrigerator smelling fresh; 

It extends the lifespan of all your perishable foods.



   

This device was created out of one fathers actions to ensure his child's health, when nothing else could. When his son fell ill for long periods of time, it was concluded that the bacteria that was causing his ailments was found in the fridge. After months of trying to find a solution in vain, a chance encounter with an expert microbiologist led to a collaboration which resulted in the invention of The Fridgmate. Follow this link to see the entire story.








    


More than a year of research went into developing The Fridgmate, led by a team of scientists and microbiologits. The Fridgmate works on a dual mode smart sterilization technique;  releasing precisely calculated amounts of ozone in conjunction with anion burst which use their electric charge to eliminate odour causing material in the air. This is the safest and most efficient method to remove bacteria, as it leaves no chemical residue that can further contaminate or harm your food. Fridgmate uses a smart sterilization algorithm developed to ensure near total sterilization while maintaining a safe concentration of ozone.




Ozone sterilization is used all over the world. Because ozone has a powerful bacteria repressing outcome, it is also used in granary and meat freezing capacities to increase the shelf life of food. The Fridgmate specifically targets psychrophile bacteria - microorganisms that live and thrive in very cold temperatures. Some well-known examples include salmonella, listeria and staphylococcus aureus. These bacteria are responsible for countless illnesses worldwide each year. When these bacteria are left to thrive in your fridge, foods stored in the affected area can end up contaminated, causing various illnesses.


You also have the option to Deep Sterilize your fridge. You simply need to remove all the product from within the fridge and engage this feature on your device. We recommend this is done once a month.




Below video shows you the sterilization rate of the Fridgate reaches 96.26 percent.





Ozone Concentration Overflow Test video


Because of the smart algorithm Fridgmate uses, the ozone overflow concentration when the user opens the refrigerator door is less than 0.018 parts per million, which is about the same as during a thunderstorm and completely harmless to humans.


Some testing photos of the Fridgmate in the laboratory.



More than a year of research went into developing algorithms that would allow Fridgmate to effectively sterilize a refrigerator while maintaining an entirely healthy environment for humans.


The Fridgmate is powered by a battery that lasts up to 50-90 days, depends on the capacity of your fridge, and can be recharged via a micro USB port. 



The Fridgmate is also a smart device, meaning it connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth and is accompanied by an app available in both Android and iOS formats. The app has English and Chinese versions.



Through the app, you are able to check the sterilization process, cleanliness rating and the remaining power of your Fridgmate. If you don’t wish to monitor your device so closely, you are able to leave the Fridgmate to work on its own after the initial set up. No further manual input from you is required.








Fridgmate is extremely easy to start using, and set up is completed in three simple steps.
Step 1
Install the Fridgmate app on your phone which is available for both Android and iOS, power on your Fridgmate unit, and then connect it with your smart phone's Bluetooth.
Step 2
You need to input the capacity size of your fridge within the settings menu of the Fridgmate app and click save.
Step 3
Place the unit inside your fridge fresh room and let it work its magic!
The only other thing that you must do is recharge the unit, besides that, Fridgmate is completely self sustained, making your life much easier!

Rocklauncher is a dedicated online platform focused on innovative consumer product offerings. Our value are founded in developing innovations that enhance lives and offer real time value. The products we represent are from high quality startups in Shenzhen, China that we have selected as strategic partners. Our team works closely with them on product development, testing and improvements. 


To find out more following the link here -  http://www.rocklauncher.com.








1. Will the cold and wet environments in the refrigerator affect the life span of the product?
The manufacturing material of Fridgmate is stainless steel ozone anion generator. It can function for more than 5 years under cold and wet conditions.
The internal structure of the Fridgmate is sealed and moisture-proof, which achieves IP65 moisture-resistant.
Fridgmate can function well for a long time when it is placed between -10 to 10 degree Celsius.
2. How do I know whether the sterilization is effective of not?
First, we focus on 6 categories of bacteria for professional testing. The most authoritative Chinese testing organizations, Guangzhou microbiological testing center released a report and we filmed the testing process in a video. Currently, we aim to kill the Psychrophile in the refrigerator and Fridgmate results excellent with 96.26% sterilization rate, which is the worldwide highest figure result.
Second, the food stored in the refrigerator is fresher with longer preservation period and there is no longer peculiar smell after putting Fridgmate in the refrigerator. This well shows that our product is effective in sterilization.
3. Is it effective in eliminating the peculiar smell of the refrigerator? 
There are two ways to eliminate the peculiar smell of the refrigerator. First, we can remove the organic components with strong oxidation of ozone. Second, with the use of anion, it will help shoot down the airborne dust or small particles which emit odors.
4. How long can Fridgmate help to extend the foods’ lifespan?
We conducted an experiment using a refrigerator in laboratory to compare the food preservation period with the use of Fridgmate. The result showed that with Fridgmate, the lifespan for strawberries were prolonged for 5 days, lettuce were prolonged for 10 days, chili were prolonged for 14 days and orange were prolonged for 21. Different food products have various preservation period extensions. 
5. Can I put Fridgmate in my car to eliminate the peculiar smell? 
Fridgmate is researched and designed for the conditions and bacteria survival of the refrigerator. If you put it in your car, as the ozone concentration, air humidity and concentration of negative ions are not enough in car, thus Fridgmate would not be able to function well. Therefore, we would recommend you to use it in refrigerator only. 
6. Although ozone can help with sterilization, inhaling too much ozone is harmful to human, how should I avoid this problem?
Having 0.1ppm of ozone in an environment for more than eight hours will be harmful to the human. On the contrary, inhaling a small amount of ozone would be beneficial to the human. For example, when there are thunderstorms, the ozone concentration in the atmosphere is about 0.04ppm, which is completely harmless. The core competitiveness of Fridgmate is its precise control of ozone emissions, ensuing the ozone concentration overflow is always less than 0.018ppm.
7. How does Fridgmate extend the lifespan of perishable foods?
Fridgmate will automatically release the right amount of ozone and anions according to the internal volume of refrigerator. This can effectively inhibit the metabolism of food and to inhibit the microbial pathogens from breeding. It also helps prevent food degradation and inhibit the generation of mildew.
8. Which layer of the refrigerator should I put to achieve optimal effect? Is it better to put it near the outside area to make ozone function well? Are there any positioning requirements? 
As the weight of ozone is 1.66 times to atmosphere, the air flow will slowly sink in overall trend. Therefore, we recommend putting it in the uppermost layer of refrigerator compartment. 
9. Is ozone harmful to the materials such as the plastic and seal bag in refrigerator? 
The internal manufacturing material of refrigerator is usually plastic while the seal bags are usually silicone in nature. These materials will not have any chemical reaction with ozone.
10. My fridge has 2 separate fresh room, shall I buy 2pcs Fridgmate?
Yes, we suggest you buy 2pcs, we have the right perk for you. If the fresh rooms are not separate, one Fridgmate is enough.



1. When is the prospective delivery date for the Fridgmate?

According to our plan we will start shipping Fridgmate before 20th of May 2016.
2. Who pays for the customs duties and VAT tax?
Customs duties and VAT tax varies by countires. If you incur a customs/VAT tax, your local custom will send you a notice. You can simply go to their carrier or post office to pay the tax before the product is released.
3.Is there a warranty?
Yes, the Fridgmate comes with a one year warranty. If you ever have a problem with it, just contact us and we'll do our best to make it right.
4.How do I get in touch with your team?

<p></p>
<div>
<b>SOLUTION:</b><p></p>
<p>Based on our experience working with clinics and doctors, we recommend using a laptop or Chromebook for Video. There are several advantages to this approach. For example, you can have a dedicated laptop that is shared among providers and can move the laptop between rooms wherever needed. Also, you can position the  laptop next to the clinic computers with the EHR; this allows the provider to meet with the patient via video using the laptop and chart in the EHR on the clinic computers.</p>

We have three major problems
*First one
133 Million Americans Have at Least One Chronic
Disease
The Top 5 chronic Disease are Heart Disease, Cancer ,Stroke, COPD and Diabetes
4 Million require 50 Home Care Visits per year

*Second Problem
Doctors & Nurses Getting paid less &
less by Medicare, Medical & ACA.
Every Doctor , Nurse Practitioner , Physician
Assistant and Small Hospital Must Supplement their Practice With Concierge
Service. Patients have to wait days and weeks to get an appointment.

*Third Problem
Collaborating only with doctors in their own group ,
or hospital or even their own state is not enough . Over 35 Million people have rare diseases 
   
Solution
*For patients with chronic diseases  , we offer a Deluxe Concierge Service + Video
*For Collaboration, we have  the only Med Community with
Free Video Consultation between Doctors nationwide. Complex cases can be solved in days rather
than months saving Billions.

<blockquote>        <i>“Tungaj Transformers are available in three different styles.”</i>
</blockquote>
<p>The air around us is full of electro-phonic waves: from radio antennae, cellular phone towers, satellites, microwaves, wi-fi routers, and so much more. While invisible, they are not all harmless. Countless studies indicate that this radiation can interfere with sleep, mood and even health. The British Medical Journal published a study proving that people who live in proximity to cellular towers are more likely to suffer negative symptoms, including fatigue, lack of concentration, dizziness, loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, depression, memory impairment and more. But in this day and age, we can’t live without technology, from laptops to televisions to microwaves to cell phones. Even if we were to stop using such devices, we could not escape the non-ionizing radiation they produce, because it is all around us, particularly concentrated in high-density urban areas. </p>
<p> But we do not have to give up this technology, or even avoid it, thanks to the Tungaj Transformer. Like an electrical transformer, which safely converts one voltage into another, the Tungaj Transformer converts the potentially harmful and disruptive non-ionizing radiation produced by today’s technology, rendering it harmless. Scores of users from around the world attest to its efficacy, describing how, after installing a Tungaj Transformer into their home or workplace, they sleep more soundly, feel more rested, are better able to concentrate when at work, and have more energy and a generally more positive mood. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1><i> How Does It Work? </i></h1>
<p>With the installation of the Tungaj Transformer, atoms of pure carbon, gold, silver, silicon and other elements establish torsion/scalar energy. This type of energy had already been researched by the great scientist and inventor of international repute,<b><i> Nikola Tesla</i></b>. Among other things, Tesla developed the alternating current generator, which is used in every household. He invented the coil that creates scalar energy. After many years of research and tests, we have finally managed to develop the Tungaj Transformer, which creates harmony and a healthy wavelength. The Tungaj Transformer is an intricate combination of knowledge about the subtle, supportive forces of nature that help human beings to establish existential balance.</p>

<li>  Much More<br/><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>What is Inside?</h1>
<p> After years of experimentation, Vrhovnik (pronounced “Ver-ho-nik”) developed an optimal combination of pulverized stones and minerals which transform non-ionizing radiation that is produced by electronic devices that rely on projected signals. These materials include gold, silver, silicon, pure carbon, selenium, quartz and other minerals. These are mixed in a suspension of sand and housed inside transformers of various sizes and designs, which can be selected by users to suit their tastes and the space they wish to protect.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h1> I’m Naturally Skeptical of Such Things. How Do I Know It Works?</h1>
<p> The Tungaj Transformer won a gold prize in the International Invention Expo in South Korea, and has been certified as effective by independent, objective scientists from the Institute of Bioelectrophotonics in Germany. In addition to these objective indications of its efficacy, there are the testimonies of scores of people, from many nations and walks of life, who simply <i>feel better—much better—after living with Tungaj Transformers. </i><br/></p>

<p>“The latest research was made in the laboratory of plant cytogenetics, where they used the Allium M test. The results tell us that Tungaj Transformer protection really works. The genotoxicity level in an onion exposed to non-ionizing radiation was much higher than the same onion, exposed to the same radiation but also placed next to a Tungaj Transformer.”</p>

<p>From the graph we can see that solar power plant during it's working proggress reduce intensity in space compare to non working time level. But intensity level of working solar power plant protected with Tungaj Transformer is even higher compare to non working time level. (Red - sunny, solar power plant working; Blue - night time, solar power plant is not working; Green - sunny, solar power plant working, protected with Tungaj Transformer)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1>Okay, Cool. Why Do They Look Different?</h1>
<p> A variety of designs are available, all of them functional Tungaj Transformers. The active material, the mix of pulverized minerals and stones, is contained inside the Tungaj Transformer, so its outer shape does not alter its efficacy, and is a matter of taste. Size does, however, with more of the active materials producing a strong transformer. Tungaj Transformers are available in a variety of sizes, suitable for a single room, a small apartment, and even an entire house. There are egg-shaped or round transformers, but they can also be made in the shape of totems, for placement on one’s desk or subtly in the corner of a room. Each Tungaj Transformer is crafted by hand, and their aesthetics will suit a variety of tastes, from craftsman-style carved wood or hand-painted, gilded eggs to streamlined reflective metal spheres that would look sharp in a minimalist office.</p>

<p>Video in words: </p>
<p>Drago Vrhovnik and the team at the Tunjice Natural Health Resort have spent years, and a considerable investment of financial resources, into developing and perfecting the Tungaj Transformers. Each one is meticulously crafted by hand, inside and out. This is a slow, laborious process, and is expensive—not an ideal business model to meet the huge demand for Tungaj Transformers, around the world. The team has maxed out its own resources, both in terms of time and funding, and needs additional assistance to move forward, beyond producing a few dozen transformers per year. This Kickstarter project will allow for the development of a new, more efficient and less expensive system for producing Tungaj Transformers, while still maintaining the level of quality and efficacy. It can improve the lives of anyone who uses one, and the demand is such that it far outstrips the capability of Vrhovnik to produce his invention. With your help, the Tungaj Transformer will become not only more available, but significantly less expensive to produce, and therefore to distribute.  </p>
<br/>
<h1>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""> How Do I Know Which Size to Choose?</span><br/>
</h1>
<p> While the look of the Tungaj Transformer is entirely up to you, and the aesthetic does not affect its functionality, the sizing does, and the size should be chosen based on the space in which you plan to use it. Therefore we recommend the following: </p>
<ul><li>Personal – a miniature Tungaj Transformer, which you can take with you to meetings, on trips, in the car…whenever you go. </li></ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li> Room-Sized – a Tungaj Transformer, in totem, egg or sphere shapes, that is suitable for a single room, such as an office, living room or bedroom. </li>
<li>-Business – larger, more powerful Tungaj Transformers, in egg or sphere shapes, wherein a single transformer is sufficient to protect a small home, apartment, or office<br/><br/><br/>

<h1> How Long Does It Take to Work? </h1>
<p>Tungaj Transformers do not require any special installation, and can be placed anywhere. They work non-directionally, and so we recommend placement in the middle of the space you wish to protect. Non-ionizing radiation passes through walls, and the protective nature of the transformer likewise functions even with stone or metal walls or dividers. Users have reported positive effects within 24 hours, though since the effects are subtle and more passive than active, living with Tungaj Transformers, over weeks and months, results in the most evident positive changes. </p>

</div></div>","“Tungaj Transformers are available in three different styles.”

The air around us is full of electro-phonic waves: from radio antennae, cellular phone towers, satellites, microwaves, wi-fi routers, and so much more. While invisible, they are not all harmless. Countless studies indicate that this radiation can interfere with sleep, mood and even health. The British Medical Journal published a study proving that people who live in proximity to cellular towers are more likely to suffer negative symptoms, including fatigue, lack of concentration, dizziness, loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping, depression, memory impairment and more. But in this day and age, we can’t live without technology, from laptops to televisions to microwaves to cell phones. Even if we were to stop using such devices, we could not escape the non-ionizing radiation they produce, because it is all around us, particularly concentrated in high-density urban areas. 
 But we do not have to give up this technology, or even avoid it, thanks to the Tungaj Transformer. Like an electrical transformer, which safely converts one voltage into another, the Tungaj Transformer converts the potentially harmful and disruptive non-ionizing radiation produced by today’s technology, rendering it harmless. Scores of users from around the world attest to its efficacy, describing how, after installing a Tungaj Transformer into their home or workplace, they sleep more soundly, feel more rested, are better able to concentrate when at work, and have more energy and a generally more positive mood. 

 How Does It Work? 
With the installation of the Tungaj Transformer, atoms of pure carbon, gold, silver, silicon and other elements establish torsion/scalar energy. This type of energy had already been researched by the great scientist and inventor of international repute, Nikola Tesla. Among other things, Tesla developed the alternating current generator, which is used in every household. He invented the coil that creates scalar energy. After many years of research and tests, we have finally managed to develop the Tungaj Transformer, which creates harmony and a healthy wavelength. The Tungaj Transformer is an intricate combination of knowledge about the subtle, supportive forces of nature that help human beings to establish existential balance.


Protect Yourself Against Non-Ionizing Radiation From:

  Radio antennae
  Satellite Dishes
  Wi Fi Routers
  Cell Phone Towers
  Microwaves 
  Smart Phones 
  Wireless Chargers
  Much More


What is Inside?
 After years of experimentation, Vrhovnik (pronounced “Ver-ho-nik”) developed an optimal combination of pulverized stones and minerals which transform non-ionizing radiation that is produced by electronic devices that rely on projected signals. These materials include gold, silver, silicon, pure carbon, selenium, quartz and other minerals. These are mixed in a suspension of sand and housed inside transformers of various sizes and designs, which can be selected by users to suit their tastes and the space they wish to protect.


 I’m Naturally Skeptical of Such Things. How Do I Know It Works?
 The Tungaj Transformer won a gold prize in the International Invention Expo in South Korea, and has been certified as effective by independent, objective scientists from the Institute of Bioelectrophotonics in Germany. In addition to these objective indications of its efficacy, there are the testimonies of scores of people, from many nations and walks of life, who simply feel better—much better—after living with Tungaj Transformers. 



“The latest research was made in the laboratory of plant cytogenetics, where they used the Allium M test. The results tell us that Tungaj Transformer protection really works. The genotoxicity level in an onion exposed to non-ionizing radiation was much higher than the same onion, exposed to the same radiation but also placed next to a Tungaj Transformer.”


Measurement made with GDV technology 
From the graph we can see that solar power plant during it's working proggress reduce intensity in space compare to non working time level. But intensity level of working solar power plant protected with Tungaj Transformer is even higher compare to non working time level. (Red - sunny, solar power plant working; Blue - night time, solar power plant is not working; Green - sunny, solar power plant working, protected with Tungaj Transformer)

Okay, Cool. Why Do They Look Different?
 A variety of designs are available, all of them functional Tungaj Transformers. The active material, the mix of pulverized minerals and stones, is contained inside the Tungaj Transformer, so its outer shape does not alter its efficacy, and is a matter of taste. Size does, however, with more of the active materials producing a strong transformer. Tungaj Transformers are available in a variety of sizes, suitable for a single room, a small apartment, and even an entire house. There are egg-shaped or round transformers, but they can also be made in the shape of totems, for placement on one’s desk or subtly in the corner of a room. Each Tungaj Transformer is crafted by hand, and their aesthetics will suit a variety of tastes, from craftsman-style carved wood or hand-painted, gilded eggs to streamlined reflective metal spheres that would look sharp in a minimalist office.


About the Project



Video in words: 
Drago Vrhovnik and the team at the Tunjice Natural Health Resort have spent years, and a considerable investment of financial resources, into developing and perfecting the Tungaj Transformers. Each one is meticulously crafted by hand, inside and out. This is a slow, laborious process, and is expensive—not an ideal business model to meet the huge demand for Tungaj Transformers, around the world. The team has maxed out its own resources, both in terms of time and funding, and needs additional assistance to move forward, beyond producing a few dozen transformers per year. This Kickstarter project will allow for the development of a new, more efficient and less expensive system for producing Tungaj Transformers, while still maintaining the level of quality and efficacy. It can improve the lives of anyone who uses one, and the demand is such that it far outstrips the capability of Vrhovnik to produce his invention. With your help, the Tungaj Transformer will become not only more available, but significantly less expensive to produce, and therefore to distribute.  


 How Do I Know Which Size to Choose?

 While the look of the Tungaj Transformer is entirely up to you, and the aesthetic does not affect its functionality, the sizing does, and the size should be chosen based on the space in which you plan to use it. Therefore we recommend the following: 
Personal – a miniature Tungaj Transformer, which you can take with you to meetings, on trips, in the car…whenever you go. 



 Room-Sized – a Tungaj Transformer, in totem, egg or sphere shapes, that is suitable for a single room, such as an office, living room or bedroom. 
-Business – larger, more powerful Tungaj Transformers, in egg or sphere shapes, wherein a single transformer is sufficient to protect a small home, apartment, or office

Non-ionizing radiation passes through walls, and the protective nature of the transformer likewise functions even with stone or metal walls or dividers.

<p>Why do we need money?  On March 1, 2016 new state law goes into effect.

from Ron:</p>
<p>Hi
Everyone, I’d love to share with you the story behind my housing project...</p>
<p> 
     I lived at the home of my parents, Joyce and Donald
Killian, until 1997 when I was 36 years old.</p>
<p>After I
moved into Lancaster House North on North Prince Street in 2003, I won a
lottery to get on the waiting list for a portable section 8 housing voucher.
After re-applying every year for 5-years I finally got notice that I was
eligible for the voucher back in August of 2009.</p>
<p>I started
looking for an apartment with my new voucher, but it would not be an easy
pursuit as I had no luck in finding an apartment right away or a landlord
willing to rent to me. For example, in the case of one apartment the housing
authority said it cost $50 too much a month and the landlord would not reduce
the rent and let me pay the remainder out of pocket. I continued searching for
an apartment with no luck at all.</p>
<p>The
housing authority has a time limit for the housing search and I had to apply
for extensions until they told me I was out of the program because my time was
up. To get back in I had to request a reasonable accommodation to remove the
time limit for the search.</p>
<p> 
     As soon as I got back into the program, I found a great
landlord but not the best apartment. I decided to take it anyway, and this is
where I am now. The bathroom is not wheelchair accessible and the front door is
difficult and dangerous as it is up a set of concrete stairs. Eventually, I had
a ramp built so I can access the apartment from the rear door, but the bathroom
is still too small for me to get in and out of the shower safely. Once a
person is a section 8 renter for a year, they can apply for a home ownership
program through Tabor’s Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) program. When I asked for
an application Tabor said I was not eligible to apply because I would not be
able to fulfill their work requirement.  I told Tabor that I knew that HUD
does not put that restriction on people with disabilities in the federal
regulations for the home ownership program. Tabor said they only knew what the
housing authority told them.</p>
<p><b></b></p><b>
</b><p></p>
<p> 
     So I requested another reasonable accommodation from the
housing authority to waive the work requirement. Despite that, Tabor still did
not change their rules but the housing authority decided to allow me to bypass
the FSS program completely in order to allow me to participate in the home
ownership program. Tabor did give me a credit counseling session and I completed
the Lancaster Housing Opportunity Partnership (LHOP) classes in October 2010,
making me officially in the Section 8 home ownership program.</p>
<p> 
     I did much research on finding an old city property and
retro-fitting it for wheelchair access until one day when my mom said, “too bad
you can’t find an architect and build your own place on the lot out back.” On
East Mifflin St. behind my parent’s house on East End Avenue is an undeveloped
lot that my parents own. So I decided to take her up on her offer and started
looking for an architect.</p>
<p>My search
for a qualified architect ended when through my aide and landscaper, Brandon
Sheetz, I made the acquaintance of Max Zahniser, an architect, green building
consultant and educator. Since I have met Max, we have put together a group we
are calling Team Rambo.</p>
<p> 
     The Team assembled by our process facilitator, Max, has
been working pro bono to design and build me a home on the Mifflin Street
lot. With this house we are creating a regenerative water system,  pushing
toward radical accessibility, LEED Platinum and Living Building Challenge certification, a no-mow
regenerative/permacultural landscape design, on-site energy production,
pristine indoor air quality, other occupant health and comfort best-practices,
and to the extent possible, using reclaimed, salvaged, and local building
materials.</p>
<p>I’m so
grateful for all that everyone on Team Rambo have done so far, and humbly
request that you help them fully realize the fruits of their labor, and take
this project to construction, so it can serve as a research and education tool,
and a demonstration of an alternative to our entrenched special needs
bureaucracy and the incredibly damaging way we develop human habitats.</p>
<p>Thanks
for your time and best wishes to you,</p>

A Letter
from Ron:
Hi
Everyone, I’d love to share with you the story behind my housing project...
 
     I lived at the home of my parents, Joyce and Donald
Killian, until 1997 when I was 36 years old.
After I
moved into Lancaster House North on North Prince Street in 2003, I won a
lottery to get on the waiting list for a portable section 8 housing voucher.
After re-applying every year for 5-years I finally got notice that I was
eligible for the voucher back in August of 2009.
I started
looking for an apartment with my new voucher, but it would not be an easy
pursuit as I had no luck in finding an apartment right away or a landlord
willing to rent to me. For example, in the case of one apartment the housing
authority said it cost $50 too much a month and the landlord would not reduce
the rent and let me pay the remainder out of pocket. I continued searching for
an apartment with no luck at all.
The
housing authority has a time limit for the housing search and I had to apply
for extensions until they told me I was out of the program because my time was
up. To get back in I had to request a reasonable accommodation to remove the
time limit for the search.
 
     As soon as I got back into the program, I found a great
landlord but not the best apartment. I decided to take it anyway, and this is
where I am now. The bathroom is not wheelchair accessible and the front door is
difficult and dangerous as it is up a set of concrete stairs. Eventually, I had
a ramp built so I can access the apartment from the rear door, but the bathroom
is still too small for me to get in and out of the shower safely. Once a
person is a section 8 renter for a year, they can apply for a home ownership
program through Tabor’s Family Self Sufficiency (FSS) program. When I asked for
an application Tabor said I was not eligible to apply because I would not be
able to fulfill their work requirement.  I told Tabor that I knew that HUD
does not put that restriction on people with disabilities in the federal
regulations for the home ownership program. Tabor said they only knew what the
housing authority told them.


 
     So I requested another reasonable accommodation from the
housing authority to waive the work requirement. Despite that, Tabor still did
not change their rules but the housing authority decided to allow me to bypass
the FSS program completely in order to allow me to participate in the home
ownership program. Tabor did give me a credit counseling session and I completed
the Lancaster Housing Opportunity Partnership (LHOP) classes in October 2010,
making me officially in the Section 8 home ownership program.
 
     I did much research on finding an old city property and
retro-fitting it for wheelchair access until one day when my mom said, “too bad
you can’t find an architect and build your own place on the lot out back.” On
East Mifflin St. behind my parent’s house on East End Avenue is an undeveloped
lot that my parents own. So I decided to take her up on her offer and started
looking for an architect.
My search
for a qualified architect ended when through my aide and landscaper, Brandon
Sheetz, I made the acquaintance of Max Zahniser, an architect, green building
consultant and educator. Since I have met Max, we have put together a group we
are calling Team Rambo.
 
     The Team assembled by our process facilitator, Max, has
been working pro bono to design and build me a home on the Mifflin Street
lot. With this house we are creating a regenerative water system,  pushing
toward radical accessibility, LEED Platinum and Living Building Challenge certification, a no-mow
regenerative/permacultural landscape design, on-site energy production,
pristine indoor air quality, other occupant health and comfort best-practices,
and to the extent possible, using reclaimed, salvaged, and local building
materials.
I’m so
grateful for all that everyone on Team Rambo have done so far, and humbly
request that you help them fully realize the fruits of their labor, and take
this project to construction, so it can serve as a research and education tool,
and a demonstration of an alternative to our entrenched special needs
bureaucracy and the incredibly damaging way we develop human habitats.
Thanks
for your time and best wishes to you,
Ron R

<p>As we progress on our journey promoting shooting sports in Ghana we need your support to achieve qualification for the Olympics in 2020, via the Commonwealth Games in 2018.</p>
<p>Since our inception in 2012 we are proud of our achievements – many being firsts for the African continent. We now have competitors at junior and senior levels, disabled and able bodied male and female, pistol, rifle and shotgun, and we soon aim to facilitate air pistol/rifle competitors.</p>
<p>In 2014 we travelled to Scotland and competed in the Commonwealth Games; a fantastic experience for our athletes. This was made possible, in the main, through fantastic support from our sponsors. These sponsors were mainly oil industry related and, by consequence of the crisis in oil prices, sponsorship has understandably decreased dramatically. Our current existence is based on sporadic support from sponsors, a trickle of membership fees and the fantastic personal support of our chairman. We have to be realistic though and accept that won't get us to Tokyo.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. With your support we can do it. Around the world associations like ours can rely on massive sponsorship, governmental support and funding streams we can’t even begin to imagine. As a developing country we don’t attract such support, but why should our athletes not have the opportunity to compete at the highest level? Imagine how you would feel watching the opening parade of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, knowing you directly helped make that happen.</p>
<p>Please help us on our quest.</p>
<p><strong>Will you help us?</strong></p>
<p>To qualify for Tokyo we need to compete in several “qualifying” competitions in the next 4 years. None of these will be in Ghana, therefore costs to us are massive. Attending the Commonwealth Games in 2018 will also be a major milestone, however impossible without your support. A short time ago, our rifle shooters couldn’t train because we couldn’t afford to import the ammunition required. We sincerely hope that each and every one of you who will support us can see how pivotal you are in our dream. Without you it won’t happen. Please support us, we will make you proud.</p>
<p><strong>How else can I help?</strong></p>
<p>Your support to us, no matter how large or small, is massive to our cause. If financial support isn't possible you can still be very much part of our team by letting as many people as you can, know of our appeal through whatever means be it word of mouth or social media.</p>
<p>As we take part in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics we will hold dear each and every one of you who made it possible.</p>
<p>As Ghanaians would cordially say ""you are invited"". Please be a very appreciated, important and significant  part of our dream.</p>

This device allows its owner to track his/her psycho-physiological state and to control emotions under certain important circumstances.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p><p><i><strong>Q: How does Vivograph work?​</strong></i><br/><strong>A: </strong>Vivograph has built-in biometric sensors that can detect variations in heart rate, respiration and perspiration rates and skin conductivity. These are all direct indicators of someone's emotional state. Different emotions are matched to biometric signal patterns detected over time, which are then correlated with other types of data such as activity levels, calendar events, and location. This information is all processed by the Intellectual Data Processing Program to give you personalized and actual guidance regarding your physical and emotional state.</p><p><i><strong>Q: What is IDPP?</strong></i><br/><strong>A: </strong>Intellectual Data Processing Program allows you to adjust your Vivograph to take in consideration your particular physical peculiarities and then inform you of any emotional or physical stresses in the most precise way. IDPP gathers data from the sensors and performs processing and comparison of the data against the adjusted settings. Thus, IDPP makes your Vivograph personalized.</p><p><i><strong>Q: How and where I can adjust the IDPP?</strong></i><br/><strong>A: </strong>You have several options. IDPP may automatically tune itself for your body's specific characteristics. You can also choose and adjust any function from Vivograph menu and adjust as you wish. You can use the Vivograph mobile app and adjust the IDPP from your smartphone, or you can directly connect your Vivograph to a PC, or a laptop, and make the necessary adjustments with the help of Vivograph application.</p><p><i><strong>Q: How long does it take to adjust my Vivograph's IDPP?</strong></i><br/><strong>A: </strong>Under normal circumstances, with no emotional or physical stress, adjustments will take no longer than twenty minutes. Then you will have to confirm sensors' readings. You can return to the manufacturers' settings at any time and repeat the sensors adjustments for IDPP.</p><p><i><strong>Q: How often the sensors readings are taken?</strong></i><br/><strong>A: </strong>The smaller the deviation of actual reading from the average-set value, the less the readings frequency will be. Reading's frequency is determined by the IDPP, according to an actuated function. You can also set the frequency manually or decide over specific sensors readings you want to track.</p><p><i><strong>Q: Can I track readings of a certain sensor?</strong></i><br/><strong>A: </strong>Yes, with help from IDPP you can select one or several certain sensors and their readings will be taken at a frequency set by you.</p><p><strong><i>Q: Can I use the Vivograph only as a Smartwatch?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Of course, you can. Insert a SIM-card and switch off the IDPP. You will be able to call and text, to shoot video and photographs.</p><p><strong><i>Q: How does Vivograph connect to my smartphone?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Vivograph syncs with your smartphone via Bluetooth SMART (low energy). The wearable works in conjunction with the Vivograph mobile app, which is compatible with both iOS and Android. </p><p><strong><i>Q: What's the difference between Vivograph and <a href=""http://vivograph.com/compare.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""blank"">other hi tech wearable</a>?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Most wearable products focus on physical conditions only (e.g. measuring your heart rate, calculating your physical load) or tend to serve only one specific purpose (eg. analyse your breathing patterns). Vivograph employs the most advanced sensing technology in combination with state-of-art IDPP algorithms to figure out a complex view of your wellbeing (both emotional and physical) and give your data added ""life context"". Emotions are known to be a major factor influencing your physical health and generally all other aspects of life.</p><p><strong><i>Q: What is the SMART EMOTIONS POLYGRAPH function?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>With this function on, you may monitor your own emotional response on questions you answer. This will help you understand which questions cause the most intensive reaction and you can determine, for example, some topics that you will not want to discuss with a stranger, or, maybe you will want to go through these topics with your psychologist.</p><p><strong><i>Q: Why do I need to watch my STRESS LEVEL?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Probability of stress situation occurrence directly depends on severity of emotional and physical stresses. Vivograph will tell you when it is necessary to take a break, relax and have some rest.</p><p><strong><i>Q: Is Vivograph a medical tool?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>No, Vivograph is not really a medical tool. Sensors readings and information from Vivograph may be used as an advice from a specialist. However, in case of health problems you need to see a physician.</p><p><strong><i>Q: Can I show the Vivograph data to a physician or a psychologist?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Yes, it is your right. You can connect the Vivograph directly to a computer and transfer the data, or you can use the memory card for it.</p><p><strong><i>Q: How accurate are the sensors readings?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Relative measurement error of sensors is from 0 to 3 %. Absolute instrument error of the sensors is determined by their manufacturers. We cooperate in order to minimize these errors.</p><p><strong><i>Q: Does Vivograph measure the blood pressure?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Vivograph is equipped with a photoplethysmography sensor on the basis of which, and of other sensors the IDPP calculates relative change of blood pressure against average set value within a certain period of time.</p><p><i><strong>Q: What measurement units are used in Vivograph? </strong></i><br/><strong>A:</strong> Vivograph menu supports both US/Imperial and metric units.<br/>You can, for example, select the temperature readings to be shown in Fahrenheit or Celsius, the distance in miles or kilometers, etc.</p><p><strong><i>Q: How long does the battery last?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Vivograph can last up to 10 days in the smartwatch mode without charging. It takes about 2 hours to fully charge. Since it uses a Bluetooth Smart (low energy) connection, it will not drain your smartphone battery. IDPP significantly saves the Vivograph battery.</p><p><strong><i>Q: How is Vivograph charged?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Vivograph comes with a USB charger which connects to the USB port on the strap's end.</p><p><strong><i>Q: What materials the Vivograph is made of?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>The Vivograph body is made of high-strength lightweight titanium and aluminum alloy. The silicone wrist strap is hypoallergenic, washable, durable and comfortable.</p><p><strong><i>Q: Is Vivograph water resistant?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Vivograph has an ATM rating and it's officially 'splashproof', which means it can resist to usual scenarios like temporarily being under the rain or washing your hands.</p><p><strong><i>Q: Are Vivograph wristbands interchangeable?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>The bands are currently not interchangeable, as the biometric sensors are built into the band and designed to keep working with you as you move throughout the day.</p><p><strong><i>Q: Is my personal information kept private?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>We're very much concerned about the privacy of your data. As a user, you are in full control over which data you want to share. Moreover, Vivograph is equipped with a fingerprint sensor and, if it is locked, nobody but you can access the device.</p><p><strong><i>Q: What will my pledge be used for?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Your financial contribution will go directly towards tooling and manufacturing the first batch of Vivograph. It will also be used toward the research and development involved in bringing this product to market, including implementing a sustainable product lifecycle. Please see our timeline above to get a more detailed picture of our product roadmap.</p><p><strong><i>Q: How do I pay for shipping and where do you ship?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>Worldwide shipping available. We collect a small fee in order to support our costs for shipping Vivograph nationally and internationally. </p><p><strong><i>Q: Why do I need the Emotions Polygraph?</i></strong><br/><strong>A: </strong>This feature will let you track and control your emotional state, strength of your emotional response to different kind of situations, questions, scenes. Also, you can use Vivograph KIT for fun, e.g. run it as a 'lie detector' on your friends.</p></div>","VIVOGRAPH  smartwatch PolygraphYou have smartwatch Vivograph and you receive information about your emotional response to any events and actions around you in the real-time mode.When your boss sets a task, your Vivograph will tell you how important is it for you.

If you fail to fully understand something, or somebody holds back the whole truth from you, or is trying to cheat you, you might be able to understand it on the back you your mind, and the Vivograph will confirm or reject your doubts in the form of emotional peak. Your body reacts to any external factors with certain changes (skin conductivity, pulse rate, blood pressure level, etc.). Vivograph sensors capture these changes. SENSORS & COMPONENTS  Enjoy your life responsibly and Vivograph will notify you in advance about any emotional or physical changes in your body on the basis of the data from the built-in sensors. IDPP - Intellectual Data Processing ProgramSensors readings are processed by a unique software called IDPP (Intellectual Data Processing Program) developed specially for the Smart Watch Vivograph.IDPP allows the built-in sensors to control your psychological state. IDPP makes the Vivograph adjust to your body and identifies deviations in chosen sensors readings, it registers the data on the memory card together with time and location coordinates. Then it allows you to analyze these data.VIVOGRAPH has five basic functions which work using data from different sensors. With IDPP, you can choose sensors that will be activated to employ the function you need. You can choose how often the sensors are read, they can be read continuously or with a given periodicity. You can specify at what value of readings deviation the frequency of sensors reading will increase. You can set up the maximum deviations of the sensors readings at which VIVOGRAPH will give you a warning. Most important, the IDDP allows you creating new unique functions taking into account your body’s unique features. You can choose certain sensors and readings which you want to track during a given interval or in relation to physical or psychological load. While you’re watching a movie, reading a book, listening to a lecture, just pick the sensors which determine your emotional state so you can see the subconscious response of your body to the information you get.When doing physical activity, you can track the basic indications of your body in real time via certain sensors: heart beat rate and its changes in time, changes in blood pressure, how much oxygen is in your blood and the temperature of the body etc.Sensors readings are taken at a certain frequency. When sensor readings significantly deviate from a normal value the frequency of readings increase for more detailed tracking of dynamics. If the readings get into the “red zone” which you can set manually, the IDPP will inform you by sound or vibrating signal or by an SMS to three pre-set phone numbers. IDPP - controls basic functons VIVOGRAPH APPIDPP can be set up directly through the Vivograph menu or on the smartphone with help from the mobile app   You can use the VIVOGRAPH just like a smartphone Recharging VIVOGRAPH is easy and simple   ​Besides, we offer an optional VIVOGRAPH KIT which you can use to check the honesty of a person you’re talking with   Main features of the VIVOGRAPHModeling the VIVOGRAPH prototype COMPARE WEARABLES Available for ordering in Three Sizes & Five Colors

 We suggest you Five Colors to choose from Our TeamWe are united by the idea of creating a unique and innovative wearable device to monitor health.Our team of diverse professionals (psychologists, IT specialists, electronic engineers) has 10 years and more of experience in the respective fields. The team worked together for a long time and refined the polygraph, also known as lie detector. We have vast practical experience proven by tests with positive results and supported with confessions. We have developed several types of small-sized detectors. We have created several versions of unique software that allows quick assessment of a person's psycho-physiological state on the basis of bio-sensors readings.Small-sized detectors with bio-sensors allows not only verify the tested persons honesty, but also to estimate his or her emotional tiredness and physical readiness of the body to perform assigned tasks.On the basis of our accumulated experience we have developed a wearable polygraph in the form of smart watch - VIVOGRAPH. This device allows its owner to track his/her psycho-physiological state and to control emotions under certain important circumstances. Frequently Asked QuestionsQ: How does Vivograph work?​A: Vivograph has built-in biometric sensors that can detect variations in heart rate, respiration and perspiration rates and skin conductivity. These are all direct indicators of someone's emotional state. Different emotions are matched to biometric signal patterns detected over time, which are then correlated with other types of data such as activity levels, calendar events, and location. This information is all processed by the Intellectual Data Processing Program to give you personalized and actual guidance regarding your physical and emotional state.Q: What is IDPP?A: Intellectual Data Processing Program allows you to adjust your Vivograph to take in consideration your particular physical peculiarities and then inform you of any emotional or physical stresses in the most precise way. IDPP gathers data from the sensors and performs processing and comparison of the data against the adjusted settings. Thus, IDPP makes your Vivograph personalized.Q: How and where I can adjust the IDPP?A: You have several options. IDPP may automatically tune itself for your body's specific characteristics. You can also choose and adjust any function from Vivograph menu and adjust as you wish. You can use the Vivograph mobile app and adjust the IDPP from your smartphone, or you can directly connect your Vivograph to a PC, or a laptop, and make the necessary adjustments with the help of Vivograph application.Q: How long does it take to adjust my Vivograph's IDPP?A: Under normal circumstances, with no emotional or physical stress, adjustments will take no longer than twenty minutes. Then you will have to confirm sensors' readings. You can return to the manufacturers' settings at any time and repeat the sensors adjustments for IDPP.Q: How often the sensors readings are taken?A: The smaller the deviation of actual reading from the average-set value, the less the readings frequency will be. Reading's frequency is determined by the IDPP, according to an actuated function. You can also set the frequency manually or decide over specific sensors readings you want to track.Q: Can I track readings of a certain sensor?A: Yes, with help from IDPP you can select one or several certain sensors and their readings will be taken at a frequency set by you.Q: Can I use the Vivograph only as a Smartwatch?A: Of course, you can. Insert a SIM-card and switch off the IDPP. You will be able to call and text, to shoot video and photographs.Q: How does Vivograph connect to my smartphone?A: Vivograph syncs with your smartphone via Bluetooth SMART (low energy). The wearable works in conjunction with the Vivograph mobile app, which is compatible with both iOS and Android. Q: What's the difference between Vivograph and other hi tech wearable?A: Most wearable products focus on physical conditions only (e.g. measuring your heart rate, calculating your physical load) or tend to serve only one specific purpose (eg. analyse your breathing patterns). Vivograph employs the most advanced sensing technology in combination with state-of-art IDPP algorithms to figure out a complex view of your wellbeing (both emotional and physical) and give your data added ""life context"". Emotions are known to be a major factor influencing your physical health and generally all other aspects of life.Q: What is the SMART EMOTIONS POLYGRAPH function?A: With this function on, you may monitor your own emotional response on questions you answer. This will help you understand which questions cause the most intensive reaction and you can determine, for example, some topics that you will not want to discuss with a stranger, or, maybe you will want to go through these topics with your psychologist.Q: Why do I need to watch my STRESS LEVEL?A: Probability of stress situation occurrence directly depends on severity of emotional and physical stresses. Vivograph will tell you when it is necessary to take a break, relax and have some rest.Q: Is Vivograph a medical tool?A: No, Vivograph is not really a medical tool. Sensors readings and information from Vivograph may be used as an advice from a specialist. However, in case of health problems you need to see a physician.Q: Can I show the Vivograph data to a physician or a psychologist?A: Yes, it is your right. You can connect the Vivograph directly to a computer and transfer the data, or you can use the memory card for it.Q: How accurate are the sensors readings?A: Relative measurement error of sensors is from 0 to 3 %. Absolute instrument error of the sensors is determined by their manufacturers. We cooperate in order to minimize these errors.Q: Does Vivograph measure the blood pressure?A: Vivograph is equipped with a photoplethysmography sensor on the basis of which, and of other sensors the IDPP calculates relative change of blood pressure against average set value within a certain period of time.Q: What measurement units are used in Vivograph? A: Vivograph menu supports both US/Imperial and metric units.You can, for example, select the temperature readings to be shown in Fahrenheit or Celsius, the distance in miles or kilometers, etc.Q: How long does the battery last?A: Vivograph can last up to 10 days in the smartwatch mode without charging. It takes about 2 hours to fully charge. Since it uses a Bluetooth Smart (low energy) connection, it will not drain your smartphone battery. IDPP significantly saves the Vivograph battery.Q: How is Vivograph charged?A: Vivograph comes with a USB charger which connects to the USB port on the strap's end.Q: What materials the Vivograph is made of?A: The Vivograph body is made of high-strength lightweight titanium and aluminum alloy. The silicone wrist strap is hypoallergenic, washable, durable and comfortable.Q: Is Vivograph water resistant?A: Vivograph has an ATM rating and it's officially 'splashproof', which means it can resist to usual scenarios like temporarily being under the rain or washing your hands.Q: Are Vivograph wristbands interchangeable?A: The bands are currently not interchangeable, as the biometric sensors are built into the band and designed to keep working with you as you move throughout the day.Q: Is my personal information kept private?A: We're very much concerned about the privacy of your data. As a user, you are in full control over which data you want to share. Moreover, Vivograph is equipped with a fingerprint sensor and, if it is locked, nobody but you can access the device.Q: What will my pledge be used for?A: Your financial contribution will go directly towards tooling and manufacturing the first batch of Vivograph. It will also be used toward the research and development involved in bringing this product to market, including implementing a sustainable product lifecycle. Please see our timeline above to get a more detailed picture of our product roadmap.Q: How do I pay for shipping and where do you ship?A: Worldwide shipping available. We collect a small fee in order to support our costs for shipping Vivograph nationally and internationally. Q: Why do I need the Emotions Polygraph?A: This feature will let you track and control your emotional state, strength of your emotional response to different kind of situations, questions, scenes. Also, you can use Vivograph KIT for fun, e.g. run it as a 'lie detector' on your friends.",26.0,0,"3 Campaigns

What is the IH-GAIT: MINI CLINIC?

The MINI CLINIC is a small foot-print integrated rehabilitation and wellness equipment and software solution for use by ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients, recovering from neurologic and orthopedic conditions and improving quality-of-life for wellness patients.
The MINI CLINIC safely lifts and secures patients, within a body harness, and provides physical and occupational therapy mechanisms, for conducting effective rehabilitation and wellness programs, within one piece of equipment and supports:

Positive patient recovery after an injury or a surgical repair, to move from non-weight bearing, to partial to full weight-bearing status.
Quality of Life improvement for wheelchair-bound ambulatory patients to conduct upper and lower body exercises.


The MINI CLINIC safely lifts and lowers patients, up to 400 pounds, from sitting to standing position and provide body support while engaged in a wide array of Red Cord, TheraBand, customized exercises and traditional rehabilitation accessories. 
The MINI CLINIC supports a wide range of patient diagnoses and conditions:
Rehabilitation: Stroke, traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, amputees, and orthopedic injury.
Wellness: Wheelchair-bound patients to improve ‘quality of life’ conditions.
The MINI CLINIC incorporates a remote-control operated motorized patient lifting system that accommodates the vertical displacement of the center of gravity that occurs during normal Gait. When walking, an individual’s center of gravity typically moves through a vertical range from one to four inches, depending on walking speed.
This MINI CLINIC accommodates up to four inches of vertical displacement while maintaining a consistent level of unweighing. The MINI CLINIC provides fall protection and dynamic body-weight support and promote early intensive therapy and supports Standing Therapy for rehabilitation.

Therapy sessions are supported with the LL Corpus Cloud-based Patient-PT Assist Software App that provides a user-friendly E-Chart to manage patient goals, exercises and outcomes, vital signs, body pain points and record patient data and notes, on a digital tablet with Wi-Fi and Microsoft Azure Cloud, on real-time basis. The App also includes a TeleREHAB capability supporting sessions with the patient and therapist in different locations. All therapy sessions are videoed, via the tablet, allowing the therapist to review and evaluate patient exercises and body movements post session.

Patients are provided the opportunity to be immersed in a Virtual Realty scenario during the session to provide a distraction from the physical therapy. 
An occupational therapist may engage the same patient for ADL training using the OT Table Accessory. Mini Clinic presents limitless therapeutic exercises for different medical conditions and level of impairment to achieve individualized goals and outcomes.

A physical therapist, at JSS Medical Center, Mysore India, using MINI CLINIC reported that her stroke patient was able to start an early phase in rehabilitation because of the safe support mechanism it provides to assist the patient in standing and balance therapy, who required a maximum assistance of two persons, with risk of fall or injury.

How does the MINI CLINIC Work? 
The MINI CLINIC safely, with remote control, lifts and lowers the patient in a body harness, from a sitting position to standing, thereby, eliminating the physical handling of multiple therapists or caregivers in a secure environment.

<h2>Why SafelyMD?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Change, ""I wish I could do something to help,"" to, ""I'm glad I was able to help.""</strong></p>
<p>Every day, tens of thousands of people are transported to emergency rooms.  And when they arrive, the emergency room staff has to try to piece together a medical profile in order to provide the best possible care.  If the person being rushed to the ER is someone you know and love, you would do almost anything to help.  You would answer questions about medications, allergies and medical conditions.</p>
<p>But how do you know if you are giving the right answers?  Is dad's Carvedilol dosage 12.5 mg or 25 mg?  Does he take it twice a day or once a day?  It's hard to remember everything when you're under extreme stress.  Are you missing something?  And what if you aren't there to answer the questions?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492549324/rvl1kqc1tzn2o2mnwct7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">""I need a list of his medications.""</p>
<p>We at SafelyFiled have lived through late-night trips to the ER and know how important accurate information is.  As an example, the mother of one of our staff members has such severe allergy to latex that if she is exposed to it, she could die. How would the ER staff know about this life-threatening allergy unless they were told?  Who would tell them if she were unconscious?</p>
<p>Having an accurate medical history available can not only save lives, but can speed up the healing process, reduce the cost of care and prevent medical mistakes. </p>
<p>That's where SafelyMD comes in.  As shown in the video, if there is a medical emergency, you can make sure, with SafelyMD, that the EMTs and ER staff can get the information they need.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>SafelyMD follows a simple two step process:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Step 1 - Get your medical data into a secure database.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Step 2 - Give authorized medical personnel access to that database.</p>
<p>Here is how it works:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - After you sign up for SafelyMD, simply enter your data in the ""Key Emergency Data"" form  on the screen.  There are a lot of dropdowns to help.  This information gets stored in our secure database at Amazon Web Services.  You can update the information  at any time.  </p>
<p><i>Here is a screenshot of a portion of the Key Emergency Data form.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492630086/nxxjq5bvk8ckpv3v0kuk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>Here is a typical dropdown menu.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492630220/yqcni0wr1zrszy6azvxh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - After you have filled out the form, print a couple copies of the card shown below.  Have your parents or grandparents put one in their wallets and put another one on the fridge in their homes.  That way, if there is an emergency, the EMT's can scan the QR code on the card and access the information you put in the database. It will show up on their smart phones or on their monitors. </p>
<p>You can also print out a copies of the cards for your own wallet or purse.   That way, in the event a card is lost and you get a call from a hospital that your one of your parents is being admitted, you can read off the name and password on the card to give the hospital access to not only his or her medical data, but legal documents like a healthcare power of attorney or living will.</p>
<p><i>Go ahead, scan the QR code below to see how it works.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492622511/l6kwofk0deqaxxrncmwh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>You can update the data without having to reprint the card.</p>
<h3><strong>About Us</strong></h3>
<p>SafelyFiled.com, LLC, which provides SafelyMD, is a bit unusual for an entrepreneurial  tech company.   Our founders are not young and tech whizzes.  We are, as much as we don't like to admit it, old.   We can't do the coding ourselves, but we suppose that is probably a good thing. What we do bring to the company, aside from seed funding and management, is an understanding of how to make sure the developers design a UX for people who are not digital natives, who need to use reading glasses to see what's on a screen, and who can never remember what those three vertical dots on the top right of a browser are for.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492555478/ebmtzqbfhbhvpfshsvr8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:120px;""><i>     Who's older?  John or Mark?  Guess our ages.</i></p>
<p>We also bring our life experiences into the products we design and offer.  We've lived through crises like the death of a parent, rushing a spouse to the hospital in the middle of the night, getting a call from the school that an ambulance is taking a child to the hospital, and getting sick while on vacation in another country.  When looking back on those crises, we've asked ourselves, ""What did we need at that time?""  And our products are the answer to that question, both for ourselves and the millions of others in similar situations.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are raising $50,000 or more to do four things.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Make SafelyMD available for purchase through the Apple Store and Google Play. That will require some modification to our application.</li>
<li>Establish the procedures and enter into contracts to accurately produce and correctly distribute the wearable QR tags.</li>
<li>Make an investment in marketing.  Retaining a social network marketing expert is high our list.</li>
<li>Keep SafelyMD secure.  While we have bank-level security built into the application, we need ongoing monitoring to watch for new threats.</li>
</ol>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we intend to invest primarily in our social network marketing campaign.  Since SafelyMD is currently functional, that may enable us to raise enough revenue via sales to invest in the other 3 activities listed above.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Perks</strong></p>
<p>We have some perks for anyone participating in our campaign.</p>
<p>By participating in our campaign at the $25 or more level, you get SafelyMD and SafelyFiled products at significant discounts.  SafelyMD currently costs $12 per year.  A $25 contribution gives you 3 accounts.</p>
<p>And the larger your contribution, the greater the savings.  SafelyFiled Family is currently priced at $15 per month or $165 per year.  It lets you store up to 2,500 documents (maximum per- document size of 1 GB). And it includes up to 12 SafelyMD accounts at no extra cost.  A $50 contribution gets you a full year of SafelyFiled Family - a savings of $115.  </p>
<p>If you have a small business, you may want to consider a $100 contribution, which entitles you to a SafelyFiled Pro Lite account, offering 1 TB of storage, 12 included SafelyMD accounts and the ability to share documents with up to 50 others.  The savings add up to $175.</p>
<p>SafelyFiled was recently awarded US Patent # 9,497,173 for its application that enables you to store, share and retrieve both digital and paper documents in one system. By participating in our campaign, you can, for very little cost, experience SafelyFiled's unique features and the most sophisticated sharing functions in the industry.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our mission at SafelyFiled with SafelyMD and our other offerings is to provide useful products to <u>help you help the people you love</u>. Your contribution to enhance SafelyMD impacts the world in three ways.</p>
<p>First, if you have elderly parents or grandparents, or a child or sibling with special needs, knowing that their medical histories are available in an emergency is comforting.  You are helping your family.</p>
<p>Second, while taking care of your parents and grandparents is important, a contribution to help enhance SafelyMD can help improve and reduce the cost of healthcare in the United States. Until Electronic Medical Records are universally available in the US, we are responsible for our own records, and SafelyMD can provide the beginning of the critical information needed to help reduce mistakes, reduce the cost of redundant tests and provide quick access to accurate medical information.  It can make local EMTs more efficient, decreasing the time needed to take care of an emergency.  All this can reduce healthcare costs overall, helping to keep insurance premiums and Medicare and Medicaid expenses under control.  It's a small step, but it is a step in the right direction for our healthcare system.</p>
<p>Third, in addition to helping your family and contributing in a small way to reducing healthcare costs in the US, a contribution to the SafelyMD campaign can help people you barely know or may never meet.  From the elderly couple down the street, to the family with a special needs child on the other side of the country, to the three siblings spread across the world trying to coordinate the healthcare and financial affairs of an elderly parent, your participation in this campaign helps make it easier for each one of us to help others.</p>
<p>Your contribution helps us fulfill our mission to make it easier for our customers to help the people they care about.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Currently SafelyMD and other SafelyFiled products run on the same platform and share the same application.  We may, for a number of reasons, such as security, administration and legal, find it necessary to separate the two, running SafelyMD on a separate and independent platform.  This could potentially increase the effort needed to revise and update the application, increasing costs and detracting from the marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Since security is of paramount importance, it may be necessary to expend more resource in modifying code and procedures to respond to new security threats.</p>
<p>Currently, SafelyFiled and SafelyMD utilize the hosting facilities of Amazon Web Services and run on DynamoDB.  DynamoDB is a proprietary database application that is controlled by Amazon Web Services.  As a proprietary application, SafelyFiled is dependent upon its continued operation in its current form.  Modifications to DynamoDB may necessitate additional coding by SafelyFiled and increase costs associated with the technical activities.</p>
<p>We are aware that others, including Google, have unsuccessfully developed and marketed medical data applications.  And though we believe that our utilization of the QR codes, the patented underlying application, and our marketing focus increase our chances for success, the potential for failure exists as it does in every venture.</p>
</div><div><h3>How Else You Can Help</h3></div><p>If you can't contribute to the campaign, we understand.  There are thousands of very worthwhile causes in the world and nobody can contribute to all of them.  But there is something you can do that will cost nothing more than a minute of your time.</p><p><strong>Let the world know about us.</strong></p><p>Please help us get the word out about SafelyMD.  If you are on Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter or any other social network, please like us or post a link to our Indiegogo page and say a few words about why SafelyMD might be important to someone.</p><p>Remember, SafelyMD just might help save the life of someone important to you.</p></div>","Why SafelyMD?

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>The Movement Sanctuary was formed behind one common theme:  <strong>the passion for movement and sharing it with others. </strong> We know that through movement you bring happiness to all aspects of your life, our vision is to create an innovative training space that inspires people from all walks of life to connect, collaborate and have fun. </p>
<p>Our warehouse in Downtown St Pete has received countless hours of love and labor from a diverse group of people in our community who deserve to see this vision come into its fullest expression. This is why we need you!   It has been a privilege and honor to have the opportunity to cultivate a thriving community focused on well-being.</p>
<p>Please consider donating to The Movement Sanctuary, in support of your fellow movers and shakers, so that they may share, grow and shine in a safe space. </p>

<h3>What we need to grow:</h3>
<p>We've covered the bare bones to get started (thanks to our 'Cinco de Acro' Fundraising Festival and a small private loan), however we need your contributions to help transform this old artist warehouse into a superior training center and performance space for everyone to enjoy (in Air Conditioning)!</p>
<p>On top of a commercial air conditioning unit, we need to purchase equipment for the gym to accommodate different disciplines and to ensure safety of our students.  </p>
<p>To expand our vision,  we will need funding for the following projects and necessities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air Conditioning ($22,000 after installation)</li>
<li>Electrical Work ($4,000 with labor, right now fuses are blown constantly)</li>
<li>Raw materials &amp; tools for facility improvements, like a new bathroom! ($7,000)</li>
<li>Lighting ($4,500 after installation)</li>
<li>Fun stuff: Aerial Silks, Mobility Tools, Juggling Toys &amp; Rigging ($2,500+)</li>
<li>Additional crash mats, a rotating twisting belt, spotting blocks ($3,500+)</li>
<li>Ninja Warrior Obstacles ($2,000)</li>
<li>Sound system ($1,000)</li>
<li>Stage Costs: building materials, lighting, safety lines ($2,000+)</li>
<li>Have kiddo insurance so we can hold Kids Cirque Classes in the future! (Approximately $2,500 for the year)</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we will use these funds to get our non-profit off the ground and running. The focus of our non-profit is to bring yoga, meditation, juggling and Acroyoga into the school system and beyond.</p>

The Movement Sanctuary was formed behind one common theme:  the passion for movement and sharing it with others.  We know that through movement you bring happiness to all aspects of your life, our vision is to create an innovative training space that inspires people from all walks of life to connect, collaborate and have fun. 
Our warehouse in Downtown St Pete has received countless hours of love and labor from a diverse group of people in our community who deserve to see this vision come into its fullest expression. This is why we need you!   It has been a privilege and honor to have the opportunity to cultivate a thriving community focused on well-being.
Please consider donating to The Movement Sanctuary, in support of your fellow movers and shakers, so that they may share, grow and shine in a safe space. 

 

 
What we need to grow:
We've covered the bare bones to get started (thanks to our 'Cinco de Acro' Fundraising Festival and a small private loan), however we need your contributions to help transform this old artist warehouse into a superior training center and performance space for everyone to enjoy (in Air Conditioning)!
On top of a commercial air conditioning unit, we need to purchase equipment for the gym to accommodate different disciplines and to ensure safety of our students.  
To expand our vision,  we will need funding for the following projects and necessities:

Air Conditioning ($22,000 after installation)
Electrical Work ($4,000 with labor, right now fuses are blown constantly)
Raw materials & tools for facility improvements, like a new bathroom! ($7,000)
Lighting ($4,500 after installation)
Fun stuff: Aerial Silks, Mobility Tools, Juggling Toys & Rigging ($2,500+)
Additional crash mats, a rotating twisting belt, spotting blocks ($3,500+)
Ninja Warrior Obstacles ($2,000)
Sound system ($1,000)
Stage Costs: building materials, lighting, safety lines ($2,000+)
Have kiddo insurance so we can hold Kids Cirque Classes in the future! (Approximately $2,500 for the year)

Additionally, we will use these funds to get our non-profit off the ground and running. The focus of our non-profit is to bring yoga, meditation, juggling and Acroyoga into the school system and beyond.

<h3>A Mission for Mom</h3>
<p>Hi! I’m Melanie, the founder and owner of Hi-FiBar. Last year, my mom was diagnosed with type II diabetes and had to change her dietary habit and reduce her sugar intake. The problem is - most snack bars on the market have too much sugar, even the “healthy alternatives” use sugar-based syrup to hold everything together.  </p>
<p>Not being able to find anything good enough, I decided to use my years of training in food science and make one for her! At Hi-FiBar, we use a <strong>special dietary fiber blend </strong>to bind all the natural ingredients together.  Each bar has 2g or less sugar (from nuts and seeds) - this is <strong>60-90% less sugar</strong> than other products out there!</p>

Hi! I’m Melanie, the founder and owner of Hi-FiBar. Last year, my mom was diagnosed with type II diabetes and had to change her dietary habit and reduce her sugar intake. The problem is - most snack bars on the market have too much sugar, even the “healthy alternatives” use sugar-based syrup to hold everything together.  
Not being able to find anything good enough, I decided to use my years of training in food science and make one for her! At Hi-FiBar, we use a special dietary fiber blend to bind all the natural ingredients together.  Each bar has 2g or less sugar (from nuts and seeds) - this is 60-90% less sugar than other products out there!
 



Our Flavors:

Pumpkin Spice Orange (NEW!!)
Smoked Paprika
Lemon Zest Blueberry
Coconut Cranberry



 
My mom loves the bars - and so do many others!  We've sold hundreds of bars at local events and online.  Our newest fall flavor, Pumpkin Spice Orange, was an instant hit at the NJ VegFest and our granola sold out in an hour. Hi-FiBar is a great snack for everyone, but we need your help to get it into the hands of more people!

<h2><strong>Natural indoor rowing - the S1club</strong></h2>
<p><strong>It is as natural and as healthy as the real rowing.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501489198/bmpzr4ez9s0xbebmkqlk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<h3>Our story in less than 1 minute:</h3>
<p>At Biorower, we have been building ultra realistic rowing machines for more than 15 years. They are considered to be the best, and most natural rowing devices on the market.<br/>As all of them were hand made, so they also were amongst the most expensive ones, with prices ranging between 14.000 and 31.000 EUR per device.This has all changed. We have invested heavily to change the game, and opt for cutting edge industrial production.</p>For the upcoming production run, we plan to manufacture at least 250 units for the price of<p><strong>2.917,- EUR* + VAT</strong> for everyone <strong>outside the EU</strong>)<br/>which is <strong>3.499,-* EUR including 20% Austrian VAT </strong>for everyone <strong>inside the EU</strong>...</p>
<h2>if we can get enough support from you.</h2>
<p><strong>Help us change indoor rowing for the better! </strong>Help us to bring natural, healthy rowing to the world.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Order, donate and spread the word!</strong></p>
<p>*Tablet, shipping cost and possible import duty are not included.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501489251/ywmkis99xwallujhq7v2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>Basic facts - Q&amp;A</h2>
<h3>What will happen with my money?</h3>
<p>We will finance the production of the S1club in larger quantities.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is rowing so healthy?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>improves your strenght + your endurance</strong></li>
<li><strong>this specific workout helps to prevent burnout</strong></li>
<li><strong>clears your mind</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The real rowing is one of the healthiest, most comprehensive workouts you can possibly do. It gives you both - <strong>strength and endurance. The rowing workout helps many people to clear their minds, make themselves tired, and catch a good sleep. </strong></p>
<p><strong>While the increased strength improves your muscle structure, the endurance training eliminates certain hormones which are required for stress related burnout symptoms.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Who is this rowing machine designed for?</strong></h3>
<p>Rowers, Gyms and Home-Fitness</p>
<p><strong>It is specifically designed to make natural rowing possible for as many people as possible.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>I am not a rower - will this work for me?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes. Tests we have carried out have shown evidence that the realistic rowing movement is easier to learn than rowing on linear drive ergs. (like the example in the picture below) All people tested proclaimed that rowing effectively on a Biorower appears to be more intuitive, logical to the body, and therefore easier to understand and apply than rowing on conventional ergometers, where rowers pull linear, which was perceived as “difficult” and “involving stiff muscles”.</p>
<h3><strong>Why conventional ergs are not the best option for your back</strong></h3>
<p>A linear pull basically resembles the movement of lifting weights with a round back from the floor.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501922321/hagmnxd0a6nl3cpantw7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501923212/asj5n3ymgpuns4kkegbc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As the linear drive is a movement that naturally harms the body, unless carried out with positioning correction every stroke, the movement contradicts with most people’s natural self-protective mechanisms. It is the fact that linear drive ergs force athletes to work against their natural self-protection mechanisms which makes training on these machines so “difficult” and “counter intuitive”.</p> <h3><strong>So what is the difference to the boat and the Biorower?</strong></h3>
<p>Pulling on two independently functioning and semi-circular moving oar handles results in the strengthening of the involved muscle chains, as well as in an increased mobility of the entire torso. <u><strong>There is no linear wear on the spline.</strong></u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501923185/gy7nsqolspscpkctv3ax.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/>It is the combination of round back and linear pulling which causes the problems.<br/>This is why the older generations of rowers, those who did not use ergometers for their practice, do not have back problems today.</p>
<div> </div>
<div>Many customers are not aware of these details, but they certainly feel a lack of mobility and increasingly stiff muscles due to the shock-absorbent reaction of the muscles chains along the spine column.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This video explaines the details:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uSL5LIT_Fag?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>How does the Biorower compare to the boat?</h3>
<div>
<p><strong>Precisely as natural and healthy for your body.</strong></p>
<p>It compares very well. This is an overview of the S1pro versus the boat. The S1pro and the S1club have a similar geometry. It is important for your spline that the handles move in semi-circles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>At the start of the stroke, your hands will pull towards each other.</strong></p>

<p><strong>At the last part of the stroke (the finish), your hands pull outwards / away from each other. This results in greater mobility and power of the muscles of the shoulders, trizeps, brest, and back, without overloading them. It is as natural and as healthy as the real rowing.</strong></p>

<p>3,5 years of rowing were enough for Team BIOROWERs Jakob Zwölfer to make his first international medal, getting Bronze in the LM1x at the European University Championships in Hannover. Jakob learned rowing in January 2012 on a Biorower at the age of 16. His first time on the water was in the first days of March 2012, after two months of Biorower training without ever beeing on the water. In April 2012, after two months of rowing on the water, Jakob put in a 2000m time in the single of under 8:00. Year by hear his best times became faster and faster. With 22 years of age, 180cm height and 70kg weight he was able to do a 7:15.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501509082/snk6hbvtg1feewe8ljlh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>One year later, he put in a 7:00 over 2000m, winning medals at International University Championships, National Championships and competing at the U23 World Championships.</p>
<p>In 2017, 5 years after having done his first rowing strokes on the Biorower, the young athlete put in a 2000m-time of 6:54, just 8 sec. off the world best time in his age and weight category.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to follow his progress even more.</p>

<p><strong>From beginner to Olympian in 7 years</strong></p>
<p>My coach PetterLjungström and I started to work with <a href=""http://www.aramtraining.com/a"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Aram </a>and the Biorower in 2009 when I was a beginner. We have been working with Aram ever since and with his help and knowledge in human physiology, rowing technique and biomechanics I can now call myself an Olympian.</p>
<p>Since I was introduced to sport and rowing as a 22 year old, it was crucial for me to get both individualized and targetbased training. There were many things I needed to learn and develop!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501508983/ylhfly0igdtrvxw2hn0s.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With Aram’s help, both on distance (through Skype), and by my side in Vienna (Austria), Stockholm (Sweden), Racice (Czech Republic) and Montemor o Velho (Portugal) I got faster every year.</p>
<p>His individualized coaching and mental support helped me to win my first gold medal in the Swedish Championships in 2013, both indoors on the erg and on the water. The following year I was selected to compete for Sweden in the European Championships, the World Championships and also at two World Cups.</p>
<p>A big goal in my career was the World Championships in 2015 which also was an Olympic Qualification Regatta. I managed to qualify an Olympic spot for Sweden which Idefended in 2016in a two month long selection period.</p>

<h3>The Biorower story</h3>

<p>If you put in everything you are, winning is not an option anymore, but the logical consequence.</p>
<p>We stand behind our product with everything we are and everything we have.</p>
<p>There is no other way than seeing the BIOROWER become the new standard in 21st century rowing. <strong>It is realistically natural, it is healthy, and it has now become affordable for many people.</strong></p>
<p>At the beginning of our story, there was a vision of a rowing machine that needs to be rowed like a boat.</p>
<p>So we did. Like young athletes, we started with no experience, no cash and certainly no support.<br/>So what, we kept on going. I had 3 day-time-jobs, sometimes 4, to pay for my living and to grow the company. My partner invested is entire pension, month after month, for many years.</p>
<p><br/>Learning to make the perfect BIOROWER, meant learning to perfectly understand the interaction between the athlete and the boat.</p>
<p># Rowing efficiently, means understanding your individual potential. Every athlete has an absolutely unique body.</p>
<p># Moving a boat truly fast, means understanding what the boat can do and what it cannot do. In order to controll your boat, you have to controll yourself. In order to get the boat going fast, you need to be able to feel it.</p>
<p># Rowing together, means influencing the boat exactly the same way – not looking the same.</p>
<p>Today, we passionately manufacture rowing machines, our customers call “the most effective training device for real rowing”.</p>
<p>What makes a BIOROWER so special is the combination of three key elements:<br/>– The way every BIOROWER is built (it has the exact set up and the adjustability of a racing shell)<br/>– The mechanic feedback: With both inboards being independently connected to one shared resistance unit, the BIOROWER makes you feel what the boat needs from you in order to go fast. Even if you have never sat in a boat.<br/>– The App, which allows rowers and coaches to get to know the influence athletes have on their boats. It allows all members of the team to connect and share their rowing data to save precious time to enjoy rowing more.</p>
<p>All of this leads to the point where athletes forget about the theory and start to row efficiently fast – because they understand how to use their potential. It is not important if you are tall or not, it is important that you understand what your potential is to row fast – and to learn how to use it.</p>
<p><strong>That’s the mission of BIOROWER - become a part of it.</strong></p>

It is as natural and as healthy as the real rowing.

Our story in less than 1 minute:
At Biorower, we have been building ultra realistic rowing machines for more than 15 years. They are considered to be the best, and most natural rowing devices on the market.As all of them were hand made, so they also were amongst the most expensive ones, with prices ranging between 14.000 and 31.000 EUR per device.This has all changed. We have invested heavily to change the game, and opt for cutting edge industrial production.For the upcoming production run, we plan to manufacture at least 250 units for the price of2.917,- EUR* + VAT for everyone outside the EU)which is 3.499,-* EUR including 20% Austrian VAT for everyone inside the EU...
if we can get enough support from you.
Help us change indoor rowing for the better! Help us to bring natural, healthy rowing to the world.

Basic facts - Q&A
What will happen with my money?
We will finance the production of the S1club in larger quantities.
Why is rowing so healthy?

improves your strenght + your endurance
this specific workout helps to prevent burnout
clears your mind

The real rowing is one of the healthiest, most comprehensive workouts you can possibly do. It gives you both - strength and endurance. The rowing workout helps many people to clear their minds, make themselves tired, and catch a good sleep. 
While the increased strength improves your muscle structure, the endurance training eliminates certain hormones which are required for stress related burnout symptoms.
Who is this rowing machine designed for?
Rowers, Gyms and Home-Fitness
It is specifically designed to make natural rowing possible for as many people as possible.
I am not a rower - will this work for me?
Yes. Tests we have carried out have shown evidence that the realistic rowing movement is easier to learn than rowing on linear drive ergs. (like the example in the picture below) All people tested proclaimed that rowing effectively on a Biorower appears to be more intuitive, logical to the body, and therefore easier to understand and apply than rowing on conventional ergometers, where rowers pull linear, which was perceived as “difficult” and “involving stiff muscles”.
Why conventional ergs are not the best option for your back
A linear pull basically resembles the movement of lifting weights with a round back from the floor.


As the linear drive is a movement that naturally harms the body, unless carried out with positioning correction every stroke, the movement contradicts with most people’s natural self-protective mechanisms. It is the fact that linear drive ergs force athletes to work against their natural self-protection mechanisms which makes training on these machines so “difficult” and “counter intuitive”. So what is the difference to the boat and the Biorower?
Pulling on two independently functioning and semi-circular moving oar handles results in the strengthening of the involved muscle chains, as well as in an increased mobility of the entire torso. There is no linear wear on the spline.

It is the combination of round back and linear pulling which causes the problems.This is why the older generations of rowers, those who did not use ergometers for their practice, do not have back problems today.
 
Many customers are not aware of these details, but they certainly feel a lack of mobility and increasingly stiff muscles due to the shock-absorbent reaction of the muscles chains along the spine column.
 
This video explaines the details:
 


 

How does the Biorower compare to the boat?

Precisely as natural and healthy for your body.
It compares very well. This is an overview of the S1pro versus the boat. The S1pro and the S1club have a similar geometry. It is important for your spline that the handles move in semi-circles.
 
At the start of the stroke, your hands will pull towards each other.

During the middle of the pull (rowers call it ""drive phase""), the hands pull overlapping semi-circles - again, there is no linear pulling movement.


At the last part of the stroke (the finish), your hands pull outwards / away from each other. This results in greater mobility and power of the muscles of the shoulders, trizeps, brest, and back, without overloading them. It is as natural and as healthy as the real rowing.


Okay. Is the tablet included?
No. In order to connect with the included sensors (Bluetooth), and to use the Biorower App (included) you will need an android tablet with the following specs:
# Android 5.x or higher# Bluetooth 4.0 or higher# Screen resolution 1280 x 800 or 1366 x 768 (the app is currently optimized for these resolutions, with the next updates, the list is planned to be enhanced) 
How much space will I need?
When in use: apprx. 200cm x 200cmWhen in storage: apprx. 200xm by 50cm (simply put it upright next to a wall)
How will the S1club be shipped?
It will be shipped in a wooden box.Approximate dimension: 100x80x60 cmWeight: apprx. 60kg
Is the assembly difficult?
No. There is a clear cut manual. The assembly is a simple set-by-step process.The assembly should be done by 2 people, and it usually takes roughly 20-30 minutes.
Can I see more pictures?
...of course. Here we go:



 
T H E   F E A T U R E S
Racing boat native spread and inboard length dimensions

The distance from oar lock to oar lock, also called span or spread is a crucial mark when it comes to setting up a boat. Every S1club comes with a standard span of 160cm.Likewise, the inboard length is crucial to experience the same rotation angle as in the boat. Naturally, your Biorower comes with the racing shell native inboard length of 88cm.
The idea behind it…
The settings of the span and the inboard are crucial for every rower. Naturally, the Biorower features boat native measurements. As the resistance is not generated by water but by air, the span and inboard settings here are not responsible for the resistance calibration but for the similar amplitude compared to the boat.
 
Rotating handles

The rotating handles provide the BIOROWER typical multidimensional feedback. This means that you may feather and square the blades just like you would do it in the boat.
After all, a BIOROWER is a BIOROWER, not an ergometer.
Adjustable foot stretchers (foot plates)

In every new boat we sit in, the first thing we check is the position of the foot stretchers. Of course you do the same on your BIOROWER. A solid mechanism allows you to set your foot stretchers according to your individual body proportions.
 
Adjustable height difference from seat to heels

Just like in your boat. Simply adjust the height difference from your heels to the seat as you would do in the boat.
The idea behind it…The angle of the knees, the resulting angle of the hip and of the ankle are essentially responsible for the ability to apply power that connects your foot stretchers with your blade. The BIOROWER is built provide the natural rowing feeling. This is what we believe it is important that you can adjust your BIOROWER to your boat measurements. However, as soon as athletes are off the water, they tend to set their training device to be as comfortable as possible. The boat, however, is not always comfortable. The height difference from your seat to your heels are mostly determined by the depth of your racing shell.

Overview

Force and angle sensors measure your performance every stroke

One bluetooth sender on each side transmitts all data to a mobile Android deviceThe senders have micro-USB-rechargable batteries which last for 24 hours of consequtive training. 

The included Biorower App provides live data about your performance, and about your technique
Share your training data online through the Biorower portal with other people from around the globe

Details
The new BIOROWER App performes a full biomechanical analysis of every rowing stroke you do.It tells you important facts about your power balance (left / right), and your length of pulling.
Too much data? Keep it simple and use the cockpit view.Too little data? Go to the signal mode, and check your force and angle curves.Use your own smartphone or tablet as your display. Store training data on your device and upload it to the Biorower-Portal. Connect with your crew members online and share your progress data.As a coach, you can form your team online and receive all training data instantly. You know exactly which athlete influences the boat in which way – selection has never been so easy and as transparent as with the Biorower. Let the facts work for you.

What other people have to say about the Biorower
 

“The BIOROWER feels very realistic compared with the boat”
Ondrej Synek (CZE),
Olympic Silver Medalist
World Champion
European Champion
 
Captain of the Cambridge University Eight 2015
“Although I had been rowing for years, I knew comparatively little about my technique. The BIOROWER unmistakably showed me how much potential my stroke has. Thanks to the live-feedback it helps me to professionally and continuously improve my rowing technique.”
Alexander Leichter (AUT)

 
“I learned to row on the Biorower”

3,5 years of rowing were enough for Team BIOROWERs Jakob Zwölfer to make his first international medal, getting Bronze in the LM1x at the European University Championships in Hannover. Jakob learned rowing in January 2012 on a Biorower at the age of 16. His first time on the water was in the first days of March 2012, after two months of Biorower training without ever beeing on the water. In April 2012, after two months of rowing on the water, Jakob put in a 2000m time in the single of under 8:00. Year by hear his best times became faster and faster. With 22 years of age, 180cm height and 70kg weight he was able to do a 7:15.

One year later, he put in a 7:00 over 2000m, winning medals at International University Championships, National Championships and competing at the U23 World Championships.
In 2017, 5 years after having done his first rowing strokes on the Biorower, the young athlete put in a 2000m-time of 6:54, just 8 sec. off the world best time in his age and weight category.
We are looking forward to follow his progress even more.
 
 
From beginner to Olympian in 7 years
My coach PetterLjungström and I started to work with Aram and the Biorower in 2009 when I was a beginner. We have been working with Aram ever since and with his help and knowledge in human physiology, rowing technique and biomechanics I can now call myself an Olympian.
Since I was introduced to sport and rowing as a 22 year old, it was crucial for me to get both individualized and targetbased training. There were many things I needed to learn and develop!

With Aram’s help, both on distance (through Skype), and by my side in Vienna (Austria), Stockholm (Sweden), Racice (Czech Republic) and Montemor o Velho (Portugal) I got faster every year.
His individualized coaching and mental support helped me to win my first gold medal in the Swedish Championships in 2013, both indoors on the erg and on the water. The following year I was selected to compete for Sweden in the European Championships, the World Championships and also at two World Cups.
A big goal in my career was the World Championships in 2015 which also was an Olympic Qualification Regatta. I managed to qualify an Olympic spot for Sweden which Idefended in 2016in a two month long selection period.

It was amazing to experience the Olympic Games in Rio – a dream I never would have been able to reach without Aram and Biorower by my side.
 
 

Bosön Elite Sport testing & training (SWE) Swedish National Rowing Team
Since 2012, the team around Lennart Gulstrand, Tobias Elgh and Tobias Lindberg are using the BIOROWER for testing and training with elite level athletes. “I consider the BIOROWER to be the best rowing machine on the market. This is why we bought it.”

 
The Biorower story

If you put in everything you are, winning is not an option anymore, but the logical consequence.
We stand behind our product with everything we are and everything we have.
There is no other way than seeing the BIOROWER become the new standard in 21st century rowing. It is realistically natural, it is healthy, and it has now become affordable for many people.
At the beginning of our story, there was a vision of a rowing machine that needs to be rowed like a boat.
So we did. Like young athletes, we started with no experience, no cash and certainly no support.So what, we kept on going. I had 3 day-time-jobs, sometimes 4, to pay for my living and to grow the company. My partner invested is entire pension, month after month, for many years.
Learning to make the perfect BIOROWER, meant learning to perfectly understand the interaction between the athlete and the boat.
# Rowing efficiently, means understanding your individual potential. Every athlete has an absolutely unique body.
# Moving a boat truly fast, means understanding what the boat can do and what it cannot do. In order to controll your boat, you have to controll yourself. In order to get the boat going fast, you need to be able to feel it.
# Rowing together, means influencing the boat exactly the same way – not looking the same.
Today, we passionately manufacture rowing machines, our customers call “the most effective training device for real rowing”.
What makes a BIOROWER so special is the combination of three key elements:– The way every BIOROWER is built (it has the exact set up and the adjustability of a racing shell)– The mechanic feedback: With both inboards being independently connected to one shared resistance unit, the BIOROWER makes you feel what the boat needs from you in order to go fast. Even if you have never sat in a boat.– The App, which allows rowers and coaches to get to know the influence athletes have on their boats. It allows all members of the team to connect and share their rowing data to save precious time to enjoy rowing more.
All of this leads to the point where athletes forget about the theory and start to row efficiently fast – because they understand how to use their potential. It is not important if you are tall or not, it is important that you understand what your potential is to row fast – and to learn how to use it.
That’s the mission of BIOROWER - become a part of it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Randall Mills, and I have been in the telemedicine industry for over 12 years, with our doctors providing prescriptions by phone or video conference to thousands of patients.  Please see our current web site at <a href=""http://www.24hourphysicians.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.24hourphysicians.com</a></p>
<p>I have noticed that only a few of our patients have a primary care physician to coordinate their total care.  Many have their medical records at as many as 8 different providers, which are usually not available to all these providers and would takes weeks for each provider to collect.</p>
<p>We are trying to go one step further and create a place where all records can be stored, and all caregivers will have instant access to them.  And our doctors can be the ""quarterback"" of the patients total medical care.</p>
<p>We want to have our doctors be their primary care physician, whose job it is to coordinate all healthcare for each patient.  Just as with in-person primary care physicians, they can give advice (based on the complete medical history), write new or refill prescriptions and send them to a pharmacy of the customer's choice, refer them to labs if needed, and refer them to other primary care physicians and specialists as they decide is necessary for the patient.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q4: How durable is it?</strong></p>
<p>A4: The container is made up of food grade material, which lasts for more than 5-7 years. Apart from that, we provide a 1-year replacement warranty on the entire product.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q5: Can we take out or replace the tap?</strong></p>
<p>A5: You can but it is not recommended or required.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q6: Does it use electricity?</strong></p>
<p>A6: Yes, a power adapter is provided along with the product.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q7: How do I clean and maintain the product?</strong></p>
<p>A7: Simply clean the outer product with a clean wet cloth. You may rinse the product from inside with clean drinking water or you may wash the product from inside with utensil detergent. Take care not to let water inside the electronic part of the tap.</p>

     Drinking Water 
 

 

 Meet the Maker  Bhrigu ChadhaCo-Founder & CEOThe inventor and creator of the V-urify Touchless Dispenser for drinking water.After spending over 2 years in improving his design based on user feedback he has developed a product like no other in its capabilities and price range.A person with a passion for technology and a perpetual fervor for learning. Having filed 3 technology patents for programmable electronic devices he is finally ready to take his invention to the market to make lives better for everyone.This product has brought together his lifelong dream to help people with technology while also educating the world to make it a better place through improved sanitation.  How the V-urify Touchless  dispenser works  
Toggle mode is ideal for domestic use.
Concealed Button makes it easier to change the mode for a consistent experience.
Continuous mode is ideal for offices, hospitals, schools, factories, hotels and other public places.
 
 Issues with existing systems Studies have shown that Manual Drinking Water Taps come in contact with 3,200 bacteria from 150 different species on our hands. The manual taps on drinking water dispensers are the most commonly touched surfaces.They carry more than nine types of infections. 1000s of people in hospitals, schools, offices, factories touch drinking water dispenser taps. These spread infections that cause fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, fatigue, abdominal pain, pimples, pneumonia and even flu.  We felt that this problem could be solved using touchless technologies which we were working on at that time.We found that there was so much work that was being done touchless bathroom faucets, high-pressure water dispensers and even for dustbins. Yet there weren't affordable and versatile options for the more commonly used water dispensers. Along the way, we got a chance to better understand why the existing touchless solutions weren't largely adopted. They are hygienic only in high pressure, high capacity systems, and may undergo accumulation of rust, dirt, grime and bacteria over time. They require higher maintenance and associated costs. We wanted to provide a solution that didn't have such issues due to solenoid valves.Vurify solves problems with both manual and existing touchless systems.We wanted to provide a solution that didn't have issues such as corrosion due to solenoid valves and could function even at low pressure while providing better sanitation.  Our DUAL PROTECTION Technology has solved these existing limitations and created a better solution.  FROM IDEATION TO PROTOTYPING TO TESTING AND FINALLY PRODUCTION  We wanted to ensure that we didn't just create a basic solution to monetize but also involve the end user to help us better develop a product based on feedback. This process took us over 2 years taking our concept from ideation to prototyping and then testing the responses for each change in our module. Using this feedback, we tweaked not only the core functionality but also the ergonomics of its usage and the presentability of our product.  

 
During every stage of our product development, we got the opportunity to demonstrate our product to people from different domains. We were lucky enough to find early adopters with organisations who gave us access to a larger consumer pool for a wider spectrum of opinions. It is from these interactions we not only better understood the ideal price point for an every day consumer but also received inquiries from multiple distributors showing interest in this product.   Probably being the first movers in this niche segment (touchless dispenser for drinking water at low pressure), we realised there is a mass need and a global scope of impact for the benefits that this solution offers. We wanted this to be a product that was accessible for all and the process of bringing down the cost took us a while to figure out - from a manufacturing perspective. Finally, while we are able to provide this solution at an affordable price in developing nations, we are also able to offer it at the same cost as a manual dispenser in developed nations.Our goal is to ensure that the price shouldn't be a hindrance in spreading this technology or the message behind it.  Replace all your manual water dispensers!    Finally at the manufacturing plant in North India! Flew nearly 2500 kms to the manufacturer to monitor the manufacturing process of our touchless dispenser. Walking in at the manufacturing plant nervous and excited to see the final parts being assembled after months of coordination. Hands-on testing the circuits for the touchless module of the dispenser. Watching the injection moulding of the dispenser. Injection Molding of the Dispenser shadeAbove is a glimpse of our first steps in the manufacturing process of our dispenser. Follow us to keep track of our progress as we create the Touchless Revolution. Recognition Sharing your support to provide safe water where it is required most

<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects muscle coordination and leads to mental decline and behavioral symptoms. There is no cure for Huntington's Disease. Huntington's Disease usually begins between 35 and 44 years of age and with a life expectancy of 10 to 25 years in adults and cases starting before the age of 21 years life expectancy is only 10 years.

I will be taking pictures and posting updates on the website that we will be setting up so you can follow the Journey daily. I won't be alone, coming with me in the support vehicle and sometimes riding himself will be Trey Gray.

My name is Doug Michael and my best friend Trey Gray has Huntington's Disease (HD). 



(Pictured Left to Right) Trey and Doug 2003

While I have supported HD for over a decade now I want to do something big to bring awareness to the cause and raise money for research. So, I have decided to ride a bike across the United States. Your help can bring about more awareness of this disease while also helping raise the funds needed to find a cure. If everyone who knows someone with HD were to contribute just $2 to this cause think about the impact and the difference this would make. Help me get the word out and let's make a difference!
What is Huntington's Disease
Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that affects muscle coordination and leads to mental decline and behavioral symptoms. There is no cure for Huntington's Disease. Huntington's Disease usually begins between 35 and 44 years of age and with a life expectancy of 10 to 25 years in adults and cases starting before the age of 21 years life expectancy is only 10 years. Some people have described it as having MS, Parkinson and Dementia all in one.

   The Journey 

I will be riding a bicycle for about 3500 from California to New York. I'll be starting at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, CA, then traveling to Nashville, TN and then from there I will be heading north to South Bend, IN. After I leave South Bend I will be heading east to the Big Apple, New York City, where my ride will end at Yankee Stadium. During my ride I will be stopping in communities to do interviews on radio, television, newspaper and any other types of media outlets telling people about what I am doing and why we need their support for HD. I will be taking pictures and posting updates on the website that we will be setting up so you can follow the Journey daily. I won't be alone, coming with me in the support vehicle and sometimes riding himself will be Trey Gray. Some of you may know Trey from his work with Huntington's Disease Society of America as their former spokesperson,   the HD documentary film Alive and Well that he was in or for being a professional musician the last 20 years playing and touring with Faith Hill, Jewel, Brooks n Dunn and Ronnie Dunn. 



Trey Gray 2011

We are raising $55,000. The money we raise will be going to ""The Trey Gray Fund for Huntington's Disease"" at the Vanderbilt University research center for HD and for covering the expenses of traveling 3500 miles. The expenses include renting a support vehicle (a small RV) to carry the support team, extra equipment that is needed such as spare tires and an extra bike, hotels, gas, a website so the public can follow our progress and a PR person to help us get to interviews on the different media outlets while we are on the journey. It will take us between 35 to 50 days depending on weather, rode conditions and the number of interviews that take place. 


What You Get When You Help 
First we want you all to know that all donation go directly to finding a cure and raising awereness. Second, we've kept our perks pretty conservative as we want the funds we raise to go to the cause and not the expenses of paying for merchandise but Country Recording Artists Rodney Atkins has donated Meet and Greet Passes for one of our perks.

<p>This campaign is an attempt to raise funds to cover the substantial medical costs (including an air ambulance service use) incurred over the last six weeks (Just before Christmas 2014) for my dad who has tragically suffered a very serious injury to his spinal column, leaving him without the use of his arms and legs and currently on a ventilator to keep him alive.</p>
<p>My dad (Danny, a UK citizen for 40yrs and only 66yrs old) has recently been flown back to the UK after <b>being diagnosed with quadriplegia (no use of arms or legs)</b>.<br/>

He flew to his place of birth (Mauritius) to visit his very sick mother and to deal with some paperwork. His trip was to be short (only 8 days).<br/><br/>

After a sleep, on his first day there after a tiring 14 hour flight he woke and got up from bed and fainted.<br/>

When he fell <b>he fractured his spine and compressed his spinal column</b> from his neck down through the vertebrae that deals with his respiratory system.<br/><br/>2 hours before being discovered his condition worsened and deteriorated further during the additional 2 hours it took for the ambulance to arrive.<br/>

After being <b>neglected in a state hospital for 5 days unwashed and uncared for</b> his brother had him transferred to a private clinic while he still had a small amount of dignity left.<br/><br/>

An operation was performed (at the private clinic) however, <b>this operation should have taken place within 6 hours of the accident and by now was 6 days overdue</b><i>.</i><br/>

At this point his respiratory system started to fail and he was put on a ventilator to breathe for him.</p>
<p>By now <b>the operation (£20,000) was more about saving his life than it was to treat his quadriplegia</b> and while saving his life was a success, the chances of recovering from this condition have become very slim. </p>
<p>We (my brother and I) initially paid daily for the hospital (approx £1,000 a day), staff and all medical equipment which amounted to around £65,000. <br/><b>

Much of dad's life savings will have paid for the bulk of the costs because, unfortunately he had not taken out travel insurance.</b> As you can see the costs incurred are huge.<br/>

My dad does not have a living will <b>(nobody expects the worse I guess)</b> so the stress involved trying to access his life savings and pension was beyond anything I could have ever expected. This tragedy became all about paying the bills and having no time to care for and be there to support my dad in his time of need.

</p>
<p>We tried so hard to get him transported to the UK as quickly as possible and into our free health care system but, <b>we came up against obstacles at every turn</b>.<br/>
</p>
<p>At first he wasn't stable enough for flight because of the amount of oxygen needed to keep him alive and the use of dopamine aboard a flight is prohibited.<br/>
When stable an air ambulance was possible but would have cost in excess of £75,000 something that was beyond our budget even with access to my dads life savings.</p><p><b>There was a commercial flight option which is what we finally managed to achieve</b> (costing £25,000), <b>after overcoming many obstacles and jumping through hoops.</b><br/>
First of all the only airline to fly nonstop and has the capability of transporting a stretcher case is Air Mauritius however, their list of approved medical equipment was a decade out of date and they would not approve the UK medical team's equipment on board.
</p>
<p><b>A doctor from the private clinic went beyond the call of duty and arranged meetings with Air Mauritius and the flight regulatory commission and got them to accept and approve the updated list of equipment and not just a temporary measure for my dad, but for all future cases!</b> <br/>Now all of this took many weeks, we were taking time off from work and my brother had to leave his 18 month old son at home while we traveled across the world to help arrange things in a developing Third World country where things are very slow moving.</p>
<p>My dad is now back in the UK, it has been a week now (1st Feb 2015) and is receiving NHS care. We have all but depleted my dads accounts and are looking into selling his house to help cover costs.</p><p>We are not sure what future care will look like and I am hoping that some of you reading this might be able to <b>help us with information regarding ongoing treatment and rehabilitation and possibly the funding of such services.</b>  I am assuming that we will eventually need equipment to transport him and a place for him to live that has been adapted for his condition.</p>
<p>For those of you not able to contribute financially, <b>maybe you know people that can help?

This project is for those who have gone through something similar, know well how it feels losing critical minutes, and for those who think ahead and want to be in a better position if something fatal happens to them or around them. Imagine, that the rescue comes from a scheduled drug: dimethyltryptamine (DMT)! <br/><br/>
We are a group of basic and clinical researchers who follow the line of investigation started by Stephen Szara's groundbreaking clinical studies with DMT. We are among the first ones who broke away of the mainstream scientific view of DMT as a psychopathological agent and proposed a somatophysiological role for this endogenous tryptamine, which is naturally occurring in the body. Our main tenet is that DMT is involved in the healing and regeneration of cells, it helps the body to survive extreme stress like clinical death. Our group has already provided experimental support of this concept in the field of immunology. 
<br/><br/>
The core of present proposal is that one of the physiological roles of endogenous DMT is protection against oxidative stress (e.g., hypoxia, lack of oxygen). Clinical death represents the most severe hypoxic condition and quickly progresses into terminal death. The reversible period of clinical death is limited by the brain's tolerance of oxidative stress what DMT may improve. If our hypothesis is right, than DMT has the potential to extend the survival of brain in clinical death. The ultimate goal (our dream) is to have DMT ampoules for intravenous use on the crash carts of emergency vehicles, intensive care units and operating rooms. The first experimental step towards this goal involves neuronal tissue cultures exposed to hypoxic (low oxygen) condition. We need your support to expand our work into hypoxia studies, which are in the stage of in vitro (""test tube"") phase. 
<br/><br/>
It is important to note that we are seeking funding for basic research. We will not be proceeding to human studies until we have got supporting basic data and obtained the requisite permits. <b>Nevertheless, even the first positive results will help rescheduling DMT by falsifying the ""no medical use"" classification!</b><br/>

<i>When, in 1961, I was working in Julius Axelrod’s lab, one day, I remember Julie showing me the results of his latest experiment on rabbit lung tissues. He found an enzyme capable of synthesizing DMT from its natural precursors. Ever since we kept wondering what could DMT be doing in the lungs, besides being sent to the brain to produce spectacular hallucinations?  Some 50 years later DMT was found to bind to sigma-1 receptors which are present in many cells of the body (including the lungs). These receptors are involved in a number of bio-regulatory functions in cells. Dr. Frecska and his colleagues were among the firsts to recognize that DMT, possibly mediated through sigma-1 receptors may be involved in the healing and regeneration processes after severe stress. His group deserves a chance to follow up, with the help of our support, their research using traditional scientific methods.

Why does the human body and brain make DMT? No one really knows, but it must have a function or more likely multiple functions. Dr. Frecska and his colleagues are on the absolute cutting edge of efforts to understand those functions in depth. Their study will focus on DMT's possible role as an antihypoxic agent in clinical death. The implications of this research, if their hypotheses holds up, are enormous. I strongly urge you to contribute generously to their Indiegogo campaign. This is about an attempt to answer some of the most fundamental questions of the human brain, mind, and spirit. Watch the video and scroll down for a pretty good picture of their research and the questions they are exploring. And then give what you can.

This is possibly the most important DMT research to happen since Rick Strassman forced open the gates 20 years ago!

This project is for those who have gone through something similar, know well how it feels losing critical minutes, and for those who think ahead and want to be in a better position if something fatal happens to them or around them. Imagine, that the rescue comes from a scheduled drug: dimethyltryptamine (DMT)! 
We are a group of basic and clinical researchers who follow the line of investigation started by Stephen Szara's groundbreaking clinical studies with DMT. We are among the first ones who broke away of the mainstream scientific view of DMT as a psychopathological agent and proposed a somatophysiological role for this endogenous tryptamine, which is naturally occurring in the body. Our main tenet is that DMT is involved in the healing and regeneration of cells, it helps the body to survive extreme stress like clinical death. Our group has already provided experimental support of this concept in the field of immunology. 

The core of present proposal is that one of the physiological roles of endogenous DMT is protection against oxidative stress (e.g., hypoxia, lack of oxygen). Clinical death represents the most severe hypoxic condition and quickly progresses into terminal death. The reversible period of clinical death is limited by the brain's tolerance of oxidative stress what DMT may improve. If our hypothesis is right, than DMT has the potential to extend the survival of brain in clinical death. The ultimate goal (our dream) is to have DMT ampoules for intravenous use on the crash carts of emergency vehicles, intensive care units and operating rooms. The first experimental step towards this goal involves neuronal tissue cultures exposed to hypoxic (low oxygen) condition. We need your support to expand our work into hypoxia studies, which are in the stage of in vitro (""test tube"") phase. 

It is important to note that we are seeking funding for basic research. We will not be proceeding to human studies until we have got supporting basic data and obtained the requisite permits. Nevertheless, even the first positive results will help rescheduling DMT by falsifying the ""no medical use"" classification!

When, in 1961, I was working in Julius Axelrod’s lab, one day, I remember Julie showing me the results of his latest experiment on rabbit lung tissues. He found an enzyme capable of synthesizing DMT from its natural precursors. Ever since we kept wondering what could DMT be doing in the lungs, besides being sent to the brain to produce spectacular hallucinations?  Some 50 years later DMT was found to bind to sigma-1 receptors which are present in many cells of the body (including the lungs). These receptors are involved in a number of bio-regulatory functions in cells. Dr. Frecska and his colleagues were among the firsts to recognize that DMT, possibly mediated through sigma-1 receptors may be involved in the healing and regeneration processes after severe stress. His group deserves a chance to follow up, with the help of our support, their research using traditional scientific methods.

Why does the human body and brain make DMT? No one really knows, but it must have a function or more likely multiple functions. Dr. Frecska and his colleagues are on the absolute cutting edge of efforts to understand those functions in depth. Their study will focus on DMT's possible role as an antihypoxic agent in clinical death. The implications of this research, if their hypotheses holds up, are enormous. I strongly urge you to contribute generously to their Indiegogo campaign. This is about an attempt to answer some of the most fundamental questions of the human brain, mind, and spirit. Watch the video and scroll down for a pretty good picture of their research and the questions they are exploring. And then give what you can.

This is possibly the most important DMT research to happen since Rick Strassman forced open the gates 20 years ago!

In August of 2011, we opened Downie Street Bakehouse in an
abandoned hotel in Stratford, Ontario. 
At the time, we were thrilled with all the light-filled space we
had. We set to work, just the two of us, baking our hand-shaped, artisanal and
specialty breads and bringing them to our customers. Because of our location
outside the downtown core, we knew we’d have to go where the people are. We now
sell at three Farmer’s Markets year-round with a fourth one in the summer. Life
is intense and exciting.And our business has grown. Last April we hired our first full-time
employee. Then we bought a baguette roller. Alan keeps buying rolling racks for
the dough to rest on as it’s rising (we call it ‘going to the spa’). 
It began to dawn on us that we need more space! Which, thank you
to all our wonderful customers, is a great problem to have.
We are still the only tenants in our abandoned hotel, so we have
room to expand. We took possession of what will be our new retail space March 1
and we will take possession of the new bake space on April 1. We’re planning to
be here for a good long time, having just signed a five-year lease with a
five-year option to renew.We’re inviting you along for the adventure of fixing up these spaces,
and buying an extra set of ovens (with a loader to save Alan’s shoulders) and
another walk-in fridge (more room for the loaves to have their spa time). This
expansion will allow us to hire a part-time shop assistant, with an eye to more
staff as we continue to grow.
We’re hoping to raise $20,000 + over the next 35 days. 

But we are moving ahead no matter what and will honour every contribution we
receive.
We’re asking for your help because we have learned that a bakery
is more than a business. It’s a community. Our customers become our friends.
This is a huge adventure for us and we want to give you the chance to be a part
of it. Please check out our perks. We had a lot of fun coming up with
that list! Know that we are grateful for every single contribution we receive. 
Special Perk
for the First Twenty-Five to Contribute
The first twenty-five people to make a contribution will be
invited to an exclusive private party in our new retail space, catered by the
fabulous Wicked Pickle food truck.
Perks for
Referrals
Whether you are able to contribute at this time or not (and
believe us, we’ve been there!) we want you to know that we appreciate every bit
of help you can give us. Referrals will earn perks, too. You will need an
Indiegogo account. Then click on the share buttons in the left-hand column of
this page. That way, we’ll be able to track your referrals and give you credit
for every contribution your friends make. Thank you so much!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is JoAnne Chitwood and I am a registered nurse, a certified trauma professional, a certified hospice and palliative care nurse (CHPN), a writer and filmmaker and a trained trauma group leader. Many people find that a current grief experience triggers deeper underlying wounds from much earlier in life. Our center will provide hurting people with opportunities to heal these wounds in a safe and nurturing environment.</span><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p>I’ve been conducting intensive grief and trauma retreats for years, always using temporarily rented facilities to do so. It is a challenge to create the necessary environment for healing when in someone else’s facility. It’s been my dream for years to have a healing center in which we can do this. Now is the time! Through a series of Providential events, I was led to a gorgeous property outside of Nashville, TN that is perfect for our center. It has a beautiful log lodge and a guest house plus trails for hiking, a lovely pond and a shop for the art projects our attendees do. </p>
<p> And you can help make this possible! Your donation to the center will make an immeasurable difference in the lives of many who have been traumatized by life experiences and need to process those hurts in a safe environment. </p>
<p><b>Carrie's Story</b></p>
<p>Carrie came to our Journey of the Heart retreat from Canada. (She gave me permission to tell her story.) She heard we were offering opportunities to work through trauma and her pinched and drawn face told the story of a lot of inner pain. We found out that she had lost her dad in a plane crash when she was only 10 and she had never really come to terms with his death, as his body was never found. </p>
<p>Then, the year before I met her, she went up for a plane ride with several family members, including her mother’s new husband. Her cousin was the pilot and she rode in the back seat with her aunt. As her cousin went through the sequence of piloting tasks to take off, Carrie fiddled with her headphones, which didn’t seem to be working. She told her cousin she was having trouble with them and he tried to help her, and, in the process, forgot to set the flaps on the plane correctly. </p>
<p>The plane lifted off, then crashed back down to a log-strewn field only seconds later. Huge downed trees ripped through the cockpit, killing all three of Carrie’s family members in the plane and crushing her right leg so badly it had to be amputated. </p>
<p>When she regained consciousness, Carrie was horrified to learn about her loved ones’ deaths and even more horrified to discover her missing leg.

<h3>What We Need and What You Get</h3>
<p>Our need is for the down payment on our retreat center and enough funding to operate for a year while we spread the word about our programs and network in the community and nationally. We need a $300,000 down payment and another $125,000 for a year’s worth of payments on the center. In addition to that, we need $25,000 for getting the word out about our program until word of mouth becomes our most effective advertising tool. Staff salaries will come from the workshop income. </p>
<p>We will have accommodations for participants to attend from all over the world and expect our reputation to spread by word of mouth as stories like Carrie’s become known. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>It's not often that we have the opportunity to contribute something as meaningful to our world today as reducing the level of fear energy being produced on our planet. Each of us that faces and works through the negative energy that is produced by unresolved trauma, contributes to our own health, the health of our family, our society, our nation and our world. Like a pebble tossed in a lake, the ripples of impact go out in an never ending arc. You have a chance to be part of that!</p>

My name is JoAnne Chitwood and I am a registered nurse, a certified trauma professional, a certified hospice and palliative care nurse (CHPN), a writer and filmmaker and a trained trauma group leader. Many people find that a current grief experience triggers deeper underlying wounds from much earlier in life. Our center will provide hurting people with opportunities to heal these wounds in a safe and nurturing environment.


I’ve been conducting intensive grief and trauma retreats for years, always using temporarily rented facilities to do so. It is a challenge to create the necessary environment for healing when in someone else’s facility. It’s been my dream for years to have a healing center in which we can do this. Now is the time! Through a series of Providential events, I was led to a gorgeous property outside of Nashville, TN that is perfect for our center. It has a beautiful log lodge and a guest house plus trails for hiking, a lovely pond and a shop for the art projects our attendees do. 
 And you can help make this possible! Your donation to the center will make an immeasurable difference in the lives of many who have been traumatized by life experiences and need to process those hurts in a safe environment. 
Carrie's Story
Carrie came to our Journey of the Heart retreat from Canada. (She gave me permission to tell her story.) She heard we were offering opportunities to work through trauma and her pinched and drawn face told the story of a lot of inner pain. We found out that she had lost her dad in a plane crash when she was only 10 and she had never really come to terms with his death, as his body was never found. 
Then, the year before I met her, she went up for a plane ride with several family members, including her mother’s new husband. Her cousin was the pilot and she rode in the back seat with her aunt. As her cousin went through the sequence of piloting tasks to take off, Carrie fiddled with her headphones, which didn’t seem to be working. She told her cousin she was having trouble with them and he tried to help her, and, in the process, forgot to set the flaps on the plane correctly. 
The plane lifted off, then crashed back down to a log-strewn field only seconds later. Huge downed trees ripped through the cockpit, killing all three of Carrie’s family members in the plane and crushing her right leg so badly it had to be amputated. 
When she regained consciousness, Carrie was horrified to learn about her loved ones’ deaths and even more horrified to discover her missing leg. Only in her mid-twenties, she felt her life was over. Her guilt consumed her and a deep depression set in. Nothing seemed to shake it. That is, until she came to our retreat.
In the retreat, we gave Carrie a chance to tell her story to a caring group. She wept as she told us about how guilty she felt about distracting the pilot and causing her mother to lose her spouse a second time. She felt angry that her leg had been taken while she was unconscious, without her permission. We reenacted the loss with a doll, dressed just as she had been on the day of the crash. Different members of the group became the nurse and the doctor, explaining to her that her leg was crushed and needed to be removed to save her life. She gave permission and the dolls leg was amputated and given to Carrie. 
We all trooped out to the garden where a little grave had been dug for the leg and we had a funeral service for it. We all wept with Carrie as she read a letter aloud that she had written to her lost leg, grieving over all the things she missed because of losing it. Then she placed the doll’s leg in the grave and we all solemnly placed handfuls of dirt over it, hugging her and expressing our sorrow over her loss. 
At the end of the two weeks, Carrie’s face had transformed from ravaged to filled with light and peace and joy. She had found a way to come to terms with tragedy and loss and forgive herself and God. She returned to Canada ready to fully engage in her life.
This is an example of the kinds of experiences that you, with your donation, will be making possible. This is not an isolated story, but a recurring theme of healing and hope.
