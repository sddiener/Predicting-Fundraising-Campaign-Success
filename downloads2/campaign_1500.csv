<h3>What I Need?</h3>

</div></div>","Who Am I?
Here's a ""formal"" introduction: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donny_Goines but honestly that doesn't define me. I'm just a simple man attempting to do #Positive things in this world. I'm an Artist, Entrepreneur, Musician, Author... But most importantly I'm a just a Human Being.
 


 
What I Need?
Here are the specifics:
%65 - %70 will be used for venue of the event. %15 - %20 will be used for frames, staging and decor.%20 - %10 will be used for shipping, misc. costs, etc. (**Unsure of these costs, but they will lower as I put the event together**)
 

 
When And Where It Be?
I would like to debut this first exhibit in New York City in September, but depending upon the success of this first event would like to create more in the future. 
 

 
Why Am I Doing This?
To me, photography is art. It's something I truly have a passion for and I want to really showcase some of the amazing people, places and things I've seen over the past year.

<p><strong>DESAFINADOS – To Be Out Of Tune</strong></p>
<p>To coincide with the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Los Crudos as a band, we are hosting a series of events that will focus on the creative aspects of punk that came out of our scene as well as the arts that moved and continue to move us. Our working schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>OPENING NIGHT (Day 1): We will open an exhibition that presents a timeline of punk on Chicago’s South Side and in the predominantly Latino neighborhoods of Pilsen and Little Village. The exhibit will highlight ephemera, art, photography, and audio/video that were created in the late eighties through the present and will be on display from Friday, Sep. 30<sup>th</sup> until Saturday, Oct. 8<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>ART FAIR (Day 2): This will be a day for artists active in the community to table and sell their work or simply show work to the public. This will be an amazing opportunity for local and emerging artists to make their work more visible and for the public to see work they might not otherwise have the opportunity to.</p>
<p>FILM/PANEL (Day 3): We will have a panel discussion with members of the local punk scene, including members of Los Crudos. There will be a video screening of outtakes from the documentary ""Mas Alla De Los Gritos - A Latino/Chicano Punk Documentary"" and hopefully other archival footage of bands that came out of the local scene.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>GALLERY HOURS (Day 4): The exhibit will be open for viewing during gallery hours.</p>
<p>GALLERY HOURS (Day 5): The exhibit will be open for viewing during gallery hours.</p>
<p>GALLERY HOURS (Day 6): The exhibit will be open for viewing during gallery hours.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>LITERARY NIGHT (Day 7): On this night we will focus on literature including both Alice Bag of Los Angeles’s seminal punk band The Bags and Michelle Gonzales (""Todd"") from Bay Area band Spitboy reading from their books. Sharing the night with the two authors will be local artist Isaac Gomez.</p>
<p>PUNK ARTIST PANEL (Day 8): We will have some local Chicago artists talking about their work within the punk scene and beyond. Participants will include Lupe Garza a.k.a. Gordo, Ricardo Compean, and more TBA.</p>
<p>QUEER ART PANEL/CLOSING PARTY (Day 9):  We have invited a number of out-of-town artists for this event to talk about their work, including David Zamora Casas (San Antonio), Cristy C. Road (New York), Dorian Wood (Los Angeles), and more TBA. Following the panel, there will be a party to formally end the exhibition.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The entire series of events will be free to the public so we are asking for support to make this event possible. We will need to cover travel and accommodations for all the artists who are coming from out of state. We would also like to provide stipends to all the artists and speakers. The gallery space has fees that we need to cover and we will be printing a special exhibition booklet that will be given free of charge to all attendees and will mirror the exhibition so that visitors can take this experience with them.</p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Hikâyem</span></h3>
<p>Merhaba, adım Banu.</p>
<p>İstanbulluyum ama son birkaç yıldır hep hayalini kurduğum bir Ege kasabasında, ailemle yaşıyorum. </p>
<p>Çocukluğumdan beri bir şeyler üretmeyi çok seviyorum. <b>Yıllar içinde çok ama çok sevdiğim birkaç şeyin hiç değişmediğini fark ettim: Çamur, kâğıt ve kumaş.</b></p>
<p><b>Bugüne kadar hep hayallerinin peşinden giden ve –ne mutlu bana ki– bunların çoğunu gerçekleştiren biri oldum.</b></p>
<p>Mimar Sinan Güzel Sanatlar Üniversitesi’nde dört güzel yıl geçirdim ve <b>sanat tarihi eğitimi</b> aldım. Bu eğitime İTÜ’de iki yıl daha devam ettim. Ardından çeşitli kültür sanat programlarında metin yazarlığı yaptım. Televizyonda en çok çocuk programları için metin ve senaryo yazarken mutlu oldum.</p>
<p><b>Çocuklar için bir şeyler yapmayı seviyorum.</b> 2010 yılından bu yana eşim ve yol arkadaşım Yıldıray ile birlikte çocuk kitaplarından söz ettiğimiz Bir Dolap Kitap adlı blogda yazıyoruz. Açık Radyo’da aynı ismi taşıyan bir program hazırlıyoruz. Çocuklar için genel kültür dergisi Dünyalı’yı hazırladık. Şu an birlikte yine çocuklar için birkaç farklı proje üzerinde çalışıyoruz. Çocuklar için yazdığım yayımlanmış iki, yayımlanacak dört ve yazım sürecinde olan iki kitabım var. </p>
<p>Bunca işin arasında dinlenmek için sürekli origami yapıyor ya da minyatür kitaplar hazırlıyorum. Şimdi bunlar bir kenarda dursun. Gelelim asıl konumuz olan çamura!</p>
<p>Seramik çamuruna ilk kez 2005 yılında özel bir sanat atölyesinde bulandım. O andan itibaren elim hep çamura bulanmış halde kalsın istedim. KAHEM'de (Kadıköy Halk Eğitimi Merkezi) yaklaşık beş sene seramik eğitimi aldım. <b>Toplam 2438 saat!</b> Bu uzun ve bol tozlu saatlerin sonucunda birbirinden değerli bilgiler edinip, çeşitli sertifikalar aldım. (Temel seramik, sırlamacı-alçı model kalıpçı, dökümcü-alçı model kalıpçı, seramik biçimlendirici, sanatsal mozaik, şabloncu-tornada şekillendirici.)</p>
<p>Hayatıma çok güzel iki oğlan çocuğu girdiği için seramik yapmaya bir süre ara verdim. Ama artık onlarla birlikte çamur yoğurmak istiyorum!</p>
<p><b>Artık kendi atölyemi açmak ve becerimi başkalarıyla paylaşmak istiyorum.</b></p>
<p>Ne yazık ki tam bu hazırlıklara başlarken annemin geçirdiği çok ciddi sağlık sorunlarıyla hayatımız sarsıldı. Maddi ve manevi olarak çok zorlu bir süreçten geçiyoruz. <strong>Annemin bakım masraflarını karşılayabilmem için atölye kurmak artık daha da önemli bir amaç oldu benim için.</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<h3><i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">My Story</span></i></h3>
<p><i>Hi, I’m Banu.</i></p>
<p><i>I’m originally from Istanbul. A few years ago I moved to a cute Aegean town I’ve always dreamed of. Since then, I’ve been living there (here!) with my husband, two young sons, and my mother. </i></p>
<p><i>Since I was a little girl, I’ve loved making things. <b>Along the years, I’ve realized that three materials have always been my favorites: Clay, paper, and fabric</b>.</i></p>
<p><i>I’m someone who has pursued her dreams no matter what (lucky me!) and I’ve even turned some of those dreams into reality.</i></p>
<p><i>I studied <b>Art History</b> at the Mimar Sinan Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul. Then, I continued my education at the Istanbul Technical University for two more years. After that, I worked as a writer, creating content for various TV shows on arts and culture. My happiest days as a TV writer were those I spent writing content and scripts for children’s programs.</i></p>
<p><i><b>I love creating things for kids.</b> Since 2010, I’ve been running -- together with my husband and best friend Yıldıray -- a blog called Bir Dolap Kitap (A Closet of Books) where we review children’s books. We’ve been broadcasting a weekly radio show on childen’s books over at Açık Radyo (Open Radio) in the last five years. We’ve also created a monthly children’s culture, arts and science magazine called Dünyalı (Earthling) and brought to life 27 issues. </i></p>
<p><i>In addition, I’m a children’s books author with two books published by prominent publishing houses in Turkey. Six new books I’m writing are contracted to be published in the next two years. </i></p>
<p><i>Sometimes, I get tired doing all that. When that happens, I sit down and either make origami or create miniature books to reenergize myself. But let’s leave those for another conversation because today, I’d love to tell you about clay!</i></p>
<p><i>The first time my hands got dirty with ceramic clay was in 2005 when I visited a private art studio. From that moment on, I desired my hands to <b>never</b> be without clay. I committed to a serious ceramic training for five long years at KAHEM (Kadıköy Community Education Center). I completed a total of <b>2438 hours! </b></i></p>
<p><i>Through this long and very dusty training I learned a lot and qualified for various certificates <span>(including “the fundamentals of training,” “glazer-plaster model moulder,” “caster-plaster model moulder,” “ceramic designer,” “artistic mosaic,” and “template maker &amp; turntable designer”).</span></i></p>
<p><i>I took a break from ceramic making after two beautiful little boys became a part of my life. But now, I want to create things with clay together with my boys!</i></p>
<p><b><i>I want to open my own ceramic studio and share my knowledge, skills and experience with other people. And I’m ready for it!</i></b></p>
<p>As I was getting prepared to start my business, our lives were shaken to the ground when my mother had a serious stroke. Since then, my family and I have been going through a very challenging time -- emotionally and financially. In order for me to meet the financial cost of providing my mother with the best medical and post-stroke care, <strong>opening my ceramic studio has become an even more important goal.</strong></p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">***</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Atölyemi farklı kılan ne? </span></h3>
<p><b>Cincüce Bobin Hizmetleri’nin temelini eğlence oluşturuyor. </b>Beni eğlendiren, keyiflendiren, mutlu eden işler yapıyorum. Üretimlerimi insanlara göstermek, onlarla paylaşmak, emeğimi kazanca çevirmek ve başkalarını da mutlu etmek istiyorum. Atölyemde üreteceğim işlerde ve vereceğim derslerde amacım bu: <b>Buraya gelen insanlar mutlu olacaklar! </b></p>
<p>Atölyenin merkezinde seramik olacak. Ama origami, kâğıt tasarımlar, minyatür kitaplar ve kumaş oyuncaklar yapmaya da devam edeceğim. Yeni şeyler denemeyi seviyorum. İnsanların bakınca gülümseyeceği nesneler üretmek istiyorum<b>. Elimde koskoca bir “yapılacak fikirler listesi” var! </b></p>
<p>Daha önce atölye ve dükkân işletmedim. Ancak <b>ne yapacağımı iyi biliyorum</b>. İyi bir iş planı hazırladım ve olası riskler için yeni çözümler bulabilirim. Ayrıca, işimi doğru şekilde başlatabilmek için, birkaç ay önce KOSGEB tarafından verilen 70 saatlik Uygulamalı Girişimcilik Eğitimi sertifika programını başarıyla tamamladım.</p>
<p><i style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">What Will Make My Studio Different?  </i></p>
<p><span><b><i>Fun and play are the two guiding principles of the Goblin Bobbin Services Ceramics and Handcrafts Studio.  </i></b></span></p>
<p><i>I create whimsy objects that amuse me and make me happy. I want to share what I create with other people and make them happy as well. In the meantime, I want to make a living creating, sharing and selling my work. My number-one motto when it comes to what I’ll create in my studio and the workshops I’ll give is this: <b>People who come to my studio will be happy!</b></i></p>
<p><i>Ceramics will take place at the heart of the studio. But I’ll also continue creating origami, other paper designs, miniature books, and fabric toys. I love experimenting with new concepts and materials. And I want to create objects that will put a huge smile on people’s faces.  <b>In fact, I have a huuuuge “things to create” list waiting to be ticked off!</b></i></p>
<p><i>I haven’t operated a ceramics studio before. However, I know very well what I want to do and how to do it. I’ve devised a very sound business plan, and I’m equipped to find new solutions for any risks.  </i>In addition, I’ve successfully completed a comprehensive 70-hour business training certificate program offered by KOSGEB (the Institute for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses) to make sure I start my business the right way.</p>

<h3>Neye İhtiyacım Var? </h3>
<p><span>Atölyemin en büyük ihtiyacı seramik üretimi için gerekli donanım (Seramik fırını, torna, kompresör, depolama sistemi, hammaddeler vs.). </span></p>
<ul style=""font-weight: normal;"">
<li><p>Seramik fırını</p></li>
<li><p>Fırın ayağı</p></li>
<li><p>Refraktör set (Fırın rafları, fırın ayakları vs.)</p></li>
<li><p>Torna</p></li>
<li><p>Çalışma tezgâhı ve tabureler</p></li>
<li><p>Seramik objeler için raf sistem,</p></li>
<li><p>Şekillendirme araçları</p></li>
<li><p>Kompresör ve boya tabancası</p></li>
<li><p>Sarf malzemesi (Çamur, sırt altı boya, sır, oksit vs.)</p></li>
<li><p>Hammaddeler için depolama sistemi</p></li>
<li><p>Atölye masrafları (Kira, tadilat, tesisat vs.)</p></li>
</ul> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Bir de mekân giderleri var. </span>Atölyenin uzun ömürlü olması için dükkân kirasını kafamdan çıkarabilmem lazım. <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Toplanan parayı  mekân kirası ve işi başlatmak için gerekli temel ekipmanı almak için kullanacağım. Bu paranın bir bölümünü ise beni destekleyen kişiler için yapacağım armağan ürünler için kullanacağım.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Atölyenin çekirdek ihtiyaçlarını tamamlayabileceğim sermayeyi toparlayabilirsem, kuracağım bu işletme için hibe ve kredi fonlarına başvuruda bulunabileceğim. </span>İşte bu noktada devreye siz giriyorsunuz.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">***</span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>What I Need? </i></h3>
<p><i><span>My biggest need for opening a studio is the technical equipment and materials for producing ceramics. Here is a list that includes some of the items I primarily need:</span></i></p>
<ul style=""font-weight: normal;"">
<li><p><i>Ceramic kiln  </i></p></li>
<li><p><i>Ceramic kiln base </i></p></li>
<li><p><i>Refractory kiln furnitures (kiln shelves and shelf supports)</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>Whirler</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>Working table and stools</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>Shelf system for ceramic objects </i></p></li>
<li><p><i>Modelling tools </i></p></li>
<li><p><i>Compressor and spray gun</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>Raw materials (Clays, slips, glazes, underglazes, oxides etc.) </i></p></li>
<li><p><i>Storage systems for raw materials</i></p></li>
<li><p><i>Studio expenses (rental, alteration, facility costs etc.) </i></p></li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>Then, there are the expenses of running a studio. I shouldn’t worry about rent in the first months to be able to set a production system that will enable the studio to survive and thrive. I will use the money I raise to rent a suitable place for the studio and to purchase the crucial equipment and material to start the business. I’ll use the rest of the money to create the items I’ll be giving to my backers who support me.</i></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>If I can gather the capital that will help me pay for the essentials for establishing a ceramic studio, I’ll be able to apply for professional grants and credit funds. </i></p>
<p><i>And this is where your support plays an important role!</i></p>

<h3>Hedef </h3>
<p><span>Her şey yolunda giderse 2017 yılında “Cincüce Bobin Hizmetleri” seramik, kâğıt ve el işleri atölyesini açmak istiyorum.

<p>Bu mekânı açarsam ne mi olacak? Güzel işler yapacağım ve sizinle paylaşacağım.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>The Ultimate Goal </i></h3>
<p><span><i>If everything goes as planned, I want to open the Goblin Bobbin Services Ceramics, Paper  and Handcrafts Studio in 2017. If you happen to visit Urla, Izmir next year, I’d love you to come and see the studio you’ll have helped to create. First, I’ll make some tea for you. While the tea is brewing, we can even create things with clay. Woudn’t that be amazing?</i></span></p>
<p><i>Are you wondering what will happen if I succeed at opening my ceramics studio? I’ll create great work and share them with you!</i></p>

<h3>Destekçilerime Armağanlarım </h3>
<p><span>Hayalim için bana destek olanları tek tek bir kenara not edeceğim. Atölyeyi kurup fırınımı alınca da onlar için birbirinden güzel objeler yapıp, fırında taze taze pişirip göndereceğim. 2017’nin ilk aylarını bu işe ayırdım.  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><i>Gift for My Backers </i></h3>
<p><i>I’m going to keep a list including each and every person who support my campaign to turn my dream into reality. When I open my studio and purchase my kiln, the first thing I’ll do is create beautiful objects out of clay. Then, I’ll bake and send them to my beloved backers on 2017.</i></p>

Hikâyem
Merhaba, adım Banu.
İstanbulluyum ama son birkaç yıldır hep hayalini kurduğum bir Ege kasabasında, ailemle yaşıyorum. 
Çocukluğumdan beri bir şeyler üretmeyi çok seviyorum. Yıllar içinde çok ama çok sevdiğim birkaç şeyin hiç değişmediğini fark ettim: Çamur, kâğıt ve kumaş.
Bugüne kadar hep hayallerinin peşinden giden ve –ne mutlu bana ki– bunların çoğunu gerçekleştiren biri oldum.
Mimar Sinan Güzel Sanatlar Üniversitesi’nde dört güzel yıl geçirdim ve sanat tarihi eğitimi aldım. Bu eğitime İTÜ’de iki yıl daha devam ettim. Ardından çeşitli kültür sanat programlarında metin yazarlığı yaptım. Televizyonda en çok çocuk programları için metin ve senaryo yazarken mutlu oldum.
Çocuklar için bir şeyler yapmayı seviyorum. 2010 yılından bu yana eşim ve yol arkadaşım Yıldıray ile birlikte çocuk kitaplarından söz ettiğimiz Bir Dolap Kitap adlı blogda yazıyoruz. Açık Radyo’da aynı ismi taşıyan bir program hazırlıyoruz. Çocuklar için genel kültür dergisi Dünyalı’yı hazırladık. Şu an birlikte yine çocuklar için birkaç farklı proje üzerinde çalışıyoruz. Çocuklar için yazdığım yayımlanmış iki, yayımlanacak dört ve yazım sürecinde olan iki kitabım var. 
Bunca işin arasında dinlenmek için sürekli origami yapıyor ya da minyatür kitaplar hazırlıyorum. Şimdi bunlar bir kenarda dursun. Gelelim asıl konumuz olan çamura!
Seramik çamuruna ilk kez 2005 yılında özel bir sanat atölyesinde bulandım. O andan itibaren elim hep çamura bulanmış halde kalsın istedim. KAHEM'de (Kadıköy Halk Eğitimi Merkezi) yaklaşık beş sene seramik eğitimi aldım. Toplam 2438 saat! Bu uzun ve bol tozlu saatlerin sonucunda birbirinden değerli bilgiler edinip, çeşitli sertifikalar aldım. (Temel seramik, sırlamacı-alçı model kalıpçı, dökümcü-alçı model kalıpçı, seramik biçimlendirici, sanatsal mozaik, şabloncu-tornada şekillendirici.)
Hayatıma çok güzel iki oğlan çocuğu girdiği için seramik yapmaya bir süre ara verdim. Ama artık onlarla birlikte çamur yoğurmak istiyorum!
Artık kendi atölyemi açmak ve becerimi başkalarıyla paylaşmak istiyorum.
Ne yazık ki tam bu hazırlıklara başlarken annemin geçirdiği çok ciddi sağlık sorunlarıyla hayatımız sarsıldı. Maddi ve manevi olarak çok zorlu bir süreçten geçiyoruz. Annemin bakım masraflarını karşılayabilmem için atölye kurmak artık daha da önemli bir amaç oldu benim için.
 

My Story
Hi, I’m Banu.
I’m originally from Istanbul. A few years ago I moved to a cute Aegean town I’ve always dreamed of. Since then, I’ve been living there (here!) with my husband, two young sons, and my mother. 
Since I was a little girl, I’ve loved making things. Along the years, I’ve realized that three materials have always been my favorites: Clay, paper, and fabric.
I’m someone who has pursued her dreams no matter what (lucky me!) and I’ve even turned some of those dreams into reality.
I studied Art History at the Mimar Sinan Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul. Then, I continued my education at the Istanbul Technical University for two more years. After that, I worked as a writer, creating content for various TV shows on arts and culture. My happiest days as a TV writer were those I spent writing content and scripts for children’s programs.
I love creating things for kids. Since 2010, I’ve been running -- together with my husband and best friend Yıldıray -- a blog called Bir Dolap Kitap (A Closet of Books) where we review children’s books. We’ve been broadcasting a weekly radio show on childen’s books over at Açık Radyo (Open Radio) in the last five years. We’ve also created a monthly children’s culture, arts and science magazine called Dünyalı (Earthling) and brought to life 27 issues. 
In addition, I’m a children’s books author with two books published by prominent publishing houses in Turkey. Six new books I’m writing are contracted to be published in the next two years. 
Sometimes, I get tired doing all that. When that happens, I sit down and either make origami or create miniature books to reenergize myself. But let’s leave those for another conversation because today, I’d love to tell you about clay!
The first time my hands got dirty with ceramic clay was in 2005 when I visited a private art studio. From that moment on, I desired my hands to never be without clay. I committed to a serious ceramic training for five long years at KAHEM (Kadıköy Community Education Center). I completed a total of 2438 hours! 
Through this long and very dusty training I learned a lot and qualified for various certificates (including “the fundamentals of training,” “glazer-plaster model moulder,” “caster-plaster model moulder,” “ceramic designer,” “artistic mosaic,” and “template maker & turntable designer”).
I took a break from ceramic making after two beautiful little boys became a part of my life. But now, I want to create things with clay together with my boys!
I want to open my own ceramic studio and share my knowledge, skills and experience with other people. And I’m ready for it!
As I was getting prepared to start my business, our lives were shaken to the ground when my mother had a serious stroke. Since then, my family and I have been going through a very challenging time -- emotionally and financially. In order for me to meet the financial cost of providing my mother with the best medical and post-stroke care, opening my ceramic studio has become an even more important goal.

Atölyemi farklı kılan ne? 
Cincüce Bobin Hizmetleri’nin temelini eğlence oluşturuyor. Beni eğlendiren, keyiflendiren, mutlu eden işler yapıyorum. Üretimlerimi insanlara göstermek, onlarla paylaşmak, emeğimi kazanca çevirmek ve başkalarını da mutlu etmek istiyorum. Atölyemde üreteceğim işlerde ve vereceğim derslerde amacım bu: Buraya gelen insanlar mutlu olacaklar! 
Atölyenin merkezinde seramik olacak. Ama origami, kâğıt tasarımlar, minyatür kitaplar ve kumaş oyuncaklar yapmaya da devam edeceğim. Yeni şeyler denemeyi seviyorum. İnsanların bakınca gülümseyeceği nesneler üretmek istiyorum. Elimde koskoca bir “yapılacak fikirler listesi” var! 
Daha önce atölye ve dükkân işletmedim. Ancak ne yapacağımı iyi biliyorum. İyi bir iş planı hazırladım ve olası riskler için yeni çözümler bulabilirim. Ayrıca, işimi doğru şekilde başlatabilmek için, birkaç ay önce KOSGEB tarafından verilen 70 saatlik Uygulamalı Girişimcilik Eğitimi sertifika programını başarıyla tamamladım.
What Will Make My Studio Different?  
Fun and play are the two guiding principles of the Goblin Bobbin Services Ceramics and Handcrafts Studio.  
I create whimsy objects that amuse me and make me happy. I want to share what I create with other people and make them happy as well. In the meantime, I want to make a living creating, sharing and selling my work. My number-one motto when it comes to what I’ll create in my studio and the workshops I’ll give is this: People who come to my studio will be happy!
Ceramics will take place at the heart of the studio. But I’ll also continue creating origami, other paper designs, miniature books, and fabric toys. I love experimenting with new concepts and materials. And I want to create objects that will put a huge smile on people’s faces.  In fact, I have a huuuuge “things to create” list waiting to be ticked off!
I haven’t operated a ceramics studio before. However, I know very well what I want to do and how to do it. I’ve devised a very sound business plan, and I’m equipped to find new solutions for any risks.  In addition, I’ve successfully completed a comprehensive 70-hour business training certificate program offered by KOSGEB (the Institute for the Development of Small and Medium-Sized Businesses) to make sure I start my business the right way.
***
Neye İhtiyacım Var? 
Atölyemin en büyük ihtiyacı seramik üretimi için gerekli donanım (Seramik fırını, torna, kompresör, depolama sistemi, hammaddeler vs.). 

Seramik fırını
Fırın ayağı
Refraktör set (Fırın rafları, fırın ayakları vs.)
Torna
Çalışma tezgâhı ve tabureler
Seramik objeler için raf sistem,
Şekillendirme araçları
Kompresör ve boya tabancası
Sarf malzemesi (Çamur, sırt altı boya, sır, oksit vs.)
Hammaddeler için depolama sistemi
Atölye masrafları (Kira, tadilat, tesisat vs.)
 Bir de mekân giderleri var. Atölyenin uzun ömürlü olması için dükkân kirasını kafamdan çıkarabilmem lazım. Toplanan parayı  mekân kirası ve işi başlatmak için gerekli temel ekipmanı almak için kullanacağım. Bu paranın bir bölümünü ise beni destekleyen kişiler için yapacağım armağan ürünler için kullanacağım.
Atölyenin çekirdek ihtiyaçlarını tamamlayabileceğim sermayeyi toparlayabilirsem, kuracağım bu işletme için hibe ve kredi fonlarına başvuruda bulunabileceğim. İşte bu noktada devreye siz giriyorsunuz.
***
 
What I Need? 
My biggest need for opening a studio is the technical equipment and materials for producing ceramics. Here is a list that includes some of the items I primarily need:

Ceramic kiln  
Ceramic kiln base 
Refractory kiln furnitures (kiln shelves and shelf supports)
Whirler
Working table and stools
Shelf system for ceramic objects 
Modelling tools 
Compressor and spray gun
Raw materials (Clays, slips, glazes, underglazes, oxides etc.) 
Storage systems for raw materials
Studio expenses (rental, alteration, facility costs etc.) 

Then, there are the expenses of running a studio. I shouldn’t worry about rent in the first months to be able to set a production system that will enable the studio to survive and thrive. I will use the money I raise to rent a suitable place for the studio and to purchase the crucial equipment and material to start the business. I’ll use the rest of the money to create the items I’ll be giving to my backers who support me.
If I can gather the capital that will help me pay for the essentials for establishing a ceramic studio, I’ll be able to apply for professional grants and credit funds. 
And this is where your support plays an important role!

Hedef 
Her şey yolunda giderse 2017 yılında “Cincüce Bobin Hizmetleri” seramik, kâğıt ve el işleri atölyesini açmak istiyorum. Gelecek yıl yolunuzu İzmir-Urla’ya düşürürseniz, katkıda bulunduğunuz mekânı görmenizi çok isterim. Size çay demlerim. Bir yandan da çamurdan bir şeyler yaparız. Çok güzel olmaz mı? 
Bu mekânı açarsam ne mi olacak? Güzel işler yapacağım ve sizinle paylaşacağım.
 
The Ultimate Goal 
If everything goes as planned, I want to open the Goblin Bobbin Services Ceramics, Paper  and Handcrafts Studio in 2017. If you happen to visit Urla, Izmir next year, I’d love you to come and see the studio you’ll have helped to create. First, I’ll make some tea for you. While the tea is brewing, we can even create things with clay. Woudn’t that be amazing?
Are you wondering what will happen if I succeed at opening my ceramics studio? I’ll create great work and share them with you!
***
Destekçilerime Armağanlarım 
Hayalim için bana destek olanları tek tek bir kenara not edeceğim. Atölyeyi kurup fırınımı alınca da onlar için birbirinden güzel objeler yapıp, fırında taze taze pişirip göndereceğim. 2017’nin ilk aylarını bu işe ayırdım.  
 
Gift for My Backers 
I’m going to keep a list including each and every person who support my campaign to turn my dream into reality. When I open my studio and purchase my kiln, the first thing I’ll do is create beautiful objects out of clay. Then, I’ll bake and send them to my beloved backers on 2017.

<p><strong>ABOUT ME:</strong></p>
<p>First, I seek to change my life.  Having been an artist and writer for 30+ years, I’ve never been able to be truly independent, creating works that are meaningful to me and give back to the world.  I don’t seek to make a fortune, just to survive - and thrive - as a creative force.   </p>
<p>From my original “Fish Eye” oil paintings, I will produce high quality art prints, each matted and signed.  On the back of each artwork I’ll place a short paragraph about the creature depicted, and the struggle it faces.</p>
<p>I will invite other artists to contribute to this project, adding their unique visions of ocean creatures to mine.  If I exceed my campaign goal - I would like to distribute other Fish Eye items such as mobiles, tiles, shirts, mugs, etc.  Marketing will be done online, and through good old-fashioned legwork like selling to shops and at art shows.   </p>
<p>You don’t have to be an environmentalist to appreciate Fish Eyes.  This is not a political issue, we can't expect government to do anything about this.  But we can support individual efforts, no matter how small.   Just ask yourself:  Do you want to live in a world where marine animals and coral reefs can only be observed in aquariums?  Where seafood is so polluted and scarce, it disappears from human diets?   Where sport fishing and diving are ruined for our children? </p>
<p>Education and a globally shared vision can help reverse the process.  Join me in creating my worthwhile and impactful “Fish Eyes” art project.  I’m sure if these amazing creatures could talk, they would join me in saying a big “thank you”.</p>
<p><strong>PROJECT NEEDS:</strong></p>
<p>Money raised will be used to acquire a high quality art printer, supply of art paper and canvas, ink, and mailing supplies.   I will produce a starter inventory of 100+ art prints of various sizes, along with mats and mailers.  I will create web pages and shops on sites such as Etsy, Artfire, Artnet, Shopify and more.  I will take prints and other Fish Eye items to art shows and shops to sell directly or on consignment.</p>
</div><div><ul></ul></div><div><p><strong>REWARDS:</strong></p></div><div>
<p>Believe me, I know every dollar counts – that’s surely the case with me, a struggling artist.   So I sincerely appreciate any amount you can contribute.   </p>
<p>As you’ll see in the perks column on the right, everyone who supports this project receives a unique gift.  A special prize will be rewarded for a single contributor of $1,000 - a framed original oil painting of an octopus eye.  During this campaign I will be showing the progress of this exciting artwork, which I think will be my best one yet!   I'm also  hoping that I can get a few people to go all-in and order a personal painting of any sea creature's eye - your choice.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t contribute financially, look me up on Facebook, and let’s share our love for the ocean and its creatures.  I know of many organizations who need volunteers, and just networking and communicating helps keeps this important conservation issue alive.</p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If I raise at least $500 - I will still send everyone at least one signed paper print, and will probably extend the campaign.   </li>
<li>If you want the original painting offered ($2000 level) – you may have to be a bit patient!  I hope many people will ask for this, but of course each one takes a couple of weeks to paint.</li>

Money raised will be used to acquire a high quality art printer, supply of art paper and canvas, ink, and mailing supplies.   I will produce a starter inventory of 100+ art prints of various sizes, along with mats and mailers.  I will create web pages and shops on sites such as Etsy, Artfire, Artnet, Shopify and more.  I will take prints and other Fish Eye items to art shows and shops to sell directly or on consignment.
REWARDS:
Believe me, I know every dollar counts – that’s surely the case with me, a struggling artist.   So I sincerely appreciate any amount you can contribute.   
As you’ll see in the perks column on the right, everyone who supports this project receives a unique gift.  A special prize will be rewarded for a single contributor of $1,000 - a framed original oil painting of an octopus eye.  During this campaign I will be showing the progress of this exciting artwork, which I think will be my best one yet!   I'm also  hoping that I can get a few people to go all-in and order a personal painting of any sea creature's eye - your choice.
Even if you can’t contribute financially, look me up on Facebook, and let’s share our love for the ocean and its creatures.  I know of many organizations who need volunteers, and just networking and communicating helps keeps this important conservation issue alive.
RISKS AND CHALLENGES:

If I raise at least $500 - I will still send everyone at least one signed paper print, and will probably extend the campaign.   
If you want the original painting offered ($2000 level) – you may have to be a bit patient!  I hope many people will ask for this, but of course each one takes a couple of weeks to paint.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
<p>I've never done anything like this before but it's become clear that I have nothing to lose by putting myself out there in order to seek the support that I need as I pursue my new educational and creative direction.</p>
<p>You might know me as the one of the owners of Wolf and Bear's food carts which Jeremy Garb and I began together in 2009. You might know me as a fellow student at Portland State University (School of Social Work, Painting classes, Conflict Resolution, &amp; Spanish), or you might not know me at all and have come across this campaign some other way :)</p>
<p><strong>The reasons that I am seeking support:</strong></p>
<p>-significant increases in the cost of living in Portland (generally)</p>
<p>-significant increase in personal expenditures due to big changes in life circumstances which include but are not limited to: a move, the cost of tuition and textbooks, airfare and accommodations abroad that I booked for this trip, and art supplies (canvas and other supports/panels, drawing materials, paint and other mediums)</p>
<p>-I am passionate about art and creative exchange. It is a crucial component of my personal ability to sustain and develop happiness, and to feed my excitement for life. I want to share this passion with you and I am committed to giving back by way of my participation in the community, as well as by way of my support of other artists and creative explorers.</p>
<p><strong>What you will get in return for contributions:</strong></p>
<p>The campaign perks will depend on the amount of your contribution to the campaign. The options include:</p>
<p>profound and genuine gratitude, a handprinted postcard sent to you from Berlin, an original print from hand carved woodblock or linocut, small or large sized paintings, or the option to request a small or medium sized custom painting inspired by the subject or theme of your choice.</p>

<p>Hi my name is Jess Hirsch. I am an artist and sculptor living in Minneapolis. After studying traditional Scandinavian woodcraft (Sloyd) for the past year, I am launching a workspace to teach women what I have learned, share space and tools, and employ women and non-binary craftspeople at a great wage.  Its called, ""Women's Woodshop.""</p>
<p>My campaign is two fold: </p>
<p><i>1)  Fundraise the remaining 25% of the Minnesota State Arts Board Folk and Traditional Art Grant which ends April 1. </i></p>
<p><i>2) Open Women’s Woodshop with great equipment for students and instructors.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your contributions will go directly towards the safety and livelihood of women. </p>
<p>I will use the funds to:</p>
<p>~<strong>Buy Saw Stop Table Saw</strong> Known as the hot dog saw, the blade drops once it senses condensation, saving fingers!  (This will also require installing 220 electrical outlets in the store)</p>
<p>~<strong>Buy Dust Collection System</strong> Since saw dust is listed as a carcinogenic.</p>
<p>~<strong>Help with Rent</strong> so I can pay instructors a great wage.</p>
<p>~<strong>The funds will contribute to my yearlong apprenticeship</strong> with Jim Sannerud, a master bowl turner. With the generous support of the Minnesota State Arts Board I was able to purchase equipment, take weekly lessons and rent a studio. The grant covered 75% of $25,000, now I am hoping to fund the remaining 25% here.  </p>
<p>When I first graduated from college, I had no equipment and my sculpture suffered. After 13 years of woodworking I have accrued many of the tools a shop needs and want to share equipment with others. </p>
<p>Sure, there are plenty of shared studio spaces where you can join with an affordable membership, but as a lady, these co-ed spaces can be intimidating. Unfortunately women are treated differently in the shop than dudes. Its no one’s fault, men are trying to be helpful, but I have had my fair share of mansplaining and even had tools taken from my hands. Thats why I wanted to start Women’s Woodshop. Its a place where women are supported and given space to learn in an encouraging environment. The goal is not separation, but rather to give women the foundation to enter this male-dominated field. Women's Woodshop also offer co-ed classes to practice a space where men and women can learn alongside each other.</p>
<p>Not to mention, the ladies want it! I have been teaching Ladies Only Spoon Carving for the past year and my classes always fill. Its proves there is a need. </p>
<p>All I need now is a little help fundraising to cover the grant that got me started and to buy some major safety equipment. Once these key pieces are in place, the shop will be buzzing with feminine energy and empowerment.</p>
<p>I have an MFA from the University of Minnesota in Sculpture, have been spoon carving for seven years, turning for two, and teaching after school programs for four years. I know I can teach, run a shop, and keep people stoked on woodworking. However, I am not going to do this alone. Women's Woodshop will be a place where women are in leadership roles and I have 4 amazing instructors already in the ropes to teach rad classes like: timber frame joinery, Japanese tea trays, and spindle turning. I am meeting with new instructors every week to brainstorm great introductory classes for women. With a fleet of skilled craftspeople, Women’s Woodshop is going to thrive. </p>
<p>If you can’t help financially, but have some tools to donate, I would be happy to take them. Get in touch. Also sharing the word always helps too. Thanks so much!</p>

<p>The above video was from our last show at SITE Gallery Houston in 2017. It gives you a good understanding of our organization and what we put into just one of our projects.</p>
<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>We are a team of THREE art professionals who have organized many art-related projects in the past. We are now organizing a festival of grand proportions for the ENTIRE CITY!</p>
<ul>
<li>Volker Eisele: the innovator and enthusiastic ring-leader.</li>
<li>Antarctica Black: the behind the scenes multi-tasking maestro.</li>
<li>Tommy Gregory: the idea-man and bustling curator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sculpture Month Houston is in its third year and we continue to survey the sculptural medium and bring it to the greater Houston area. In our first exhibition, ""From Space to Field,"" in 2016, we showcased the emergence of a gifted generation of sculptors. The diversity of artworks served as a fitting analogy for the diversity of the city of Houston. That inaugural festival included 43 venues around the city. In our interim 2017 exhibition, “Tensile Strength”, we held a stand-alone show at the Silos at Sawyer Yards. There, inside SITE Gallery Houston, we invited artists from across Texas and over its borders to enhance a multi-sensory experience for our audience. This new approach brought us new insight and direction for our 2018 festival, ""Peak Shift"".</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531426814/esixav1vyshx3172utd0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Each year we have sought to raise the bar, exhibiting ever-more complex, sophisticated and innovative art. In refining our format over the past two years of exhibitions at SITE, artists are now able to create ever-grander installations by working in one, two, or even three contiguous silos. This arrangement challenges artists to think on a larger scale and to further explore the possibilities of this singular architecture. This year we are excited to announce that internationally-lauded Jessica Stockholder will be a participant.  </p>
<p>Below is a video from one of artists from our first rendition of SMH at SITE Gallery Houston at the silos: Jo Ann Fleischhauer.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/210613118?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h3>
<p>Our artists need funding to bring the most innovative, enriching and thought-provoking pieces to life in a monumental space. An example of venues we are incorporating into our 2018 programming are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>SITE Gallery Houston, which is housed in the re-purposed physical structure of the old Success Rice Silos.</li>
<li>The defunct control tower designed by IM Pei at the Bush Intercontinental Airport.</li>
<li>The 1940 Air Terminal Museum along with their vintage airplane hangar at Hobby Airport.</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the perks listed on the side (which we will discuss in more detail in a minute), you will get a chance to experience cutting-edge installations in incredibly unique venues. You will give artists a chance to challenge themselves and invoke work they never deemed possible. You will get to be a part of something huge in Houston.</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531426636/bwklrhk2utr5rlapzns3.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>This Year's Events:</h3>
<ul>
<li>October 11, 2018 (11am-12:30pm) - The Commencement Celebration @ The Police Officers' Memorial at Buffalo Bayou (created by Jesus Moroles). The honor guard of the Police Department will meet and greet with the art community at the largest sculptural monument in Houston. </li>
<li>October 12, 2018 (6pm-9pm) - The VIP Preview @ SITE Gallery Houston (By invitation only, or gifted through a perk!).</li>
<li>October 13, 2018 (6pm-9pm) - The Public Kick-Off Reception @SITE Gallery Houston (FREE!)</li>
<li>There will be several performances by some of the installation artists on both of those nights.</li>
<li>Every Saturday at 2pm during the length of the festival, tours will be offered to the public for free at SITE Gallery given by the curators and exhibiting artists.</li>
<li>More events to follow - be sure to check our website (<a href=""http://sculpturemonthhouston.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sculpturemonthhouston.org</a>) during the festival: October 11 - December 1, 2018.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the SMH curated exhibitions, we are welcoming other art venues from throughout the city, including commercial galleries, nonprofit art spaces, the Houston Airport System, museums, and City Hall, to present sculpture exhibits specifically for the celebration of the sculptural medium under the umbrella of SMH. We hope to have a finalized list of venues for 2018 by the end of July.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Do What We Do:</h3>
<p>Installation art has become a popular and internationally recognized medium where contemporary issues are explored in an immersive way. Many artists have chosen the installation medium because of the inherent ability to go beyond conservative conventions and traditions.<br/> <br/>Sculpture Month Houston’s series of site-specific installations tie into this current body of ideas that is percolating throughout the art world in places like Documenta and the Venice Biennale. We provide artists with the access to weigh in on this with their creative responses in order to enrich and shape the visual dialogue. SMH is participating in this dialogue by providing artists with an opportunity to be challenged to create site-specific installations in unique architectural venues.</p>

The 1940 Air Terminal Museum along with their vintage airplane hangar at Hobby Airport.

Besides the perks listed on the side (which we will discuss in more detail in a minute), you will get a chance to experience cutting-edge installations in incredibly unique venues. You will give artists a chance to challenge themselves and invoke work they never deemed possible. You will get to be a part of something huge in Houston.

This Year's Events:

October 11, 2018 (11am-12:30pm) - The Commencement Celebration @ The Police Officers' Memorial at Buffalo Bayou (created by Jesus Moroles). The honor guard of the Police Department will meet and greet with the art community at the largest sculptural monument in Houston. 
October 12, 2018 (6pm-9pm) - The VIP Preview @ SITE Gallery Houston (By invitation only, or gifted through a perk!).
October 13, 2018 (6pm-9pm) - The Public Kick-Off Reception @SITE Gallery Houston (FREE!)
There will be several performances by some of the installation artists on both of those nights.
Every Saturday at 2pm during the length of the festival, tours will be offered to the public for free at SITE Gallery given by the curators and exhibiting artists.
More events to follow - be sure to check our website (sculpturemonthhouston.org) during the festival: October 11 - December 1, 2018.

In addition to the SMH curated exhibitions, we are welcoming other art venues from throughout the city, including commercial galleries, nonprofit art spaces, the Houston Airport System, museums, and City Hall, to present sculpture exhibits specifically for the celebration of the sculptural medium under the umbrella of SMH. We hope to have a finalized list of venues for 2018 by the end of July.

Why We Do What We Do:
Installation art has become a popular and internationally recognized medium where contemporary issues are explored in an immersive way. Many artists have chosen the installation medium because of the inherent ability to go beyond conservative conventions and traditions. Sculpture Month Houston’s series of site-specific installations tie into this current body of ideas that is percolating throughout the art world in places like Documenta and the Venice Biennale. We provide artists with the access to weigh in on this with their creative responses in order to enrich and shape the visual dialogue. SMH is participating in this dialogue by providing artists with an opportunity to be challenged to create site-specific installations in unique architectural venues.


Other Ways You Can Help:

Join our volunteers and help with tour groups, installing art work, or gallery assistance. (email us at sculpturemonthhouston@gmail.com to be put on the volunteer list!)
Get the word out and make some noise!! (Tell all your friends!)
Use the Indiegogo share tools!
Come to the Public Kick-Off!

Perks:
We have listed different perks depending on how much you are able to give. For example, $50 gets you a high-five, while $150 gets you two passes to our VIP Preview event on October 12th! This wide range offers you some fun surprises while you are offering up money to go towards our artists: you can even make a note in your donation if you want it to go towards a specific artist! We thank you ahead of time for your generous gifts and can't wait for you to see what we come up with for our 2018 exhibitions!

De la MICA nostră unire, am creat caricaturi ȋn diverse locații și ocazii.
Nunti/Botezuri/Parastase/Lansări/Prăbusiri/Baluri/Spitale/Catedrale

Acum, cu ocazia centenarului, ne-am decis să strângem mai multi artiști români, cu care să colaborăm, ȋn vederea realizării unor albume inedite, de caricaturi, ""Figuri de stil"" și ""Deformări profesionale"".
 Prin acest proiect dorim, ca și artiști caricaturiști, să lăsăm ceva României, să reamintim valorile naționale, și poate, să restabilim caricatura ca și ARTA. Si toate acestea ȋntr-un mod unic și amuzant, ușor de digerat.
Contribuind la acest proiect, veți putea ajuta la crearea unei punți de legatură ȋntre arta digitală și cea de sevalet, vor fi facuti ""de râs"" sub ochii dumneavostră  200 de romani mari.

Albumul ""Figuri de stil""

Cu ocazia centenarului marii UNIRI, ne-am hotărat, să unim într-un album, cei mai buni caricaturiști români, ȋntr-o formă stilistică literar, ""Figuri de stil""
""Nu ne intelegeți greșit, vom desena ȋn continuare, ȋnsă prin unirea disciplinelor, sperăm să putem (re)afirma caricatura, ca mijloc plastic, social și cultural, pe scena românească.""

Cel de-al doilea album oferă o imagine mai clară pe care România a reușit să o facă ȋn exterior, prin acești ""ministri de externe"", personalități care au avut un impact major asupra științei și culturii universale.
Cu un discurs mai liniar ȋn cea ce privește diferențele dintre profesii și aportul adus lor, dar net superior prin calitate și direcție, ""Deformări profesionale"" ILUSTREAZĂ modul ȋn care atât artiștii cât și cei prezentați, au fost afectați de profesia lor, schimbandu-li-se percepția asupra vieții.

Incă de pe bancile liceului am lucrat pentru un cotidian local, foarte actual la vremea aceea, Bună Ziua Brașov, mai apoi am continuat studiile la Universitatea de Arte George Enescu din Iași, unde ȋn paralel lucram și la Monitorul de Iași, un ziar local cu o echipă de profesioniști de unde am ȋnvățat multe lucruri despre gazetărie și implicit despre grafică de presa și caricatură. Ȋn anul 2006 am terminat și masteratul tot la aceeasi facultate, specialitatea arte plastice, din dorința de a-mi aprofunda cunostințele legate de artă și nu numai. Ȋn prezent sunt colaborator la mai multe publicatii locale și naționale, printre ele numărându-se cotidianul local Brașovul Tău, rețeaua Adevarul, printre care se numară multicunoscuta revistă de bussines Forbes, Money Express, etc...

Riscuri si Provocari

Toti cei implicați au o experiență vastă cu ce insemnă ""deadline"", lucrul direct cu clientul, și provocările financiare. Ne asumăm răspunsul la toate contribuțiile primite și recompensarea acestora și lansarea albumelor la timp, aceasta ȋnsemnând să iesim un pic mai mult ȋn afara zonei noastre de confort, și să ne implicam activ atât la răspandire cât și la implementarea proiectului.
Planul nostru este să lansăm albumul ""Figuri de stil"" la 1 decembrie, având ȋn vedere terminarea și celui de-a doilea, ""Deformări profesionale"", până in 20ish decembrie.
""Caricatura pentru caricatură"", este cea care nu naște dispute.


Alte moduri prin care ne puteti ajuta!

Pe cei ce doresc să ne susțină proiectul intr-un mod non-financiar, ȋi rugam să ""ȋmprăștie zvonul"", ""Vestea cea bună"", printr-un share ȋn retelele lor!
Pentru asta, folosiți ""instrumentele de ȋmprăstiat"" INDIEGOGO!

Urmează râsul! En: We, romanian cartoonists, got united under this project, to re-establish caricature as a form of ART, all this in a unique and fun way. We want to leave something of our work to Romania and not only, as artists, who express themselves through caricature.By sustaining this project, you help create a bridge between digital and traditional art.The first album, ""Figure of speech/style/stylus"", combine easel and stylus elements, to create fun and fine art.We'll lay out those 100 romanians, who made an positive image for Romania, and another 100 who're well known, will be made ""fools"", drawn, right under your very sight.Our albums aim is to illustrate the differences between ""opinion"" and ""experience based"", how literature and visual art intertwined themselves, how are them related, through similarities and differences both.
""Professional untraining/distortion"" - The second one illustrates how we, as artists, and the 100, get affected by our lines of work, changing the way we see life and we express ourselves.Through the duration of the project, we'll publish the reactions of ""professionals"" form all the fields involved (to see how they got their point/perspective changed): Literature, Cinema and Media, Photography, Advertising and P.R., Crowdfunding, Visual Arts, Comedy, Publishing and Printing Houses.Follow the laughter!",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>An Alter For Intention</h3>
<p>The Wishing Wings are an event-specific installation meant to inspire people to speak their wishes into existence.</p>
<p>The base of the Wings is typically shaped using a combination of chicken wire and scrap wood, with responsibly-sourced local bark and branches used to form the exterior. The Wings are then adorned with crystal garlands, flowers, and found #prettyshinythings.</p>
<p>Community members are invited to write/draw their wishes on a heart, and attach the hearts to the Wings - allowing others to witness and hold space for their intentions. At the closing of each display, the Wings are saged and each heart is carefully removed by Wing guardians - who then transport the wishes for burning. </p>

In the past 20 years I’ve conducted workshops across the country and abroad.  The majority of these have been 2 day demonstrations centered around making/talking about pots. A few times per year I’ve conducted firing workshops at university's and art centers like Peters Valley or University of Kentucky ranging from 4 days to 2 weeks focused on the heating/firing techniques in wood burning kilns.  On average I also conduct 1 kiln building/firing workshop per year.  Each kiln has taught the workshop participants and I many things about life, clay, group effort, and the abundant variety of kiln design.  So many of you have asked to come fire and learn with me at our former property in Jupiter, FL, though we just did not have the space.  </p><p>     This dream of inviting a small group for a “session” is now becoming a reality.  The opportunity to come work with me in clay, assist with kiln building, stoke the kiln, etc. is just around the corner.  The weather in Morrison is ideal with summertime highs in the low 80’s, dipping into the 50’s at night.  The winter weather is up and down, with daytime highs averaging in the 40’s dipping to 20 at night.  If you are looking for alternate activities during your session while the kiln is cooling, the skiing, hiking, biking, fishing, rafting, and rock climbing opportunities are abundant and close by.  We also value the variety of events, dining, arts and culture a large city has to offer, so Denver is ideal being only a 35 minute drive.  Denver is also centrally located, so travel by vehicle or air is very convenient and never more than a 3 hour flight from anywhere in the country.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Project</strong></u></h3><p>     I’ve spent countless hours cleaning up our property to make space for the new kiln shed.  The research I conducted along with assistance from the county, public health, zoning, fire marshal, etc. helped me carefully select the appropriate structure for the kiln project.  I decided to go with a fully enclosed (vented) steel building with roll up doors on all sides.  I need the flexibility to use the kilns through the winter, so a steel building was an obvious choice.  The enclosed kiln shed will provide a safe, secure, warm, comfortable environment for everyone throughout the year.  The footprint is 30’ x 40’ with a single slant roof height of 14’ - 12’ 6”.  </p><p>     This provides enough space for a few “small” kilns.  I’ve always preferred small kilns for their ease of firing, quick feedback for testing, and fast turnaround.  The kiln selection will provide opportunities to a variety of surface finishes, and abundant learning opportunities.  The kiln shed will house a natural gas/wood cross draft soda kiln, a small catenary tube wood kiln, and a revised version of the commonly called “Lambo gama” anagama (most recognized for its’ “smoke reduction” design incorporating the “afterburner” chamber).</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Opportunity</u></strong></h3><p>     The kiln shed will also function as a “sampler” for someone interested in building a kiln at their respective school, art center, home studio, etc.  As a guest you have the opportunity to fire any kiln to see if it might be the right fit for your future project.  This experience enables you to “test drive” one of the kilns prior to making your decision so you end up with the right kiln for your needs.  I will have the according material list for you to build it yourself, or you can choose to have me come build your kiln with you. </p><p>     Hopefully this can help avoid the situation so many end up where you have a great kiln, just not the right kiln for you.  It could be too big, too small, require too many people, require fuel that is difficult to attain, poor efficiency, bad design, improper insulation, awkward proportions, etc.  Avoid many of these problems by attending a session to try a kiln, before deciding on a kiln design.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>The Project</u></h3><p>     The scope of the project included quite a bit of land grading to make space for the kiln building, as well as clearing out an old garden, removing large posts, boulders, debris, relocating a treehouse, etc.  Given the amount of “bobcat” type of work involved prepping for the kiln shed, grading the driveway, creating space for vehicles, firebrick delivery unloading, and other various tasks, we purchased a used skid steer loader to save $$$ in the long run.  I’ve been able to do most of the work myself, and save my body physically in the process.  This tool also facilitates a variety of tasks, and has proven invaluable with delivery of materials for the project.</p><p>     Building anything has its challenges, and I am asking for your assistance with the next phase of the project.  We have purchased equipment, brought the kiln building from idea to a completely finished structure having received the final inspection from county June 12, 2018. After many months of searching, I purchased and received more than enough super duty, high alumina fire brick, and additional refractories for all of the kilns.  A new dedicated natural gas line has been run, and permit inspection performed successfully.  The studio area has been reorganized to comfortably accommodate our guests.</p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Help</u></strong></h3><p>      There are a few opportunities where I could use some help to complete the kiln shed project.  As a <strong>“Donor”</strong>, you are invited as one of our first VIP guests for a “session”.  You can select the session you wish to attend as the focus will vary with each session.  You can contact me at any time to discuss which session might be most fulfilling for you.  All you need to do is get here, we will take care of the rest for you.  <strong>“Sponsors”</strong> help collectively to provide the resources to push the project along more swiftly.  Sponsor rewards are described below accordingly, and your generous contributions will be put to use finishing the kiln shed project immediately.</p><p>     Your help will enable this project to move to completion sooner than later making the experience more fulfilling for everyone.  Many times small groups are able to work through ideas faster than large groups, exchanging ideas and forming solutions with more intimate discussion.  Small groups enable more testing opportunities due to fast turnaround, which leads to quicker resolution when developing concepts.  Small groups require smooth transitions when working together, and each person is invaluable to the success of the common goal.  This leads to enhanced learning and understanding, more personal connection to the process, and increased confidence when applying techniques in various future situations. </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Rewards</u></strong></h3><h3><strong><u>Donor Level</u></strong></h3><p><strong>“The Whole Enchilada”  Anagama Kiln Donor  $10,000:</strong>  The anagama is a special kiln to me for so many reasons, and the proportions are critical for good results.  It creates a tight group of artists who all work together seamlessly for a common goal.  The teardrop shape produces even heat saturation, and dramatic effects unlike any other kiln shape.  There is something surreal about every aspect of the anagama from its’ origin dug into a hillside, to the complex thought processes of loading, and the intimate listening to the kiln to learn what the kiln needs.</p><p><strong>“Burrito Grande”  Tube Kiln Donor  $7,500:</strong>  The tube kiln is an extremely versatile design for a large variety of situations.  It can be heated quickly and is very easy to load since it does not contain the complex curves of the anagama.  This is a “go to wood kiln” design in most any situation and can be easily adjusted in size.</p><p><strong>“Chimichanga”   Soda Kiln Donor  $5,000:</strong>  The catenary cross draft kiln design has been proven again and again by so many artists throughout its’ lifetime.  Since Grad School at IU in 2000, I’ve had a version of a catenary cross draft kiln available.  Small, versatile, and a proven arch make this design a must have.</p><p><strong>“Caliente”  Chimney Donor  $2,500 each x 2:</strong>  The kiln shed is engineered for 2 chimneys to exit the roof.  I need to weld steel frames on the corners of these chimneys, add spark arrestors, and flash them through the roof to be “water tight”.</p><h3><strong><u>Sponsor Level</u></strong></h3><p><strong>“La Comida”  Gas Burner Sponsor  $500 each x 8:</strong>  The kilns will incorporate a natural gas burner system to aid with efficient heating and the post combustion chambers for the smokeless design.  I have already run new underground gas lines to the kiln shed permit approved and inspected by county, but I need to pipe them to the kilns and purchase burners.  In turn you are “sponsoring” a students material fees to attend a session as my assistant.  I will select one student sponsor assistant via application for each “session”.  Applicants must be currently enrolled in a BFA program, or have completed a BFA degree.  This sponsorship will enable me to continue working closely with artists developing their voice in clay and assist them in their journey.</p><p><strong>Kiln Design Consultation Sponsor 4 hours, $250 each, 4 available:</strong>    Are you planning to build a kiln?  Have you emailed me about helping you design a kiln?  Are you wondering how much it will cost to build a kiln?  Do you have questions about who to contact to see if you are permitted to have a kiln?  I’ve spent countless hours

<p><strong><i>Tints of Resilience is a collective exhibition bringing together the works of eleven international artists in a rich tapestry of visual artworks, photography, poetry and film. The exhibition explores the potential of art in developing resilience in zones of conflict.</i></strong></p>

<p><strong><i>How it all started</i></strong></p>
<p>To adapt to the status quo or to advocate and work for change? A question I often asked myself while growing up. I was born at the end of the civil war in Lebanon, in a region witnessing constant political turmoil and economic instability. I always wondered what choices could be made in such circumstances? How do people around the world suffering from diif cope and develop?</p>
<p>The answer is never simple. Yet I realized with time that it somehow lies within each one of us. It lies in our assimilating of experiences and knowledge. The choice for me was to use what I know and love best: <strong><i>Art</i></strong>.</p>
<p>A beautiful encounter with Syrian artist Diala Brisly in 2016 triggered a project proposal and two years later an entire exhibition.</p>

<p><strong><i>What is it all about </i></strong></p>
<p>In times of war, life is interrupted and individuals find themselves forcibly alienated from their lands, traditions, and communities. <i>Tints of Resilience</i> is a collective exhibition that places art at the heart of adversity, examining its ability to reconnect and maintain the bonds with home, people, and tradition.</p>
<p>Eleven artists, currently or previously living in the Middle East, share their experiences in art-making and using art to cope with war, asylum, injury and search for identity. They present both individual explorations and artistic collaborations with refugee children, social workers, and art therapists.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531863681/afbixbysxks8av4erxzx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>Visitors to the exhibition are invited to join the artists in vibrant aesthetic moments where art-making provides the opportunity to address conflict and alienation through the unfolding of multiple narratives, where art can make meaning through empowerment.</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The exhibition proposes a rich public programme including a live Arabic calligraphy mural performance by young calligrapher Ghaleb Hawila and a seminar talk with both art therapist Myra Saad and artist Diala Brisly on the pivotal role of art making and art therapy in developing resilience for youth and adults in zones of conflict.

<p>The Oracle of the Green Rose holds a significant value during this momentous time in history as we liberate the cannabis plant from prohibition and bring awareness around the historical figures that made it possible. Many still struggle today to secure safe access to cannabis medicine for themselves and for their families. We honor those individuals with this literary work of art.</p>
<p>With this beautifully illustrated deck, you’ll be spreading the message of this spirit plant and sharing the wisdom of this plant’s medicine with the world.</p>

<p>Courtney is a cannabis industry entrepreneur in Los Angeles, California who supports the cannabis legalization movement in an effort to bring education around cannabis medicine and healing modalities.</p>
<p>Courtney manages manufacturing logistics and product development for cannabis products.  She was part of the first wave of cannabis businesses to bring lab-tested, 2018 compliant cannabis product to market in California.  With 15 years of both digital and print marketing experience, Courtney has the expertise to deliver this project with success.

<p><strong>She *Sparked*</strong> ... <strong>An IDEA</strong></p>
<p>After studying the Tarot with two esteemed masters of this ancient mystery school, Courtney had an epiphany.  Cannabis is unique in the plant kingdom in its ability to heal emotional trauma. Why not merge the power of this uplifting, spirit plant with the mystical and guiding principles of the Tarot?! And thus, that was the genesis of the Oracle of the Green Rose.</p>
<p><strong>About the Artists</strong></p>
<p>Collaborating with the talented fine artist <strong>Amber June Cross</strong>, the White Buffalo Spirit team is introducing <strong>the first ever cannabis oracle deck</strong> as a magical gift to weed enthusiasts everywhere. </p>
<p>The accompanying book in this exquisitely presented gift set, written by Ms. Freeman, shares a light-hearted story expressing both the historical context of each card's imagery and a thought-provoking message intended for the person receiving the reading, known as the <i>querent</i>.</p>
<p><strong>A Few Details For The CannaNERDS</strong></p>
<p>This deck holds 22 cards honoring the Major Arcana or archetypes outlined in the famous Rider-Waite Tarot deck.  Each of these cards touches on aspects of universal truths, symbolism, spiritual entities such as Santa Maria (the spirit of the cannabis plant) and the real-life (3rd dimension reality) pioneers who deserve a hearty thanks.</p>
<p>For example, The Magician card, numbered ""one"" in the deck, depicts Hua Tuo, an ancient physician and surgeon who created the first pain reliever by mixing ground cannabis flower with wine. (Super fun fact!!!).</p>
<p>Of the remaining 22 cards,</p>
<p>- 12 cards are dedicated to the <strong>heirloom or landrace cannabis strains</strong>, which hold the rich heritage of today's weed varietals. Durban poison will be the first landrace illustration that we share and the campaign will be updated when the art is ready for viewing. <i>This is a work in progress!</i></p>

<h3>Revisions of the Moon Summary</h3>
<p>Revisions of the Moon is a poetry book touching on the topics of love, loss, identity, death, trauma, grief, and growth. The book is organized into six chapters, which represent six of the moon phases. The sections emphasize the six phases including chaos, beginnings, challenge, clarity, communication, and growth. Our lives, like the moon phases, are always changing, and we go through similar cycles as we constantly strive for progress.<br/><br/>As you read through each chapter, you are guided to learn that after chaos and confusion comes light and clarity. There is always time to reflect and create change. As we go through life, we experience revisions of identity, revisions of memory, revisions of love, and revisions of growth.<br/> </p>

<h3>Goal </h3>
<p>This is the first printing of Revisions of the Moon, and I hope to reach my initial goal of $5000. My extended goal is $10000, and this would help me send the book to publishers to get it picked up by a poetry publishing house.</p>
<p>All books are signed over the price of $50 backed from the campaign, but I can also sign it in person during the launch event or a Toronto pick-up!</p>

Revisions of the Moon is a poetry book touching on the topics of love, loss, identity, death, trauma, grief, and growth. The book is organized into six chapters, which represent six of the moon phases. The sections emphasize the six phases including chaos, beginnings, challenge, clarity, communication, and growth. Our lives, like the moon phases, are always changing, and we go through similar cycles as we constantly strive for progress.As you read through each chapter, you are guided to learn that after chaos and confusion comes light and clarity. There is always time to reflect and create change. As we go through life, we experience revisions of identity, revisions of memory, revisions of love, and revisions of growth.

Goal 
This is the first printing of Revisions of the Moon, and I hope to reach my initial goal of $5000. My extended goal is $10000, and this would help me send the book to publishers to get it picked up by a poetry publishing house.
All books are signed over the price of $50 backed from the campaign, but I can also sign it in person during the launch event or a Toronto pick-up!
This would cover the cost of printing (in colour!), shipping, packaging, Indiegogo fees, credit card fees, and 10% of the profit will go towards Mental Health organization, Family Service Toronto to help with counselling services.

<h3>Johnathan Campbell</h3>
<p>As a teenager living on the family farm north of Bismarck I was introduced to the basics of photography and darkroom printing by my mother. I carried that interest to the University of North Dakota where I earned a B.A. in Visual Art in 1995. </p>
<p>After graduation I put the camera down so I could concentrate my artist skills on being the fossil preparator at the North Dakota Heritage Center restoring fossils such as the mosausaur skeleton displayed in the Geologic Times Gallery.</p>
<p>In 2014, after a 20 year hiatus, I picked up the camera again, and begun re-exploring the manipulation of light. My current primary area of expression is long exposure photography, with an emphasis on creative light painting. </p>
<p>I have been a full gallery artist with the Bismarck Downtown Artist Cooperative since 2015 in my pursuit of being a professional visual artist.</p>
<h3><strong>I Need Your Help</strong></h3>
<p>The McCanna House Artist-In Residence has the potential to be a life altering experience, but to take full advantage of my stay I need your assistance. </p>
<p>Donations to my residency will be used towards the following:</p>
<ul><li>Food, starving artist is not something I am striving for. I will have enough money saved up to make due with basic groceries, but good nutrition makes for better creativity.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Exploration of the region in pursuit of natural and man-made inspirations for the creation of photographic art. Without your help my wanderings will be limited to the immediate McCanna area.</li></ul>
<ul><li>It is my hope to spend time experimenting with long exposure film photography during my stay at the McCanna House. Using film instead of digital forces the artist to slow down and concentrate on each shot being taken as you are mindful that each click of the camera is costing you money. With your help to cover the cost of film and developing I will have more creative options to explore during my stay. One roll of color medium format film costs around $20 with processing</li></ul>
<h3>Benefits of Donating</h3>
<p>Besides the satisfaction of knowing you are helping an artist enrich the world with their art each donation will receive the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>$20 donation will receive a signed 8x10 print.</li>
<li>$30 donation will receive a signed 2020 calendar with photographs taken during the residency.</li>
<li>$50 donation will receive the 2020 calendar and a signed 11x14 print.</li>
<li>$100 donation will receive a 11x14 print on canvas</li>

<li>Hi, I'm Steve Hartley. I'm a caricature artist by day but THIS is the stuff I draw at home.</li>
<li>I have always wanted to share my art and love of dragons. This long quarantine gave me the opportunity to complete this first part of my dream.</li>
<li>I would be honored if my book was enjoyed by you and your family. </li>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your help, I want to print a large format artbook </p>
<p>The artbook is full-color, 17 x 11in, hardcover with case binding. I have some ideas about extra perks if certain goals are reached during the campaign, like a real sketch inside the cover of each book.</p>

<h3>Why I'm Doing This</h3>
<p>Since I was a child, I knew I wanted to create children's books. Also, since I was very young, Psalm 23 (""The Lord is my shepherd..."") has always brought me a sense of protection and helped me internalize the knowing that the Divine has and always will be with me. It's so important for me to get this work into the homes of more families and children. You, as my contributors, will bless me with the ability to make this happen with the costs of printing hard-cover, high-quality books.</p>
<p>Together, let's bring this psalm into as many homes as possible. Whether you are Jewish, Christian, or just spiritual, this psalm is universally powerful to bring inner peace and wholeness.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576105835/qe3yv4pggjl7dgntwdtd.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>The visual story I have illustrated of the young girl with her little lamb and dog-sidekick was inspired by having sheep and getting to take care of lambs in our pastures as I was growing up. <i>(This is a photo of me in my favorite rainbow polka-dotted jacket with one of the lambs.) </i> As a child, I felt at one with nature and spent a lot of time in it alone -- as I never really felt alone with all the wonderful animal and plant kingdom. I met God first in nature and the wonders of the glorious creation in the miracles of the tiny dew droplets to the vastness of the sky. </p>
<p>I want to bring a sense of peace and inner sovereignty to children, as expressed by the girl in my paintings in this book. Even when life feels like an unknown wilderness... we can trust that we are under the wings of the Divine presence and protection. This psalm does just that for us.</p>

<li>
<p>Different levels of contribution offer different perks from an e-book, to a hard-cover copy, a choice of printed wall art, and beyond. <br/>HERE ARE THE VARIOUS PERKS (but you can donate any amount, and let me know if you want the perk that is closely associated with it): </p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt; GRATITUDE - $18</strong><br/>Your contribution makes a difference! I will send you a downloadable ebook version of the book.</p>

You will receive two signed hardcover copies of the book + a small <u><i>customized commissioned art</i></u>. I will be in touch with you about your vision + specifics. You are also invited to add a dedication to someone or in memory of someone that will be published in the book (up to a maximum of 30 words).</p>
</li>
<li><p>If I don't reach my entire goal, I will consider marketing just an e-book and print a smaller run for contributors. But let's not go there... I'm bright-eyed and bushy-tailed about getting some amazing support from amazing people!</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Let's Make an Impact</h3>
<p>I intend for this project to be meaningful so we can raise a generation of children who feel a knowing of the Divine presence within them. If you can imagine a childhood book that has stayed with you over the years or decades because of the ideas expressed and the positive and reassuring visuals presented, this is what I want to contribute to the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I realize I am taking a risk in this big ask as it's not easy to ask you to open your heart and wallet. I realize this book goes WAY beyond me... as did the Psalm (in very powerful ways) that King David wrote several thousand years ago. I stand in that knowing and thinking of the children that will be read this book before bed every night, or when they are struggling. With your help, the mission goes way beyond me collecting some publishing funds and marketing of this book.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can, please make a small (or even better, LARGE!) contribution. I understand not everyone can, but doesn't mean you can't help. </p>
<ul>
<li>Please help me get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. </li>
<li>You can use the Indiegogo share tools! Copy the link, repost, email, social media it...</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm so appreciative!</p>
</div><h3>Book Love (Reviews)</h3><p>“The psalms are timeless, ancient human voices speaking to us out of the distant past.  The challenge facing any teacher, any translator, any illustrator of the psalms is to capture and convey the deeply human emotions of the ancient words without 'modernizing,' and thereby watering down, the text.  In this stunning book, Lucinda Rae has succeeded at bringing the old words to life, in all their depth, antiquity and mystery, and making them accessible to both adults and children.  Lucinda, thank you.”</p><p>- Rabbi Stephen E. Cohen, Congregation B’nai B’rith, Santa Barbara CA</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>“Lucinda Rae’s spirited illustrations of this sacred song of protection seen through the eyes of a child, simply awaken the divine message transmitted in each verse. The message of the universal connection we all have with our Creator, our Shepherd, can be felt, known and seen through our love.  The authentic Hebrew gives a deep living vibration to this timeless song!”</p><p>- P. Paulsen, Spiritual Director, Sunburst Sanctuary</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p><p>“This beautiful book is the perfect vehicle to teach our little ones both about God and His qualities and also about the ideal relationship for us to build with Him. The words of the psalm are not only comforting but instructive and Lucinda’s stunning illustrations are captivating for children and adults too.  I am thrilled to introduce my own little ones to the 23rd Psalm with this gorgeous book at bedtime, and I am also grateful to have such a vehicle for myself at the end of the day, to lead us all into quiet, peaceful and blessed sleep.”</p><p>- Brandy Mussman, M.A., CA</p><p> </p></div>","Why I'm Doing This

The visual story I have illustrated of the young girl with her little lamb and dog-sidekick was inspired by having sheep and getting to take care of lambs in our pastures as I was growing up. (This is a photo of me in my favorite rainbow polka-dotted jacket with one of the lambs.)  As a child, I felt at one with nature and spent a lot of time in it alone -- as I never really felt alone with all the wonderful animal and plant kingdom.

You are also invited to add a dedication to someone or in memory of someone that will be published in the book (up to a maximum of 30 words).

If I don't reach my entire goal, I will consider marketing just an e-book and print a smaller run for contributors. But let's not go there... I'm bright-eyed and bushy-tailed about getting some amazing support from amazing people!


Let's Make an Impact
I intend for this project to be meaningful so we can raise a generation of children who feel a knowing of the Divine presence within them. If you can imagine a childhood book that has stayed with you over the years or decades because of the ideas expressed and the positive and reassuring visuals presented, this is what I want to contribute to the world.

Risks & Challenges
I realize I am taking a risk in this big ask as it's not easy to ask you to open your heart and wallet. I realize this book goes WAY beyond me... as did the Psalm (in very powerful ways) that King David wrote several thousand years ago. I stand in that knowing and thinking of the children that will be read this book before bed every night, or when they are struggling. With your help, the mission goes way beyond me collecting some publishing funds and marketing of this book.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can, please make a small (or even better, LARGE!) contribution. I understand not everyone can, but doesn't mean you can't help. 

Please help me get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. 
You can use the Indiegogo share tools! Copy the link, repost, email, social media it...

I'm so appreciative!
Book Love (Reviews)“The psalms are timeless, ancient human voices speaking to us out of the distant past.  The challenge facing any teacher, any translator, any illustrator of the psalms is to capture and convey the deeply human emotions of the ancient words without 'modernizing,' and thereby watering down, the text.  In this stunning book, Lucinda Rae has succeeded at bringing the old words to life, in all their depth, antiquity and mystery, and making them accessible to both adults and children.  Lucinda, thank you.”- Rabbi Stephen E. Cohen, Congregation B’nai B’rith, Santa Barbara CA~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~“Lucinda Rae’s spirited illustrations of this sacred song of protection seen through the eyes of a child, simply awaken the divine message transmitted in each verse. The message of the universal connection we all have with our Creator, our Shepherd, can be felt, known and seen through our love.  The authentic Hebrew gives a deep living vibration to this timeless song!”- P. Paulsen, Spiritual Director, Sunburst Sanctuary~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~“This beautiful book is the perfect vehicle to teach our little ones both about God and His qualities and also about the ideal relationship for us to build with Him. The words of the psalm are not only comforting but instructive and Lucinda’s stunning illustrations are captivating for children and adults too.  I am thrilled to introduce my own little ones to the 23rd Psalm with this gorgeous book at bedtime, and I am also grateful to have such a vehicle for myself at the end of the day, to lead us all into quiet, peaceful and blessed sleep.”- Brandy Mussman, M.A., CA",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

I had always sensed a connection to the moon’s influence, but now it was confirmed.</p><p> </p><p><strong>I was going wild each cycle and needed solid ground to figure out what was influencing it all. </strong>I was in constant pain physically, was wildly unpredictable, and aggressive emotionally. I hated my own cycle — I was not at peace with myself, inside or out. There was a deep disconnect and war raging inside of me. </p><p> </p><p><strong>I sought to mend my lack of connection between myself and my womb. </strong>Slowly, I started to close the gaps and find understanding as I followed the lunar cycle and tracked my patterns alongside it. However, <strong>I did this mostly in my head or scattered between various apps that I would constantly forget to use or feel overwhelmed by more screen-time. </strong></p><p> </p><p>As I continued to sync up with the full moon, the intensity fueled me to know more.

Model: Zuwena Mshale</i></p><h3>A Message to You </h3><p>The more intentional we can be leading up to things such as our bleeding time, the more we can work with our bodies rather than against. I like to say we are learning to flow with our tides rather than against them. <strong>Once we are aware, doors open everywhere for our expansion and transcendence from pain. </strong>We realize everything is intimately connected — and oftentimes — just needs our love and attention.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Individually, self-care allows us to feel supported so we can be a better part of the collective whole. </strong>It helps us realize that we are worthy of choosing to prioritize ourselves. Collectively, we are learning to diverge from a strictly work &amp; logic mindset that the world is focused on. We’re learning to instead be perceptive, to listen, to feel, and to realize it's much more beautiful and intuitive to live this way. <strong>We are learning that we can use this knowledge to be even better versions of ourselves.</strong></p><p> </p><p>It's truly a ripple effect. It's beautiful how much pain we can shed &amp; love we can share with ourselves and one another once we get beyond the idea that our periods are a burden and our bodies are not on our side. <strong>We are ending the deflected war against our human vessels &amp; the natural, beautiful, magic processes they carry us through. </strong>That all of this is pure and to be cherished is the most important thing to remember.

<li>We have allowed extra cushioning room in our schedule so that you will receive your journals well by the holiday season if you pre-ordered — and at least a month+ ahead of time before the new year &amp; the journal's official start date of the Solstice on December 29, 2020.</li>
<li>We have also factored in the chances of shipping delays and such with corona looming in the air still. While we can’t fully control any postal delays, we just assume things always take longer than expected, so that’s why we say November delivery and appreciate your patience.</li>
</ul><h3>A Note on Shipping:</h3><p>Our goal is to get everyone in the U.S. their journal before December - November is our goal, before holidays &amp; especially before its start date in December 2020 - with no promises to international although we will prioritize shipping yours first. While we cannot guarantee shipping delays won't be in effect due to COVID, the mail for the election in the U.S. &amp; holiday season, we are allowing extra time to accommodate this and will do all we can.</p><p>We will ship in the following order:</p><p>1. International</p><p>2. Shop/Retail Bulk Orders</p><p>3. Other Bulk</p><p>4. Early Birds</p><p>5. Etc in order of tiers</p><p>Shipping estimates are always just estimates - oftentimes they are inaccurate, especially when you factor in the layers of chaos in the world right now :-). We appreciate your patience in advance and are factoring in extra time. A normal time-frame for priority mail in the U.S. is 2-5 days, but at this point we must allow up to 2 weeks. As for international, sadly I've had orders take up to 3 months to arrive, but on average I say allow 1-2 months. We will ship yours first regardless in hopes it arrives sooner than later.</p><p>Our goal is to ship everything in early November so it has a full month to reach everyone before it begins and before holiday season. We will be prioritizing shipments to shops &amp; international orders first - in October if possible. We are also going to ship all orders via priority mail this year, aside from bulk orders which are media mail unless an upgrade is requested.</p><p>We hope for the best for the future of the understaffed and threatened USPS and their underpaid workers. We will update you as time goes on and hope for the best. <strong>While we cannot control the postal service, we will do everything in our power to ensure that you get your journals.</strong></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595453099/nqomgdo9qplth2qqjjin.png"" src=""""/></h2><h3>Help Us Spread The Movement</h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596151388/xcrx8t5k8ngdsbi03lka.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><p>As a small project growing and rooting, we can use all the help we can get spreading the word.

The journal has been sent to print! :) Yay!
RE: the indiegogo message at checkout says crowdfunding is not shopping for their safety, but you WILL receive the physical perk you select
Discounts end on 9/30
Cycles Journal is an illustrated lunar and menstrual tracking calendar for those seeking to prioritize self-care, slow down — and deeply listen. You’ll be guided on a journey to uncover patterns within & reconnect to your natural flows through journaling, lunar insight, sacred tips, and more. Reclaiming the power of your cycle helps you regain control within your life — so that you can heal + transform your relationship with yourself, others & the world. Societal stigma tries to convince us we can't work magic and bleed at the same time (it's quite the opposite!) or that we don't deserve to rest when we need to. We’re standing up against that notion. It’s time to use our menstrual cycles to plan & prepare for our  lives — to experience less burn-out and more flowing magnetism.It’s time for us to reclaim ourselves and our powerful flows. It’s time to mend the parts of our nature we may feel disconnected from or at internal war with.We are empowering ourselves as unique parts of a blossoming whole. We are decolonizing and unraveling forced, limiting linear timelines. We are rebuilding our own beautiful, flowing cyclical way of life. And it starts by understanding our own waves.  NOTE:At checkout, Indiegogo says ""crowdfunding is not shopping but a donation and does not guarantee a 'perk' "" - but if you select a perk you WILL receive that physical item in the mail within the estimated delivery time! This campaign is a pre-order campaign. We're sending this to the printer and distributing no matter what - we take the cost difference risk, which is why we're fundraising via pre-orders offset costs via this campaign.

We host a fundraiser yearly to provide you with some amazing discounts & deals for helping us afford printing costs. Your support via pre-orders and sponsorships help make this journal possible!We believe in transparency, so you can see where all the money is being directed. Any extra money helps us get more journals printed so that we can keep spreading the magic! Plus, the creator hopes to get paid for all her hard work once all costs are covered so she can keep feeding herself and keep on creating this for you!All fees are covering printing & shipment to my home studio, covering platform & transaction fees, paying the postal service to ship these orders out to all of you & packaging supplies for shipments. I chose not to include other expenses such as marketing, paying our team helpers who make this possible, paying out collaborators, federal & state taxes, and other costs - this will be covered through sponsorships, and a hope for stretch goals beyond our base goal!Why Support Us?(photographed above is our 2020 journal)We’re a small, self-publishing, grassroots business founded by an independent artist and activist. This journal has been created from the heart & soul of a group on the same path as you.We only print in small-batches with recycled materials & never in mass-producing unethical factories. We are dedicated to aligning our ethics & eco-activism with our creation process. Cycles Journal is never printed in factories in China or anywhere else because we are dedicated to small, quality batches. We also consider the environment when choosing the recycled, certified paper, and we package with recycled materials as much as possible.We offer accessible options & discounts for low-income BIPOC.We are dedicated to providing accessible options for those who are marginalized and need some financial assistance. We are starting a pooled fund of donations; through the pay-it-forward method, you can support someone to receive a journal at a variable of a discounted price, which is open for discussion/sliding scale based on need. Pay it forward via the “add-on” option when you check out.Visit cyclesjournal.com/pay-it-forward for more info on how this process will work &/or to apply for relief.We are dedicated to intersectional feminism, anti-racism, and dismantling unjust power systems of white supremacy and patriarchy.This creation is inherently radical in the best way. Through empowering ourselves and learning how to harness our greatest assets (aka our bodies & mental health), we are rising up and bringing the matriarchal power back into alignment. We are dedicated to uplifting, representing, and focusing on serving our Black, Indigenous & Brown sisters & folks through this creation and all that it offers.We are committed to inclusivity & diversity.Someone told us last year that the journal was ""too inclusive"" and we took that as a win because that's the goal. We believe that queerness is beautiful, and we consider all gender identities who may embody a womb and use this journal. This is why we don't only use the word ""women"" to address our community, and it is why the journal aims to represent and address as many body types, gender presentation and skin tones as possible. This shows not only our want for justice and equality, but our refusal to go without it.When you support us, you support yourself.This journal is a gift to yourself or someone you love whether you realize it or not. The once-a-year investment is small compared to the expansion you'll uncover upon working with this journal. It is a powerful tool to help you shift your mind & practices. We believe that this is a beautiful reciprocal tool; you support our efforts and costs in creating this, and in return you receive a space of possibility & guidance, along with being a part of the collective evolutionary healing.About the CreatorI wanted to tell you a bit about who I am & why I started this creation, if you are curious. I'm Rachael Amber — I'm an illustrator & designer, a menstrual health & self-care advocate, an environmental activist, a plant whisperer, a cat-lover.... I create tools and visuals for change because it is how I feel driven to cope with some of the confinements and injustices of our society. Doing this work grounds me, gives me hope, and connects me to all of you. I am thankful that I can create work that resonates with others.My StoryI once bled in alignment with the full moon for 12 consecutive months. I had always sensed a connection to the moon’s influence, but now it was confirmed. I was going wild each cycle and needed solid ground to figure out what was influencing it all. I was in constant pain physically, was wildly unpredictable, and aggressive emotionally. I hated my own cycle — I was not at peace with myself, inside or out. There was a deep disconnect and war raging inside of me.  I sought to mend my lack of connection between myself and my womb. Slowly, I started to close the gaps and find understanding as I followed the lunar cycle and tracked my patterns alongside it. However, I did this mostly in my head or scattered between various apps that I would constantly forget to use or feel overwhelmed by more screen-time.  As I continued to sync up with the full moon, the intensity fueled me to know more. I felt called to dive deeper through a more organized approach. Creating a tool seemed like the only way I could figure out what influenced me and where it all linked — to uncover the magic that I was starting to feel beneath the surface. I wanted something to track it all in one place. Something that would inspire and motivate me to actually feel dedicated to it. So I realized that if it didn't exist already, this was my sign to create it. Originally, I was going to make a simple booklet for myself to use, but as I told others my revelation, I realized this was desired and needed by so many more. There was an underlying realization of lack of cyclical focus in our world. And so, like all of my ideas, I want to share it and expand it to help other people, too. Thus the guiding tool of Cycles Journal was born — for all of us.All Photography by Devon Dadoly. Model: Zuwena MshaleA Message to You The more intentional we can be leading up to things such as our bleeding time, the more we can work with our bodies rather than against. I like to say we are learning to flow with our tides rather than against them. Once we are aware, doors open everywhere for our expansion and transcendence from pain. We realize everything is intimately connected — and oftentimes — just needs our love and attention. Individually, self-care allows us to feel supported so we can be a better part of the collective whole. It helps us realize that we are worthy of choosing to prioritize ourselves. Collectively, we are learning to diverge from a strictly work & logic mindset that the world is focused on. We’re learning to instead be perceptive, to listen, to feel, and to realize it's much more beautiful and intuitive to live this way. We are learning that we can use this knowledge to be even better versions of ourselves. It's truly a ripple effect. It's beautiful how much pain we can shed & love we can share with ourselves and one another once we get beyond the idea that our periods are a burden and our bodies are not on our side. We are ending the deflected war against our human vessels & the natural, beautiful, magic processes they carry us through. That all of this is pure and to be cherished is the most important thing to remember. When we are intentional and caring, we can make anything happen.Risks & ChallengesWith all projects, there are risks and challenges. The main ones we face are printing and production time. For the past two years we have met our deadlines and all has gone according to plan, aside from minor delays and spelling/number errors uncaught pre-press. We are making sure this doesn't happen again!
We have an editing team to make sure the information is correct and spelling errors are caught pre-press.
We are working hard to create the journal to its fullest and most beautiful potential. Any speed bumps will be met with care and communication.
We have allowed extra cushioning room in our schedule so that you will receive your journals well by the holiday season if you pre-ordered — and at least a month+ ahead of time before the new year & the journal's official start date of the Solstice on December 29, 2020.

<p>Stickybones has been engineered to withstand anything your imagination throws its way. As animators, we understand the importance of having strong and precisely functioning joints to consistently hold our poses.  From the outset, creating a solution that enables our joints to endure wide ranges of motion and repeated use has remained at the heart of our Stickybones design and functionality.  </p>
<p>Because our joints have the great benefit and convenience of a pre-tensioned socket system, one of the physical characteristics we are carefully scrutinizing are qualities relating to the retention of surface volume for increased longevity and optimum joint performance, enabling Stickybones to maintain their stiffness and ability to hold your poses with repeated use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453034556/emkb2i20qfsotkstnrcq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>Our primary objective is to make the most robust and highly functioning animation/artistic figure on the market while keeping the price accessible to everyone.  Currently, the best way we can accomplish this is by having high-grade steel molds precisely tooled that will be used to then injection mold our parts with the highest quality engineering grade polymers.  Through the combination of design for animation and poseability, world-class tooling, ultra-tight tolerance injection molding, and specially tuned materials, Stickybones is infused and methodically constructed to help you more rapidly animate and create the poses you really want to hit!<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/FnInE-dXCuTJFKeogNHnzc_lF-FIc6viFP7iH205KRJ_tF-cpLBf5LSq1ru7rIUi_5XYUSkjGa2rRvVq4pnXzsgHlt8JFHtRtqvtWMgLLNuyP3UBWVKurPoEQidnxCgmAQFses9n"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Where Are We in Production?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We’ve designed and built working prototypes—now the next step is to build the tooling and molds for manufacturing.  We’ve chosen and are working hand-in-hand with a US-based manufacturer specializing in precision tooling and tight-tolerance injection molding.  We’ve also chosen a US-based packaging company and are currently reviewing packaging options.</p>
<br/>We've already saved tens of thousands of dollars during the past year and a half of development by designing with precision CAD based software(Autodesk Fusion 360) and fabricating our own animation-ready prototypes using a combination of 3D (SLA) printing, tooling, and injection molding processes.<br/><br/><br/><br/> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453527009/ebykasapvljz4ig07mwb.jpg"" src=""""/></p> <h3> </h3>
<h3>Made by Animators, for Animators &amp; Artists</h3>
<p>With the years of knowledge gathered working in the animation industry, we've worked hard to pour these nuggets of creative goodness into the development of Stickybones.  As a result, Stickybones has become a versatile, precisely calibrated tool for artists and storytellers to create their own images.</p>

<p>Once on store-shelves, it is important to us that Stickybones remains affordable and within reach for students on a budget. The best way to achieve this is to use full-scale manufacturing to make the parts. However, the tooling necessary for full-scale manufacturing is a labor intensive and an extremely expensive process, requiring a huge upfront investment. Here is the best part... You can help get Stickybones manufactured and be one of the first people to get your very own Stickybones simply by contributing to our Indiegogo Campaign!</p> <h2> </h2>

<h1>Stickybones FAQs</h1> <p>Q: How do I pre-order a Stickybones of my very own?</p>
<p>Answer: You can pre-order Stickybones by claiming one of the exclusive perks we’ve offered above. The perks are listed on the right-hand side of the campaign page, starting at the top. To claim one of the perks, all you have to do is click on one you would like and go through the payment confirmation. You will get a confirmation email from Indiegogo. </p>
<p>Q: What is the Indiegogo Limited Edition Color going to be?</p>
<p>Answer:  A backer's vote has been taken and the winner is Spark Blue!  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Will the final product be 3D-Printed?</p>
<p>Answer:  Nope. 3D printed materials currently lack the strength, durability, and a gamut of physical characteristics required for optimum joint performance and longevity. Our primary objective is to make the most robust and highly functioning animation/artistic figure on the market while keeping the price accessible to everyone, and currently, the best way we can accomplish this is with high-precision injection molding with strong, engineering-grade materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: SHIPPING: WHERE will you ship?</p>
<p>Answer: We plan to ship worldwide!  However, please note:  Every country has its own shipping regulations and rules.  Once the final Stickybones is manufactured and packaged, if your country, (for some reason) says we cannot ship it there, then you will be issued a full refund.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: I do not live in the United States...what are some international shipping cost considerations?</p>
<p>A: Some extra shipping cost considerations for International Backers will be customs/duty taxes.  (Some countries require a VAT.)   Please make sure you're comfortable covering International shipping and the customs and duty taxes of your own country before contributing/pre-ordering, as some countries are notoriously high--which (of course) we have no control over.</p> <p>Q: SHIPPING: How much will shipping cost?<br/>Answer: We are working out final shipping costs right now.  We have backers from 90 countries!  Which is awesome! But as you can imagine, calculating shipping to all of them is quite an enormous chunk of work!   Before we ship anything to you, we will get in touch with you to confirm your mailing address, get any color preferences and collect shipping fees.  International backers must anticipate import taxes and fees charged by your country's customs agency.</p> <p>Q:  How do I get in touch with your team?  </p>
<p>Answer: Email hello@stickybones.com</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How tall is Stickybones?</p>
<p>Answer:  Stickybones is 8.5 inches (21.5 cm) tall.  (1/9th Scale)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: Can I put clay, foam, or latex over Stickybones?</p>
<p>Answer:  Stickybones is designed to be a simple, easy-to-use solution that doesn't require extra work.  We have not tested adding any kind of bulk to this figure... But that being said, we encourage people to get experimental and try out anything they'd like!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q:  Is Stickybones meant to replace traditional stop motion armatures?</p>
<p>Answer:   We're creating Stickybones to be a useful tool for all kinds of animators and artists—with the fantastic benefit of having the functionality of being able to create stop motion animation... it's not meant to replace traditional stop motion armatures.  It's meant to be a fast, easy and affordable solution for someone who wants to jump right in and pose or animate!</p> <p>Q: Do you plan to release other characters or a quadruped?</p>
<p>Answer:  Yes, we are looking forward to using our patent pending joint system in alternate characters and animals!  Also, because our limbs and joints are modular, we can release variations on individual body parts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q: How can I hit mid-air poses? Will you release an articulated arm/rig?</p>
<p>Answer:  Yes, you can pre-order our super duper <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIw8ZPbaikQ"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">FLY_RIG!</a></p> <p>Q: I’m just starting out in animation or looking to learn more about it. Is Stickybones for me?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes!  We’re creating Stickybones to be an intuitive, easy-to-use tool to help both professionals and beginners alike push their art and animation further!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Q:  Will you offer a surface or base that Stickybones can attach to?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes.  Every Stickybones will come with a FREE compact Pose-Plate to display your sweet poses.  <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If you want a larger surface on which to animate,  we recommend you pre-order a <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/stickybones-rapid-posing-animation-made-easy-art-design/payments/new?perk_id=3818114"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Performance Stage</a>! </span></p> <p>Q: How long can Stickybones hold each pose?</p>
<p>Answer: Most poses should hold as long as you’d like them to!</p> <p>Q:  How do the joints work?</p>
<p>Answer:  We have a patent pending joint system comprised of pre-tensioned, interlocking, snap-to-fit ball and socket parts you can pop apart and back together, when desired.  This allows Stickybones to be more modular and enhances the ability to modify the appearance and swap parts with variations we may release in the future.  This pre-tensioned ball and socket design also opens up the freedom of motion, maximizing the rotational range of our joints on the X,Y, Z axis.</p> <p>Q:  How are the joints able to hold extreme poses with repeated use?</p>
<p>Answer:  Stickybones joints are robust in design and construction.  They are made with a combination of high-performance and highly wear-resistant materials, enabling them to maintain their stiffness and ability to hold your poses with repeated use.  As animators, we understand the importance of having stiff joints and precision functionality to consistently hold poses and create performances.  From the outset, creating a solution that enables our joints to endure repeated use has remained at the heart of our Stickybones design and functionality.  </p> <p>Q: I’m having trouble claiming a perk.

  Stickybones is the Ultimate Artist’s Companion
 
  Stickybones can hit and hold the poses you've always wished your poseable figure could.  We spend a vast amount of time studying human kinesiology to ensure Stickybones meets and exceeds the natural range of motion.
 

“I could definitely use Stickybones in my paintings—I paint a lot of dancers among other things and Stickybones is perfect for that because it gives me the perspective elements and structure I need to get a solid drawing. Then I can add all the other elements—the lighting, clothing and the general appearance of the character.""  — Emanuele Pavarotti, Blue Sky Studios (pictured above)
 

“I am an avid sketcher. I love drawing in my sketchbook and just coming up with really unique poses.  When I first saw Stickybones, I thought that this would be a really awesome way to explore posing.”
— Garrett Shikuma, Blue Sky Studios (pictured above)
 
 
 
A Wide Variety of Uses

 
 
 
“I can see Stickybones technology as a go to in the performing arts for many disciplines of dance—not only for describing complicated choreography with intricate detail, but also for preserving works created today and historically. Our current forms of notation lack detail and movement—but Stickybones could allow for full and fluid demonstration. Also, Stickybones has endless options as a choreographic tool. This could be utilized for years to come.”      — Derrick Agnoletti, Leading Artist with The Joffrey Ballet  
Intuitive Tool for Students & Teachers

""As an art instructor, I have always wanted a better way to show my students how the human body moves. Using live models or wooden manikins left me wanting more.  When Erik and Lauren introduced their Stickybones figure to my middle school 3-D action figure sculpture class, it was quickly evident that this was the moveable figure that my students would benefit from and the type of figure I had been looking for. I can envision many exciting advantages and possibilities that Stickybones can offer, not only to the fine arts but also to many other teaching disciplines.""  
— Sharon Wilkus, Art Instructor & Yearbook Adviser, Almaden Country School
 
 
  
 

 

Ready to animate right out of the box
 
Stickybones lowers the barrier of entry for anyone looking to explore stop motion animation.  You can take Stickybones out of the package and start posing and animating immediately—no need to spend large amounts of time and money on building your own puppet from scratch.

How it works
 
  

 
Joints Engineered To Hold Your Poses

 
Stickybones has been engineered to withstand anything your imagination throws its way. As animators, we understand the importance of having strong and precisely functioning joints to consistently hold our poses.  From the outset, creating a solution that enables our joints to endure wide ranges of motion and repeated use has remained at the heart of our Stickybones design and functionality.  
Because our joints have the great benefit and convenience of a pre-tensioned socket system, one of the physical characteristics we are carefully scrutinizing are qualities relating to the retention of surface volume for increased longevity and optimum joint performance, enabling Stickybones to maintain their stiffness and ability to hold your poses with repeated use.
 
Our primary objective is to make the most robust and highly functioning animation/artistic figure on the market while keeping the price accessible to everyone.  Currently, the best way we can accomplish this is by having high-grade steel molds precisely tooled that will be used to then injection mold our parts with the highest quality engineering grade polymers.  Through the combination of design for animation and poseability, world-class tooling, ultra-tight tolerance injection molding, and specially tuned materials, Stickybones is infused and methodically constructed to help you more rapidly animate and create the poses you really want to hit!
 
 
Where Are We in Production?
 
We’ve designed and built working prototypes—now the next step is to build the tooling and molds for manufacturing.  We’ve chosen and are working hand-in-hand with a US-based manufacturer specializing in precision tooling and tight-tolerance injection molding.  We’ve also chosen a US-based packaging company and are currently reviewing packaging options.
We've already saved tens of thousands of dollars during the past year and a half of development by designing with precision CAD based software(Autodesk Fusion 360) and fabricating our own animation-ready prototypes using a combination of 3D (SLA) printing, tooling, and injection molding processes.   
Made by Animators, for Animators & Artists
With the years of knowledge gathered working in the animation industry, we've worked hard to pour these nuggets of creative goodness into the development of Stickybones.  As a result, Stickybones has become a versatile, precisely calibrated tool for artists and storytellers to create their own images.

 Why Fund us on Indiegogo?
Once on store-shelves, it is important to us that Stickybones remains affordable and within reach for students on a budget. The best way to achieve this is to use full-scale manufacturing to make the parts. However, the tooling necessary for full-scale manufacturing is a labor intensive and an extremely expensive process, requiring a huge upfront investment. Here is the best part... You can help get Stickybones manufactured and be one of the first people to get your very own Stickybones simply by contributing to our Indiegogo Campaign!

Stickybones FAQs Q: How do I pre-order a Stickybones of my very own?
Answer: You can pre-order Stickybones by claiming one of the exclusive perks we’ve offered above. The perks are listed on the right-hand side of the campaign page, starting at the top. To claim one of the perks, all you have to do is click on one you would like and go through the payment confirmation. You will get a confirmation email from Indiegogo. 
Q: What is the Indiegogo Limited Edition Color going to be?
Answer:  A backer's vote has been taken and the winner is Spark Blue!  
 
Q: Will the final product be 3D-Printed?
Answer:  Nope. 3D printed materials currently lack the strength, durability, and a gamut of physical characteristics required for optimum joint performance and longevity. Our primary objective is to make the most robust and highly functioning animation/artistic figure on the market while keeping the price accessible to everyone, and currently, the best way we can accomplish this is with high-precision injection molding with strong, engineering-grade materials.
 
Q: SHIPPING: WHERE will you ship?
Answer: We plan to ship worldwide!  However, please note:  Every country has its own shipping regulations and rules.  Once the final Stickybones is manufactured and packaged, if your country, (for some reason) says we cannot ship it there, then you will be issued a full refund.
 
Q: I do not live in the United States...what are some international shipping cost considerations?
A: Some extra shipping cost considerations for International Backers will be customs/duty taxes.  (Some countries require a VAT.)   Please make sure you're comfortable covering International shipping and the customs and duty taxes of your own country before contributing/pre-ordering, as some countries are notoriously high--which (of course) we have no control over. Q: SHIPPING: How much will shipping cost?Answer: We are working out final shipping costs right now.  We have backers from 90 countries!  Which is awesome! But as you can imagine, calculating shipping to all of them is quite an enormous chunk of work!   Before we ship anything to you, we will get in touch with you to confirm your mailing address, get any color preferences and collect shipping fees.  International backers must anticipate import taxes and fees charged by your country's customs agency. Q:  How do I get in touch with your team?  
Answer: Email hello@stickybones.com
 
Q: How tall is Stickybones?
Answer:  Stickybones is 8.5 inches (21.5 cm) tall.  (1/9th Scale)
 
Q: Can I put clay, foam, or latex over Stickybones?
Answer:  Stickybones is designed to be a simple, easy-to-use solution that doesn't require extra work.  We have not tested adding any kind of bulk to this figure... But that being said, we encourage people to get experimental and try out anything they'd like!
 
Q:  Is Stickybones meant to replace traditional stop motion armatures?
Answer:   We're creating Stickybones to be a useful tool for all kinds of animators and artists—with the fantastic benefit of having the functionality of being able to create stop motion animation... it's not meant to replace traditional stop motion armatures.  It's meant to be a fast, easy and affordable solution for someone who wants to jump right in and pose or animate! Q: Do you plan to release other characters or a quadruped?
Answer:  Yes, we are looking forward to using our patent pending joint system in alternate characters and animals!  Also, because our limbs and joints are modular, we can release variations on individual body parts.
 
Q: How can I hit mid-air poses? Will you release an articulated arm/rig?
Answer:  Yes, you can pre-order our super duper FLY_RIG! Q: I’m just starting out in animation or looking to learn more about it. Is Stickybones for me?
Answer: Yes!  We’re creating Stickybones to be an intuitive, easy-to-use tool to help both professionals and beginners alike push their art and animation further!
 
Q:  Will you offer a surface or base that Stickybones can attach to?
Answer: Yes.  Every Stickybones will come with a FREE compact Pose-Plate to display your sweet poses.  If you want a larger surface on which to animate,  we recommend you pre-order a Performance Stage!  Q: How long can Stickybones hold each pose?
Answer: Most poses should hold as long as you’d like them to! Q:  How do the joints work?
Answer:  We have a patent pending joint system comprised of pre-tensioned, interlocking, snap-to-fit ball and socket parts you can pop apart and back together, when desired.  This allows Stickybones to be more modular and enhances the ability to modify the appearance and swap parts with variations we may release in the future.  This pre-tensioned ball and socket design also opens up the freedom of motion, maximizing the rotational range of our joints on the X,Y, Z axis. Q:  How are the joints able to hold extreme poses with repeated use?

<p>Hello! Thanks for taking a moment to read about our new business venture! Our names are Jim, Sara, and Roy. We are all ex smokers and have made the switch to vapor. With the vaping experience we were all able to get off big tobacco and reduce health risks dramatically. We love the vaping experience and can't wait to share it with our customers in a new and exciting way. We look to open a new vape shop in Longmont Colorado that will cater to the needs of our local vape community, as well as local artists. 303 Vapes will offer an extremely low consignment rate for local artists that otherwise might not have a profitable place to showcase and sell their pieces. We hope to help more new people discover vaping as an alternative to tobacco and get healthy! Our shop will also offer a comfortable environment where people can hang out and socialize while vaping as we will be offering free wifi and other amenities. We appreciate every contribution that helps us achieve the dream of owning a successful vape business. So there are quite a few vapor shops out there but that's not important. What is important is that we have a recipe for success and are eager to become entrepreneurs in this new market before it's too late. Contrary to information that big tobacco may provide the news about there not being enough research and there are possible risks, we vouch for VAPOR and the health benefits that come with the switch. Big tobacco will lobby and pay secretively for advertisements against vapor. They are afraid, as they should be, that people are finally finding a way to kick tobacco. I'd like to see Big Tobacco bankrupt. <br/></p>

<p> A little history about us: <br/></p>
<p>Jim grew up working in a custom wood shop with his father who would design and build furniture. These skills, hand me down techniques and tricks of the trade have given Jim the ability to transform what may seem like some scrap pieces of wood into an amazing piece whether it be something as small as a coaster or mod stand to larger pieces like tables and desks. Jim also is a skilled stone mason who can cut, shape, fabricate and lay stone with the best of them.  His experience doesn't stop there. Jim also has experience with working in a weld shop, antique restoration shop, landscape construction, and many more hobbies/jobs that ultimately helped form his creative mind for sculpting metal and mixing mediums like metals and exotic woods. <br/></p>
<p>Roy is a third generation stone mason who takes his trade very seriously. His attention to detail is immaculate, and inherited from his father who is well known for the quality of stone masonry that he provides. Roy Has learned some skills with woodworking from Jim and is experimenting with others like steam bending. Roy also enjoys Blacksmithing as a hobby where he is working on the art of forging and brazing his own carbide chisels for stone masonry, creating cold steel chisels, knives, tuckpointers, trowels, and anything that seems plausible when the forge fires up. Roy also enjoys welding which he uses in the fabrication of his own industrial art pieces which range from Desks and tables to a collection of wild and science fiction like lamps. <br/></p>
<p>Sara has spent 14+ years working as manager in well known banks in the area. She is  an avid networking figure and because of this she is involved in many areas of our community.  Due to all her connection in the area she is also involved in many diverse projects. Just to name a few, Sara works with a local non-profit as a board member/treasurer to help under privilege youth get music lessons. Sara takes pride in also being very involved with music and the arts scene in our area. Her most recent endeavors have taken her to the Stage as a performer/actress in a very moving theatrical/musical  production to bring awareness to domestic violence. She has always been eager to have a career that will let her explore some of her more creative Goals and aspirations. Sara has started a candle business called ""Candle Nerd"" where she creates interesting and unique soy based scented candles that smell amazing and look just as great along with custom soaps that are unique and fun. Needless to say, Sara has a very extensive creative and business driven background.    <br/></p>
<p>So in conclusion we want to take these wild creations of ours and use them to help create an art friendly environment where people can come in to purchase their much needed vaping supplies, vape, enjoy a rotating display of artwork which will be mostly for sale, hang out and use the wifi while vaping or building coils, and just be comfortable. We estimate that we will need as much as $20,000 to really make this idea hit the ground running and as little as $15,000 on a tighter budget. We will all be contributing as much as we can to keep momentum but we can't do it without some support. $7500.00 would pay for a year of service with a website service provider (Roy has experience and will work with jim and sara to create the website) it will pay for our professional logo for business cards, secure a property for the store, Purchase of an eye catching sign for the shop, Some SEO services for the website, and possibly a point of sale system. One great thing about Jim and Roy's fabricating abilities is that they can build/create most of the furniture in the shop, so some of these funds may also go towards material for furniture creations and interesting displays.<br/></p>

<p><b>DALAI LAMA'S TIBET: a book and exhibition to help the Tibetan cause.</b></p><p>As
the Dalai Lama approaches his 80th birthday in 2015, this year presents itself as an important moment to
document and explain the here and now of the Tibetan cause. The
dream of a free Tibet has evolved in recent times. Instead of independence,
Tibetans are pursuing political and cultural autonomy within China. It is a
very realistic step for them. One that, without a doubt, has many more
possibilities than the pursue of independence. But for now, the authorities of
the biggest country of the world remain silent. The
fourteen Dalai Lama, authentic leader of the Tibetan people and worldwide
recognized figure, has renounced to his political duties -now fulfilled
by a Prime Minister and a Tibetan Parliament in exile, installed in Dharamsala, India- to focus exclusively on
being a religious and spiritual leader. </p><p><b>Our project: </b><br/></p><p>Thanks to our personal relationship with Thubten Wangchen-la  -who is Deputy of the Tibetan Parliament, an old friend of the Dalai Dama and his representative in part of Europe (Spain, Portugal, France, Germany)- we have guaranteed access to the places and the protagonist of the story we want to tell: <i>Dalai Lama's Tibet: his memories and vision of Tibet after over half a century in exile.</i><br/></p><p>We will visit Tibet and Dharamsala (India) to chat with his holiness. Our photographic journey will interlace conversations with the spiritual leader, to share with the world an up close and personal vision of Tibet.</p><p>Then we will produce a coffee table book, in English and Spanish, and we will donate 1000 copies to the Tibetan Government to create awareness and to help them with the means to generate some funds for the cause. We will also present an exhibition that will open in Barcelona (Spain) where Thubten Wangchen-la is the director of <i>Casa del Tíbet</i>. It is also our intention to bring the exhibition to New York in 2,016. <br/></p><p>

the Dalai Lama approaches his 80th birthday in 2015, this year presents itself as an important moment to
document and explain the here and now of the Tibetan cause. The
dream of a free Tibet has evolved in recent times. Instead of independence,
Tibetans are pursuing political and cultural autonomy within China. It is a
very realistic step for them. One that, without a doubt, has many more
possibilities than the pursue of independence. But for now, the authorities of
the biggest country of the world remain silent. The
fourteen Dalai Lama, authentic leader of the Tibetan people and worldwide
recognized figure, has renounced to his political duties -now fulfilled
by a Prime Minister and a Tibetan Parliament in exile, installed in Dharamsala, India- to focus exclusively on
being a religious and spiritual leader. Our project: Thanks to our personal relationship with Thubten Wangchen-la  -who is Deputy of the Tibetan Parliament, an old friend of the Dalai Dama and his representative in part of Europe (Spain, Portugal, France, Germany)- we have guaranteed access to the places and the protagonist of the story we want to tell: Dalai Lama's Tibet: his memories and vision of Tibet after over half a century in exile.We will visit Tibet and Dharamsala (India) to chat with his holiness. Our photographic journey will interlace conversations with the spiritual leader, to share with the world an up close and personal vision of Tibet.Then we will produce a coffee table book, in English and Spanish, and we will donate 1000 copies to the Tibetan Government to create awareness and to help them with the means to generate some funds for the cause. We will also present an exhibition that will open in Barcelona (Spain) where Thubten Wangchen-la is the director of Casa del Tíbet. It is also our intention to bring the exhibition to New York in 2,016.

El Dalai Lama está próximo a cumplir sus
ochenta años: razón de peso para documentar el aquí y ahora de la causa
tibetana, que hoy por hoy es diferente a
los años pasados. Los tibetanos han renunciado a la independencia y ahora
luchan por tener una autonomía política y cultural dentro de China. Es un paso
muy realista, aunque las autoridades del país más grande del
planeta no se pronuncian. Indudablemente la autonomía tiene mas posibilidades
que la independencia.
Por su parte el Dalai Lama
-autentico líder de los tibetanos y figura de relieve mundial- ha renunciado a
sus cargos políticos, que ahora ejercen un Primer Ministro y un Parlamento
Tibetano en el exilio, instalado en Dharamsala. El XIV Dalai Lama se enfoca
unicamente en ser líder y autoridad religiosa.
El proyecto: un libro y una
exhibición itinerante

</p><p><br/>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">   Everyone likes stories. From way back in human
history, stories, based on real events or entirely imaginary, have
been an integral part of our lives. For example, think about the arts
as we know them today. Each one of the art forms has its own means of
expression, like it is for
example a choreography or a painting. However, no matter how
different those means of expression may be, they all have a common
starting point: they need to have a story to narrate...</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
In your free time, you may like to lose yourself
in a good book or watch a whole new world unfold in front of your
eyes through a film. On the other hand, you may prefer to watch a
series that keeps you in suspense revealing the story bit by bit,
over a series of episodes. Of course, you might as well be one of
those who like to read graphic novels, where the story is drawn on
paper, or those who enjoy the emotional interaction between actor and
spectator that a good theatrical performance has to offer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
I could fill lots of pages with all the ways one can enjoy a story;
however, the bottom line is: We <i>adore </i>them all!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1282108/files/20150309163151-iml_PNG.png?1425943911"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><h1>Our Goal</h1>
<br/>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
We are a group of young people who love all kinds
of art and who are involved themselves in
one or more different art forms. Our idea
might be ambitious, but is also simple: We aim to create a website
which will be used as a “shelter” for any kind of artistic
creation. However, the creators of those projects won’t be just us.
Through the internet, which more than anything else creates access to
things, our work will be given the chance to reach every corner of
the world and attract more people who wish to contribute to this
effort, expanding
this way our
team! This means that, according to their abilities, everyone
involved in this task will be given equal chances of participating in
any kind of artistic project they wish. This way, we will be able to
cultivate our talents, our ideas
will come to life and it will be possible for everyone to get to know
them.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
Our website is structured in a very similar way
with a TV channel’s webpage. Our first project has already started and
is inspired by the combination of different art forms, such as
literature, acting and photography. It is
an online series, but it has some major
differences from a conventional web series.
Just like any regular TV series, the storyline will unfold in a sequential
episode-by-episode fashion. Those episodes, however, <b>won’t
be</b> in audiovisual form, <b>but
in</b><b> written
form</b> (that’s why we will need the
support of reading lovers from all over the world!) and we will call
them <b>chaptisodes</b>
[chapter + episode]. However, we don’t want to present you just a
plain text or something that looks like an e-book. With the tiny
budget we had and borrowed equipment (cameras, tripods, etc.), we
created a trailer and some ""posters"" for the main
characters, as if it was for a regular movie or TV series. Moreover,
we purchased the music track –soundtrack to be– and we designed
the logos for our first series and for our ""channel"". Here you can find our first chaptisode: <a href=""http://www.imlnetwork.com/#!ep01-page1en/c9pv"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.imlnetwork.com/#!ep01-page1en/c9pv</a><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
For a long time, I had
been looking for a way to combine as many
kinds of art as possible and integrate them into the rapidly evolving Internet sector.At
the same time, since I
was involved myself
for several years
with acting and writing,
I was troubled by the pessimism of my peers;
they all seem to be very concerned about
the career opportunities they could have in
the field they want to devote their
lives. I see
every day very talented
people and great ideas to be wasted in amateurish efforts without ever
receiving the
recognition they deserve. Nor the support,
or the budget... So,
after considering it for a long time,
I arrived at the idea
of the ""ImL Network"" (where <b>ImL</b>
= <b>I</b>t's <b>m</b>y

which is the official name of our website!</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1282080/files/20150309162002-VASSILIS_JPG.jpg?1425943202"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><h1>Long-term &amp; Short-term Goals<i> </i>
</h1><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>   1. <i>Short-</i><i>term </i><i>goals:</i></b>
	First of all, (with your kind
	contribution!) we would like to enrich our
	initial project.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">   Our team comes from Greece and the original texts
are written in Greek. Therefore, an important amount of the provided money will be invested in the
translation of the episodes into English, so that our work will be
available to a wider audience. However, in the future we wish to
translate our series’ episodes into as much languages as possible.
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
Furthermore, more money means more actors, who
will incarnate more of the series’ characters for more posters and
videos to be created in the future. Moreover, through funding we will
be able to obtain our own equipment, so
that we can film certain scenes, enriching
this way the initial text.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
Finally, we will be able
to create our <u>own</u>
music, particularly for our series and our channel.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>   2. <i>Long-term </i><i>goals</i>:</b>
We have strong faith in this first series that we’ve created for
you, but we don’t want it to be our one and only, we’re planning
to do a lot more than that!<br/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">   In the future, more people who involve
themselves in
writing will have the chance to join our team, and this way our
channel will have many more new series, to suit all tastes! Some of
them may follow the guidelines of the first (in style and form),
although others might be entirely in an audiovisual form.
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">   People who are interested in music may compose or
sing their own songs (either for the needs of our series or not
necessarily) and we will give them the opportunity to promote their work through our website. Those who are interested
in graphic arts
will have the chance to create a
comic book or graphic novel based on our series, or even create their own
stories around our main characters!
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">   There are endless possibilities! For example,
there may be some local theatrical plays (which will be recorded and
then shown on our website’s
channel), some short -or even feature- films, and any other kind
of art, like dance, photography or even poetry, may
be incorporated into our network. Besides, you –the audience–
will show us our next steps by your own preferences! We consider our
project as a vehicle of art, available to everyone, and we wish to
meet new people who share the same dreams and ambitions with us, to
learn new things, and of course… to create high-quality
entertainment <u>for everyone</u>!</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1282088/files/20150309162533-Hospital_02i.jpg?1425943533"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><h1>Where your money goes:</h1><p><br/></p><p>

<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	To a new computer with high processing power,
	since a well-functioning system unit is essential in order to edit
	all of the network’s photos and videos or any other kind of
	material uploaded to our website.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	To professional filming equipment (digital video
	camera, DSLR camera, microphone, tripod, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	To professional lighting equipment, which is
	needed for low-light and night-time shooting.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	To online -and not only- promotion and
	advertising of our series and our website (e.g. promotional products
	and posters, etc).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	To the maintenance of our website (at least for a
	year). Since we use a website builder,
	which allows us to manage our website exactly the way we want, we
	need to spend an important amount of money per year in order to
	purchase and maintain this domain (<u><a href=""http://www.imlnetwork.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>www.imlnetwork.com</span></a></u>),
	the online storage space and all those beautiful features that make
	our website unique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	To the copyrights registration of all of our network’s texts –in
	each language separately–, photos, music, posters, etc. You might
	think this is a minor expense but… it is certainly not! Anything
	that will be uploaded online for you, needs to be copyrighted first!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	To the people involved (translator, actors,
	photographer, technicians, people who are
	responsible for the video editing and the
	creation of the posters, etc.) that, thanks to their hard work, we
	now have this amazing result to present you. Moreover, in the
	future, we would like to be able to create even more things for you!

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	The transport cost of our team to and from
	Amorgos island, where we’re going to do most of the series’
	shooting, since almost half of our story takes place on this Greek island.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
	Finally, a significant share of the raised funds
	will be invested into accessories (props) and sets
	for our shootings. Apart from the actors’ make up, many times we
	need a lot of other things in order to create the
	characters or the fictional world into which they will act (clothes/costumes,
	wigs, jewelries, etc). Additionally, for shooting both indoors and
	outdoors, we always need to restructure and rearrange the existing
	scenery, to add objects that most of the times need to be bought, if
	we don’t have them already, etc. If we reach our goal, or
	(especially) if we outreach it, we will be able in the future to
	entirely create our own sceneries. This way we could meet our high
	demands and give our audience a more quality result!</p>

Even though till now, most of the people
involved in this project are doing it for absolutely no personal
gain, motivated only by their enthusiasm for the overall concept, we
aim high and we would like our work to be as professional as
possible. Personally, as the creator of the “ImL
Network” project, I strongly believe that if you do something well,
you <b><i>shouldn’t</i> </b>do it for free. So, my purpose is that, in the near
future, the members of my team will receive at least a nominal fee
for all the effort they put into the actualization of this concept.
The funds raised from this campaign will be invested, above all else,
into our technical equipment, and the rest will be given as a small
reward to those who helped me make a dream come true. In the future,
we will try to find some sponsors in order to enlarge our project and
be able to have even more staff. However, we won’t ask our audience
to pay anything in order to read the new “Dream on” episodes, the
future ImL Network’s series or, in general, any other material that
is going to be published and uploaded to our website.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1282097/files/20150309162717-collagelighted.png?1425943637"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>    Here you can find a synopsis of the ""Dream On"" series that was mentioned above which is the first project that came to life on ImLNetwork.com: <a href=""http://www.imlnetwork.com/#!chaptisodes/c218r"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.imlnetwork.com/#!chaptisodes/c218r</a><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1283132/files/20150310034049-dream_on.png?1425984049"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><br/></p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h1>Πρόλογος</h1><p><br/></p><p>

Σε όλους αρέσουν οι ιστορίες. Από πολύ
νωρίς στην πορεία της ανθρωπότητας, οι
ιστορίες, βασισμένες σε αληθινά γεγονότα
ή πέρα ως πέρα φανταστικές, αποτελούν
ένα αναπόσπαστο κομμάτι της ζωής μας.
Παρατηρήστε τις τέχνες όπως τις ξέρουμε
σήμερα. Η κάθε μια από αυτές έχει τα δικά
της μέσα έκφρασης, όπως είναι για
παράδειγμα μια χορογραφία ή ένας πίνακας
ζωγραφικής. Όσο διαφορετικά κι αν είναι,
όμως, αυτά τα μέσα μεταξύ τους, έχουν
όλα ένα κοινό σημείο εκκίνησης: για να
υπάρξουν πρέπει να έχουν μια ιστορία
να διηγηθούν...</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
Στον ελεύθερο χρόνο σου,
μπορεί να σ' αρέσει να χάνεσαι
στον κόσμο ενός καλού βιβλίου ή να τον
βλέπεις να ξετυλίγεται μέσα από μια
κινηματογραφική οθόνη με τη μορφή
ταινίας. Ίσως πάλι να προτιμάς να
παρακολουθείς μια σειρά που σε κρατάει
σε αγωνία, αποκαλύπτοντας την πλοκή της
σε μικρές δόσεις μέσα από επεισόδια.
Μπορεί βέβαια να είσαι κι από αυτούς
που τους αρέσει να διαβάζουν ιστορίες
σχεδιασμένες στο χαρτί σε μορφή κόμικ,
ή από εκείνους που απολαμβάνουν τη
συναισθηματική αλληλεπίδραση μεταξύ
ηθοποιού και θεατή σε μια καλή θεατρική
παράσταση, όπου η ιστορία εκτυλίσσεται
μπροστά στα μάτια σου σε πραγματικό
χρόνο.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
Θα μπορούσα να γεμίσω σελίδες ολόκληρες
με τους τρόπους που μπορεί κανείς να

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
Είμαστε μια ομάδα νέων ανθρώπων που
αγαπάμε όλων των ειδών τις τέχνες και
οι περισσότεροι από εμάς ασχολούμαστε
εδώ και αρκετά χρόνια με μια ή περισσότερες
από αυτές. H ιδέα μας είναι
φιλόδοξη, αλλά απλή: πρόκειται για τη
δημιουργία μιας ιστοσελίδας που θα
λειτουργήσει ως «στέγη» οποιασδήποτε
καλλιτεχνικής μας δημιουργίας. Κι όχι
μόνο δικής μας. Μέσω του διαδικτύου οι
δουλειές μας θα μπορούν να φτάσουν σε
κάθε γωνιά του κόσμου και να προσελκύσουν
κι άλλα άτομα που θέλουν να συμμετάσχουν
σε όλο αυτό, μεγαλώνοντας έτσι την
ομάδα μας! Αυτό συνεπάγεται πως όλοι
όσοι εμπλακούν σ’ αυτή την προσπάθεια,
παλιοί και καινούριοι, θα έχουν όλοι
ευκαιρίες ανάλογες των δυνατοτήτων
τους να συμμετέχουν σε οποιοδήποτε
καλλιτεχνικό project επιθυμούν,
είτε αυτό σχετίζεται άμεσα με το
αντικείμενό τους, είτε όχι. Έτσι, θα μας
δοθεί η ευκαιρία να καλλιεργήσουμε τις
δεξιότητες μας, και οι ιδέες μας θα
αποκτήσουν επιτέλους σάρκα και οστά
και θα είναι διαθέσιμες να τις γνωρίσει
όλος ο κόσμος.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
Η ιστοσελίδα μας είναι στημένη όπως ο
ιστότοπος ενός τηλεοπτικού ή ιντερνετικού
καναλιού. Το πρώτο μας project,
εμπνευσμένο από τη φιλοσοφία του
συνδυασμού διαφορετικών τεχνών, έχει
ήδη ξεκινήσει. Πρόκειται για μια
ιντερνετική σειρά που όμως έχει μεγάλες
διαφορές από ένα κλασικό web
series. Όπως και σε μια
συμβατική τηλεοπτική σειρά, η πλοκή θα
εκτυλίσσεται σε επεισόδια, που <b>όμως
</b>δε θα είναι σε μορφή βίντεο, αλλά σε
<b>γραπτή μορφή </b>(γι’ αυτό και θα
χρειαστούμε την στήριξη των απανταχού
οπαδών της ανάγνωσης!), και τα επεισόδιά
μας από εδώ και πέρα θα τα λέμε <b>chaptisodes</b>
[chapter + episodes].
Ωστόσο, δε θα θέλαμε να αρκεστούμε στην
“ξερή” παράθεση ενός κειμένου. Για το
λόγο, αυτό δημιουργήσαμε “αφίσες” για
τους πιο βασικούς ρόλους, όπως θα γινόταν
σε μια κανονική τηλεοπτική σειρά ή
ταινία, και με το ελάχιστο budget που διαθέταμε και με δανεικό εξοπλισμό (κάμερες,
τρίποδα, κλπ.) δημιουργήσαμε ένα trailer
και τα logos για τη σειρά
μας και το κανάλι μας. Τέλος, αγοράσαμε
και τη μουσική που θα χρησιμοποιηθεί
ως soundtrack. Εδώ μπρείτε να βρείτε το πρώτο μας επεισόδιο: <a href=""http://www.imlnetwork.com/#!ep01-page1gr/c3ly"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.imlnetwork.com/#!ep01-page1gr/c3ly</a><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
Καιρό τώρα έψαχνα έναν τρόπο να συνδυάσω
ένα μεγάλο κομμάτι των τεχνών και να το
ενσωματώσω στον ταχύτατα εξελισσόμενο
χώρο του Διαδικτύου. Παράλληλα,
ασχολούμενος και ο ίδιος για αρκετά
χρόνια με τον χώρο της υποκριτικής και
της συγγραφής, είχε αρχίσει να με
προβληματίζει η απαισιοδοξία των
συνομηλίκων μου -και μη- που καταπιάνονται
με τις τέχνες, και το άγχος για επαγγελματική
αποκατάσταση στον τομέα που ήθελαν να
αφιερώσουν τη ζωή τους. Κάθε μέρα βλέπω
ταλέντα και εξαιρετικές ιδέες να
χαραμίζονται σε ερασιτεχνικές προσπάθειες
χωρίς να λαμβάνουν ποτέ την αναγνώριση
που τους αξίζει. Ή την υποστήριξη, ή το
budget... Κάπως έτσι κατέληξα
στη σύλληψη του “ImL
Network” (<b>ImL</b>
= <b>I</b>t’s
<b>m</b>y <b>L</b>ife),
όπως θα είναι και το όνομα της ιστοσελίδας
μας!</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1283073/files/20150310030615-amalia.jpg?1425981975"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><h1>Άμεσοι &amp; Μακροπρόθεσμοι Στόχοι</h1>

(με την ευγενική συνεισφορά σας!), θα

το αρχικό μας project.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">   
Η ομάδα μας είναι από την Ελλάδα και τα
πρωτότυπα κείμενα είναι γραμμένα στα
ελληνικά. Επομένως, ένα διόλου ευκαταφρόνητο
ποσό των χρημάτων που θα μαζέψουμε θα
επενδυθεί στη μετάφραση των επεισοδίων
στα αγγλικά, έτσι ώστε η δουλειά μας να
είναι διαθέσιμη σε μια ευρύτερη μερίδα
του αναγνωστικού κοινού. Επιθυμία μας
στο μέλλον είναι να μεταφραστούν τα
επεισόδια της σειρές και σε ακόμη
περισσότερες γλώσσες.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">  Επίσης, περισσότερα χρήματα σημαίνει
περισσότεροι ηθοποιοί, οι οποίοι θα
ενσαρκώσουν κι άλλους από τους χαρακτήρες
της σειράς, για νέες αφίσες και κλιπάκια
που θα υπάρξουν στο μέλλον. Ακόμη, με τη
χρηματοδότηση θα έχουμε την άνεση να
αγοράσουμε δικό μας εξοπλισμό, προκειμένου
να γυρίσουμε σε βίντεο κάποιες σκηνές,
εμπλουτίζοντας έτσι το αρχικό κείμενο.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">     Τέλος, θα έχουμε τη δυνατότητα να
δημιουργήσουμε τη δική μας μουσική,

τη δυνατότητα να ενσωματωθούν στην
ομάδα μας κι άλλα άτομα που ασχολούνται
με τη συγγραφή, κι έτσι θα δημιουργήσουμε
περισσότερες σειρές, που θα καλύπτουν
όλα τα γούστα! Κάποιες μπορεί να
ακολουθήσουν το φορμάτ και το στυλ της
πρώτης και κάποιες άλλες να είναι
εξολοκλήρου γυρισμένες σε βίντεο.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">    Άτομα που ασχολούνται με τη μουσική θα
μπορούν να συνθέσουν ή να τραγουδήσουν
τα δικά τους τραγούδια (είτε στο πλαίσιο
της σειράς, είτε όχι) κι εμείς θα τους
δώσουμε, απλώς, την ευκαιρία να προβληθούν
μέσα από το site μας. Άλλοι,
που μπορεί να τους αρέσει το σχέδιο, θα
έχουν τη δυνατότητα να μεταφέρουν σε
comic/ graphic
novel κάποια από τις σειρές
μας ή κάποια ιστορία δικής τους έμπνευσης
με πρωταγωνιστές τα πρόσωπα των ηθοποιών
μας!</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">  Οι δυνατότητες είναι απεριόριστες! Από
θεατρικές παραστάσεις τοπικά (που θα
βιντεοσκοπηθούν και θα προβληθούν
έπειτα στο κανάλι του site
μας) και ταινίες μικρού -και γιατί όχι
και μεγάλου; - μήκους, μέχρι την ενσωμάτωση
της τέχνης του χορού και της φωτογραφίας
ή της ποίησης. Εξάλλου εσείς -το κοινό μας-
θα μας δείξετε με τις προτιμήσεις σας
ποια θέλετε να είναι τα επόμενα βήματά
μας! Θέλουμε το project μας
να αποτελέσει ένα μεγάλο δίαυλο της
τέχνης, σε διάφορες εκφάνσεις της, για
όλο τον κόσμο. Να γνωρίσουμε νέους

<br/></div>","Prologue

   Everyone likes stories. From way back in human
history, stories, based on real events or entirely imaginary, have
been an integral part of our lives. For example, think about the arts
as we know them today. Each one of the art forms has its own means of
expression, like it is for
example a choreography or a painting. However, no matter how
different those means of expression may be, they all have a common
starting point: they need to have a story to narrate...
   
In your free time, you may like to lose yourself
in a good book or watch a whole new world unfold in front of your
eyes through a film. On the other hand, you may prefer to watch a
series that keeps you in suspense revealing the story bit by bit,
over a series of episodes. Of course, you might as well be one of
those who like to read graphic novels, where the story is drawn on
paper, or those who enjoy the emotional interaction between actor and
spectator that a good theatrical performance has to offer.
   
I could fill lots of pages with all the ways one can enjoy a story;
however, the bottom line is: We adore them all!Our Goal

   
We are a group of young people who love all kinds
of art and who are involved themselves in
one or more different art forms. Our idea
might be ambitious, but is also simple: We aim to create a website
which will be used as a “shelter” for any kind of artistic
creation. However, the creators of those projects won’t be just us.
Through the internet, which more than anything else creates access to
things, our work will be given the chance to reach every corner of
the world and attract more people who wish to contribute to this
effort, expanding
this way our
team! This means that, according to their abilities, everyone
involved in this task will be given equal chances of participating in
any kind of artistic project they wish. This way, we will be able to
cultivate our talents, our ideas
will come to life and it will be possible for everyone to get to know
them.
   
Our website is structured in a very similar way
with a TV channel’s webpage. Our first project has already started and
is inspired by the combination of different art forms, such as
literature, acting and photography. It is
an online series, but it has some major
differences from a conventional web series.
Just like any regular TV series, the storyline will unfold in a sequential
episode-by-episode fashion. Those episodes, however, won’t
be in audiovisual form, but
in written
form (that’s why we will need the
support of reading lovers from all over the world!) and we will call
them chaptisodes
[chapter + episode]. However, we don’t want to present you just a
plain text or something that looks like an e-book. With the tiny
budget we had and borrowed equipment (cameras, tripods, etc.), we
created a trailer and some ""posters"" for the main
characters, as if it was for a regular movie or TV series. Moreover,
we purchased the music track –soundtrack to be– and we designed
the logos for our first series and for our ""channel"". Here you can find our first chaptisode: http://www.imlnetwork.com/#!ep01-page1en/c9pv
   
For a long time, I had
been looking for a way to combine as many
kinds of art as possible and integrate them into the rapidly evolving Internet sector.At
the same time, since I
was involved myself
for several years
with acting and writing,
I was troubled by the pessimism of my peers;
they all seem to be very concerned about
the career opportunities they could have in
the field they want to devote their
lives. I see
every day very talented
people and great ideas to be wasted in amateurish efforts without ever
receiving the
recognition they deserve. Nor the support,
or the budget... So,
after considering it for a long time,
I arrived at the idea
of the ""ImL Network"" (where ImL
= It's my
Life),
which is the official name of our website!Long-term & Short-term Goals 
   1. Short-term goals:
	First of all, (with your kind
	contribution!) we would like to enrich our
	initial project.   Our team comes from Greece and the original texts
are written in Greek. Therefore, an important amount of the provided money will be invested in the
translation of the episodes into English, so that our work will be
available to a wider audience. However, in the future we wish to
translate our series’ episodes into as much languages as possible.
   
Furthermore, more money means more actors, who
will incarnate more of the series’ characters for more posters and
videos to be created in the future. Moreover, through funding we will
be able to obtain our own equipment, so
that we can film certain scenes, enriching
this way the initial text.
   
Finally, we will be able
to create our own
music, particularly for our series and our channel.   2. Long-term goals:
We have strong faith in this first series that we’ve created for
you, but we don’t want it to be our one and only, we’re planning
to do a lot more than that!   In the future, more people who involve
themselves in
writing will have the chance to join our team, and this way our
channel will have many more new series, to suit all tastes! Some of
them may follow the guidelines of the first (in style and form),
although others might be entirely in an audiovisual form.
   People who are interested in music may compose or
sing their own songs (either for the needs of our series or not
necessarily) and we will give them the opportunity to promote their work through our website. Those who are interested
in graphic arts
will have the chance to create a
comic book or graphic novel based on our series, or even create their own
stories around our main characters!
   There are endless possibilities! For example,
there may be some local theatrical plays (which will be recorded and
then shown on our website’s
channel), some short -or even feature- films, and any other kind
of art, like dance, photography or even poetry, may
be incorporated into our network. Besides, you –the audience–
will show us our next steps by your own preferences! We consider our
project as a vehicle of art, available to everyone, and we wish to
meet new people who share the same dreams and ambitions with us, to
learn new things, and of course… to create high-quality
entertainment for everyone!Where your money goes:



	To a new computer with high processing power,
	since a well-functioning system unit is essential in order to edit
	all of the network’s photos and videos or any other kind of
	material uploaded to our website.



	To professional filming equipment (digital video
	camera, DSLR camera, microphone, tripod, etc).



	To professional lighting equipment, which is
	needed for low-light and night-time shooting.



	To online -and not only- promotion and
	advertising of our series and our website (e.g. promotional products
	and posters, etc).



	To the maintenance of our website (at least for a
	year). Since we use a website builder,
	which allows us to manage our website exactly the way we want, we
	need to spend an important amount of money per year in order to
	purchase and maintain this domain (www.imlnetwork.com),
	the online storage space and all those beautiful features that make
	our website unique.



	To the copyrights registration of all of our network’s texts –in
	each language separately–, photos, music, posters, etc. You might
	think this is a minor expense but… it is certainly not! Anything
	that will be uploaded online for you, needs to be copyrighted first!



	To the people involved (translator, actors,
	photographer, technicians, people who are
	responsible for the video editing and the
	creation of the posters, etc.) that, thanks to their hard work, we
	now have this amazing result to present you. Moreover, in the
	future, we would like to be able to create even more things for you!
	*



	The transport cost of our team to and from
	Amorgos island, where we’re going to do most of the series’
	shooting, since almost half of our story takes place on this Greek island.



	Finally, a significant share of the raised funds
	will be invested into accessories (props) and sets
	for our shootings. Apart from the actors’ make up, many times we
	need a lot of other things in order to create the
	characters or the fictional world into which they will act (clothes/costumes,
	wigs, jewelries, etc). Additionally, for shooting both indoors and
	outdoors, we always need to restructure and rearrange the existing
	scenery, to add objects that most of the times need to be bought, if
	we don’t have them already, etc. If we reach our goal, or
	(especially) if we outreach it, we will be able in the future to
	entirely create our own sceneries. This way we could meet our high
	demands and give our audience a more quality result!


   *
Even though till now, most of the people
involved in this project are doing it for absolutely no personal
gain, motivated only by their enthusiasm for the overall concept, we
aim high and we would like our work to be as professional as
possible. Personally, as the creator of the “ImL
Network” project, I strongly believe that if you do something well,
you shouldn’t do it for free. So, my purpose is that, in the near
future, the members of my team will receive at least a nominal fee
for all the effort they put into the actualization of this concept.
The funds raised from this campaign will be invested, above all else,
into our technical equipment, and the rest will be given as a small
reward to those who helped me make a dream come true. In the future,
we will try to find some sponsors in order to enlarge our project and
be able to have even more staff. However, we won’t ask our audience
to pay anything in order to read the new “Dream on” episodes, the
future ImL Network’s series or, in general, any other material that
is going to be published and uploaded to our website.    Here you can find a synopsis of the ""Dream On"" series that was mentioned above which is the first project that came to life on ImLNetwork.com: http://www.imlnetwork.com/#!chaptisodes/c218r------------------------------------------------------------------Πρόλογος
   
Σε όλους αρέσουν οι ιστορίες. Από πολύ
νωρίς στην πορεία της ανθρωπότητας, οι
ιστορίες, βασισμένες σε αληθινά γεγονότα
ή πέρα ως πέρα φανταστικές, αποτελούν
ένα αναπόσπαστο κομμάτι της ζωής μας.
Παρατηρήστε τις τέχνες όπως τις ξέρουμε
σήμερα. Η κάθε μια από αυτές έχει τα δικά
της μέσα έκφρασης, όπως είναι για
παράδειγμα μια χορογραφία ή ένας πίνακας
ζωγραφικής. Όσο διαφορετικά κι αν είναι,
όμως, αυτά τα μέσα μεταξύ τους, έχουν
όλα ένα κοινό σημείο εκκίνησης: για να
υπάρξουν πρέπει να έχουν μια ιστορία
να διηγηθούν...
   
Στον ελεύθερο χρόνο σου,
μπορεί να σ' αρέσει να χάνεσαι
στον κόσμο ενός καλού βιβλίου ή να τον
βλέπεις να ξετυλίγεται μέσα από μια
κινηματογραφική οθόνη με τη μορφή
ταινίας. Ίσως πάλι να προτιμάς να
παρακολουθείς μια σειρά που σε κρατάει
σε αγωνία, αποκαλύπτοντας την πλοκή της
σε μικρές δόσεις μέσα από επεισόδια.
Μπορεί βέβαια να είσαι κι από αυτούς
που τους αρέσει να διαβάζουν ιστορίες
σχεδιασμένες στο χαρτί σε μορφή κόμικ,
ή από εκείνους που απολαμβάνουν τη
συναισθηματική αλληλεπίδραση μεταξύ
ηθοποιού και θεατή σε μια καλή θεατρική
παράσταση, όπου η ιστορία εκτυλίσσεται
μπροστά στα μάτια σου σε πραγματικό
χρόνο.
   
Θα μπορούσα να γεμίσω σελίδες ολόκληρες
με τους τρόπους που μπορεί κανείς να
απολαύσει μια ιστορία, αλλά η ουσία
είναι μία: Εμάς μας αρέσουν όλοι!Το Όραμά μας

   
Είμαστε μια ομάδα νέων ανθρώπων που
αγαπάμε όλων των ειδών τις τέχνες και
οι περισσότεροι από εμάς ασχολούμαστε
εδώ και αρκετά χρόνια με μια ή περισσότερες
από αυτές. H ιδέα μας είναι
φιλόδοξη, αλλά απλή: πρόκειται για τη
δημιουργία μιας ιστοσελίδας που θα
λειτουργήσει ως «στέγη» οποιασδήποτε
καλλιτεχνικής μας δημιουργίας. Κι όχι
μόνο δικής μας. Μέσω του διαδικτύου οι
δουλειές μας θα μπορούν να φτάσουν σε
κάθε γωνιά του κόσμου και να προσελκύσουν
κι άλλα άτομα που θέλουν να συμμετάσχουν
σε όλο αυτό, μεγαλώνοντας έτσι την
ομάδα μας! Αυτό συνεπάγεται πως όλοι
όσοι εμπλακούν σ’ αυτή την προσπάθεια,
παλιοί και καινούριοι, θα έχουν όλοι
ευκαιρίες ανάλογες των δυνατοτήτων
τους να συμμετέχουν σε οποιοδήποτε
καλλιτεχνικό project επιθυμούν,
είτε αυτό σχετίζεται άμεσα με το
αντικείμενό τους, είτε όχι. Έτσι, θα μας
δοθεί η ευκαιρία να καλλιεργήσουμε τις
δεξιότητες μας, και οι ιδέες μας θα
αποκτήσουν επιτέλους σάρκα και οστά
και θα είναι διαθέσιμες να τις γνωρίσει
όλος ο κόσμος.
   
Η ιστοσελίδα μας είναι στημένη όπως ο
ιστότοπος ενός τηλεοπτικού ή ιντερνετικού
καναλιού. Το πρώτο μας project,
εμπνευσμένο από τη φιλοσοφία του
συνδυασμού διαφορετικών τεχνών, έχει
ήδη ξεκινήσει. Πρόκειται για μια
ιντερνετική σειρά που όμως έχει μεγάλες
διαφορές από ένα κλασικό web
series. Όπως και σε μια
συμβατική τηλεοπτική σειρά, η πλοκή θα
εκτυλίσσεται σε επεισόδια, που όμως
δε θα είναι σε μορφή βίντεο, αλλά σε
γραπτή μορφή (γι’ αυτό και θα
χρειαστούμε την στήριξη των απανταχού
οπαδών της ανάγνωσης!), και τα επεισόδιά
μας από εδώ και πέρα θα τα λέμε chaptisodes
[chapter + episodes].
Ωστόσο, δε θα θέλαμε να αρκεστούμε στην
“ξερή” παράθεση ενός κειμένου. Για το
λόγο, αυτό δημιουργήσαμε “αφίσες” για
τους πιο βασικούς ρόλους, όπως θα γινόταν
σε μια κανονική τηλεοπτική σειρά ή
ταινία, και με το ελάχιστο budget που διαθέταμε και με δανεικό εξοπλισμό (κάμερες,
τρίποδα, κλπ.) δημιουργήσαμε ένα trailer
και τα logos για τη σειρά
μας και το κανάλι μας. Τέλος, αγοράσαμε
και τη μουσική που θα χρησιμοποιηθεί
ως soundtrack. Εδώ μπρείτε να βρείτε το πρώτο μας επεισόδιο: http://www.imlnetwork.com/#!ep01-page1gr/c3ly
   
Καιρό τώρα έψαχνα έναν τρόπο να συνδυάσω
ένα μεγάλο κομμάτι των τεχνών και να το
ενσωματώσω στον ταχύτατα εξελισσόμενο
χώρο του Διαδικτύου. Παράλληλα,
ασχολούμενος και ο ίδιος για αρκετά
χρόνια με τον χώρο της υποκριτικής και
της συγγραφής, είχε αρχίσει να με
προβληματίζει η απαισιοδοξία των
συνομηλίκων μου -και μη- που καταπιάνονται
με τις τέχνες, και το άγχος για επαγγελματική
αποκατάσταση στον τομέα που ήθελαν να
αφιερώσουν τη ζωή τους. Κάθε μέρα βλέπω
ταλέντα και εξαιρετικές ιδέες να
χαραμίζονται σε ερασιτεχνικές προσπάθειες
χωρίς να λαμβάνουν ποτέ την αναγνώριση
που τους αξίζει. Ή την υποστήριξη, ή το
budget... Κάπως έτσι κατέληξα
στη σύλληψη του “ImL
Network” (ImL
= It’s
my Life),
όπως θα είναι και το όνομα της ιστοσελίδας
μας!Άμεσοι & Μακροπρόθεσμοι Στόχοι

   
1. Άμεσοι στόχοι: Πρώτα απ’ όλα
(με την ευγενική συνεισφορά σας!), θα
θέλαμε να βρούμε τρόπους να εμπλουτίσουμε
το αρχικό μας project.
   
Η ομάδα μας είναι από την Ελλάδα και τα
πρωτότυπα κείμενα είναι γραμμένα στα
ελληνικά. Επομένως, ένα διόλου ευκαταφρόνητο
ποσό των χρημάτων που θα μαζέψουμε θα
επενδυθεί στη μετάφραση των επεισοδίων
στα αγγλικά, έτσι ώστε η δουλειά μας να
είναι διαθέσιμη σε μια ευρύτερη μερίδα
του αναγνωστικού κοινού. Επιθυμία μας
στο μέλλον είναι να μεταφραστούν τα
επεισόδια της σειρές και σε ακόμη
περισσότερες γλώσσες.
  Επίσης, περισσότερα χρήματα σημαίνει
περισσότεροι ηθοποιοί, οι οποίοι θα
ενσαρκώσουν κι άλλους από τους χαρακτήρες
της σειράς, για νέες αφίσες και κλιπάκια
που θα υπάρξουν στο μέλλον. Ακόμη, με τη
χρηματοδότηση θα έχουμε την άνεση να
αγοράσουμε δικό μας εξοπλισμό, προκειμένου
να γυρίσουμε σε βίντεο κάποιες σκηνές,
εμπλουτίζοντας έτσι το αρχικό κείμενο.
     Τέλος, θα έχουμε τη δυνατότητα να
δημιουργήσουμε τη δική μας μουσική,
ειδικά για τη σειρά και το κανάλι μας.
       2. Μακροπρόθεσμοι στόχοι: Πιστεύουμε
πολύ στην πρώτη αυτή σειρά που έχουμε
ετοιμάσει για εσάς, αλλά δε θέλουμε να
μείνουμε μόνο εκεί! Στο μέλλον θα έχουν
τη δυνατότητα να ενσωματωθούν στην
ομάδα μας κι άλλα άτομα που ασχολούνται
με τη συγγραφή, κι έτσι θα δημιουργήσουμε
περισσότερες σειρές, που θα καλύπτουν
όλα τα γούστα! Κάποιες μπορεί να
ακολουθήσουν το φορμάτ και το στυλ της
πρώτης και κάποιες άλλες να είναι
εξολοκλήρου γυρισμένες σε βίντεο.
    Άτομα που ασχολούνται με τη μουσική θα
μπορούν να συνθέσουν ή να τραγουδήσουν
τα δικά τους τραγούδια (είτε στο πλαίσιο
της σειράς, είτε όχι) κι εμείς θα τους
δώσουμε, απλώς, την ευκαιρία να προβληθούν
μέσα από το site μας. Άλλοι,
που μπορεί να τους αρέσει το σχέδιο, θα
έχουν τη δυνατότητα να μεταφέρουν σε
comic/ graphic
novel κάποια από τις σειρές
μας ή κάποια ιστορία δικής τους έμπνευσης
με πρωταγωνιστές τα πρόσωπα των ηθοποιών
μας!
  Οι δυνατότητες είναι απεριόριστες! Από
θεατρικές παραστάσεις τοπικά (που θα
βιντεοσκοπηθούν και θα προβληθούν
έπειτα στο κανάλι του site
μας) και ταινίες μικρού -και γιατί όχι
και μεγάλου; - μήκους, μέχρι την ενσωμάτωση
της τέχνης του χορού και της φωτογραφίας
ή της ποίησης. Εξάλλου εσείς -το κοινό μας-
θα μας δείξετε με τις προτιμήσεις σας
ποια θέλετε να είναι τα επόμενα βήματά
μας! Θέλουμε το project μας
να αποτελέσει ένα μεγάλο δίαυλο της
τέχνης, σε διάφορες εκφάνσεις της, για
όλο τον κόσμο. Να γνωρίσουμε νέους
ανθρώπους με παρόμοιες φιλοδοξίες, να
μάθουμε καινούρια πράγματα, και φυσικά...
να δημιουργήσουμε ποιοτική ψυχαγωγία
για όλους!Πώς θα χρησιμοποιηθούν τα χρήματα που συνεισφέρετε



	Σε έναν καλό υπολογιστή, με τον οποίο
	θα μπορούμε να επεξεργαζόμαστε τα
	βίντεο και τις φωτογραφίες του network
	ή οποιοδήποτε άλλο υλικό για την ιστοσελίδα μας.



	Σε πιο επαγγελματικό εξοπλισμό, όσον
	αφορά τις λήψεις μας (κάμερα, φωτογραφική
	μηχανή DSLR, μικρόφωνα,
	τρίποδο, κ.λπ.).



	Σε επαγγελματικό φωτισμό για λήψεις
	σε εσωτερικούς χώρους ή βραδινές λήψεις
	σε εξωτερικούς χώρους.



	Στην προβολή και διαφήμιση της σειράς
	και γενικότερα στην προώθηση του
	ιστοτόπου μας μέσω Internet,
	αλλά και εκτός αυτού (προωθητικές
	αφίσες, διαφημιστικά αντικείμενα/δώρα
	κ.λπ.).



	Στη συντήρηση του ιστοτόπου μας (τουλάχιστον για ένα έτος). Εφόσον
	χρησιμοποιούμε έναν πάροχο, ο οποίος
	μας επιτρέπει να διαχειριζόμαστε
	εξολοκλήρου μόνοι μας την ιστοσελίδα
	μας, θα πρέπει να ξοδεύουμε ετησίως ένα
	σεβαστό ποσό για την αγορά και τη
	διατήρηση του domain
	(www.imlnetwork.com),
	για τον online αποθηκευτικό
	χώρο και για όλα εκείνα τα όμορφα
	χαρακτηριστικά που κάνουν τον ιστότοπό
	μας να ξεχωρίζει.



	Στην εξασφάλιση των πνευματικών
	δικαιωμάτων του υλικού μας. Μπορεί σε
	κάποιους να φαίνεται μικρό έξοδο,
	αρχικά, αλλά... σίγουρα δεν είναι!
	Οτιδήποτε ανεβαίνει online
	για εσάς (κείμενα, φωτογραφίες, μουσική,
	αφίσες) θα πρέπει πρώτα να το έχουμε
	κατοχυρώσει!



	Στο ανθρώπινο δυναμικό (μεταφράστρια,
	ηθοποιοί, τεχνικοί, επεξεργασία βίντεο
	και αφισών/ φωτογραφιών κ.λπ.) που, χάρη
	στη σκληρή δουλειά του, έχουμε σήμερα
	αυτό το αποτέλεσμα να σας παρουσιάσουμε.
	Επίσης, στο μέλλον, θα έχουμε τη δυνατότητα
	να δημιουργήσουμε ακόμη περισσότερο
	υλικό για εσάς! *



	Στα έξοδα για τη μετακίνηση της ομάδας
	μας από και προς το νησί της Αμοργού,
	στο οποίο θα γίνονται οι φωτογραφήσεις
	και τα γυρίσματα για ένα μεγάλο μέρος
	της σειράς, μιας και το 50% περίπου της
	ιστορίας διαδραματίζεται σε αυτό το ελληνικό νησί.



	Τέλος, ένα σημαντικό μέρος των χρημάτων
	που θα μαζέψουμε, θα επενδυθεί σε
	αξεσουάρ (props) και στα
	σκηνικά των γυρισμάτων μας. Πέραν του
	μακιγιάζ των ηθοποιών, πολλές φορές,
	υπάρχουν κι άλλα πράγματα που μας
	βοηθούν να δημιουργήσουμε τους χαρακτήρες
	τους και τον κόσμο μέσα στον οποίο δρουν
	(ρούχα, περούκες, κοσμήματα, αξεσουάρ
	κ.λπ.). Επίσης, είτε κάνουμε γυρίσματα
	σε εσωτερικό, είτε σε εξωτερικό χώρο,
	πάντα είναι απαραίτητη η παρέμβασή μας
	(αναδιάταξη, προσθήκη αντικειμένων που
	πολλές φορές πρέπει να αγοραστούν
	κ.λπ.). Αν πετύχουμε τον στόχο μας, ή
	(κυρίως) αν τον ξεπεράσουμε, θα έχουμε
	τη δυνατότητα στο μέλλον κάποια σκηνικά
	να τα φτιάξουμε σχεδόν από το μηδέν,
	για να ανταποκρίνονται καλύτερα στις
	υψηλές απαιτήσεις που έχουμε από το
	αποτέλεσμα της δουλειάς μας, ώστε να είναι
	πάντα ποιοτικό για το κοινό μας!



      * Αν
και μέχρι τη στιγμή που ξεκίνησε αυτή
η καμπάνια, οι περισσότεροι άνθρωποι
που εμπλέκονται στο στήσιμο του project,
το έκαναν τελείως αφιλοκερδώς και από
ενθουσιασμό για την όλη ιδέα, στοχεύουμε
ψηλά και θα θέλαμε η δουλειά μας να είναι
επαγγελματικού επιπέδου. Προσωπικά,
σαν εμπνευστής της ιδέας του ImL
Network, ενστερνίζομαι απόλυτα
την άποψη πως, αν κάνεις κάτι καλά, δεν
θα πρέπει να το κάνεις δωρεάν. Έτσι,
σκοπός μου είναι, στο άμεσο μέλλον, τα
μέλη της ομάδας μου να παίρνουν μια
αμοιβή, έστω και συμβολική, για τον κόπο
και την προσπάθεια που καταβάλλουν. Οι
πόροι, λοιπόν, που θα εξασφαλίσουμε από αυτήν
την καμπάνια, θα επενδυθούν πρωτίστως
σε τεχνικό εξοπλισμό και δευτερευόντως
σαν μια ελάχιστη ανταμοιβή στους
ανθρώπους που με βοήθησαν να κάνω ένα
όνειρο πραγματικότητα. Μελλοντικά θα
φροντίσουμε να βρούμε χορηγούς για να
μεγαλώσουμε το project μας
και να μπορούμε να απασχολήσουμε ακόμα
περισσότερο προσωπικό, όμως δεν πρόκειται
να ζητήσουμε από το κοινό μας να πληρώσει
για να διαβάσει τα επεισόδια του “Dream

του ImL Network

interculturelle sous le thème «Entre deux cultures», qui vise à rassembler des jeunes Québécois adoptés ou
métissés avec des immigrants pour faire un projet de création artistique sous forme
des mosaïques pour exprimer leur identité culturelle.
L’aide précieuse que vous nous
apporterez permettra d’offrir 8 ateliers de mosaïque aux jeunes adoptés ou métissés
de la région Bas-Saint-Laurent, ainsi que la réalisation d’un film documentaire
avec une vidéaste professionnelle.
Pour la production de cette

artist and Haida Elder. </p>
<p>Although
Davidson’s vision is deeply rooted in tradition, he strives to push boundaries
of representation and art-making to what he considers a universal artistic
experience. Many of his works lean close to abstraction while showing deep
respect for traditional Haida artistic expression and it is in this balanced
intersection that we see the significance of the progression of form.</p>
<p>Visitors
will be given an appreciation of the work in the space as well as of Davidson’s
traditional carvings, jewellery making, totems and significant contribution to
Haida song, dance and ceremony––all integral to his artistic and life
journey. </p>

It's an honor I feel cannot refuse and not be part of the finalists show. The exhibition will be held in April at  Arte Borgo Gallery in Roma, Italy.</p><div>
<p>It's the first time I will be shipping a very large piece of art overseas and I cannot do it without you. </p>
<p>Your contribution will help to ship my painting White01 to the gallery in Italy.</p>
<p>Due to its size, the painting is considered freight, which is more costly. I checked several carriers and I found a broker in Italy that will handle the shipment from my door to the gallery. The door to door transport would cost $730.00, duties and customs fees included.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this does not include the price of the box.  They will have to build a custom box directly around my painting. The cost of the custom box + cushion and bubble wrapping is   $90.00.</p>
<p>Any extra assistance would be very welcome as this would help for the return costs.</p>
<p>It would be wonderful to have a painting in Italy. I believe to be part of the exhibition of the finalists would help to make my art known overseas and bring me more opportunities in the future.</p>
<p>If you would like to support my work and help me with the freight costs,  I will be forever grateful.</p>

</div></div>","I'm a French artist living in Savannah, GA. I have been selected to be part of the finalists of the Fomenar prize 2016. It's an honor I feel cannot refuse and not be part of the finalists show. The exhibition will be held in April at  Arte Borgo Gallery in Roma, Italy.
It's the first time I will be shipping a very large piece of art overseas and I cannot do it without you. 
Your contribution will help to ship my painting White01 to the gallery in Italy.
Due to its size, the painting is considered freight, which is more costly. I checked several carriers and I found a broker in Italy that will handle the shipment from my door to the gallery. The door to door transport would cost $730.00, duties and customs fees included.
Unfortunately, this does not include the price of the box.  They will have to build a custom box directly around my painting. The cost of the custom box + cushion and bubble wrapping is   $90.00.
Any extra assistance would be very welcome as this would help for the return costs.
It would be wonderful to have a painting in Italy. I believe to be part of the exhibition of the finalists would help to make my art known overseas and bring me more opportunities in the future.
If you would like to support my work and help me with the freight costs,  I will be forever grateful.
 

Check my work on my website: www.axellekiefferart.com

What you get:
$5.00 Postcards:
$15.00 Notebook: you have the choice between three different artworks: Disintegration (upper left), Portrait in crimson (middle) and Untitled IX (lower left). I only have 2 Disintegration, 2 Untitled IX and 1 Portrait in Crimson left.

<p><strong>The project</strong></p>
<p>To celebrate Canada's 150th, we, artists <a href=""http://alisongrapes.weebly.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Alison Grapes</a>  and <a href=""http://carolloeb.weebly.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Carol Loeb, </a>are traveling along the Trans-Canada Highway from coast to coast, stopping every 150 Km to find the subject and inspiration for a painting. Over the nearly 7500 km of the highway from St. John's, Newfoundland to Victoria, British Columbia, we'll pass through all 10 provinces of Canada and produce a series of 104 paintings, 52 each. The project will document the country as it reaches its sesquicentennial, portraying life along the only road that ties it together from coast to coast.</p>
<p>We're excited to show our country, from coast to coast, at this milestone in the nation's history. Both mundane, everyday scenes of life along the road and the stunning vistas for which the country is famous will figure prominently. Stopping every 150 km, no matter where that spot might be, forces us to look closely at what is there. The challenge of finding inspiration in urban, rural, or wild natural locations leads us to create a more complete picture of the landscape of Canada.</p>
<p>For an even more complete view of the country, we invite you to join us as an artist, no matter your age or artistic ability. Go to one of our stops (see the <a href=""http://transcan150xtwo.weebly.com/itinerary--maps.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website for locations and more information</a>), find your inspiration, and submit a digital image of your artwork for inclusion on the website and in our 2018 exhibition. We want this to be a project both for and by Canadians, and the more people who join in, the better. Add your view of Canada at 150.</p>
<p>We'll be exhibiting all of the paintings done to date in a public launch of the project at the <a href=""http://www.artagallery.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arta Gallery</a> in Toronto's <a href=""http://www.thedistillerydistrict.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Distillery District</a> over Canada Day, from 28 June to 4 July 2017. Over the next year we'll cover the remaining sections of the highway, culminating in another exhibition at the Arta Gallery for Canada Day 2018, the end of the 150th year celebrations. Your works can be submitted throughout the year for inclusion in the 2018 show. We hope to take the exhibition on tour afterwards so that people across the country can see and share in the project.</p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>We've already completed a third of the paintings in the project, but we need your help to continue. All donations of any amount are welcome, and we've made some great perks available for you as thanks for supporting the project. Sponsor a portion of the trip for $0.53 per kilometer, or $80 per 150 Km leg. Show your pride in Canada with a project T-shirt on Canada Day. Help us get our paintings framed professionally, or just share the project with your friends.</p>
<p>A portion of proceeds from eventual sales will go to support visual arts programs for kids across Canada. As art teachers who have taught in five provinces over the last 30 years, we feel strongly that the arts are a vital part of our culture and that all kids deserve to have art in their lives. The more successful this project is, the more we can help.</p>
<p>Share the project with your friends. Get involved and create some art. <a href=""http://transcan150xtwo.weebly.com/contact.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Contact us</a> with your thoughts.

<h3>Bringing Bands To Boston</h3>
<p>Our benefit for the fest got shut down by the cops (<i>ACAB!</i>) so we need to raise more money to make available to bands traveling to Boston for the fest. We as organizers acknowledge the importance to support our community members, and the particular financial difficulties queer, poc, and differently abled folk may face during travel. However, we cannot do this ourselves. </p>
<p>To do this we are printing t-shirts designed by one of our organizers. Don't miss out on your chance to get your hands on this year's shirt design and help ensure that we can bring some really sick bands up for the fest!                                     </p>

Lower Leg is the Westernized name of an Egyptian hieroglyph that looks like a leg or a foot. The hieroglyph stands for the English letter ‘B’; you see, I’m also known as Bella. My full birth name is<i> Isabella India Holmes Zoltak</i>, but if we’re being honest, no one will remember that. I’ve been diligently making art over the last several years, primarily focusing on creating bright, colorful, avant-garde faces. During this time I made the conscious decision that I wanted to be an artist, “when I grow up"". In order to bring this goal into fruition, I've started this campaign to give my work a larger platform, and make my dream a reality.</p><h3>What is ""Let's Face It""?</h3><p>""Let's Face It"" is my most recent collection. It is a series of faces drawn from my imagination, paired with words that I felt called to share. The faces are bright, colorful, innocent, and abstract with surrealistic, exotic features. When I create faces I follow the basic guidelines that I know (eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, etc.) and then I add my own finesse.</p><p>This collection was especially inspired by my move to Maui, Hawaii. I came to the island on vacation and found that I didn’t want to leave; I stayed and created a new life for myself. The faces in the collection came out as I wrestled with the ups and downs of relocating 4,000 miles away from everything I knew. The words I paired with the faces were extremely relevant topics as I settled into my new home and new state of being.</p><p>Surrounded by fresh faces, I couldn’t help but look and become inspired. There is something beautifully telling in a person's face. I am especially drawn to eyes as most of us are. They are often seen as windows into a person's soul. Of course, a face is much more than just eyes. A face is the forefront of a person's presentation.</p><h3>What are the Products?</h3><p>The original pieces were made with multiple medias; gouache, pencil, marker, and pen on paper. I took each piece, cut it out with an X-ACTO knife, adhered it to black glitter paper, and framed it. I went on to create prints and stickers of the faces. For the prints, I settled on matte card stock paper with a thin (yet sturdy) backing and clear sleeves to present the prints in. For the stickers, I met with a local graphic printer (<a href=""http://www.phatdigitaldesign.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.phatdigitaldesign.com</a>) who specializes in stickers. We settled on creating stickers in both large (4-1/2""x 6"") and small (2-1/2""x 1-3/4"") sizes. The material is vinyl, two-ply, and UV resistant, making them great for indoor and outdoor use without fading or peeling.</p><h3>Where is the Money Going?</h3><p>The money from this campaign will go towards creating more (stickers and prints), website cost (SquareSpace), getting an LLC, and advertising on social media (Facebook, Instagram, Google).</p><p>If I am not able to generate the full $3,000...<i>Knock on wood</i>...I am willing to scale down on quantity of products and brand build-up until I can reach this goal, but will not lower the level of quality.</p><h3>Perks!</h3><ul>

Therefore, HALA FiX cannot become a reality without help from the community.</p><p>The total worth of the <strong>development project is more than 120,000 dollars</strong> and the main lines of investment and financing go towards:</p><p>- heating, thermal insulation and hydro insulation systems, that cost <strong>44,674 dollars</strong>;</p><p>- truss and stage technique: first of all, we will be needing a truss for the lighting equipments, that should cover the entire space. Moreover, we will have to purchase wireless microphones, lanyard microphones and headsets that would ensure artists’ mobility on stage, when needed. Last but not least, we’ll be needing dimmers, cables and a lighting control panel. All in all, based on the offers we have received so far, this segment requires an investment of about <strong>59,100 dollars</strong>.</p><p>- a professional sound system: a fully-equipped, professional sound system that would respond to the needs of our space, is worth about <strong>17,700 dollars</strong>, according to the research we did.</p><p>￼<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512572525/xxy0hcnpiqom8h9sobp1.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>In spite of the numbers, winter is coming, so we decided to prioritize our needs and the most pressing one is to have a heated venue.</strong> So, if you believe in our project and you want to support us, you should know that we’re in urgent need of heating and insulation. A heating system as well as thermal and hydro insulation would allow us to use the space even in those times when the weather is rather unfriendly.</p><p><strong>Thermal insulation entails the replacement of all the windows in the venue</strong>. The old structure is more than 40 years old and is made up of concrete grids and glass and many of the windows are broken. In order to thermally insulate the building, we need 30 panels of PVC joinery. The cost of a single panel varies from 257.35 dollars to 599.97 dollars, depending on dimension and placement. For a total surface of 225 m2, <strong>the overall costs of purchase and fitting go as high as 17,255 dollars</strong>.</p><p>Hydro-insulation is pretty similar, in terms of technicalities. At the moment, the ceiling is covered with glass fibre and metal structures that are decades old. They were, of course, affected by the passage of time and by the fact that the space hasn’t been used in more than 10 years. Consequently, rain, wind and snow often make their presence felt indoors as well. In order to solve this problem, <strong>400 square meters of glass fiber panels will have to be replaced with hydro-insulating panels</strong>. A single square meter of such panels costs 18.32 dollars. Therefore, a system that would ensure <strong>complete insulation from bad weather and water infiltrations is around 7328 dollars</strong>.</p><p>Additionally, since our space will be hosting a variety of events that require a good sound quality, it needs to be phonically insulated. The system we are considering consists of layers of thick fabric disposed around the ceiling that would ensure a better dispersion of the sound and that would eliminate the echo effect of such a large venue. For one of the theatre rooms and the event hall, <strong>phonic insulation costs around 2363.70 dollars, including effective cost of materials and fitting</strong>.</p><p>Last but not least, given the dimensions of HALA FiX and the fact that the winter is getting closer and closer, <strong>a heating structure is absolutely vital to us</strong>. We want to opt for high-power fans with a thermal capacity over 300 kW. We’re still in the projection phase but we estimate that <strong>the</strong> <strong>cost of the necessary materials and equipments is at least 17727.75 dollars</strong>.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512571367/j0g4rveomshpsm1uwvzr.png"" src=""""/></p><p>In short,we have great plans for HALA FiX. We want it to be rain-free and cold-free and we can’t do that without your help!

We have also hosted tens of independent productions, various workshops and concerts and over 14,000 people experienced Teatru FiX firsthand.Our team grew and strengthened in the past five years and it currently numbers about ten people, not counting the volunteers who work with us and support us. At the same, we worked with more than 25 independent actors in Iasi, actors who remained in the FiX family. We support independent artists, their work and ideas. Invest in us to invest in them! What is our aim? The purpose of the HALA FiX project is to contribute to the development of independent theatre and culture. We hope to achieve this purpose by creating a free expression art space for independent artists, inside the community and for the community.Through our project we want to:- develop a venue that is unique by size, location and use;- revitalise an industrial area that’s currently of low interest for the community and turn it into a regenerative cultural core;- bring independent national and international productions and artists to Iasi, with the possibility of reducing some of the costs through our own structures ( for example, accommodation and meal costs);- develop a network of partners and collaborators with other independent structures across Romania, Europe and the USA;- create and support a stable and self-sustainable local community of independent artists. Practically, as far as facilities and spatial partitioning are concerned, HALA FiX will have:- two multifunctional black-box theatre rooms, of 150 and respectively 250 m2;- a workplace for decor building;- two workshop rooms;- a coffee shop/ exhibition space of 150 m2;- a 600 m2 concert hall;- a closed circuit accommodation structure;- a 150 m2 catering structure;- a 160 m2 terrace. Why and how could you help us? For our team, everything that has been done so far represented a superhuman effort that channelled all of the resources we could find. For all that is about to be done, we need help. The project we bring forward is a bold one and it’s aimed at the community. Therefore, HALA FiX cannot become a reality without help from the community.The total worth of the development project is more than 120,000 dollars and the main lines of investment and financing go towards:- heating, thermal insulation and hydro insulation systems, that cost 44,674 dollars;- truss and stage technique: first of all, we will be needing a truss for the lighting equipments, that should cover the entire space. Moreover, we will have to purchase wireless microphones, lanyard microphones and headsets that would ensure artists’ mobility on stage, when needed. Last but not least, we’ll be needing dimmers, cables and a lighting control panel. All in all, based on the offers we have received so far, this segment requires an investment of about 59,100 dollars.- a professional sound system: a fully-equipped, professional sound system that would respond to the needs of our space, is worth about 17,700 dollars, according to the research we did.￼In spite of the numbers, winter is coming, so we decided to prioritize our needs and the most pressing one is to have a heated venue. So, if you believe in our project and you want to support us, you should know that we’re in urgent need of heating and insulation. A heating system as well as thermal and hydro insulation would allow us to use the space even in those times when the weather is rather unfriendly.Thermal insulation entails the replacement of all the windows in the venue. The old structure is more than 40 years old and is made up of concrete grids and glass and many of the windows are broken. In order to thermally insulate the building, we need 30 panels of PVC joinery. The cost of a single panel varies from 257.35 dollars to 599.97 dollars, depending on dimension and placement. For a total surface of 225 m2, the overall costs of purchase and fitting go as high as 17,255 dollars.Hydro-insulation is pretty similar, in terms of technicalities. At the moment, the ceiling is covered with glass fibre and metal structures that are decades old. They were, of course, affected by the passage of time and by the fact that the space hasn’t been used in more than 10 years. Consequently, rain, wind and snow often make their presence felt indoors as well. In order to solve this problem, 400 square meters of glass fiber panels will have to be replaced with hydro-insulating panels. A single square meter of such panels costs 18.32 dollars. Therefore, a system that would ensure complete insulation from bad weather and water infiltrations is around 7328 dollars.Additionally, since our space will be hosting a variety of events that require a good sound quality, it needs to be phonically insulated. The system we are considering consists of layers of thick fabric disposed around the ceiling that would ensure a better dispersion of the sound and that would eliminate the echo effect of such a large venue. For one of the theatre rooms and the event hall, phonic insulation costs around 2363.70 dollars, including effective cost of materials and fitting.Last but not least, given the dimensions of HALA FiX and the fact that the winter is getting closer and closer, a heating structure is absolutely vital to us. We want to opt for high-power fans with a thermal capacity over 300 kW. We’re still in the projection phase but we estimate that the cost of the necessary materials and equipments is at least 17727.75 dollars.In short,we have great plans for HALA FiX. We want it to be rain-free and cold-free and we can’t do that without your help! We made the first step in this direction by bringing to HALA FiX more than 300 people who wholeheartedly answered our call. They supported us in filming the first episode of our story and you could support us in making the entire series. WE HAVE THE CROWD!

<p>Short Summary and the Impact</p>
<p>My name is Kay HE. I am a composer. I am a video artist. I am a pianist. I am a photographer. I am a painter. I am a teacher. I am a new-fashioned Chinese. I am a free thinker. And oh yes, I am a woman. Being female is one of the last things I have thought about regarding my identity as an artist or as a person in general. As a female composer and multimedia artist, it’s been challenging to follow my dream without influenced by the subconscious judgments the society brought into my life. I have to fight harder to have my ideas heard. I have to work harder to get my music performed.</p>
<p>We all know the fact, in many fields; woman artists who were undoubtedly great are painfully underappreciated. But I am still going to restate the example: in classical concert music, where less than 2% of the artists programed by mainstream organizations are women. 2%!!

<p>Hi! My name is Hillary Eustis and I am currently a Master of Arts Administration candidate at the Savannah College of Art and Design. To complete my degree, I am planning, curating, fundraising, and marketing a group exhibition, Functional Creations, in Savannah, Georgia.</p>
<p>The purpose of this
exhibition is to showcase “functional creations” (i.e. handbags, pillows,
bowls, mugs, etc.) by fiber and ceramic artists and give both established and
emerging artists the opportunity to share their work. Often, people tend to
group these types of works in with ‘crafts’ and forget that these creations can
also be works of art. I am putting together an exhibition that highlights
artists who dedicate their time and talent to creating functional items that
hold as much artistic value as an oil painting on canvas.</p>
<p>The opening reception
will give visitors to the exhibition the opportunity to socialize and
experience these works of art in a relaxed and inviting setting and engage with
some of the local artists included in the show.</p>
<p><b>The exhibition will
run from August 12, 2015 – August 15, 2015 at Sulfur Studios (2301 Bull St,
Savannah, GA 31401) and the opening reception for the show will take place on

<p>The Great Scottish Make Off is an idea for a fun, engaging arts event to take place across several cities in Scotland in summer 2016. The aim is to bring together communities, artists, and local organisations to make something that everyone can enjoy.</p>
<p>Think of it as a real life, much less competitive, more interactive version of your favourite reality cooking competition, but with no losers. We’re just replacing food with art…and we’re not cooking it. We will not be held responsible for what happens if you put your paints on the hob or a sculpture in the oven.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>There are three core parts of the idea:</b></p>
<p><b>Competition Bit</b></p>
<p>In each city, a group of artists* will be selected and given a brief, materials, and one day to create a piece.</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>*We say artist for ease of use on words, but anyone can apply to be one of the competitors. If you aren’t a professional artist or maker, but want to show your work, you are more than welcome to apply. All are welcome, though space will be limited.</blockquote>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Interactive Bit</b></p>
<p>If you like Master Chef or Bake Off, watching is half the fun, but by the end of an episode you’ve got your stand mixer out and flour all over half the kitchen. We want to make sure everyone is involved and gets to try a little creativity. We’ll run workshops with local artists, and even have mini make-off challenges for everyone to try.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Exhibition Bit</b></p>
<p>Under pressure, sometimes things can be completely different than what you would make at home (for better or worse). The selected artists will also get a chance to exhibit the body of work they would normally show in a gallery or art festival. So the public can see the artist making under these restrictions, but also see what he or she would normally make in the comfort of his or her own studio.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>BUT WAIT, there’s more…</b> There will be parties, music, local businesses and organisations, fun experiements for kids, adventures for grown ups, and so much more. </p><blockquote>Also, we just finished a rough trial run in Edinburgh where we were able to learn a LOT about what we'll need to do to scale this project up and improve it. Check out more about it <a href=""popupscotland.org/projects/the-great-scottish-make-off/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<div> <h3>The Impact <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; background-color: initial;"">aka Why should I care?</span>
</h3>
<p>There’s a lot of great art going on in Scotland. We’re really proud of that, but universally there’s a preceived divide between the “art world” and “non-arty” people. The Great Scottish Make Off is a bridge between these groups by making a unique, accessible opportunity that encourages everyone to experience the benefits of creativity*. </p>
<p>People can come for some music and drinks in the evening, or bring their kids to try something new during the day, or just watch what happens in true reality TV style, but we’ll making sure anyone can join in.</p>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote>*What benefits are these you might ask? Employees with a creative outlet perform better, students who participate in the arts achieve better grades, people with illnesses who participate in the arts can actually get better faster (We’re not making this up! We’ve done <b>research</b>.

<blockquote>These are our initial plans, but we are open to working with additional communities or changing locations slightly. Plus, this is the first event, as we grow we can show up in more places.</blockquote>
<p>

<p>We plan to launch in <b>Paisley</b> for a week of fun and making at the end of July. We’re excited about Paisley and Renfrewshire as it goes for city of culture 2021 and it’s just a few minutes on the bus or train from <b>Glasgow</b> city centre.</p>
<p>We’ll then spend a long weekend each in <b>Inverness</b>, <b>Aberdeen</b>, and <b>Dundee</b>.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ll land in <b>Edinburgh</b> during the Festival season with the fruits of our labours from the other cities. We’ll exhibit the work made in the other cities and let Edinburgh have a chance to get in on the fun as well.</p>
<div><b>When will this happen?</b></div>
<div>End of July - August 2016, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We haven't locked in any firm days. We know we want to finish by bringing all of the work and energy to Edinburgh during the festival season, and we know this will take a year to plan to perfection.</span>
</div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">
<p><b>The Edinburgh Festival(s)</b></p>
<p>The festival season in Edinburgh is roughly the month of August and the population of Scotland’s capital quadruples with visitors from all over the world. We think this is a great way to finish the make off. With the smaller budget, we will run for just over a week. This portion of the Make Off will include:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li> the same core bits of make off discussed above</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">exhibition of the work made in other cities</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">ticketed evening parties and performances</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">special collaborations with visiting performers and artists</span></li>
</ul></span>
<p>
</p>
<p>In spite of the fact that the 2015 festival just ended, we already need to lock in our venue for next year. If we can raise enough funding, we’ll go for the whole month. It’s part of our big budget plan. We’re being realistic to start and planning for a week.</p>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In this campaign we're trying to raise £35,000, which will get us started and guarantee the project can run. For the full scale project, we'll need a minimum of £100,000. We are applying for funding from other sources, but what will help our application is a groundswell of public support and a strong initial investment from the community.</p>
<p>There are also some great perks available so you can go ahead and be part of </p>
<p> There are the vitally important things we can't get around paying for: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li> Licenses from the councils in each city</li>
<li> Several types of insurance (for the art, the venue, the volunteers)</li>
<li> Venues in each city (funny how you need a place to go)</li>
<li> Exhibition equipment (we can’t just lean that painting against the wall), </li>
<li> Materials for the artists and workshops</li>
<li> Staff (we’ve done everything with just volunteers, but on a project of this scale we’ll need a minimum of one full time staff member to manage the project, a a part timer in each city starting a few months before)</li>
<li>
Shipping/transport of work (it unfortunately can't teleport to Edinburgh)<br/>
</li>
<li>Publicity (though hopefully we'll get a lot of traction from social media, we'll still need to print up posters, place a few ads, have a sign on the venue so people know where to go, even the web design)</li>
<li>Planning costs (While coffee shops are great, we'll even need to pay for places to have meetings, we'll need paper, pens, a good accountant, and a little bit of legal work)</li>
</ul>
<div>
<h3>Getting into the Awesome</h3>
<p>There are a lot of little things we haven't mentioned. We plan to live stream part of the making process, create a great video of everything, be all over social media with it, and create a catalogue with the art that's made and images of the process. There are more ideas bubbling and we'll be developing them with the local teams we assemble.</p>
</div>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> There are a lot of things that can go wrong when you're organising people, an artist might cancel last minute, something might go wrong with the venue, a giant sea monster might swallow all of Scotland, but on some of these, we can do something about it.</p>
<p>Most of this comes down to people and planning. We are making a clear plan, building a team with the right skills and putting in place checks and balances to make sure things get done when they are supposed to. Obviously, we'll have to rely a lot on volunteers, so having a devoted team is key and a few core staff members who can follow up and ensure everything is done right.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>After you’ve donated, SHARE SHARE SHARE. There are even handy Indiegogo share buttons for all your social media! we need 3,500 people to each give £10 to hit our initial goal. </p>
<p>Also: Get involved! We want to make sure your community gets the best project possible. So come volunteer, tell us what you want, tell us about great venues, if you have a skill you think we could use or an idea that would make the project even more amazing, we want you involved so talk to us, sign up for <a href=""http://eepurl.com/2wIwD"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the mailing list</a>, and come along to our planning and community engagement meetings that we'll be organising in the next few weeks.</p>

</div></div>","The Basics 
The Great Scottish Make Off is an idea for a fun, engaging arts event to take place across several cities in Scotland in summer 2016. The aim is to bring together communities, artists, and local organisations to make something that everyone can enjoy.
Think of it as a real life, much less competitive, more interactive version of your favourite reality cooking competition, but with no losers. We’re just replacing food with art…and we’re not cooking it. We will not be held responsible for what happens if you put your paints on the hob or a sculpture in the oven.


There are three core parts of the idea:
Competition Bit
In each city, a group of artists* will be selected and given a brief, materials, and one day to create a piece.


*We say artist for ease of use on words, but anyone can apply to be one of the competitors. If you aren’t a professional artist or maker, but want to show your work, you are more than welcome to apply. All are welcome, though space will be limited.


Interactive Bit
If you like Master Chef or Bake Off, watching is half the fun, but by the end of an episode you’ve got your stand mixer out and flour all over half the kitchen. We want to make sure everyone is involved and gets to try a little creativity. We’ll run workshops with local artists, and even have mini make-off challenges for everyone to try.


Exhibition Bit
Under pressure, sometimes things can be completely different than what you would make at home (for better or worse). The selected artists will also get a chance to exhibit the body of work they would normally show in a gallery or art festival. So the public can see the artist making under these restrictions, but also see what he or she would normally make in the comfort of his or her own studio.


BUT WAIT, there’s more… There will be parties, music, local businesses and organisations, fun experiements for kids, adventures for grown ups, and so much more. Also, we just finished a rough trial run in Edinburgh where we were able to learn a LOT about what we'll need to do to scale this project up and improve it. Check out more about it here.

 The Impact aka Why should I care?

There’s a lot of great art going on in Scotland. We’re really proud of that, but universally there’s a preceived divide between the “art world” and “non-arty” people. The Great Scottish Make Off is a bridge between these groups by making a unique, accessible opportunity that encourages everyone to experience the benefits of creativity*. 
People can come for some music and drinks in the evening, or bring their kids to try something new during the day, or just watch what happens in true reality TV style, but we’ll making sure anyone can join in.


*What benefits are these you might ask? Employees with a creative outlet perform better, students who participate in the arts achieve better grades, people with illnesses who participate in the arts can actually get better faster (We’re not making this up! We’ve done research. There's some of it here, here, 
here, 
here, and 
here). 
 

A Bit More in Depth
Where will this happen?


 Paisley
 Inverness
 Aberdeen
 Dundee

 Edinburgh



These are our initial plans, but we are open to working with additional communities or changing locations slightly. Plus, this is the first event, as we grow we can show up in more places.


We plan to launch in Paisley for a week of fun and making at the end of July. We’re excited about Paisley and Renfrewshire as it goes for city of culture 2021 and it’s just a few minutes on the bus or train from Glasgow city centre.
We’ll then spend a long weekend each in Inverness, Aberdeen, and Dundee.

ticketed evening parties and performances
special collaborations with visiting performers and artists

 There are the vitally important things we can't get around paying for: 


 Licenses from the councils in each city
 Several types of insurance (for the art, the venue, the volunteers)
 Venues in each city (funny how you need a place to go)
 Exhibition equipment (we can’t just lean that painting against the wall), 
 Materials for the artists and workshops
 Staff (we’ve done everything with just volunteers, but on a project of this scale we’ll need a minimum of one full time staff member to manage the project, a a part timer in each city starting a few months before)

Shipping/transport of work (it unfortunately can't teleport to Edinburgh)

Publicity (though hopefully we'll get a lot of traction from social media, we'll still need to print up posters, place a few ads, have a sign on the venue so people know where to go, even the web design)
Planning costs (While coffee shops are great, we'll even need to pay for places to have meetings, we'll need paper, pens, a good accountant, and a little bit of legal work)

</div>Hey -- We're artists and we TOTALLY understand if you are not able to
  make a contribution, but if you like what you see here, then spreading
 the word about Nuit Blanche North is just as helpful for us! Sharing our
 campaign with your friends and family goes a long way -- or just find 
us on your favorite social media and give us a ""like"". <p></p></div>","A Bold Interactive Multi Arts Street Festival
 
On July 11th, 2015 thousands of visitors
will flood the streets of downtown Huntsville for a Free fun filled evening of interactive art, and performances in
unconventional places presented by Edge of the Woods Theatre and Huntsville Festival of the Arts.  Now entering its 5th year, NbN has presented the work of over 500 local and invited artists and engaged tens of thousands of  community members in hands on art making activities and one of a kind artistic experiences. 
And it's all FREE!
And we want to keep it that way. Our event survives on government funds, donations and the blood, sweat and tears of so many volunteers, artists and organizers. NbN has become a vital part of Muskoka's cultural fabric by using art to strengthen connections between the everyday lives of our attendees and the place they live, promoting increased community and civic engagement and supporting local small businesses in rural townships.


How Can You Help?

In honor of our fifth anniversary, we are asking our friends to give birthday presents of $25, $50 or $100. All funds will go directly to paying local artists. If you've 
attended before, or are planning on attending this year, or if you just 
believe in what we stand for, please consider supporting us.



Why Support Nuit Blanche North?
It Supports Artists.  In
2014, 106 different artists participated (up from 94 in 2013) presenting their
work to over 7,000 attendees (up 40% from 2012) offering artists the opportunity
to push the boundaries of their practice, and engage in potent creative collaborations with other artists, community
members and the spaces around them.  

It Promotes the Arts. Art is for everyone. In order to reach as diverse an audience as
possible, we strive to keep the event accessible. By presenting
artistic activities in public spaces, we can better
attract audiences who don’t traditionally attend arts events, and through that encounter, create fun and meaningful artistic experiences that leave leave a lasting effect.
Positive Economic Impact.  Through our event, we strive to bring
increased opportunities to local businesses, showcasing the downtown core of
Huntsville and building on Muskoka’s reputation as a tourism destination.  



Every year we face many challenges and financial uncertainties.

But we do it because we love it. And there are thousands who love it too, from youth to seniors, permanent residents to visitors, different cultures, races, abilities. Your donation will help all of us, and in turn make a powerful statement on the importance of this event. You gift will help us build support to keep Nuit Blanche North running for years to come!

<p><b><u>Who We Are</u></b></p>
<p>Led by
artist-educator Jan Tichy, <i>The Heat Light
Water Cultural Project (HLWCP) </i>is a team of artists, cultural producers,
thinkers, activists, and community partners who value art, culture and science
as conduits for restoration, empowerment and engagement in downtown Gary and
its surrounding neighborhoods. Through a collaborative partnership with local
and regional artists, community members and city officials, our goal is to help
re-energize Gary!</p>
<p>Jan Tichy is a contemporary artist and
educator working in video, sculpture, architecture, and photography. Born in
Prague in 1974, Jan studied art in Israel before earning his MFA from the
School of the Art Institute of Chicago where he is now Assistant Professor in
the Department of Photography. He has created socially engaged art projects in
Chicago and internationally. <i>Project
Cabrini </i>Green, which you can view here: <a href=""http://www.projectcabrinigreen.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.projectcabrinigreen.org</a> is just one example of
his keen ability to bridge art, science, and community together. </p>
<p>One
of the collaborators is Dr. Jeffreen Hayes. Jeffreen, an artistic producer and
curator, believes, like Jan, in the power of art, culture and science to
empower communities in need. She is supporting HLWCP through her organization
bridge/arts, which provides administrative support to artist and
community-driven art projects. </p>
<p><i>The
Heat Light Water Cultural Project </i>collaborators
share a collective experience of over 15 years of art interventions, curating, and
community engagement.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Name</b></p>
<p><i>The Heat Light Water Cultural Project</i> takes its name from what is
currently known as the General Services building. The building’s given name,
when designed by architect George W. Maher, was the Gary Heat Light Water Co.
Warehouse. Taking into consideration that heat, light and water are essential
elements for life and basic services, we believe that art is also a basic
service. </p>
<p><b><u>Why Gary</u></b></p>
<p><b><i>We understand ourselves as cultural facilitators and
catalysts who take our direction from what the community actually wants. </i></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>As
artists, we believe in working with the people of Gary to not only provide
access to  the arts but to also help
individuals and communities tap into their creativity. We view these workshops
as a way to identify the culture that already lives in Gary and to activate
what is already there. The HLWCP workshops are one way to acknowledge that
beauty exists in different forms—in forms different from the ways we typically
identify as beauty. </p>
<p>Gary
is part of our Chicagoland community and a neighbor. In order to build
community you have to share resources, take care of your neighbor, and build a
network. We want to share our artistic resources and show Gary, and the world,
the beauty we see and experience in the community.</p>
<p><b><i>Gary is our neighbor. In order to build community you have to

<p><b><u>What We Are Doing</u></b></p>
<p>To begin our
long term engagement, we will be facilitating artist-run workshops this summer
and fall. We take a holistic approach to community-building. Everyone should
have access to the art. The workshops will offer something for everyone, with a
focus on specific age groups, as well as intergenerational arts programming. </p>
<p>Some of the artist
workshops include:</p>
<p><b>Documentary photography</b></p>
<p>●<span>  </span>This workshop will encourage
different ways of seeing while teaching the participants about the history of
photography and how it has been used to document cities and communities</p>

<p>We
will offer these as well as traditional forms of art: drawing, painting, etc. </p>
<p>At
the end of our first year of artist-run workshops, we will have a community-curated

the banks of the Thames, visitors will be invited to literally walk a mile in someone else’s
shoes whilst being immersed in an audio narrative of their life.
In association with In the Dark radio we are already collecting shoes
and stories from local people, from a paediatric brain surgeon and market trader to a
refugee and chess grand master. A Mile in My Shoes will be housed in a
specially designed giant shoebox that we will create for the event.
A Mile in My Shoes will tour internationally in 2016 as part of the Empathy
Museum, and we will be adding to our collection of shoes and stories as we go. We need your
help to ensure that we can complete this work and take our vision for the
Empathy Museum on the road. The idea of the Empathy Museum has already captured the public imagination, drawing media attention in the UK from the Independent to the BBC, and in countries such as Brazil, Italy and Croatia.


‘Empathy - the imaginative act of stepping
into another person’s shoes and viewing the world from their perspective – is a
radical tool for social change and should be a guiding light for the art of
living.’ Roman Krznaric
What we need and
What you get
We have secured the funding to create the content for our first
exhibition A Mile in My Shoes. Now we need your help to create a playful, theatrical,
mobile space to house this and future exhibits.
Working with a team of artists and designers we are planning to convert
a shipping container into a state of the art exhibition space. The exterior
will resemble a giant shoebox and the interior will display our collection with
a space for visitors to share their experiences and contribute stories and a
photo of their own shoes.
Your contribution will give us the £15,000 we need to complete
our vision, launch the Empathy Museum and spread the empathy message.
Breakdown of the Budget
£5,000 - to buy and part convert a shipping container
£5,000- design, materials and build cost to transform the container
into a mobile exhibition space  - the shoebox
£2,000 - for audio equipment£3,000 - storage, transport and presentation of A Mile in My Shoes at new venues 
No contribution is too small – please join us in the empathy
revolution!
Our perks are listed on the right hand side.

<p></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><b>Who we are</b></p>
<p>Black Cube Collective (BCC) is a Scottish-based Community Interest Company creating new and accessible opportunities for emerging artists in the UK and internationally. We run an Annual Show that provides an unprecedented opportunity for artists to show their work in an open, non-institutional large-scale and affordable public exhibition in Edinburgh. We also have been working on EU projects bringing together art and technology practitioners and pioneering multidisciplinary practices.<br/></p>
<p>S.permaroutsi-Arcadia is an ongoing project that deals with sustainability and self-sufficient agriculture and is part of a wider reconstructive development in a rural area of Greece. The founder of S.permaroutsi, Dimitri Foundos explains:</p>
<p>“The economic crisis brought upon us the beast of unemployment.  We had to react in order to survive.  That is when the reactive movement S.permaroutsi was created, named after our village.  It was an incentive of Dimitris Foundos, with the support of Panagiota Dimitropoulou.”</p>
<div><br/></div>
<b>Campaign and background</b>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">We will bring artists from outside of Greece committed to issues of environmentalism and sustainability to develop ideas around 'alternatives to austerity'. Their projects will aim to rebuild communities and promote relationships with Europe more positively, in addition to demonstrating how artists and the creative industries can have a constructive and active role in environmentally aware reconstructive and sustainable projects. </div><div>Your help will not only provide genuine support to artists and their work but will also build cultural solidarity and make a real contribution to finding alternatives to living under austerity.</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The collaboration was ignited when Dimitris came to a BCC exhibition in Athens and we immediately established mutual ambitions and passions. Dimitris wanted to work with international artists and BCC wanted to work with Greek sustainability initiatives so the collaboration happened quite naturally. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The small village of Routsi in Arcadia was hit by devastating fires in 2007 and then again in 2012. Along with the impact of the economic crisis, many villagers lost their livelihoods due to the destruction of olive trees, walnut trees and other crops. The main aim of the S.permaroutsi project is to replant the landscape using methods of natural farming and forest gardening in order to help the community live sustainably.</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441039872/ge6txxzwjployarfduc2.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 391.190082644628px; height: 294px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441039951/wdoxbmtickiihrgiswxu.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 219.471482889734px; height: 293px;""/><br/></span></p>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In June this year and with little notice Athens decided to shut banks in a defensive move to prevent a bank run as the Greek government’s negotiations with its creditors collapsed in disarray. The people of Greece are painfully learning that without functioning banks, the daily lives of citizens and businesses come to a juddering halt. People are suddenly unable to pay rent or even to buy food. Capital controls that limit the free movement of money are measures of desperation and whether they work depends on how well the treatment suits the disease.</span></div>
<p></p>
<br/><b>What we aim to achieve</b><br/><p style=""text-align: justify;"">So what is the alternative? Is there any alternative? We believe that there is and that artists can play a crucial role in finding one. Many artists offer alternative and critical ways of viewing the world, and as innovators, can explore and develop other positive possibilities to meekly accepting imposed austerity.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Now, more than ever, the people of Greece and in other communities around the world need to find ways of tackling financial instability, finding new means of support and make the most of their shared resources.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Artists in all countries are often undervalued as contributors to society, huge funding cuts in the cultural sector over the past few years clearly indicate this. This project will bring about a move towards sustainable living in a small village in Arcadia (Greece) and demonstrate how artists in particular can bring about solidarity with other communities and work for positive, proactive change in human society and the wider environment. As well as that, artists are significant contributors to the economy: </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">'A recent study found that the culture and creative industries (CCI) contributed with 4,2% of GDP of Europe in 2012. The majority of the total revenue is attributed to the visual arts, well above advertisement and TV.' </p>

Who we are
Black Cube Collective (BCC) is a Scottish-based Community Interest Company creating new and accessible opportunities for emerging artists in the UK and internationally. We run an Annual Show that provides an unprecedented opportunity for artists to show their work in an open, non-institutional large-scale and affordable public exhibition in Edinburgh. We also have been working on EU projects bringing together art and technology practitioners and pioneering multidisciplinary practices.
S.permaroutsi-Arcadia is an ongoing project that deals with sustainability and self-sufficient agriculture and is part of a wider reconstructive development in a rural area of Greece. The founder of S.permaroutsi, Dimitri Foundos explains:
“The economic crisis brought upon us the beast of unemployment.  We had to react in order to survive.  That is when the reactive movement S.permaroutsi was created, named after our village.  It was an incentive of Dimitris Foundos, with the support of Panagiota Dimitropoulou.”

Campaign and background
We will bring artists from outside of Greece committed to issues of environmentalism and sustainability to develop ideas around 'alternatives to austerity'. Their projects will aim to rebuild communities and promote relationships with Europe more positively, in addition to demonstrating how artists and the creative industries can have a constructive and active role in environmentally aware reconstructive and sustainable projects. Your help will not only provide genuine support to artists and their work but will also build cultural solidarity and make a real contribution to finding alternatives to living under austerity.
The collaboration was ignited when Dimitris came to a BCC exhibition in Athens and we immediately established mutual ambitions and passions. Dimitris wanted to work with international artists and BCC wanted to work with Greek sustainability initiatives so the collaboration happened quite naturally. 
The small village of Routsi in Arcadia was hit by devastating fires in 2007 and then again in 2012. Along with the impact of the economic crisis, many villagers lost their livelihoods due to the destruction of olive trees, walnut trees and other crops. The main aim of the S.permaroutsi project is to replant the landscape using methods of natural farming and forest gardening in order to help the community live sustainably.

In June this year and with little notice Athens decided to shut banks in a defensive move to prevent a bank run as the Greek government’s negotiations with its creditors collapsed in disarray. The people of Greece are painfully learning that without functioning banks, the daily lives of citizens and businesses come to a juddering halt. People are suddenly unable to pay rent or even to buy food. Capital controls that limit the free movement of money are measures of desperation and whether they work depends on how well the treatment suits the disease.

What we aim to achieveSo what is the alternative? Is there any alternative? We believe that there is and that artists can play a crucial role in finding one. Many artists offer alternative and critical ways of viewing the world, and as innovators, can explore and develop other positive possibilities to meekly accepting imposed austerity.
Now, more than ever, the people of Greece and in other communities around the world need to find ways of tackling financial instability, finding new means of support and make the most of their shared resources.
Artists in all countries are often undervalued as contributors to society, huge funding cuts in the cultural sector over the past few years clearly indicate this. This project will bring about a move towards sustainable living in a small village in Arcadia (Greece) and demonstrate how artists in particular can bring about solidarity with other communities and work for positive, proactive change in human society and the wider environment. As well as that, artists are significant contributors to the economy: 
'A recent study found that the culture and creative industries (CCI) contributed with 4,2% of GDP of Europe in 2012. The majority of the total revenue is attributed to the visual arts, well above advertisement and TV.' 
(ICT ART CONNECT.study Brochure, iMinds, Artshare, Bozar, 2014)

A mural for the Santa Monica Red Cross
Francisco Letelier with Beautify Earth
My
name is Francisco Letelier. For more than three decades I have been making murals and
public art that express the dreams and histories of communities and
individuals.
Beautify Earth is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization that offers love to neglected communities through the installation of public murals.  They are working in communities across the United States, putting an end to blighted walls and fixtures by empowering artists, encouraging social responsibility, and instilling community pride in impoverished or neglected communities and streets. I am working with Beautify Earth to create a mural for the Santa Monica Red Cross. We share the conviction that acts of imagination can lead to profound change.  As part of the greater efforts of Beautify Earth, the mural will add to the momentum already started on Broadway Avenue, creating a cluster of murals situated near each other for a gallery effect. 



The
Santa Monica Red Cross is one of the oldest civic organizations in
the city, founded in 1918 by the historic Santa Monica Bay Women's
Club. A largely volunteer organization, the efforts of the Santa Monica Red Cross chapter have left a
tremendous impact on the lives of thousands across generations. The
chapter serves more than 90,000
people over 16 square miles. Nonetheless,
many remain uninformed about the work they accomplish. Despite the
organization's enduring commitment to its surrounding communities many overlook its heroic dimensions and take for
granted the importance of its tasks. For every crisis, every fire,
every earthquake within its district, the Red Cross shows up for
those who are in need.



I
am asking my extended community to help create a place of imagination
and memory through a  public art work. I invite you to join me in
giving a sense of place and belonging to an organization that has
responded to human need for close to a century.Through
its staff and volunteers the Santa Monica Red Cross consistently
acknowledges the power of cooperation and helps reveal the inherent
strength of our communities.Together, lets create a public monument that celebrates that spirit for their
upcoming centennial.




The Guardian Mural

I
will create a mural along the south facade of the Santa Monica Red
Cross chapter building as well as another public art work created with
volunteers located on the retaining walls surrounding the front entrance parking lot.  After
conversations with Santa Monica Red Cross Director, Julie Thomas and Resident Historian, Anna Lisa Debois, I began the design phase of the project. Beautify
Earth is committed to providing materials and scaffolding or lifts
for the project. What we need now is direct financial support so that I can undertake the task of creating the mural.



I
am seeking funding of $5,500.00 to keep me on the wall until the
project is completed.

We
estimate that the project will take 2 months to complete.




Your donation will go directly towards my expenses while I am at work. This will allow me to focus on the project without distractions.  By supporting this campaign, you help create a 'win' for all involved.  The Santa Monica Red Cross receives recognition through a mural, I receive the support required to give my art and efforts, Beautify Earth creates more murals, and you become a part of something that truly matters to many people.
 Donations are tax deductible through Beautify Earth, a 501(c)3 non profit organization.


All
donations make a difference, 
I plan to complete this project whether
I reach my goal or not.

<div><b>WHAT WILL THE INSTALLATION HAVE?</b></div>
<div>Throughout January we will collect footage and audio recordings related to social media, internet activism and popular culture in and around London. We will conduct interviews with new media artists and activists focusing specifically on laughter and satire in their work. Based on our research we will construct four interlinked narratives on the following questions; When did man first laugh? What is he laughing at? How and why did he begin to laugh, and What is laughter in media doing now? These interlinked narratives will be projected on four different screens and sequences from each will be played through holograms. Several pressure sensitive switches will be placed along the floor and as participants walk over them changes in texture, mapping, and sound design will occur. A web camera will also be used to insert participants in a split screen with one of the narratives. The participants' physical presence in the space will impact the way the media is experienced by all participants viewing the installation. Through interactivity in a social event we hope participants will sense and react to their agency over this experience with media and reflect and think about their engagement with media and the ways in which laughter in media could bring about more effective social and political change. </div>

<div><b>The IMPACT:</b></div>
<div>As I have explained before, my profession has afforded me the opportunity to participate in the day-to-day development of many youth.  I've seen enough as an educator of 20 years, to write a book on that subject alone.  Nothing I've seen however, is more PURE than the satisfaction that I have witnessed in the eyes of a youth who has finally ""discovered"" a natural talent or ability. Whether that discovery came as a result of a writing assignment, a video project or if the student had just delivered the best 5 minute monologue our class had ever heard, it didn't matter. Something <i>very</i> powerful takes place when a person ""stumbles upon"" that one particular thing that they are good, and in some cases, GREAT at doing! The discovery alone can bring a satisfaction that can be seen in widened eyes, shoulders that are suddenly squared or a gait that has transformed into a long confident stride. The liberation is thrilling for the youth and the onlooker. IMF gives us the opportunity to take an active part in this ""artistic evolution"" of such youth.</div>
</div><div><b>Risks and Challenges:</b></div><div> <p>We all know that there are risks involved with opening a non-profit.  The biggest risk being that funding may not always remain available for the maintenance of the organization. What IMF proposes is NEEDED in our community in a really BIG way. Cuts to the arts in public schools and community organizations is now the norm. Because of the GREAT need for art appreciation and expression, I am confident that IMF will become a partner in the community and in return,  individuals, businesses and organizations will embrace and support  it. In addition to teaching, I've also served as founder and/or project manager for many organizations and churches as well as Yaktown Poets. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I've honed my skills as a project manager in schools, churches, community organizations and abroad. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My earlier work with the Pontiac Area Urban League, Impact  (an arm of Campus Crusade for Christ), The Pontiac Gospel Fest, etc lend themselves as examples of</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  my personal skills, talents and abilities to spearhead and maintain projects.

What will they think of it? Could fate play a part? There are all kinds of ""games"" we can come up with. The ideas don't end with us.Also, consider that one of the greatest things to come about with the existence of social media is the knowledge that most likely, you will never fully lose someone.  That awesome teacher you had in 2nd grade? You just might be able to find her.  Your best friend that moved away in the middle of high school? You can just look them up and keep in contact. As artists, we spend a lot of time and effort on each piece we work on, sometimes existing on a violent roller coaster of emotions. Sometimes it's a relief to let it go. But often nostalgia creeps up on us and we wonder who might be enjoying that tricky still-life we sold years ago.  We want this site to exist so that most likely, you will never fully lose your art. This website can be used as casually or as comprehensively as you desire. And like most social media, it will be free to sign up! More and more information is being transmitted in real-time.  There is no reason art should be left behind.Artstalker Project- The BusinessArtstalker Project is a brand new small home business, whose mission statement states: We are committed to discovering new ways to share and follow art while supporting the art community. Currently, our sole focus is the Artstalker Project website. Future plans include moving into an office, hiring employees, and continuing to meet the needs of the Artstalker Project community. Although Artstalker Project seeks to be a successful small business, at its heart it is all about the art.Artstalker Project- The WebsiteIn order for Artstalker Project to be anything to anyone, we need to get the website up and functional. The website will be necessary to generate the unique tracking numbers for personal artwork and to connect to other members. And that's just the beginning. We've brainstormed many future possibilities for the website, but right now we are focusing our efforts on the first steps.For artists, there will be a custom gallery function, enabling you to showcase all your original artwork in one place. Plus, the tracking feature will naturally build your very own provenance, something usually reserved for famous works of art. For the art lover, there will be the option to follow your favorite artists, and learn more information about your newest art purchases. For everyone, the website will be a place to keep us all connected with a shared passion. Artstalker Project- The CommunityIn our mind's eye, the Artstalker Project community is made up of everyone in the world, whether they know it or not. For now, we have our team and our family and friends who support us at all times. And then there is you. Consider this an open invitation to join us. We have no doubt that there are like-minded Artstalkers who need to be reached, we just need help to find them.Artstalker Project- The Team     Ty PierceAt the head of our table is business owner and team leader, Ty Pierce. His iron plated work ethic and his skill with the paintbrush are merely two of a million reasons we choose to follow him. He has a proven track record of getting the job done and getting it done beautifully. His educational background is in fine art, his work experience is in multimedia development, and in his chest beats the determined heart of a determined artist.
     Sarah PierceTy's wife and team co-captain, Sarah does most of the writing for Artstalker Project. She also nervously provided the voice acting for our pitch video above. She claims to have no artistic talents but does have a deep love for a number of talented artists.     Jake WalkerBased in Winston-Salem, NC, Jake is our designated ""cool guy"".

All I can offer any of you is the opportunity to help a friend, and whatever value that helping me has for you … and my thanks, gratitude, and heart (figuratively speaking of course). However you can help will be of immense value to me, indeed. Thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

But are we really sure that this “ordinary” way of living sexuality cannot become a fetish itself?







Sketch by ONZE 
In the short film the recurring theme of money and of the glossy cover image render a vision of a globalized world as if it were a monopoly, a board game within which everyone most recompose the pieces sooner or later. 
The research places and non – places not common to most of us serves to underline this playful component and to develop the resulting critical component: on the other hand anyone can rent a limousine bid farewell to the single life, indulging in short lived luxury and cuddles, experimenting various possible experiences. 
I would like to introduce the world of fetishism with lightness and irony, incorporating romantic love, rendering it pathological in the same way as the western world transforms desire, fun, curiosity in paraphilias caring to preserve mononuclear family schemes and binary of gender. 
My personal history is difficult to categorize and fit in to a scheme. I wish to break away from categories and boxes and for this reason i choose to show the body and sexual work. I fight to liberate the sexual prowess of us women. Showing the weakness of the social construct ""man"" unhealthy carrier of privileges.
 I refuse labels, that are mostly pathological psychiatric definitions given by doctors – males - that goes without saying .
That said, I’m LILITH PRIMAVERA , a “Queer”, a “Slut"", and a “Feminist”, and so on . I hope that by seeing this short film you will have the possibility to think or at best  you could... do it with your hands!

<p><br/></p>One of the great blessings I had having regained sobriety was the possibility to travel again. So, with director Catherine McGilvray we went to India to shoot a documentary about a story of unconditional forgiveness. Samundar Singh, a Hindu fanatic, had killed in 1995 a Catholic nun, Rani Maria. In prison, he was forgiven by the family, who asked and obtained his release from jail. The mother and sister of Rani Maria than welcomed him as a son and a brother. All this would not have been possible without Swami Sadanand, a Catholic priest whose mission was to actively spread the message of forgiveness to all people, ragardless of their faith, social conditions or wrongdoings. To fulfill his mission, he risked his life more than once,  Since then, Swami was a costant companion and guide both for me and Catherine. His loving smile could heal every moment of depair, suffering, uncertainty. He came to New York and Rome for the screening of the documentary (The Heart of a Murderer), and his speeches on forgiveness touched the hearts of many. While he was with us we did some shooting so to have a testimony of his his life and words. This year, at the age of 68, he left this world to return where he belonged, the house of the Father,<br/>We decided not to keep to ourselves the shootings, and to make a documentary. We think that his committment to forgivness and reconciliation, his quest for God, and his loving smile should reach as many people as possible. In the documentary I will also briefly talk of my past as an alcoholic and gambler. Now that i have ragained sobriety (and how wonderful this is), I would like to give testimony that it is possible to exit hell and begin to walk a path of peace.<br/><br/><b>WHY WE DO IT</b><br/><br/>We feel that there is too much talk on religion and too little real 
religious commitment. When I asked Swami why so many people meditate, 
pray, do yoga, etc., and so few of them seem to express a spiritual 
attitude (acceptance, forgiveness, thankfulness, joy and so no) in their
 everyday life, he explained to me that are not ready to sacrifice what 
they have (even preoccupations) when they search for God or inner peace.
 Swami took that challange seriously, and it changed his all life. Then,
 seeing God in others as well, he dedicated himself completely to solve 
inner and outer conficts. While living he had an enormous impact on 
thousands of lives (<a href=""http://mattersindia.com/2016/04/revolutionary-catholic-ascetic-dies/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mattersindia.com/2016/04/revolutionary-c...</a>),
 and we wish that our work, with all its faults and errors, may continue
 to bring his healing voice to all those in sorrow and in need.<br/>
<br/>So, we have a lot to work with, and we are putting all our efforts in this project, but we need help, so that we can do some additional shooting, finish the editing, work in the postproduction of the film and spread the message.

$225: Costs for campaign rewards. 
The big wildcard is the rings that are dispensed. Our machine fits around 1000 rings at a time. The highly illuminating blinky rings cost $.25 each. 

That puts the total at $1,500 for a completely filled machine. We're aiming for $3,000 so that we can keep the machine stocked throughout the week (6 refillings). The more we get, the more we can give. (At $36,000, we could gift illumination to every person at Burning Man!)




The team


We are Jacob & Pamela, two makers from the bay area.
 
We'll be joined by Erin and Howard...


...And Liz and Janardyn!


...Plus LED wizard Jason Trager!





    Thank you We'd like to thank the Burning Man community for your support. Together, we can make the world a brighter place!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

Batwood
Creations Origins:</h3> <p>
I
am Blaine Atwood of Price Utah. As a youth I struggled with mainstream academia
due to a case of undiagnosed dyslexia. This caused me to be drawn to the arts.
Feeling a sense of accomplishment as I explored the arts gave me the confidence
to work hard in my regular classes, graduate high school, and ultimately go on
to graduate from college with my BA in ceramics in 1995. </p> <ul> <li>
<p>In 2000 I was privileged to accept a job teaching ceramics
and sculpture at The College of Eastern Utah. I loved teaching there. For
thirteen years I taught and watched as students lives were touched and molded
by their own encounter with the arts. As I was in the process of obtaining my MFA in ceramics
(which I completed in the spring of 2014), I was forced to move on from the
teaching job that I loved at CEU due to budget cuts that closed the ceramics program
at the college. Since then my wife and I have dedicated our time to selling my
pottery under the name of Batwood Creations. </p>
</li> <li>
<p>As a youth, finding I had a talent in clay and other
artistic areas was such a benefit to me that helping people of all ages to
discover art through ceramics has become a passion of mine. We want to transform
our small home-based operation into a large full-functioning ceramic studio
where we can teach community classes and increase pottery production.</p>
</li> <li>
<p>This studio will benefit a whole community providing a creative, constructive outlet for all ages. Who knows, with your help, we may
even be able to help a child or two develop the confidence to accomplish more
than they think they can.</p>

<p><b>Who Am I?</b></p>
<p>My name is Linda Kaye-Moses and I have been a maker of art jewelry for forty years. You can check out my jewels at lindakayemoses.com. Welcome to my Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, “From Drawings to Jewelry”. There is just a single goal for this campaign, a goal to raise $8,000.00, but more about that below. Read on to find out, and to discover how you can personally be a part of my vision.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>The Inspiration for This Campaign</b></p>
<p>Over a decade ago, I began writing a memoir tracing the path I followed to become the artist I am today; the path that allowed me to indulge my passion for making jewelry. This memoir, titled <i>Roots, Stems, and Branches; A Recollection</i>, was originally handwritten and included my hand-drawn, illuminated letters. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2012 it was published in hardcover and paperback &lt;<a href=""http://www.blurb.com/search/site_search?search=Linda+Kaye-Moses"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://www.blurb.com/search/site_search?search=Linda+Kaye-Moses</span></a>&gt; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why am I talking about the book, when this project is less about <i>Roots, Stems, and Branches; A Recollection</i>,and more about the drawings within it and the jewelry that grew out of it? Because each section and each chapter in the book began with my own hand drawn, illuminated letters and ended with a drawing using an element from each of those letters, and THESE DRAWINGS DIRECTLY INSPIRED MY JEWELRY AND THIS CAMPAIGN.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>How Did Tht Happen and What Happened Next?</b></p>
<p>Many of my collectors commented that<i> these designs could be re-interpreted as jewelry, as my unruly jewels</i>, although I hadn’t envisioned the drawings in the book for this purpose. (it never even occurred to me). So the idea of translating my drawings into jewelry began to percolate. </p>
<p>From that moment, I became compelled, destined, and driven to revisit the drawings with this in mind. I selected ten of them (see images below) on which to base the jewelry designs. I became immersed in the process of making this jewelry, and so, after working steadily in my studio for many months, ten pendant neckpieces were created. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>The Pendant Neckpieces</b></p>
<p>Based on the themes of the chapters from which the drawings were taken, the pendant neckpieces are titled as follows: <i>This Gathering, Summer Breeze</i>, <i>The Gift</i>, <i>Mixed Messages</i>, <i>Syncopator</i>, <i>Walking Through Ancient Lives</i>, <i>A Land Removed</i>, <i>The Way In</i>, <i>Divergence</i>, and <i>Astonishing Vistas</i>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Each of these hand-fabricated jewels is made using Fine (Pure) and Sterling silver, with 14k or 18k gold details. Most are set with gemstones. The Sterling silver chains from which the jewels are suspended, are joined with hand made clasps based on the design of the pendant neckpieces themselves. Each of these pendant neckpieces has been enameled in colors that refer back to the colors of the original drawings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><b>And Now Presenting...The Single Goal of the Campaign</b></p>
<p>Since I haven’t really told you yet, you may have begun to wonder what this campaign is all about. There is only one goal of this campaign. The expense of purchasing the materials and supplies, and then creating these jewels, was substantial. The <b>single goal</b> of this campaign is to help me offset that cost by raising $8,000.00. I’m inviting you to help me do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>How You Can Help</b></p>
<p>To encourage you to become a part of this project, I’m offering a range of some very elegant, interesting, and, I hope, irresistible perks for all levels of generosity. Have a look, read through them, and please join me in creating the success of this campaign!</p><p></p></div>","Who Am I?

<div>For the past 6 years, I have been showing my artwork across Seattle, honing my style and perfecting my techniques to prepare myself for this upcoming trip. In June, I will be spending one month traveling around Iceland, creating a body of work inspired by the Icelandic scenery and people! Come, join me on this awesome journey of self discovery. </div>
<div>I will be travelling around the country by myself, camping every night and creating one original watercolor painting per day. At the end of the trip, I will come back to Seattle and feature all the new paintings at KoLab Gallery in Urban Light Studios for Greenwood Art Walk. </div>
<div>By donating to this campaign, you will not only help an artist grow and evolve, but you will be helping fulfill a 10-year-old dream to see Iceland myself. </div>
<div>Here is a link to the route that I have plotted out</div>
<div>
<a href=""http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.plotaroute.com%2Froute%2F194913&amp;h=PAQHx7Uaw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.plotaroute.com/route/194913</a><br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Since Iceland is a pretty expensive country to visit, each one of your donations will go to the following accommodations:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Car Rental: $2,500</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Gas: $300</span></li>

<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Incidentals: $1,000</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Food and Camping Supplies: $1,050</span>
</li>
</ul>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Some of the perks for donating include anything from a postcard sent to you from my adventures in Iceland, to an 8x10 print set of all 30 paintings I make while I am there, or even a photo book filled with photography from my Icelandic travels and process photos of all the paintings I create while I am there. </span>
</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>This trip is, for me, a once in a lifetime opportunity. I have wanted to spend time in Iceland since I was 17 years old, but was never financially able to. After a bunch of scrimping and saving, I was able to come up with enough money to buy my plane ticket, and get my passport. Each donation, no matter how small, will make the biggest impact on this adventure. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>If I do not raise enough money to rent a car, then I will be taking a bicycle with me. I will be training for this trip to make sure I am physically able to complete a 30 day tour of Iceland. </div>
<div>Of course, renting a car will enable me to see parts of Iceland I wouldnt otherwise have time for on bike. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Feel free to share my campaign with your family and friends! You can also follow me and my adventures on instagram @mrshmrart</p>
<p>If you cannot contribute monetarily, I will happily accept any camping or art supply donations! If you would like to donate an item for my trip, please send me an email at mjcrosetto@gmail.com</p>

A group of artists and writers from the Alexandrine Street Seminars and College for Creative Studies alumni across the arts of ceramics / choreography / sculpture / post-studio art / social practice / music / performance / and critical theory felt the need for a new journal to capture the exciting historical and emerging arts scene and practices which Detroit has witnessed coming together these past ten years. We also wanted the journal to be a vehicle for artist research / critical studies. Most of all, we wanted the journal to represent the contemporary art scene of Detroit in a national and international setting and in turn to be a place where national and international issues in art + practice could be debated in a critical language. Vol. 1 (<i>On Space</i>) had Scott Hocking as the featured artist. Volume 2 (<i>On Dance</i>), due out in May, will see Marie T. Hermann as the featured artist; and volume 3 (<i>On Sounds / Music</i>) will see Kevin Beasley as the featured artist.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">With help from the Knight Foundation, the College for Creative Studies, friends, and supporters Volume 1 of <i>Detroit Research</i> was launched at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit (MOCAD) in March 2015 with resounding success. Since then <i>Detroit Research</i> in collaboration with the College for Creative Studies was the recipient of a Knight Arts Challenge Grant of $30,000 conditional on raising matching funds.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Many artists and writers both inside and beyond Detroit and across the arts – McArthur Binion, Michael E. Smith, Leni Sinclair, Vievee Francis, Marie T. Hermann, Tyanna Buie, Paul Kotula, just to name a few – have generously donated works to be sold through Indiegogo in a fundraiser for <i>Detroit Research</i> to meet the Knight Foundation matching fund goal.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We invite you to donate, to buy copies of the journal, or any of the great art work donated by artists in support of <i>Detroit Research</i>. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Visit our website at <a href=""http://www.detroitresearch.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.detroitresearch.org</a> <br/><span>Read Detroit Research Vol. 1 at <a href=""http://www.detroitresearch.org/demo-home/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.detroitresearch.org/<span>volume1/</span></a> ‎</span></p><div>

</div></div>","Detroit Research is a new journal of Art + Criticism. A group of artists and writers from the Alexandrine Street Seminars and College for Creative Studies alumni across the arts of ceramics / choreography / sculpture / post-studio art / social practice / music / performance / and critical theory felt the need for a new journal to capture the exciting historical and emerging arts scene and practices which Detroit has witnessed coming together these past ten years. We also wanted the journal to be a vehicle for artist research / critical studies. Most of all, we wanted the journal to represent the contemporary art scene of Detroit in a national and international setting and in turn to be a place where national and international issues in art + practice could be debated in a critical language. Vol. 1 (On Space) had Scott Hocking as the featured artist. Volume 2 (On Dance), due out in May, will see Marie T. Hermann as the featured artist; and volume 3 (On Sounds / Music) will see Kevin Beasley as the featured artist.With help from the Knight Foundation, the College for Creative Studies, friends, and supporters Volume 1 of Detroit Research was launched at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Detroit (MOCAD) in March 2015 with resounding success. Since then Detroit Research in collaboration with the College for Creative Studies was the recipient of a Knight Arts Challenge Grant of $30,000 conditional on raising matching funds.Many artists and writers both inside and beyond Detroit and across the arts – McArthur Binion, Michael E. Smith, Leni Sinclair, Vievee Francis, Marie T. Hermann, Tyanna Buie, Paul Kotula, just to name a few – have generously donated works to be sold through Indiegogo in a fundraiser for Detroit Research to meet the Knight Foundation matching fund goal.We invite you to donate, to buy copies of the journal, or any of the great art work donated by artists in support of Detroit Research. Visit our website at www.detroitresearch.org Read Detroit Research Vol. 1 at www.detroitresearch.org/volume1/ ‎

<h3>
<strong><i>“Art washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.”</i></strong><strong><i>  </i></strong><strong><i>~ P. Picasso</i></strong>
</h3>
<p>The artwork becomes interactive when there is a viewer, and the viewer becomes a participant in the scene. Some contemplate gazing at the pieces, and some simply enjoy being surrounded with artworks. Being an artist is not usually a choice; some higher drive pushes us to create whether we are appreciated or not, and we sacrifice so much in the process. Hi, I'm Ozlem Paker, in short 'Oz'... a female multimedia artist born and raised in Istanbul, matured in New York, and currently living in Los Angeles. Being a practicing artist over 20 years, I have been employing concepts such as human psyche, human journey on earth, women's and children's issues, existential issues, etc. As a female being, born in a repressed society, I had to overcome many obstacles throughout all of my education in Turkey. However, these also encouraged me express myself freely, and to be determined to follow my own path.<br/> </p>
<p><i><strong>So, My Dear Art-Lover Friends and Patrons of Arts, I’d like to update you with the recent news of my studio-practice… </strong></i></p>
<p>Just recently, in the beginning of July, I moved from Istanbul to Los Angeles with my family. As you may be aware of the war and political situation in Turkey, as an artist, it has been unbearable to live and work in Turkey. In 2002, we had moved from New York to Istanbul hoping for better days, and they were there for a while. However in the last 8 years, with the oppressive government policies, and with an unvisible-to-naked-eye war, the situation badly escalated, and the hope for better days died. It is unlikely that they will arrive anytime soon.</p>
<p>We are fine, settling in slowly, looking for new projects, contacts and opportunities that life will offer us. My 10-year-old son adapted quickly to his new school and friends. Here, I am hopeful for the future, I appreciate life and I am ready to create openly and freely. In the meantime, I am establishing my new studio, working on new projects, and for that I need your supports by simply being art collectors, in other words art patrons. Because you own some of my work and/or you have expressed interest in my art, here is a great opportunity to own some more. <u>Let's help funding my new studio practice, and feel the satisfaction and joy of being an art patron!</u></p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your contributions, I will part with some of my existing works, and make space for the new ones. I will also be able to effort a larger studio space, a storage for existing pieces, and enough time to progress with my new projects without any distractions, and still will be able to attend my son’s needs while he is adjusting to a new life. Items I need:</p>
<p>• A new video camera<br/>• Video equipment<br/>• Studio equipment<br/>• Canvas, wood, paint and other materials <br/>• Printing budget, etc.</p>
<p><i><strong>All contributors will have the option of receiving original artworks or limited edition prints, and the pride that goes with being a patron of the arts! </strong></i></p>
<p><strong>Contributors will also receive email updates </strong>documenting my process, along with pictures of works in progress. </p>
<p>There’s something for virtually every budget. And remember: <strong>Art makes a very unique gift! </strong></p>
<p>Please examine the several different options that I am offering you. All items here are below their original prices. Once you claim your choice, I will send you the artwork in 1-3 weeks after the campaign ends. You are always welcome for a studio visit, if you’re in or around LA. Please feel free to comment, ask questions and to share this page with friends who you think may support my cause. If you would like to be a recurring patron of my practice, please write to me privately at <a href=""mailto:ozlempaker@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ozlempaker@gmail.com</a>. If your company is looking to give away tax-deductible donations to a 501(c)3 organization, I can also direct you to another link; so, let me know please.</p>

<h3>
<strong>ABOUT THE ARTIST</strong>      </h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Lori Shorin. I'm  a figurative sculptor working in Jersey City, New Jersey. My passion to sculpt the human form led me to study at the <strong>Florence Academy of Art </strong>in Florence, Italy from 2006-2010.  For four years, I was immersed in sculpting, drawing, and studying the anatomy of the human figure.  Countless hours of training prepared me to express my inner visions through the medium of sculpture.</p>
<h3>WHY THE MEAM MUSEUM in BARCELONA, SPAIN?</h3>
<p>The sculpture <i><strong>Spiritual Sisters</strong></i> participated in a three-month  exhibition called Figurativas 2015 at the Museu Europeu d’Art Modern (MEAM museum) in Barcelona, Spain.  Over 2,500 artists competed to have their artworks displayed in this beautiful venue in the Borne section of Barcelona, near the Picasso museum.  MEAM attracts thousands of international visitors each year. Having my sculpture in the permanent collection at MEAM will greatly increase the exposure of my art to a wide variety of individuals from around the world.  When I saw my sculpture in the museum for the opening ceremony of the exhibition, I realized that I had found a new and special home for <i><strong>Spiritual Sisters.</strong></i></p>
<p>MEAM was created by restoring the old Gomis Palace and has been open to the public since 2006. Restoration and purchasing artworks to build a permanent art collection for the museum has been a very costly undertaking. The museum only has partial funds to purchase my sculpture, so I need your help to complete this acquisition. It's important to me that the sculpture is in a collection with other figurative artworks created by my contemporaries. The sculpture will be well maintained and available for many to appreciate now and in the future. Your contributions will help my artwork to be in a place where it can be seen by a large audience.</p>
<h3><strong>FUNDING GOAL</strong></h3>
<h3>
<strong>My funding goal is $43,000. </strong> </h3>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","ABOUT THE ARTIST      
Hi, my name is Lori Shorin. I'm  a figurative sculptor working in Jersey City, New Jersey. My passion to sculpt the human form led me to study at the Florence Academy of Art in Florence, Italy from 2006-2010.  For four years, I was immersed in sculpting, drawing, and studying the anatomy of the human figure.  Countless hours of training prepared me to express my inner visions through the medium of sculpture.
WHY THE MEAM MUSEUM in BARCELONA, SPAIN?
The sculpture Spiritual Sisters participated in a three-month  exhibition called Figurativas 2015 at the Museu Europeu d’Art Modern (MEAM museum) in Barcelona, Spain.  Over 2,500 artists competed to have their artworks displayed in this beautiful venue in the Borne section of Barcelona, near the Picasso museum.  MEAM attracts thousands of international visitors each year. Having my sculpture in the permanent collection at MEAM will greatly increase the exposure of my art to a wide variety of individuals from around the world.  When I saw my sculpture in the museum for the opening ceremony of the exhibition, I realized that I had found a new and special home for Spiritual Sisters.
MEAM was created by restoring the old Gomis Palace and has been open to the public since 2006. Restoration and purchasing artworks to build a permanent art collection for the museum has been a very costly undertaking. The museum only has partial funds to purchase my sculpture, so I need your help to complete this acquisition. It's important to me that the sculpture is in a collection with other figurative artworks created by my contemporaries. The sculpture will be well maintained and available for many to appreciate now and in the future. Your contributions will help my artwork to be in a place where it can be seen by a large audience.
FUNDING GOAL

My funding goal is $43,000.  
This sculpture took about 18 months from the original conception of the idea to final casting in bronze.  I spent many a late night sculpting,  sometimes until sunrise. Beyond my creative time, there were a lot of costs involved in making this sculpture.
The costs for making the Spiritual Sisters sculpture:
 ​
$9,800 for a Silicone mold by professional mold maker.
$300 delivery of clay sculpture to the mold maker 
$12,000 for Bronze casting at the foundry.
$2,775 Shipping USA to Spain, Customs Broker fees
$500 Sculpting materials
$800 Model fees
$650 Videographers for Indiegogo campaign.
$2,500+ Fabrication of the perks. This amount will be higher depending on the quantity of artworks contributors order.
TOTAL COSTS=$29,325 USD
A total of 8% plus transactions fees will be deducted from the total amount raised.
Indiegogo’s platform fee = (5%).
Third party fees for payment processors = 3% plus 30 cents per transaction for credit card.
CREATIVE TIME AND PROCESS:  The initial stages included making drawings and small clay composition sketches until I arrived at the final design. Next, I built the stand and armature, the structure that hoods the clay. The bulk of my creative time,  represents approximately 1,600 hours, was spent sculpting the two figures in clay. I worked with live models, and from imagination. I primarily worked with professional models and periodically had pregnant women pose to better portray the unique qualities of pregnancy.  The mold making process  was done by a professional mold maker.  The next  part is called chasing the wax, which is a preparation for the bronze casting. Once the bronze is cast metal workers have a big job to weld, grind, hammer, and chase the metal in preparation for the patina. The patina is a chemical process in which oxidizes the bronze to give it the rich warm browns and light dusting of green.       
    
In total it was a truly a wonderful experience and a labor of love and I hope you will be inspired to contribute.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Under the helm of HELLHOUNDdesign lies Luka Riot, science fiction and fantasy obsessed artist and self-taught jeweller. Through the GALACTIC MYTHOS series, she uses acrylics to create new galaxies on canvas, elements of our own Earth to channel the stars into jewellery, and metal weaves to form pieces of wearable armour. Bringing the cosmos down to Earth, Luka is now venturing into the illustration world using elements of our world's flora and fauna to create otherworldly beings. What started as extraterrestrial doodles, quickly spiraled into a passion project rushing to reach completion in time for Christmas.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Printing books isn't cheap, and neither are the custom lapel pins we're offering, so here's an outline of where your money will be going:</p>
<ul>
<li>810$ for the initial printing of 100 books</li>
<li>410$ for a limited run of 100 lapel pins</li>
<li>180$ for various printing costs (art prints, pin backing, stickers, etc)</li>
<li>100$ for the paper and pens used to draw the designs</li>
<li>100$ for various packing and shipping materials</li>
<li>80$ for vending space at the Frostbite edition of the Bazaar of the Bizarre in Toronto December 13th, where the book will be officially launched!</li>
</ul>
<p>This leaves 320$ to go towards various fees, graphic design, and other last minute costs that may present themselves (and they always do).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The adult colouring book trend has evolved from a simple need for stress relief among debt-ridden millenials and adults of all ages. The GALACTIC MYTHOS series will provide you with detailed alien lifeforms to bring to life as you see fit, with each design printed on its own sheet of paper to ease the framing of your final work. From one stressed millenial to the world, each detailed page will provide you with hours of calm-down time as you bring these original creations to life.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Self-publishing is full of hurdles, from trying to market a new book with no knowledge of advertising, to the basic need for funding to get going in the first place. Raising credit limits is one option, but we prefer to reach out to our customers. Being a lifelong artist, meeting the print deadline for creation of new aliens is a daunting but manageable task for Luka. We hope to garner enough interest in this campaign to avoid any financial issues from tackling this project on our own.</p>

<h3>Short Summary:</h3>
<p>Black Fox Studios is the game studio name I am looking at to officially produce Die Nachtblume - The Night Flower RPG. That means in addition to working on the game, mapping out events and control flows, we have to register and file a business. Write up business plans. We have the game halfway draft complete (we're continually having testing rounds to improve it as we go), but now it's time to really step up. </p>
<p>You can see the game trailer here: </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is how we reached the number for the total budget: </p>
<ul>
<li>$300 (3 months) goes to Baltimore Game Lab for use of their facilities; </li>
<li>$500 initial marketing budget - $300 of this budget is reserved for logo creation; </li>
<li>$500 for custom music budget;</li>
<li>$1000 for custom pixel art commissions (3 bosses, battlers and field sprites for each) </li>
<li>$200 for business registration and initial fees/costs associated with such; </li>
<li>$100 Steam Greenlight submission fee;</li>
<li>The remainder is padding/overflow due to IGG platform fees/percentages, any rush orders, shipping and handling of any materials like table drop cloths, etc. Basically, a built-in emergency fund. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>A new, woman-owned game studio. Huzzah! Paperwork and all. </li>
<li>A game. A GAME. Also: with key mapping / controller support and a chance to be on Steam!</li>
<li>Commercial games require money to start up, and unfortunately in the past I have been focused on keeping a roof over my head. Homelessness means no game work can be done. The funds I have raised in the past, though, have enabled me to get some custom assets for Chapters 1 and 2, such as several tracks (the Trumlui Cathedral theme, the battle theme, the theme for the Arcadia segment in Chapter 2...) and helped me demo the game at Playcrafting NYC in 2015.  I want this to get off the ground, with your help! </li>
<li>Also, it's an RPG with vampires in it. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have crowdfunded towards this game before. But I made the mistake of aiming too low ($800), and at the time, I was also fighting homelessness. Not a good combination to try and do creative works. The money raised did, however, go into paying artists for what I have in the game so far: custom music (such as the battle theme, cathedral music, and two forest themes), and in obtaining licenses for art packs and additional music packs used in Die Nachtblume. </p>
<ul>
<li>I am the only person working on programming/map tiling/dialogue, so there may be delays due to balancing my own survival needs (shelter, food, medicine) with game development.</li>
<li>Even if I am not fully funded, the game will still release - it will just take longer.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign!</li>
<li>If you really can't share, there are other things you can do, that are longer term than backing a campaign. Encourage a kid to get into tech, especially if they're from a marginalized community. Or volunteer at your local library. Don't dismiss someone's dreams out of hand. Stories are powerful.  Encourage them.</li>
</ul>

$200 for business registration and initial fees/costs associated with such; 
$100 Steam Greenlight submission fee;
The remainder is padding/overflow due to IGG platform fees/percentages, any rush orders, shipping and handling of any materials like table drop cloths, etc. Basically, a built-in emergency fund. 


The Impact
 

A new, woman-owned game studio. Huzzah! Paperwork and all. 
A game. A GAME. Also: with key mapping / controller support and a chance to be on Steam!
Commercial games require money to start up, and unfortunately in the past I have been focused on keeping a roof over my head. Homelessness means no game work can be done. The funds I have raised in the past, though, have enabled me to get some custom assets for Chapters 1 and 2, such as several tracks (the Trumlui Cathedral theme, the battle theme, the theme for the Arcadia segment in Chapter 2...) and helped me demo the game at Playcrafting NYC in 2015.  I want this to get off the ground, with your help! 
Also, it's an RPG with vampires in it. 


Risks & Challenges
I have crowdfunded towards this game before. But I made the mistake of aiming too low ($800), and at the time, I was also fighting homelessness. Not a good combination to try and do creative works. The money raised did, however, go into paying artists for what I have in the game so far: custom music (such as the battle theme, cathedral music, and two forest themes), and in obtaining licenses for art packs and additional music packs used in Die Nachtblume. 

I am the only person working on programming/map tiling/dialogue, so there may be delays due to balancing my own survival needs (shelter, food, medicine) with game development.
Even if I am not fully funded, the game will still release - it will just take longer.


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Share this campaign!
If you really can't share, there are other things you can do, that are longer term than backing a campaign. Encourage a kid to get into tech, especially if they're from a marginalized community. Or volunteer at your local library. Don't dismiss someone's dreams out of hand. Stories are powerful.  Encourage them.

And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

</p><h3><b></b></h3><p><span style=""font-size: 24px;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><h3>ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN</h3><p></p>
<p>Dear friends, colleagues and supporters, </p>
<p>Earlier this year I was accepted to Yale's MFA Program. I
also just found out I’ve been selected to participate in <a href=""http://www.skowheganart.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Skowhegan School of Painting &amp; Sculpture</a>, a summer artist residency in Maine and one of the
most prestigious residencies around. This has come as a pleasant surprise. However, having to relocate to New Haven has left
me financially strapped, and now preparing for Skowhegan presents another challenge.</p>
<p>I’ve created this Indiegogo campaign to give perks in
exchange for your support to help me get to Skowhegan, and make new work when I
get there.</p>
<p>Skowhegan accepts 65 artists from a pool of 2000 applicants
each year. The intensive nine-week summer session, held in Maine, provides a
collaborative and rigorous environment for artistic creation, risk-taking, and
mentorship. Alumni often report that the intensity of the Skowhegan experience
has had a profound effect on their work and their lives. In order to allow
others entry to the program, no participants are allowed to return for a second
summer. It is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
<p>I’m excited for this opportunity because it would provide me
with the time, space, and facilities to experiment and challenge my practice.
As a result, I would also be able to create new work to give to contributors of
this campaign.</p>
<h3><b>GOAL &amp; PERKS</b></h3>
<p><b>I need to raise
$5,700 in four weeks.</b></p>
<p>Contributors will help me with paying the fees for
Skowhegan, transportation, printing materials, equipment (2 strobe lights, 2 soft
boxes, 2 light stands, 1 reflector, 1 battery for camera, and a 35mm lens), and
shipping costs. </p>
<p>In return, I’m offering:</p>
<ol>
<li>Personalized poetry</li>
<li>Inkjet Prints ranging in
     size from 4” x 6”, 8” x 10”, to 16” x 20”. All prints will be printed on
     Canson Baryta Photographique museum grade photo paper with a quarter inch
     border on the top and side. All content will come signed with a personal thank
     you note.</li>
<li>For a more generous donation, you will receive a 20 image portfolio of 13” x 19” prints of your choice from one of three bodies of work I’ve created, in addition to one new 13” x 19” print I will create at Skowhegan, and an 8.5” x 11” calendar created at Skowhegan.<span style=""background-color: initial;""></span>

<h3><b>CAN’T DONATE?</b></h3>
<p>Please share this Indiegogo campaign on your social media or

with others will help me as much as any donation. Even the smallest help I get

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.gregmasonburns.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greg Mason Burns</a>, and I'm a visual artist and former journalist from Maine. I am redefining Surrealism with this <i>tax-deductible</i> project, the latter of which was initially developed during a five-year period that I spent in Brazil. It was inspired by the process of the eventual 2016 political coup d'etat and impeachment of Brazil's president.</p>
<p>I was motivated to pursue this project by the biased media reports in favor of the impeachment process. There were people in favor of impeachment and those against it, and the media, particularly the network Globo, heavily reported in favor and essentially ignored those who opposed. Thus a gap was created between the media's message and the audience's understanding of what they believed to be true. Knowing that this gap exists everywhere, and can be particularly seen in this year's US elections, I decided to take the idea of this ""gap"" to another level.</p>
<p>I am asking a specific question about this gap: <u><strong>What would that gap look like if it were an actual place instead of just a state of mind?</strong></u> </p>
<p>In other words, if this gap were a real place, what would its people look like? Its churches? Schools? Cars? What would it feel like to live there? Can you imagine that? Would you like to?</p>
<p>The name Novo-surrealism was inspired by the events in Brazil (hence the Portuguese word novo (""new"" in English)) and the surreal idea that this ""gap"" could actually be a real place. This is how I am redefining Surrealism.</p>
<p>This residency, in Lisbon, Portugal called <a href=""http://www.zaratan.pt/en/residencies/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Zaratan Air</a>, is crucial to the project's success because it will allow me to develop the idea more. </p>
<h3>During the residency I will</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create a secret work of art (shared only by those who select a perk that includes this)</li>
<li>Work on a community-fed website that will help to redefine how the audience interacts with the media (see video)</li>
<li>Finalize a plan for launching and exhibiting the website</li>
<li>Create various studies for future work for two exhibits in 2017 and for the perks for this campaign</li>
</ul>
<h3>How the funds will be used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Travel expenses from Maine to Portugal and back, and also around Portugal itself</li>
<li>The cost of the residency itself</li>
<li>Art supplies</li>
<li>Time away from the real world to create a solid timeline and more defined strategic steps.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When you think about how the news portrays the candidates, how do you feel? How do you feel when one brand of cell phone company tells you that they are better than another, and then the other says the same thing about the first company? Do you feel as if you don't know who to trust or that it all may be just a big joke? This project examines that gap of faith that everyone knows exists but the media ignores.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help me move this project forward from the conception stage to finished product by the end of 2017. By helping in this stage, you are setting up the potential to create a piece of interactive art (the website) that will give the you a voice that tells the media you're paying attention.</p>
<p>I need this residency period to build the foundation for the tangible finished product, of which you can possibly be one of the first participants on the above noted community website when it goes live in September 2017.</p>

<h3>Hope and Survival is a piece of history immortalized in a work of art by Nova Scotian Laurie Swim. </h3>
<p>In December 2017 it will be 100 years since the largest man-made explosion before Hiroshima rocked Halifax Harbour killing 4% of the city's population!</p>
<p>Laurie Swim is a Nova Scotian fibre artist known for her large-scale community art projects. For the past 4 years, she has been working on a monumental memorial quilt ""Hope and Survival"" dedicated to those killed or injured during the explosion. The artwork consists of two elements: The Scroll of Remembrance 4' h x 36' w (1.1 m x 11m) and the Hope and Survival centrepiece 8' h x 12' w (2.4 m x 3.6 m). It will be the only memorial of the explosion listing the names of all the dead in beaded Braille — completed with the help of 400 volunteers — on a ""Scroll of Remembrance,"" in recognition of those left with eye injuries from the blast.</p>

<p><i>""...Laurie Swim believes in her subjects. She is able to choose fabrics whose textures she understands. And with this understanding she is able to bring warmth and comfort to even the most demanding of her quilts.""</i> Mary Pratt, 2007</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Teresa MacInnes and Kent Nason from Sea to Sea Productions are filmmakers based in Nova Scotia. They have been documenting Laurie's progress over the past 4 years. They made the short film included above, and are working on a longer piece showing the creative process and insights of the artist. It will accompany the completed quilt on display at the Halifax International Airport, at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic, and at gallery and museum installations in the future.</p>

<p>Based on Laurie's research for the quilt, she has also written a children's book called ""Hope and Survival: A Story of the Halifax Explosion"" using elements from the quilt as illustration. She plans to publish this book in the summer of 2017.</p>
<h3>About the Artist</h3>
<p>Laurie Swim has been making art for 40 years. In 2013 she was awarded Nova Scotia's <strong>Portia White Prize for Cultural and Artistic Excellence</strong>. Her work is in many private and public collections, including the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, the City of Toronto Art Collection, and the Museum of Arts and Design in New York. She has originated six monumental art projects. Completed with the help of volunteers, the resulting art is an effective means for bringing issues to public attention to institute cultural change, to raise awareness, and to celebrate the creativity of a group effort.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>HAUS OF started out as a conversation about our upset over the busyness of city life and a real interest in building a fun-filled creative arts community that could be accessible to everyone. <strong>We noticed that we and many of our friends were unhappy with the hum-drum monotony of daily life. We noticed that there were many vulnerable groups in London that were not properly connected to arts therapies that would deeply benefit them. </strong>HAUS OF is built on the solid belief that everyone should be able to access hands on creative time so that they can be as happy as possible. Starting HAUS OF seemed like the most obvious solution. </li>
<li>This campaign is the first of its kind. This is our first attempt at crowdfunding, so we have set our sights high! It's incredible that our company has developed so much since it began in December 2018. <strong>We need YOU</strong> to help us put down roots in East London in summer 2019 so that we can really make an impact.</li>
<li>Funding is dwindling from the government to local charities who help the vulnerable groups that HAUS OF seeks to help. <strong>We're taking it into our own hands to give back to the community. Mental health and homelessness are now considered a crisis and populations needing assistance are forecast to grow. </strong>NHS resources aren't sufficient enough. It's time we do something to lift the strain.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>We need a total of £3,000 from this campaign</strong>, a realistic goal we've set for this platform. We really need a total of £16,000 to make this project work, but we know that £3,000 will give us much needed start-up resources. </li>
<li>If you pledge, we'd like to thank you with lots of gifts! (see below)</li>
<li>We are putting these funds toward a studio, tools and cost of running our classes. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The contribution you will make will be <strong>FUNDAMENTAL</strong> to the success of our business. </p>
<ul>
<li>Rough sleeping and mental illness are considered a crisis in London. <strong>People in these categories deserve art therapies that are low cost or free.</strong> HAUS OF is special because we offer a myriad of art classes under one roof. </li>
<li>We've already held successful classes and we're building partnerships with local organisations right now to help us expand our reach! </li>
<li>We, the founders of HAUS OF, have both suffered with addiction and mental illness for many years. HAUS OF was born out of frustration that there are few places of refuge to access truly wholesome experiences in London. London is a hot spot for partying and alcohol, but when it comes to improving mental health and sticking to a healthy lifestyle, finding ways to socialise that don't involve lots of money or alcohol were hard to come by. <strong>HAUS OF is a place that focuses on building community and fun-filled experiences apart from the hustle and bustle of chaotic city life. </strong>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we don't raise a total of £16,000 across all crowdfunding platforms we will not be able to move into a physical studio that we have put a down payment on. In this case, we'll have to think about ways to continue HAUS OF, whether this is continuing crowdfunding into summer 2019 or thinking up something even more adventurous. </p>
<ul>
<li>We've been working in charity, government and the arts for years. We know how to develop strong partnerships, grow membership, talk to press and market ourselves. </li>
<li>In May 2019 this business<strong> won the creative category of the Big Idea Competition hosted by the Accelerator of London Metropolitan University</strong>. We have garnered support and have plenty of people cheering us on.</li>
<li>We're partnering with local charities who help us front the cost of our workshops too. Working with vulnerable groups is at the heart of our business concept.</li>

<p><strong>The Story Behind <i>Feline Frequencies</i></strong></p>
<p>We're Sean Ryan and Phil Vasta, creators of Soundspring Studio. We're a new music production studio, trying hard to break into the world of audio for games, film, and other forms of multimedia. While that continues to take shape, we've decided to use our resources to create an album that combines our music with something equally delightful - cats!</p>
<p>As cat owners, we can attest to the positives of having them in our lives. They are curious (sometimes mischievous!) little friends, sources of genuine laughter, and a soothing presence. They are, in a word, family.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the most beautiful aspects of cats is their semi-unique ability to purr. It is this ability that inspired us to write <i>Feline Frequencies</i>. By merging recorded purrs with original music, we hope to bring these wonderful sounds to those who cannot bring cats into their households. In fact, purrs may not only be pleasant to hear; studies have shown <a href=""http://archive.news.indiana.edu/releases/iu/2015/06/internet-cat-video-research.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">correlations </a>to certain <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3317329/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">medical benefits</a>.</p>
<p>If you value animals as we do, we'd love to have you on board as a contributor! To be clear, <i>Feline Frequencies</i> is finished - written, mixed, and mastered - so its release is not a question of ""if"" but of ""when"" (which we strongly anticipate to be early Summer 2018). Thus, any contributions will help Soundspring Studio to recoup the costs of creating this album, allowing us to continue to create as we cement ourselves as a credible source of talent in our industry. Last but certainly not least, 15% of all funds will be donated to a carefully selected animal shelter/organization.</p>
<p><strong>The Perks</strong></p>
<p>In order to successfully cover the costs of creating <i>Feline Frequencies</i>, making perks (we'll get to that in a second), and donating to a shelter, we've determined that we need to raise $3,000.</p>
<p>So what will you actually get when you contribute? We have perks ranging from digital wallpaper for your computer or phone, a downloadable copy of Feline Frequencies, and poster prints of the album art (created in part by <a href=""https://www.byjayciemota.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jaycie Mota</a>). And for one contributor, Soundspring Studio will write a dedicated track just for your pet!</p>
<p>If you're unable to contribute but still want to help, please consider telling your friends and family, as well as sharing this campaign on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. And of course, sign up for updates on the album's release!</p>
<p><strong>Help Us Help You Help Us</strong></p>
<p>We truly appreciate your interest in helping Soundspring Studio in the release of our first album, <i>Feline Frequencies</i>. It's been a long road, but with a great collection of music and perks, we really think we have something special on our hands. Thank you!</p>

While that continues to take shape, we've decided to use our resources to create an album that combines our music with something equally delightful - cats!
As cat owners, we can attest to the positives of having them in our lives. They are curious (sometimes mischievous!) little friends, sources of genuine laughter, and a soothing presence. They are, in a word, family.
Of course, one of the most beautiful aspects of cats is their semi-unique ability to purr. It is this ability that inspired us to write Feline Frequencies. By merging recorded purrs with original music, we hope to bring these wonderful sounds to those who cannot bring cats into their households. In fact, purrs may not only be pleasant to hear; studies have shown correlations to certain medical benefits.
If you value animals as we do, we'd love to have you on board as a contributor! To be clear, Feline Frequencies is finished - written, mixed, and mastered - so its release is not a question of ""if"" but of ""when"" (which we strongly anticipate to be early Summer 2018). Thus, any contributions will help Soundspring Studio to recoup the costs of creating this album, allowing us to continue to create as we cement ourselves as a credible source of talent in our industry. Last but certainly not least, 15% of all funds will be donated to a carefully selected animal shelter/organization.
The Perks
In order to successfully cover the costs of creating Feline Frequencies, making perks (we'll get to that in a second), and donating to a shelter, we've determined that we need to raise $3,000.
So what will you actually get when you contribute? We have perks ranging from digital wallpaper for your computer or phone, a downloadable copy of Feline Frequencies, and poster prints of the album art (created in part by Jaycie Mota). And for one contributor, Soundspring Studio will write a dedicated track just for your pet!
If you're unable to contribute but still want to help, please consider telling your friends and family, as well as sharing this campaign on Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter. And of course, sign up for updates on the album's release!
Help Us Help You Help Us
We truly appreciate your interest in helping Soundspring Studio in the release of our first album, Feline Frequencies. It's been a long road, but with a great collection of music and perks, we really think we have something special on our hands. Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
