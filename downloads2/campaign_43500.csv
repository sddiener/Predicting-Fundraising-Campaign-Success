Glad you asked! Tell people about this campaign! You might not have a penny to your name (we know the feeling!) but you might have friends or followers who spend $150 on breakfast alone. Help them find us & support us! Indiegogo has plenty of easy share tools for you to make use of, and it could just take a few seconds to share our campaign & another few seconds for that friend of yours with a big heart and a big wallet to find us. Having said that, we’re happy for Every. Single. Cent.
 
Sid Spidersnake loves you. Thanks for reading & thank you for your support!

All watches pre ordered get a 3 year warranty!But our journey is not finished yet, you can have the chance and support the WICKED WATCH CO. and receive your bronze diver at exclusive offerings. In case you haven't heard of us yet, here is our introduction:Codename: PEARL DIVERLocation: Aesch BL, SwitzerlandBrand: WICKED WATCH CO.  THE CASEThe PEARL DIVER is made of CuSn8 Bronze. The dive watch features a uni-directional 120 clicks bezel, screw-down crown, drilled lugs for easy strap removal, and is up to 200 m / 20 ATM waterproof. It comes with 2 variations.NH35A CaseWe keep the case as compact as possible--- 40 mm in diameter (43.80 mm including the crown), lug to lug size is 46 mm and the lug width is 22 mm. The thickness of the timepiece is 13.77 mm including the crystal. The slight domed sapphire crystal with multi layer (5 Layers) anti-reflective coating (blueish) and a fully lumed CusN8 bezel insert, are just two of the highlights.STP1-11 CaseThanks to the slimmer movement, we are able to create a thinner watch, this case is 12.50 mm in height, including the double domed sapphire (11.50 mm without sapphire).  THE BEZEL INSERTThe bezel has a 120 click uni-directional mechanism and feature a bronze insert. The markers at are engraved deeper than usual to be able to hold more lume.  THE CASE BACKThe screw-down case back features as tribute to our hometown Basel, the ""Basilisk Dragon"" as motif.You can read more about the mythic creature here: WIKIPEDIA LINK or here moreThe NH35A version will feature a 316L stainless steel case back, while the STP1-11 will have a titanium grade 2 case back. Our Bronze Diver is a limited Edition of 500 pieces per colour and movement. A serial number will be engraved on each case back.  THE SAPPHIRENH35A CaseOur sapphire crystal is 3.80 mm thick and 30.00 mm in diameter in the NH35A Automatic Model. The slight domed design gives it a very special look. The crystal features a blue shimmer multi layer antireflective coating (5 layers) on the inside. STP1-11 CaseThe crystal on the STP1-11 Automatic Model is 3 mm thick and has a double domed structure. The sapphire is 100% made in Switzerland, manufactured by SEBAL SA, a Swiss company with over 40 years of experience in crafting sapphire for famous Swiss watch brands.The Swiss made sapphire features a very special AR coating called ARunic® by Econorm.The premium two-sided colourless AR coating provides the sapphire with the following features: THE MOVEMENTOur mission is to develop stylish yet affordable watches for all watch lovers against the soaring watch prices nowadays. With that goal in mind, we did research on many different movement suppliers such as ETA, Seiko, Miyota, Sellita, etc.; the secret boiled down to one specific movement = SEIKO'S NH35A.WHY?The NH35A is a power horse par excellence, within the same price range this movement is unmatched in reliability, accuracy and durability.Using this mechanical movement allows us to offer the PEARL DIVER at an unbeatable price. BUTWe know some people prefer Swiss Movements, that's why we chose to offer our PEARL DIVER with an upgrade to STP1-11. The mechanical movement is made in Switzerland and offers these specification: 
Hours, minutes, sweep second
Date, rapid corrector
Stop second device
Self-winding mechanism with ball bearing
28'800 vibrations per hour, 4 Hz.
26 jewels
Power reserve 44 hours
average rate; -0/+15 sec/d
Producer info: STP
 This movement from one of the newer supplier (Swiss Technology Production since 2006) was tested by our watch maker and approved. You can choose between the following movements: 
NH35A (Date)
NH38 (No date)
STP1-11 (Date)
STP1-11 (No date complication, no ghost position)
 THE STRAPSYour PEARL DIVER comes with a genuine Italian leather strap with crazy horse treatment. The leather strap is 22 mm wide on the lugs and tappers down to 18 mm at the buckle. Choose between vintage brown or black.  The leather strap is not made for diving as everyone knows. Your timepiece will come with a fluoro rubber (natural rubber) strap with fitted and hardened endlinks. This premium rubber strap allows your watch to enter the darkside of the sea !  Every strap comes with the bronze buckle with a lumed logo engraved.    The last strap that comes with the PEARL DIVER is the high quality nato strap, made of soft woven nylon and bronze hardware.   THE DIALAfter a quite intense discussion about our first dial version, we decided to completely redefine it. You will find our dial with the hour glass at 12 o'clock, round pearls on the hours in between and ""long"" pearls at 9 and 6 (and 3 for no date versions). Our dial bases are made of recycled brass from Switzerland and Japan. The WICKED text will be replaced with our W logo made with Lumicast.MAGPIE - forged carbon  CROW - black grainy textured dial PHOENIX - forged carbon with gold dust BASILISK - Green sunburst dial CARDINAL - Red fumée dial RAVEN - Black MOP dial (Grade AAA) THE HANDSOur handsets are coated with N5 rose gold coating. They are brushed and cut with highest precision from our trusted supplier. The second hand features our Anchor logo,  with a pointy end and red finish, filled with same lume as the other hands. The arrow hour and sword-like minute hand help you read the time easier and at one glance.All hands feature the same superior grade Swiss Super-LumiNova® like on the bezel insert and dial. This generates a homogenous look of the lume. THE LUMEThe creation of best luminous power/effect of our PEARL DIVER was a core task for us. We want to have lume as bright as possible and clean without shadows. CREATE A WICKED LUME BEAST. We did our research and optimized the design for a great lume effect, for example: Our bezel insert is higher than usual, for deeper engravings = more pigments can fit in = better lume performance.The default lume will be Swiss Super-LumiNova® C3 ef GL, X1 Superior Grade, but for our kickstarter campaign, we give you the chance to customize your lume to either C3, Old Radium or BGW-9 instead. These parts will have the lume applied: Bezel insert, crown, buckle, dial and hands.For best glowing results we guarantee that we use the premium products of RC Tritec AG the swiss manufacture of Swiss Super-LumiNova®. Our lume is 100% guaranteed Swiss made. BGW-9 GRADE A ef C3 Grade X1 GL ef How good is our lume?

He personally assembled and regulated more than 300 movements of the famous 7750 VALJOUX automatic. He and his team will ensure our high quality standards and will assemble the watches carefully with Swiss precision.  THE PRODUCTIONWe don't hide the origin of our watches. We are a SWISS brand, with manufacturer partners in Shenzhen, the famous metropolis in Southern China, Switzerland and other countries. We work with professional watch part suppliers that have served various brands from Switzerland or Germany for more than 20 years, some do it for more than 40 years (our Swiss sapphire supplier as an example). We are confident about our quality.The mix of swiss and international manufactures allow us to offer you the watch on Indiegogo and later for a good price. To ensure the quality of every single WICKED WATCH, we sourced and tested all materials ourselves. For example the sapphire crystal, the luminous powder, the movements, just to name a few. We have been on this journey for more than 2 years, and we are just at the beginning.Our mission has always been: deliver the best quality/price ratio.THE REVIEWSTake a look at what independent watch reviewers say about our PEARL DIVER wristwatch.Random Rob ""Wicked Watch Co Pearl Diver""   WatchChris ""Wicked Watch Co The Pearl Diver - INSANE BLINDING LUME - Bronze Swiss Made Automatic $329""

Watch Addiction Watch Reviews Consigli per gli acquisti You can find all reviews here: https://www.wickedwatch.ch/reviews THE TIMELINE FULL SPECS STP1-11BEHIND THE SCENESArranging NH35A prototypesVideoshootingPhotoshooting THE BOXWe have been thinking long time about the box..... What shall we do, keep the original design with the cork box, or do we completely change it. Eventually we decided to go with the second option. Who uses these big heavy boxes anyway?!We offer our bronze pearl diver with our hand made, genuine leather travel pouch for up to 3 watches. We selected the vintage brown leather with crazy horse treatment (wax) to achieve a nice vintage look. On the inside we covered the leather with a microfiber to protect the watches from rough surfaces. Custom made wallets for manual, tools etc. A SPECIAL THANKSAt this point I would like to take a minute and thank some people that supported me so far.... First of all my beautiful wife, she is my motivation to keep going and creating beautiful watches! Without her support, I wouldn't be able to make this project happen. Thank you so much my soulmate! I love you!The next one goes to my team and suppliers, I know it can be very difficult to deal with me and my wishes. So thank you for being patient and deliver what I want, what I really really want! :-D Can't wait for our next project! The next shout out goes to the reviewer, they have done a great job testing our prototypes and gave us essential feedbacks for improvements. And of course, a big thank you to every backer that supports this project! You will be the ones that make it actually happen at the end. With your support we are able to follow our dreams!  CHANGESSome features of the watches change on the production version, here you find what:
Shorter hour hand, a bit longer second hand
Spring bars instead of screw bars for easier strap removal
15 min track on the bezel insert
NH35A Sapphire will have a blue shimmer AR-Coating
STP1-11 dials will have SWISS MADE printed at 6 o'clock
STP1-11 has titanium grade 2 case back
Anchor logos on buckle and crown exchanged with our W logo
WICKED on the logo disappears and our W logo made with lumicast will replace it
 If you have any questions please do not bother contacting us, we are glad to help you. THE STRETCH GOALS THE SHIPPINGIf everything goes smooth as planned, the watches can be shipped in September 2021 (NH-Series) and October 2021 (STP-Series). We are keeping our followers with posts here or in our Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/wickedwatchco updated.  THE END",46.0,6,"1 Campaign

The thermos-chemical process* diffuses nitrogen into the surface of the 316L, bombarding the surface with energetic nitrogen ions, which allow nitrogen ions to diffuse and form a case-hardened surface (Note: This is NOT a “coating” process per se that merely applying a thin layer of covering e.g. powder, epoxy, electroplating or chrome, which supposes to be a “shell” or “skin” over the metal which will eventually peel, crack or flake off due to lack of adhesion between the covering the substrate).  Through the heat treatment process, the 316L will not only become more scratch-resistant, but its performance, working lifespan, strain limit, and fatigue strength will also be enhanced, other advantages of this process are the low-temperature range to avoid shape distortion and maintaining 316L corrosion resistance properties.</p><p><strong>*Note. </strong>This heat-treating process has existed since the 1920s; however, it only started gaining popularity in the last three decades. Due to its increasing popularity, further developments were made to create a more efficient process that can be accurately controlled with lower costs.  Vesuviate Watches is neither the inventor nor the proprietary owner of this industrial heat-treating process (Disclaimer – The use of such a process does not infringe the Patents or other intellectual property rights of any Third Party).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619507852/nxucsnji7chulcauvavo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619507941/kjieu3pof6jd6shpqovv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619507911/kbtftufljwvagtrnhdhh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619507968/gygqsvdkyromyox7q091.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619507994/vtmjelf0nwlfeksfayud.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619508015/riyvmo6lkikjqmtatcpy.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Case Dimensions</strong> – 39mm width with a lug-to-lug length of 46.2mm.  The overall thickness is 11.00mm measured at the apex of the sapphire (dome height 0.55mm), thus making it a rather slim tool-watch with a thickness of just 10.45mm.

Following are some of the preliminary changes for the production model:
Lume Super-LumiNova – BGW9 for the hour and minute hands will be applied thicker to brighten the hands lume further.
Black dial will retain the original prototype color as per all the feedback I have received, as some referred to as dark chocolate brown or coffee color.
The red dial will have chrome second-hand.
Miyota 9015 will be Gilt (factory gold plated) instead of standard.
Leather straps add-on to Attivo with center links and custom-made genuine leather straps are now available, consist of leather straps, deployant clasp and center links (sold separately, in case you would like extra leather straps), pictures below are for illustration purposes only.
All pictures, technical drawings, renderings and videos belong to Vesuviate, except the Miyota 9015 caliber pictures which belong to Citizen Watch Co., Ltd.Case & Bracelets:  Stainless steel 316L with case/surface hardening heat treatment.  SS 316L has very low carbon content with a maximum of only 0.035% and has corrosion and magnetic resistance; hence, it is widely used in the food and medical industries, as well as diving equipment and marine applications.  Despite its relatively good hardness @ 222HV (HV = Vickers Hardness) compared to the 904L @ 149HV, we have decided to use case hardening heat treatment to harden the surface of the 316L to the hardness value of 1,100HV +/- 10% to improve the wear resistance further. The thermos-chemical process* diffuses nitrogen into the surface of the 316L, bombarding the surface with energetic nitrogen ions, which allow nitrogen ions to diffuse and form a case-hardened surface (Note: This is NOT a “coating” process per se that merely applying a thin layer of covering e.g. powder, epoxy, electroplating or chrome, which supposes to be a “shell” or “skin” over the metal which will eventually peel, crack or flake off due to lack of adhesion between the covering the substrate).  Through the heat treatment process, the 316L will not only become more scratch-resistant, but its performance, working lifespan, strain limit, and fatigue strength will also be enhanced, other advantages of this process are the low-temperature range to avoid shape distortion and maintaining 316L corrosion resistance properties.*Note. This heat-treating process has existed since the 1920s; however, it only started gaining popularity in the last three decades. Due to its increasing popularity, further developments were made to create a more efficient process that can be accurately controlled with lower costs.  Vesuviate Watches is neither the inventor nor the proprietary owner of this industrial heat-treating process (Disclaimer – The use of such a process does not infringe the Patents or other intellectual property rights of any Third Party).Case Dimensions – 39mm width with a lug-to-lug length of 46.2mm.  The overall thickness is 11.00mm measured at the apex of the sapphire (dome height 0.55mm), thus making it a rather slim tool-watch with a thickness of just 10.45mm. (at edge height).Crown:  7mm diameter, screw-down SS 316L.Bracelets Dimensions:  24mm connected with central links at 16mm between the lugs with solid links, butterfly deployant clasp – 22mm.  All components SS 316L, case/surface-hardened.Watch Crystal:  2.55mm thick Domed Sapphire Crystal with five (5) layers of quarter-wavelength interference coatings that give consistently low reflectance over a wide visible spectrum.  (Note. The quality of the Anti-Reflection depends upon the number of layers/stack coatings applied to the crystals).  Sapphire is chosen in favor of mineral crystal for its resistance to scratches and shattering.  Similar to Ceramic, the hardness of Sapphire is 2,000HV.Lume:  Super-LumiNova – BGW9 (Day - White, Night - Blue-Green), Grade A pigment is chosen for its excellent afterglow performance.  This material is 100% Swiss-made, non-radioactive, REACH compatible, high temperature, environmental resistance, and complies with ISO 3157:1991 requirements.Water Resistance:  Rating - 10 ATM / 100m / 330ft.  This watch is designed to withstand underwater depths of at least 100 meters which meets the ISO 6425 requirement.  Hence, it is safe for recreational sports such as swimming, free/skin diving.Case back:  Exhibition flat Sapphire Crystal with inner anti-reflective (AR) coating.Movement/Caliber – The heart of the watch - Miyota 9015 Gilt caliber, is considered to be the workhorse of the industry. Since 2009, it's been widely considered to be a proven movement that is easy to service; it is also one of the slimmest automatic calibers at just 3.90mm thick.  It is equipped with quick date correction via hacking – i.e. time setting with the second-hand halt mechanism, self-winding – unidirectional, 24 jewels and with a typical power reserve of 42 hours, frequency of 28,800 beats per hour, 4 Hz (Eight vibrations a second, providing a smooth action second hand but unlike the high-beat movements i.e. ≥36,000 vph that are subject to strain on their internal workings that required more frequent maintenance to deal with the added friction), accuracy of -10 ~ +30 second (per day).  Note: Miyota just started offering the fully factory original gilt plated caliber for their 9015 from 2019; you can be assured that you have the newest caliber from Miyota.Note:  The production model will have the factory gold plated Cal. 9015 Gilt instead of the standard Cal. 9015 as shown in this picture.Note:  The production model will have the factory gold plated Cal. 9015 Gilt as per this picture of Vesuviate previous model – Doppio.Warranty:   Our watch is warranted for two (2) years from the date of purchase against any and all manufacturer’s defects.  Any damage resulting from improper handling, extreme use, accident, or negligence is not covered under this warranty.Original RenderingTechnical DrawingTechnical DrawingTechnical DrawingTechnical DrawingTechnical DrawingTechnical Drawing       A poll was conducted with the members of the Micro-Brand Watches Groups to determine the majority sentiment of a wooden presentation box or travel watch case and the vast majority prefer travel watch cases rather than another box. This travel case has been selected as it can hold up to two watches but is also comfortable to carry around with you, yet small enough to fit in your hand luggage.  How many layers of luminous (Lume) on the dial markers and hands?Luminous phosphorescent (in short – Lume) comprises pigments and a binder (i.e. varnish).  After mixed, the mixture will be applied with an applicator to “flow” evenly over the hands and markers in one go to achieve a smooth finish (this is unlike paint where you would brush over or spray layers onto the surface, and is more like pouring onto the workpiece like pancake batter).  To achieve a strong lume, larger particle-sized pigments can be used, but this will make it difficult to achieve a really smooth finish; alternatively, we have decided to use top-quality pigments instead.  We have therefore chosen to use Super-LumiNova Grade A.Is the watch scratch-proof?No, the watch is scratch-resistant; we have increased the hardness of the 316L from 222HV to the hardness value of 1,100HV +/- 10% to further improve the wear resistance (i.e. almost five times, which is equivalent to the hardness of hard chrome).  In our daily lives, there are many objects that have higher hardness values such as steel tools e.g. the hardened tip of a screwdriver or other tools with applied diamond coating or tungsten carbide (1,600HV) which are as hard as or harder than the watch and are capable of scratching its surface.Case Diameter – 39mmA square watch of 39mm has more surface area than a round watch of 39mm.

However, keeping up with the required regular cleaning is near-impossible with just hand-washing because it is tedious, time-consuming and impractical. 

With hand-washing still the only cleaning method for makeup brushes and sponges, it's no surprise that only 6.5% of us bother at all. Requiring standing over the sink scrubbing away for several minutes and using several liters of water to clean and rinse your tools, it is a time-consuming, wasteful, impractical and ineffective process that usually ends in failure and frustration.Persistent makeup stains, rips from nails digging into the delicate surface of sponges, soap residue lodged deep in the pores, shedding brush fibers, dry hands from the prolonged exposure to water and total destruction from suspect hacks are only a few of the failings of the routine.​ 

You use machines to clean your dishes and laundry......because they are repetitive tasks, and machines save time, energy and overall hassle. In the same way, cleaning of your makeup tools is a repetitive task that is a machine’s job, which is the reason we created FACE IT 2-IN-1!FACE IT 2-IN-1 is the world’s first washing machine that cleans both makeup brushes & sponges without hassle & effort.FACE IT 2-IN-1 conveniently switches between brush and sponge washing, cleaning several brushes within 3 minutes and sponges within 5 minutes, all without damaging the brush hairs or ripping the sponges. It is completely mess-free, kills 99% of germs, removes all makeup stains, rinses out completely without odor and saves water. 

This is all the evidence you need to see how FACE IT 2-IN-1 effortlessly cleans both makeup brushes & sponges.
Watch how FACE IT cleans your makeup sponges...

 
...and watch how FACE IT cleans your makeup brushes.
 

 
   Never use a grimy, dirty brush or sponge on your skin again. FACE IT 2-IN-1 antibacterial cleanser kills 99% of bacteria and completely removes stubborn makeup stains regardless of the shade.   FACE IT 2-IN-1 easily switches from brush to sponge cleaning. Simply detach the sponge-cleaning brush, then attach the brush-holder to the lid. Simple!   The oscillating cleaning mat is gentle on the smooth surfaces of sponges and do not cause rips and tears. They also gently comb through your brush hairs to remove deep stains without distorting or shedding the brush hairs, whether natural or synthetic.   FACE IT 2-IN-1 uses minimal water compared to hand-washing with a complete cycle requiring only 1 liter of water to wash and rinse thoroughly.  FACE IT switches between two cleaning modes to do the jobs of two machines, hence saving you the cost of two separate machines.     FACE IT is a 2-IN-1 washing machine for both makeup brushes and sponges that eliminates hand-washing so you can conveniently clean your makeup tools whenever you want and as often as you like. Just load your makeup tools, add water, antibacterial cleanser, press start & walk away.  The specially formulated antibacterial cleanser kills 99.99% of germs, completely removes all makeup stains and rinses out cleanly without leaving soap residue or odor. Two substantial machines combined into one saves you the cost of buying 2 separate machines and also clutter on your counter top!   Hand-washing your makeup brushes not only takes effort and time, it also damages and destroys brush hairs because of the aggressive manipulation to remove makeup stains from deep inside the brush hairs. The patent-pending oscillation motion of it cleaning mats allow FACE IT 2-IN-1 to gently remove makeup stains from your makeup tools without damaging them. The consistent motion lifts stains from deep within the tools removing them quickly and effectively without abrasion. FACE IT also removes bacteria during the cleaning process to leave your tools not only clean but sterilized.   FACE IT cleans brushes in a short 3 minute during which the cleaning mats gently comb through the makeup brush hairs for a deep clean that removes makeup stains even at the center. This gentle process prevents the brush hairs from distortion, shedding and fraying common with hand-washing.   The cleaning mats gently rub against makeup sponges to remove even deep stubborn stains without damaging the delicate surface. This consistent rubbing is safer for the sponges than the aggressive, pinching and pounding common with hand-washing.          We are passionate about conservation of our planet and committed to assisting in global efforts  to preserve the planet for ours and future generations. Firstly, FACE IT helps you easily clean your makeup sponges so that last longer and fewer end up in the environment. Secondly, we will donate 5% of all profits from our campaign to ocean reef conservation to help our planet's dying coral reefs. We are therefore counting on your pledges.  Please share our campaign on social media and include the hashtag #SAVETHESPONGE to help create awareness to this worthy cause. Thank you so much. It's been 6 years since the idea for FACE IT was first conceived and we've had fun watching its evolution from a mere idea to a final world-first product to be enjoyed by you and millions globally.The completion of this journey is thanks to our capable and amazing design team at D2M, and equally dedicated manufacturing partners Advanced Bonding Ltd.We really couldn't have done it without their tireless efforts. FACE IT comes to you by JOI, a brand focused on understanding your daily beauty needs, and providing you with innovative and versatile solutions that solve these real-life challenges.  Both JOI and FACE IT were founded by me, Andrea Alli, a busy modern woman and (very) restless product engineer.

</div></div>","Overview
 
Hello there! We’re Shoevenir, a footwear start-up based in Porto. For a year and a half, we mixed traveling, art, and sustainability to develop game-changing sneakers.
A Shoevenir is a small treasure that will make you remember the places you visited, the people you met, the routes you took, and the monuments that enchanted you. These memories will be immortalized in a sneaker that can transmit good energy at each step taken.


Sneakers, Art and Love
 
People have been rediscovering the joys of both modern and contemporary styles. It’s time to break free from old conceptions of who and what we should be. Because of that, we have created unisex sneakers.


 
Models
 

Our first shoevenir edition is inspired by Portuguese locations. We are very proud to call home one of the best destinations on the planet and we will reward you if you explore it with us.

 

WEAR IT WITH ANY OUTFIT

Materials
For over a year we searched for the components that better fit our sustainability goals. Call it eco-fashion if you like, we think it’s just common sense.

Details
 

 
Box & Postcard 
 
We use 100% recycled boxes and paper manufactured in Portugal with the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC) certifications. We hope you can give it a second life after receiving the sneakers – maybe store some other memories in there
The box also comes with a postcard created by a super talented artist that teleports you to an amazing place.
 

 
Production Process 
Production will be 100% Portuguese and we guarantee that all suppliers and components comply with the ethical standards of a fair society.
We do not want to contribute to a precarious labor market where the low cost of production is valued to the maximum.
 
                         
                         
 
Our supply chain will be centered in the north of the country so that we can understand the production processes and working conditions of suppliers. In addition, we significantly reduce our ecological footprint by not requiring long trips to bring all the components together.

<p>“Humans have a deeply rooted craving to touch and be touched by another person - it’s known as touch hunger. It’s how we share feelings, bond with loved ones, and even relieve stress and pain. By developing iXu, we help families and couples live happier and healthier lives by growing and nurturing the feeling of closeness between people who are not together,” says JoyHaptics CEO and Co-founder Dr. Jussi Tuovinen.</p>
<p>“The JoyHaptics iXu Bear is the best possible way of realistically reproducing this form of required touch across long distances given the current technology available,” says Dr. Ajay Prabhu, an Advisor for JoyHaptics and COO of global engineering services giant <a href=""https://www.quest-global.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">QuEST Global</a>.</p>
<p>“Decades of engineering have gone into transmitting sounds and pictures to help us feel connected with our loved ones, but it doesn’t capture the irreplaceable need we have to be touched and touch others. JoyHaptics is pioneering a new way forward with science-based, C-Tactile touch devices to create an even fuller and more personal experience for those people in long-distance relationships,” continues Prabhu. </p>

<h3>Founded on an ambitious goal and a big heart</h3>
<p>In 2014, Jussi Tuovinen, an award-winning engineer and scientist, found himself in a long-distance relationship. While he was working in Dublin, Ireland, his family lived in Espoo, Finland.</p>
<p>Despite the variety of options to stay in touch with his wife, Jussi noticed he was still missing something. The feeling of true closeness just wasn’t fully deliverable through mere words and seeing each other on screen.</p>
<p>Jussi saw this as a challenge, and where there’s a problem, there’s a solution. Jussi, together with his co-founder, Kai, went on to research different types of technical solutions and human psychology to create a humane, real-life experience of touch that can be sent over distance.</p>
<p>So began the story of JoyHaptics in 2015. To this day, Jussi and Kai have been perfecting the product to convey a true experience of caress and closeness. </p>

By developing iXu, we help families and couples live happier and healthier lives by growing and nurturing the feeling of closeness between people who are not together,” says JoyHaptics CEO and Co-founder Dr. Jussi Tuovinen.
“The JoyHaptics iXu Bear is the best possible way of realistically reproducing this form of required touch across long distances given the current technology available,” says Dr. Ajay Prabhu, an Advisor for JoyHaptics and COO of global engineering services giant QuEST Global.
“Decades of engineering have gone into transmitting sounds and pictures to help us feel connected with our loved ones, but it doesn’t capture the irreplaceable need we have to be touched and touch others. JoyHaptics is pioneering a new way forward with science-based, C-Tactile touch devices to create an even fuller and more personal experience for those people in long-distance relationships,” continues Prabhu. 
 
All about iXu  Featured    
 
Founded on an ambitious goal and a big heart
In 2014, Jussi Tuovinen, an award-winning engineer and scientist, found himself in a long-distance relationship. While he was working in Dublin, Ireland, his family lived in Espoo, Finland.
Despite the variety of options to stay in touch with his wife, Jussi noticed he was still missing something. The feeling of true closeness just wasn’t fully deliverable through mere words and seeing each other on screen.
Jussi saw this as a challenge, and where there’s a problem, there’s a solution. Jussi, together with his co-founder, Kai, went on to research different types of technical solutions and human psychology to create a humane, real-life experience of touch that can be sent over distance.
So began the story of JoyHaptics in 2015. To this day, Jussi and Kai have been perfecting the product to convey a true experience of caress and closeness. 
 
The science behind iXu by JoyHaptics
""We all need touch - How science and technology are helping long-distance relationships and beyond "", is the title of our whitepaper, which describes the science behind iXu by Joyhaptics.
Humans have a fundamental psychological, physical and social need to touch and to be touched by another person.... Read more READ MORE

<p><u><strong>About Me</strong></u></p>
<p>Welcome to my Her Universe Fashion Show 2021 funding page!<br/><br/>My name is Kathryn Henzler, and I am what I like to define as a Renaissance Woman. I am a translator, composer, performer, designer, athlete, nerd, and animal-rights activist from the good old state of Ohio. I developed an interest in fashion in junior high school and started cosplaying a few years later. After 4 years at USC, where I got a B.A. in East Asian Languages and Cultures, I started doing costume and fashion design for independent films, museum exhibitions, figure skating, and theatre productions. Even after I got my MMus in Music Technology and Digital Media, I still make space in my career for fashion and sewing. Geek Couture is a large part of what I currently design, whether it is for runways, ice rinks, or conventions. I have used only vegan fabrics and other materials that are also organic, fair-trade, and eco-friendly whenever possible.</p>
<p>I am a veteran of the Her Universe Fashion Show, having competed in 2014, 2015, and 2019, and I can't wait to get to work on this year's look! Any little bit to help will be much appreciated in order to make this garment look the best it possibly can.</p>

The Titanic was the largest and most luxurious ocean liner in the world when it was completed in 1912. It sank on its maiden voyage from Britain to New York when it hit an iceberg on April 14, 1912, killing 1,500 passengers and crew. About 750 others were rescued.

The watch has a harmonious design featuring a rotor inspired by the rusty anchor of a shipwreck and symbolizing the passing of time in which the Titanic has been eroded by the sea. Embossing, debossing, and some specialized craftsmanship are the processes of creating a raised or recessed relief pattern and design in the rotor’s surface. The case back is built to maximize the view of the movement, itself based on the principle of transparency.

Therefore, We have been started to develop this design over 6 months in last year. Finally the Titanic X was born.    Far beneath the ocean waves, nestling silently on cold and dark sea beds at a depth of 3,800 meters underwater, lie the remains of about three million shipwrecks, an enormous vessel, the “RMS Titanic” can be found. The Titanic was the largest and most luxurious ocean liner in the world when it was completed in 1912. It sank on its maiden voyage from Britain to New York when it hit an iceberg on April 14, 1912, killing 1,500 passengers and crew. About 750 others were rescued. Research on the Titanic has provided scientists with confirmation that by the year 2030, the ship may be completely eroded and disappear due to “hungry” bacteria in the ocean.This Titanic X holds an important mission to explore and discover new information about the Titanic under the deep sea before it is gone forever.      The Titanic X timepiece is powered by Miyota 8215 automatic movement. The watch has a harmonious design featuring a rotor inspired by the rusty anchor of a shipwreck and symbolizing the passing of time in which the Titanic has been eroded by the sea. Embossing, debossing, and some specialized craftsmanship are the processes of creating a raised or recessed relief pattern and design in the rotor’s surface. The case back is built to maximize the view of the movement, itself based on the principle of transparency. This highly unique rotor design is unlikely to found on any timepiece in the world.    The Titanic X Seeker has two large hands along with a highly visible luminous area. Swiss Superluminova is used on the Titanic X Seeker. Other prominent features include a calendar disc, large indexes and a big date-frame. Despite its rather substantial content layout, the watch is actually very easy to read, especially under water and in the dark. The luminous material used for the hands offers more than twice the afterglow brightness (even after five hours) compared to conventional materials.There are multiple grades of Superluminova. The exceptional performance of BG W9 with blue light and C7 with green light, are used depending on the color combinations of the dial. Those grades are significantly higher than C1 which is the standard used in other watches.    RAW STEEL CASE // BLACK DIAL // GRAY LEATHER STRAP  PVD BLACK CASE // BLACK DIAL // BLACK LEATHER STRAP​  PVD BLACK CASE // YELLOW DIAL // BLACK LEATHER STRAP​  PVD BLACK+ ROSEGOLD CASE // BLACK DIAL // DARK BROWN LEATHER STRAP​   PVD ANTIQUE BROWN CASE // BLACK DIAL // DARK BROWN LEATHER STRAP​    A slightly domed sapphire crystal with anti-reflective coating protects the dial. Highly reliable and reputable raw materials are selected from European sources. The sapphire crystal is scratch resistant and very hard glass with a rating of 9 on the Mohs mineral hardness scale. Sapphire crystal delivers the best possible scratch resistance and shatter proof protection for our watch.    The feature buckle comes with a satin finish along with a leather case with an engraved logo. The inspiration for the selection of these materials and designs is drawn from the seat belt of the vessel.   In theory, a dive watch (or any diving instrument) can never be built to be too safe. The screw-down crown that comes with the Titanic X Seeker can definitely be described as an essential feature, ensuring high performance under 200 meters depth.   It is surely worth your while to peer through the mineral window in the case back, which is held securely in place by six screws. Seen from the rear, this solid case back is inspired by the porthole of the ship.   Miyota 8215 is one of the reliable & powerful movement which had been used by most of watch markers for many years. This consists of a jewel three hand with date movement, unidirectional winding system, an accuracy of -20 to +40 seconds a day and a minimum power reserve of 40 hours. Its diameter is 25mm with 5.67mm thickness, and sects at six-half cycles per second.  It keeps the time of this Titanic X in high accuracy and perfect condition.   The Titanic X Seeker has a dark brown/ grey/ black Italian leather strap with a pleasing mock patina. The strap has eight closely spaced holes and quick-release spring bars, helping to assure a comfortable & easy fit. The lugs are 22 millimeters apart. We can proudly say that this watch looks great on a range of strap types and colors.            R M S . 0 1  R M S . 0 2  R M S . 0 3  R M S . 0 4  R M S . 0 5  It had been worked from sketch idea to the final for nearly 6 months.  Upon the technical drawings entirely achieved, it has been necessary to prepare the 3D rendering. Though this development steps, we would have more information to modify the the details specifically by multi-angles.   In addition to pushing the creative limits for watch development and design, our Chief Designer, Ricky Lam also specializes in handcraft leather products. This handy and elegant leather watch holder wallet is minimalist in design, highly practical, and 100 percent handmade. It is hand-sewn, finished with wax, and the embossed logo is presented in an understated, yet, luxurious fashion. The watch holder wallet is crafted with the intention to last a lifetime, not only to protect the watch, but also for other possible uses as well. The watch holder features two slots which fits the Titanic X Seeker watch, instruction manual, and the warranty card.   This project came to begin in 2017 with development for over a half of year of design, meetings with different specialist companies and thanks to compliment from the backers who supported our previous timepieces.  We’re very proud to have successfully met the production schedule on time.  As our prototypes are well prepared and have been passed all testing process by assembly center. What we are waiting for it's just your SUPPORT!!    We have worked very hard over the past one year to reach that stage. We will continue to do our best until those are delivered. Therefore, we sincerely need your support! Let us bring this Titanic X to become a real story!!",34.0,4,"7 Campaigns

<p><strong>“How are the Hands assembled?” </strong>This is the most commonly asked question we faced in the past year and the reason why countless hours were spent in the development process. Instead of following the existing norm like others, our designer has embraced the technical challenge with the revolutionary idea - placing the Hour Disc underneath the 3D Mars and the curvy Minute Hand on top of the 3D Mars. Via the glowing 3D Mars in the dark, the shadow of Minute Hand laying on top tells the minute while the luminescent-coated Hour Disc underneath tells the hour.  </p>

<p><strong>Simply by looking at the wrist, wearers could find where the case perfectly joints with the Sapphire Crystal. </strong>This concept is derived from the UFO’s streamlined design. The 43.5MM case Diameter is fitted with 316LStainless steel material to demonstrate the perfect scale design. Inspired by “The Mars Rover Concept Vehicle” by NASA, both sides of the case are embossed with a unique honeycombed pattern. </p>

<p><strong>A blue sunray dial is assembled into the case back. </strong>Through the skeleton case back, you could take a glimpse and enjoy the rotor movement.

<p><strong>The craziest ideal comes to the thrilling reality as the Sapphire Crystal curve exquisitely accomplishes the case angle like a dream.</strong> It forms an almost seamless curve on the dial. The double-layered dome is made of raw European Sapphire materials following by a special cold grinding procedure to achieve such an extreme curve. In order to reduce excessive reflection, the crystal is treated with an anti-reflective coating which enables wearers to read the crystal clear dial from any angle. </p>

<p>A soft and tender leather strap handcrafted with German nylon stitching lays comfortably around the wrist. Three selected strap color options (distressed black, bronze and ash grey) are offered to go with your choice of different dial. We believe you would enjoy the combination. A lot of thought was put in the leather material selection. We come up with two special options; one is natural Full Vegetable leather which looks organic and effortless, good in durability and strength while the Crazy Horse leather option delivers a vintage vibe with unique and real texture. </p>

Simply by looking at the wrist, wearers could find where the case perfectly joints with the Sapphire Crystal. This concept is derived from the UFO’s streamlined design. The 43.5MM case Diameter is fitted with 316LStainless steel material to demonstrate the perfect scale design. Inspired by “The Mars Rover Concept Vehicle” by NASA, both sides of the case are embossed with a unique honeycombed pattern. 
 

A blue sunray dial is assembled into the case back. Through the skeleton case back, you could take a glimpse and enjoy the rotor movement. This design is derived from the solar arrays of NASA’s Insight Mars Lander. The Mars Mission logo is etched through in the centre of the case back. 
 

The craziest ideal comes to the thrilling reality as the Sapphire Crystal curve exquisitely accomplishes the case angle like a dream. It forms an almost seamless curve on the dial. The double-layered dome is made of raw European Sapphire materials following by a special cold grinding procedure to achieve such an extreme curve. In order to reduce excessive reflection, the crystal is treated with an anti-reflective coating which enables wearers to read the crystal clear dial from any angle. 
 
 

A huge enhancement is made in the movement. Mars Mission is powered by NH70A movement from Seiko. This automatic movement features a hacking function. (A hacking function means the second hand stops when the crown is pulled out.)  

 
This Seiko NH70A movement is credited for its reliability and fair accuracy in automatic movement which makes it one of the most popular automatic movements in the industry. 
 

A soft and tender leather strap handcrafted with German nylon stitching lays comfortably around the wrist. Three selected strap color options (distressed black, bronze and ash grey) are offered to go with your choice of different dial. We believe you would enjoy the combination. A lot of thought was put in the leather material selection. We come up with two special options; one is natural Full Vegetable leather which looks organic and effortless, good in durability and strength while the Crazy Horse leather option delivers a vintage vibe with unique and real texture.

Packaging is one key part of our product design. Mars Mission comes with a deluxe box embossed with Mars Missions 3D initial “MM” on top. Each box carries a detailed and delicate instruction manual complemented with a metallic warranty card. 
 
 

 
 

That's why we could never stop to create new designs. What we have, it's your amazing compliments to our previous campaigns!! 
 

We stand firmly behind our watches; OVD offer a 2-year limited warranty on Mars Mission which covers movement manufacturing defects. The warranty does not cover damages that may occur from wear and tear and daily use. For more information please see www.ovd.com.hk

We’re building a community of people who love getting outside for their physical and mental health. We're helping people to move more in cities by protecting them from air pollution, because we all deserve to clear our heads with cleaner air.  To pre-order your Airhead mask, select a perk now.  91% of the global population are exposed to air pollution. As keen cyclists in London, we’re certainly familiar with pollution, and, despite a lot of searching, we never found a mask that met our needs. So we set out to create one.Before we get into it, we wanted say this: we understand it’s not the most natural thing to put a mask on your face. We also know that all the other masks out there are so hot, uncomfortable, embarrassing (Darth Vader effect is real), and sometimes they have little gaps in the side, so they don’t even work properly!So almost a year ago, we teamed up with some incredible partners, including industry-leading experts at Brunel University, to create a mask that’s more comfortable, cleaner and smarter. Meet the Airhead mask.Updated design, August 2020:

 We're so proud of the mask we've created and what you see here is our latest prototype, which was made slightly larger than the finished product will be. The real deal is going to be noticeably smaller than this (woah, even slicker) so if you're worried about it looking too big on your face, we want to put those fears to bed. Not only that, the colours will match the GIF below. The colours were selected based on over a thousand (kind) survey responses.Choose your AirSkin® colour later. Grey, black or blue.
 

 
 
 
 
Our filters efficiently block 99% of PM2.5 particulate matter and can remove particles that are as small as 0.3 microns in size. We are striving to obtain FFP3 (N99) certification. This can only be achieved once the first batch of masks have been manufactured and tested using independent test houses. We are using filters that exceed the requirements for FFP3 (N99).  
 The activated carbon layer removes harmful gases, including nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and ozone. They also remove unwanted smells and vapours from organic compounds. 
 Our filter provides effective filtration of natural pollutants such as fine particulate matter from smoke and dust. 
 The mask can effectively block pollen particles - don’t let your seasonal allergies prevent you from exercising outdoors! The latest prototype. Final mask will be smaller and AirSkin® colours will vary.
  
The latest prototype. Final mask will be smaller and AirSkin® colours will vary.
  Through the entire design process, we've relentlessly focused on what customers (in our loyal Airhead community) want. Not only has this enabled us to create something we're very proud of, it's produced some wonderful feedback. 
 
 Okay, let’s go deeper into what makes the Airhead mask so great:
Keep cool, keep calm.With our innovative team of designers at Brunel University, we went the extra mile to make this mask as comfortable as possible. We used a design-led innovation process to create a mask that maximises breathability through the filters and valves (more on that below), then we carefully selected textiles that are kind to your skin.  Ditch the Darth Vader ImageNobody wants to look or feel silly, but everyone wants to be safe. We’ve bombarded our early Airhead community with questions to find out exactly what people want. We’ve been listening every step of the way. We’re delivering a mask that you’ll be proud to be seen in, and we’re changing the perception of what it means to be protected against pollution.  
Above and beyond what you expectWe wanted to create a product that we’d recommend to our nearest and dearest. The Airhead mask leaves no stone unturned, and provides users with outstanding protection against air pollution. Firstly we have our unique airtight seal. Secondly, our filters exceed the top European regulatory standard; they block 99% of PM2.5 particulates, and even remove particles down to PM0.3. The activated carbon layer stops gases such as nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and ozone. 
Brought to life by trusted British manufacturers. We’ve gone to great lengths to find the best possible suppliers of each component of our mask. It’s so important to us that we provide you with a product that meets the highest quality standards. By being geographically close to these key partners, we’re also able to foster better relationships, can run a tighter ship and ultimately deliver a superior product to you.   
The latest prototype. Final mask will be smaller and AirSkin® colours will vary.
  The World Health Organisation (WHO) states that 91% of the global population are exposed to air pollution. On average, 16 people die every minute around the world due to air pollution. That’s 8.8 million human beings every year.  If all of these numbers feel difficult to comprehend, a study by scientists at the University of California helped visualise the effects of air pollution by comparing it to the equivalent number of cigarettes smoked.Average daily air pollution levels in the US are the equivalent of smoking 146 cigarettes a year. In the EU, it's more like 584 cigarettes. In China, it's 1,460.That is a LOT of cigarettes!Major causes of air pollution are power generation, vehicle emissions and natural disasters. 
 
 It’s designed to fit your face perfectly, with an airtight seal so that no dirty air can leak through the sides. The highest quality medical grade silicone makes the mask feel incredibly soft and cool on your face. Then there’s the filtration technology. It exceeds the top European standards. With our unique valves and filter we make breathing easier and cleaner than you might expect. 
 We’ve solved a problem and our mask will fit your face like no other. We’ve used the most advanced technology to analyse a range of faces and create a unique design with one size to fit all. Our medical grade silicon will maximise filtration efficacy in polluted cities. 
 Our valves are truly different. They are rear-facing, they rapidly move hot air away from the face and they prevent glasses from steaming up. Moving the valves has also maximised the surface area of the filter, which makes it easier to breathe and keeps you cool. 
 If you’re cycling or running up a hill as fast as you can, you'll probably get hot, we won’t pretend otherwise. This unique feature gives you a quick cooling breeze, or a chance to have a drink, snack or chat. When you're ready, simply clip it back in place to resume full protection.Change the colour of your mask with ease.
 Grey, black or blue, choose a style to suit you. With our design, you can remove the AirSkin® and replace it with a different one to suit your style or mood. In the future, we plan to have many other colours and designs to choose from. 
 Our modular design will let you take the mask apart, to allow you to give it a thorough clean. You won’t be able to wash the filters, but these will be replaced periodically, depending on your usage (more on that below!). 
 We recommend that you replace the filters after approximately 60 hours of use to ensure maximum filtration efficiency is maintained. This duration is influenced by the amount of pollution you’re exposed to, so you may need to replace them more frequently in highly polluted areas.  Cyclists. Runners. Walkers. Commuters. 
  We teamed up with Dr Sanja Potgieter-Vermaak, who is a Senior Lecturer in Analytical Chemistry at Manchester Metropolitan University and an air pollution expert. She explains clearly what to look out for when choosing an effective pollution mask. 

 
 Airhead was selected for a government-funded programme to work in collaboration with industry-leading design experts at Brunel University. We are also an award-winning member of the NatWest Entrepreneur Accelerator, where we receive expert coaching and mentorship. Since inception, we've made an effort to constantly surrounded ourselves with the best possible support to deliver the most advanced innovation.

<p>After four years of in-depth design and engineering, we have finally hit our mark; The Decaf Denim is here. The Decaf Denim is the perfect combination of technical jeans, maximum comfort, and sustainable manufacturing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604349453/bvertbcogtnxb9aokiya.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Spent coffee grounds are mixed and melted with recycled plastic bottles, then extruded into the fibers that create our Decaf Denim. The process requires minimal resources and utilizes sustainable technologies such as solar power, gray water recycling, and more! </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604349638/q0wn2m2eojeautqjsbyp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our partners across the globe have worked for years to perfect the technique of turning coffee into clothes. First, coffee grounds are collected from local shops. Often this is done by employees on their way to work in the morning, so there’s no need to haul in the grounds with trucks that run on fossil fuels.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604349690/h05wpfemelynofabwgci.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Next, the coffee is dried and the oils are separated out. Often these oils are given more life as soaps, cosmetics, and more. The dried coffee is further ground into nano-sized particles, that are then combined with plastic fibers and turned into cloth!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604349726/eky2mtpwqg0rfaqhbdik.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Decaf Denim is also made from recycled plastic bottles. Instead of discarded bottles going into the waste stream and often finding their way into oceans, the bottles are shredded into flakes and dried.

After four years of in-depth design and engineering, we have finally hit our mark; The Decaf Denim is here. The Decaf Denim is the perfect combination of technical jeans, maximum comfort, and sustainable manufacturing.


 
Spent coffee grounds are mixed and melted with recycled plastic bottles, then extruded into the fibers that create our Decaf Denim. The process requires minimal resources and utilizes sustainable technologies such as solar power, gray water recycling, and more! 
 

Our partners across the globe have worked for years to perfect the technique of turning coffee into clothes. First, coffee grounds are collected from local shops. Often this is done by employees on their way to work in the morning, so there’s no need to haul in the grounds with trucks that run on fossil fuels.

Next, the coffee is dried and the oils are separated out. Often these oils are given more life as soaps, cosmetics, and more. The dried coffee is further ground into nano-sized particles, that are then combined with plastic fibers and turned into cloth!

Decaf Denim is also made from recycled plastic bottles. Instead of discarded bottles going into the waste stream and often finding their way into oceans, the bottles are shredded into flakes and dried. Those flakes are melted down and extruded through a sieve into small fibers. The coffee is then mixed in to create yarn, giving the fabric natural protective features without chemical additives. 
 

 

 
Our comfort and sustainability factors are really something to brag about, but let us not forget that our jeans are also stocked with features such as UV protection, odor resistance, and water-wicking properties.


 

 
To make one pair of denim it takes 3,800 gallons of water from start to finish. By using recycled materials, organic cotton, and a waterless dye method, we save thousands of gallons per pair of denim. With these production techniques we are revolutionizing the denim production process!

Sitting at a desk
Racing through the Alaskan bush, being chased by a grizzly
Grilling hot dogs on the Traeger you got for Father’s Day
Beasting your next free-climb
Rapid response when nature or love calls
Bending down to pick up every #$*% kid’s toy
 What makes the Groove Belt™ so awesome?Snap-Tech™The correct term is ne·o·dym·i·um magnets. Yeah...they’re awesome, even if you can’t pronounce it. The magnet snaps the buckle in perfect place...oh and you can unlatch with one hand.. Just listen to that SNAP. If you have an ASMR fetish, try to hold it together. These bad boys snap and latch instantly. Honestly, latching your belt is now more addictive than Joe Exotic’s tiger meth.     Stretch-Tech™ (aka just the right amount of stretch)You know the deal. Your belt is either too tight or too loose (neither is a good situation). The Groove Belt™ is comfier than the sweatpants you wore for 3 weeks during the Corona Pandemic.  These bad boys have just the right amount of stretch to keep you feeling comfortable and flexible.  Secure-Tech™Set it and forget it design. Once you adjust the belt to the proper length, never worry about it again. Unless you go really crazy next Thanksgiving, just use our easy adjust to give yourself a little extra.   Stiff-Tech™ (aka won’t fold in your belt loops)You know that belt you bought last time? The one that folds over at the back of your pants? The Groove Belt™ doesn’t. Whether you’re climbing Mount Everest, attaching your tactical gear, or just grilling hotdogs in your backyard (let’s be honest, the most likely), this belt is made with the perfect blend of durable, stiff webbing and stretch. It’s going to stay on you like that bad tattoo from your last bro-country concert, without losing its form.   Space-Tech™Made from recycled space shuttle cladding...Okay maybe not but we used the best materials on earth to make this the best belt EVER. Between our proprietary webbing, rare-earth neodymium magnets and A380 aluminum alloy buckle, you’re basically ready for an apocalypse. Or for simply pulling up your pants an average of 5.24x per day.    Won't flap and get all loosey-goosey Tech™No one likes the end of a belt flapping around all loosey-goosey (please put that away.) That’s why we designed the end to neatly tuck behind the belt. For the occasional rogue fly-away, we’ve added our secure keeper loop. No more flap.   94-Year WarrantyYep! Just like our rings and watch bands, this belt is covered with a lifetime guarantee. So if you break it, you’re good for a return free of charge for life (unless you make it past 94 years from now, but let’s be honest—your diet is not up to par for that).   Just in case you thought we threw this together over the weekend... here’s a glimpse into the last 12 months.   If everything else didn't convince you to back the Groove Belt™ maybe some photos of this sexy, beast of a belt below will seal the deal.   Here are a couple videos of Happy Groove Belt Early Testers, including MMA Champion Michael Chandler.  Country Music Star Josh Gallagher  And Matt Drury of Drury Outdoors & DeerCast  Stock Car Driver Jeb Burton",19.0,7,"1 Campaign

You can choose your color and size once we send backer surveys in a few months.The Evolution Hoodie will be offered in sizes XS thru 2XL.

Grab one of our bundles that feature some of our best-selling eco-minded goods. Many of these items were made possible through crowdfunding! Learn more about each product below.    Thanks to previous backer support, we're able to expand into more sizes! Please note that these measurements are for the garment, and not for your body. Because it is a hoodie, the sizes may look big. The hoodie fits nice and loose, like you would expect from a standard hoodie! We suggest not worrying too much about how you measure up to these numbers, and to choose whatever size you would normally wear. Spent coffee grounds are mixed and melted with recycled plastic bottles, then extruded into the fibers that create the Evolution Hoodie. The process requires minimal resources and utilizes sustainable technologies such as solar power, gray water recycling, and more! FROM CUP TO CLOTHOur partners across the globe have worked for years to perfect the technique of turning coffee into clothes. First, coffee grounds are collected from local shops. Often this is done by employees on their way to work in the morning, so there’s no need to haul in the grounds with trucks that run on fossil fuels!Next, the coffee is dried and the oils are separated out. Often these oils are given more life as soaps, cosmetics, and more. The dried coffee is further ground into nano-sized particles, that are then combined with plastic fibers and turned into cloth! FROM PLASTIC TO PRACTICAL The Evolution Travel Hoodie is also made from recycled plastic bottles. Instead of discarded bottles going into the waste stream and often finding their way into oceans, the bottles are shredded into flakes and dried. Those flakes are melted down and extruded through a sieve into small fibers. The coffee is then mixed in to create yarn!  The Evolution Hoodie's pick-pocket proof kangaroo pouch is what sets it apart from your average hoodie. Unzip the pouch to uncover two organizing pockets with velcro closures, both large enough to hold your passport, phone, or wallet. Use the interior loop to clip your keys so you’ll never have to worry about losing them again. This pouch is built into the interior of the hoodie and is separate from the traditional handwarming pocket, so you can keep your valuables safe and secure!   Traditional hoodies are bulky and awkward, and usually not very eco-friendly. Here’s how the Evolution Hoodie compares. The Evolution Hoodie is designed to be worn on-the-go. The material is constructed with microscopic pores which increase its surface area. This means moisture is spread throughout the hoodie and the drying process is accelerated!  Play hard and stay worry-free! Coffee is a naturally odor-absorbing material and by weaving the grounds into the fibers, odors are trapped as you sweat.

<p>Smartphones, keys and wallets are the bare essentials on our person everyday, if not all day. But we might also have to carry sunglasses, Airpods, charging cables/block, an external battery, notepad, pens or pocket knife, etc. </p>

<p>Bolstr is obsessed with carry options that are perfectly sized and minimal. Whatever we design has to make both style and utility sense.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Problem</h2>
<p>Most men are creatures of simplicity and habit, especially when it comes to everyday carry. They want their smartphone, wallet, keys, Airpods, and sunglasses (everyday essentials) on them at all times without the need for a larger bag or backpack to carry them.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1616164469/ugudp74zjdw2tlroccda.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<p>While clothing pockets seem like a friendly companion for everyday carry, most end up getting overstuffed, which wears on clothing, inhibits access, results in things getting misplaced, and does not look good. Men need a new way to carry.</p>

<p>""Guys want better options for carrying their bare everyday essentials without the need for pockets. Something that gives them fast-access and the functionality to be used in many ways.

</div></div>","A Minimal Carry Obsession

Smartphones, keys and wallets are the bare essentials on our person everyday, if not all day. But we might also have to carry sunglasses, Airpods, charging cables/block, an external battery, notepad, pens or pocket knife, etc. 

Bolstr is obsessed with carry options that are perfectly sized and minimal. Whatever we design has to make both style and utility sense.
 
The Problem
Most men are creatures of simplicity and habit, especially when it comes to everyday carry. They want their smartphone, wallet, keys, Airpods, and sunglasses (everyday essentials) on them at all times without the need for a larger bag or backpack to carry them.

While clothing pockets seem like a friendly companion for everyday carry, most end up getting overstuffed, which wears on clothing, inhibits access, results in things getting misplaced, and does not look good. Men need a new way to carry.
 

bolstr Aux Pocket
Smaller than a sling pack. Larger than a wallet.
An innovation in minimal carry, Aux Pocket (AKA Utility Pocket) is a breakthrough future-classic in design. There is nothing else like it on the market. It is that extra pocket for everyday essentials that can be uniquely worn, carried, or stored for fast access and security.
Whether worn, carried, or stored - keep everything in one spot at all times.

bolstr Small Carry
Smaller than a laptop bag. Larger than a holster.
Upgraded with a cleaner appearance and new colorways, Bolstr Small Carry 3.0 provides the same easy access to your smartphone, sunglasses, Airpods, wallet, keys and a few extras. It proved we cracked the code on overcoming the man purse stigma.

Amongst those passengers laid some with the deepest pockets on earth desiring to explore new opportunities in USA. The voyage ended up an epic catastrophe amidst the ice-strewn waters of the Atlantic with a death toll of more than 1,500 out of 2,224 crew members on board. Captain Edward Smith also went down with the ship together with the chief designer Thomas Andrews.After the previous collection of TitanicX, positive feedback and high demand from the backers have been received. OVD team decided to let this legendary story set sail again-""TITANICX-II"" is officially onboard.  To pay tribute to the TitanicX, the rust-like-effect rotor part of the movement is retained. It is inspired by the rusty anchor of a shipwreck. The design of the solid case back embarks the porthole on hull in a rust-like-effect with a protection coat to symbolize the passing of time in which the Titanic has been eroded by the sea. The design inspiration of buckle comes from the vintage appearance of instruments and vessel-related components on board. The unique two-stage shape and ergonomic design makes it more convenient and comfortable for users to wear. We're confident no identical buckle could be found in the market given its uniqueness. Calendar is placed in between 2 and 3 o’clock to commemorate 2:20am, the time that Titanic sank. The calendar frame is made with diamond-cut chamfered surface to go with this concept.      After the experience of TitanicX, our team has brought TitanicX-II movement to the next level, upgrading to SII NH35A. This specification of movement allows 21,600 vibrations (per hour) and provides a power reserve that lasts for 41 hours. What really sets TitanicX-II apart is the special rotor design of its movement. Taking the inspiration from the shipwreck anchor, we have in-house modified to distress the rotor to bring an old and sturdy appearance.

 
   The dial of the TitanicX-II and the hands are coated with a Swiss SuperLuminova to ensure the legibility even in the dark environment. The glowing ""X"" logo imprinted on the Sapphire crystal surface is as striking as a lighthouse at sea. In the darkest time, there is always room for a little light. TitanicX-II is always here for you, guiding you home.  Dual leather materials are used in the belt. CODE.01 is equipped with a nylon strap with strong distressed effect to create an antique vibe. The other 4 models are paired with high-quality Vegetable tanned leather strap and iconic hot stamping, true unique timepieces. All watch straps are entirely handmade, including hand-wrapping the wax thread to embody the weather-beaten-feeling.   From the initiating the concept to the second production of a solid prototype, from numerous of design modification to product shoot and layout design, we proudly present you with TitanicX-II after this 1-year voyage. We did not make any compromises despite the increasing production cost. We want the best for our wearer, and we make sure you are getting the best. Take material selection as an example, we insist on using imported raw materials for the double-dome sapphire crystals from Europe even when it costs much more comparing to other options. 


 

 
As usual, we insist on the importance of the role that packaging design plays in telling the whole story behind. The box is made of walnut undergoing a special burning process to create an antique effect. It is just like a lost underwater treasure chest. To be consistent with the design concept, the package comes with a bronze warranty card and a vintage manual.      We have completed seven campaigns in three years, and all were delivered before the expected and promised time. We value and respect to timeline commitment as we believe it is key to a good crowdfunding platform. Taking in charge of all the procedures internally, including material purchase, material follow-up, watch assembling, and packaging processes, it allows us to be able to keep abreast of the production timeline. ""You may call me a dreamer, but I always want to create something so unique that people would actually talk to each other about it.

</div></div>","The 1st denim jacket that enables you to swap between art and even the original denim fabric.PATENT PENDING From rock & roll to hip-hop, the concept of customizing jackets reached a variety of communities. Although art styles differed across communities, they all used custom jackets as a form of self expression. As artists in the hip-hop community, we saw painted art on the back of clothing often at competitions and parties. Unfortunately, the paint on the jackets cracked, peeled,  and people grew tired of continuously wearing the same art. We wanted to innovate the jacket to one that kept up with its history, supported artists, and is sustainable. We envisioned a jacket with art that would last a lifetime and enabled you to create again and again — hence “The Endless Canvas”.    Customization is an exclusive feature we are allowing for Indiegogo.  We've spent over two years researching and developing an attachment system that finally passed the test. We discovered that using both zippers and velcro with strategic pattern making was crucial to success.





Artist designs from across the globe!













All selections and customizations will take place on our website post campaign. (Jacket colors & sizes, art panels, custom panels) 




 



We created over 25 prototypes, wore them outside, danced in them, and improved it to the jacket you see today. Premium quality, comfort, and beautiful art - all seamlessly integrated.

We're over fabric that rips because it isn't made with the stretch we need to bend over and strap in. We are strong, confident women who love to ski and snowboard, and we need pants that can keep up with us and make us look as good as we feel.We should be worrying about how to land our next trick, not worrying about our pants!Nobody's Princess was born in 2020 when founder Maria finally got her sh*t together after years of struggling to find well-fitting snow pants. As an Australian size 12 to 14, she was constantly ripping the crotch of her snow pants because the fit just was never quite right. We launched Nobody's Princess for one reason - to make great snow pants for women like you. Women who have no time for insecurities when trying snow pants. Women who don't like being left feeling humiliated when their pants split halfway down a run. Women who don't like being forced to wear ill-fitting and unsightly shaped men's snow pants because our snow sport industry doesn't cater to us.You can read more about our story here. Over 400 women have completed this survey so far, helping us determine what is wrong with their snow pants. They have provided critical measurements so we can analyse their sizes and shapes. They have told us what they honestly expect out of a great pair of snow pants. Our pants will be designed using real statistics from snowboarding and skiing women from all over the world.Using communities like Miss Snow It All #showusdagirls we've spoken to countless women who are all yearning for the same thing - pants that fit, and they've spoken loud and clear!We are going to provide you with the features YOU want.This is what you've told us you want:We've secured the talents of a world-class technical fashion designer, who has worked with some of the biggest snowsports companies in the world. She is bringing her years of expertise to the (snow) field, and still cannot believe these issues haven’t been addressed - until now!These pants are going to be made for women, by women. Our first pant will be black, and available in AU8/US4, AU10/US6, AU12/US8, AU14/US10, AU16/US12, AU18/US14, AU20/US16 and AU22/US18! We don't have a big savings account or fancy-schmancy investors helping us to fund the dream. Our process that leads to creating a fully-functioning prototype to test includes paying for a few things along the way.Our costs include; sourcing a quality manufacturer and the right fabrics, pattern making, designing new concepts to solve issues, sewing fit garments, creating prototype samples, product testing, and doing a bit of self-promotion to get the word out.We aren't paying ourselves, making a profit, or anything like that - every cent we get our hands on is going into make you the best fitting snow pants, ever. Our pants are due to be available for sale to the general public by the beginning of August 2021. We are working to a strict timeline so that the Southern Hemisphere will be able to get their legs into our incredible pants during the 2021 season, and there will be plenty of time for the Northern Hemisphere to get slip into theirs for the 2021/22 season. We will launch a new crowdfunding campaign when our prototype is ready and has been tested, so you can place your pre-order and help us get our minimum order requirements.It all started back in 2018 on a chair lift when founder Maria felt an odd, cool sensation in her crotch. It's true, a ripped crotch on her brand new snow pants is what spurred this brand. And it's sad to say, that wasn't the only pair. And as she told this story, she found out she wasn't the only one. In the search to find a pair of pants that fit better,  a chorus of women spoke up and chimed in, about their frustration in the elusive search. They'd lift up their jackets and show the gaping in their backsides. They'd show the inside lining on their pants ripped through. And this just fueled the fire. So, this is why we're doing something about it.We need this. We need to change the game. Change the standard. We head to the snow to have fun, socialise, and energise ourselves with that mountain air. We shred and ski all over that mofo. And we are there for ourselves, we don't go for anyone else. We don't go to conform, we do it to express ourselves. We don't try to fit in, we go to be better than we were the day before. We are there for the snow.Our main motto and driver behind our idea is that comfort = confidence. And we stand by that statement. If you've spent your day on the snow wondering if your pants are going to split if you bend over, if you're going to get snow down your pants next time you fall; if you live in fear or doing up your bindings because your crotch might give out, or sitting in the lift chair hurts because that phone in your pocket is digging into your hips; if you wonder if you hit that kicker are your pants going to fall down 5 inches..... then you are the reason why we are doing this. Those issues and problems SHOULDN'T be on the forefront of your mind every time you hit the snow, and having your mind focused on the wrong things ruins your confidence.

What causes foot odor? Feet smell when bacteria breaks down sweat as it comes from the pores. A pungent smell is released as the sweat decomposes. Silver, Copper, and Zinc kill bacteria and prevent them from generating foot odor.


The key to the effectiveness of the MP Magic socks is their unique composition. This fabrics are infused with three metals: Silver, copper and zinc. Multiple metals can kill more types of bacteria, making these socks extra antibacterial. The metal infusion technique was developed for the aerospace industry, but we have repurposed it for everyday use.

When deal with odor control, we are super proud about our fabrics and technology. We are the world's best! Silver is known as a great antibacterial metal, copper can kill bacteria and is a key component of many enzymes, and zinc can reduce the bacteria that contributes to odor! We use special technique to infuse all the three metals with the fabrics, never wash away! 

With these functional fabrics, you can take off your shoes without any hesitation. MP Magic socks are equipped with metal circulation wire zones, making them 100% conductive, boosting foot circulation and reducing stiffness! In addition to the unique fabrics, we’ve specially designed the socks at the toe and heel area to perfectly match the human foot shape, increasing breathability and durability.

MP's Product History
Everyone desires a pair of good socks. Regular socks can be hot and uncomfortable, prone to developing odor quickly after just one use. After a sweaty workout, long travels, or a fitful night sleep, you could definitely use a great pair of odorless and comfortable socks. When you search for the best socks online and in-store, it is a frustrating experience with the overwhelming number of options that lack description and viability. How are consumers supposed to make an educated decision? That's why you need check out MP products! We are a group of people with renowned design, engineering and supply chains expertise. We only find the world’s best and most innovative technique to engineer our products. This spring, we successfully launched the MP Glovax Gloves, delivering pairs to more than 1300 backers all over the world! The feedback was overwhelmingly positive.
 

You can google ""glovax gloves"", and can easily find many reviews and feedback!
Additionally, we added one beta version of this socks to every package. That means, these socks will be improved based on 1300 users' feedback! No other campaign has been able to perform this type of cost development and interaction with their backers! Until the MP team! 
MP team develops innovative lifestyle products. United States are good at design and development, Japan usually can provide high quality and innovative raw fabrics and yarn, China is famous on fabrication. We have set up several offices and partnerships in different global areas, and bring the best products to all!

We have built a great community of supporters, and every member can enjoy our continually developing product innovations. This is MP, we love what we are doing, so join us, and work with us so together we can improve.

We are super proud and confident with our delivery and customer supports! We will usually start shipping in about one month, and deliver to all over the world around 10~15 days. That's the timeline of Glovax gloves, what we did this summer! We will continue this rate for MP Magic Socks, in order to deliver the great MP products to our lovely backers!
A good product is not only the product good, but also a good customer support and experience!  Our business logic is that we provide the extreme good customer support to build super great reputation and brands, then we will earn more money post crowdfunding with our distributors and E-Commerce. We do not plan to earn money from crowdfunding, we invest a lot to achieve our branding goal. Some backers value our supports:

<h3>The Only Type Of Cloth Diaper You'll Ever Need!</h3>
<p>There are so many types of cloth diapers out there, which can take hours of research to figure out the best fabrics, absorbency, styles, covers, type of enclosure etc.  We made it easy with our ultimate all-in-one diaper that will fit a newborn up to a 40-pound child.  No trial and error needed and no headaches with leakage problems. </p>
<p>We've tested it on many newborns and toddlers, and parents love the fit, absorbency, ease of use &amp; quality.  We've gathered feedback from countless avid cloth diapering Moms, so we can offer you the best diaper!  Our diapers are backed by a lifetime warranty!</p>
<p>We've used this platform for pre-orders so we can gain more momentum in launching a high-quality and affordable diaper for all.  36 diapers are recommended if you plan to launder 2-3 times/ week.  You won't find a better-priced diaper with so many hemp layers!  Please join us to help save the environment for our kids and grand kids!   We 100% guarantee you will receive a high quality product!  </p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Choosing to cloth diaper one child will stop about <strong>7000 disposable diapers</strong> (one ton) from going into landfills.  Studies indicate that diapers in landfills take up to <strong>500 years</strong> to degrade, creating methane and other toxic gasses in the process, and the manufacture uses volatile chemicals that also end up in the eco-system.  The solid waste in diapers also introduce harmful pathogens into the environment.</p>
<p>The super gel and dyeing agents in disposables can cause skin irritation and allergies.  You can have peace of mind with our cloth diapers as the inner absorbency layers are all-natural.  </p>

<h3><strong>Your Child Won't Wake Up From A Leaking Diaper!</strong></h3>
<p>It's been tested by many ""heavy wetters"" of all ages, and it did NOT leak throughout the night!    Adding the hemp booster gives 14 layers of nighttime protection!</p>

The super gel and dyeing agents in disposables can cause skin irritation and allergies.  You can have peace of mind with our cloth diapers as the inner absorbency layers are all-natural.  
 
Inside our Diaper:

Your Child Won't Wake Up From A Leaking Diaper!
It's been tested by many ""heavy wetters"" of all ages, and it did NOT leak throughout the night!    Adding the hemp booster gives 14 layers of nighttime protection!
You have a choice of Snap or Velcro enclosure.  Velcro snaps, are similar to disposable diapers and can be easier for beginners, caregivers and grandparents.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In the 25 years I’ve been Bboyin, finding the perfect shoes to Break in has always been a problem for me. Every good Breakin shoe has a few good qualities that make them ideal for dancing in, but wouldn’t it be great to have a shoe that is designed to have all the best qualities that a Bboy needs?</p>
<p>In my Bboy Journey, I tried breakin in every type of popular shoe for Breakin, took me a while to finally find  sneakers that I’d love to break in. Those shoes were hard to come by.  I always end up buying more than one pair, because I never know when I would see them next. </p>
<p>Strangely, I knew that even my favorite sneaker types I had worn for years, could and should be better for Breakin. The problem was that these shoes weren’t made for Breakin, and it’s nearly impossible for these huge brands to notice of us, let alone make a better breakin sneaker for us. Also, what really bothered me was despite how huge our Bboy &amp; Bgirl community spends on sneakers, while making these big brands become famous through hip hop and Breakin’s explosion since the 80’s, how much do these Brands give back to our Breakin community? </p>
<p>Sure, sometimes they sponsor us here and there, but for them, they don’t care if Bboyin lives or dies, unlike skateboarding shoe companies who know that if skating dies, so does their brand! Therefore, they give back a lot to keep developing and building up the Skate culture... but who do we have?</p>
<p>So, when I was approached by the owner of a sneaker factory and asked if I would like to create a Bboy shoe, I told them that I could design the best Bboy sneaker shoe in the world if they could make it. I’ll never forget the day they handed me the alpha Bboy sneaker prototypes, my heart almost stopped, and I knew right there and then that these were the best Breakin sneakers I have ever laid my eyes on. </p>
<p>With that said, I am now releasing the pre-sale for the first design called the “Numbawonz”. Why? Because</p>
<ol>
<li>they’re the first sneakers designed specifically for Breakin, they are the prototypes</li>
<li>So far, they are the best shoes for Bboyin ever!</li>
</ol>

<p>Those are pretty bold claims to make, and yes I’m sure there are Bboys out there who the shoe won’t fit (pun intended), but this sneaker was created for the  culture, by the community, and will be continued to be developed and refined by the Bboys and Bgirls. </p>

<p>The Dyzee Bboy sneakers are more high quality than all the other famous sneaker brands who if they matched these qualities would need to significantly raise their prices. Now a lot of people may wonder, is the Bboy &amp; Bgirl community even ready for a high quality Breakin shoe? With the rapid rise of a Pro-Breakin battle industry and it's inclusion into the 2024 Paris Olympics, I sincerely believe that now is the time for the Breakin culture to finally have a product of its own that can be also sold to the general audience. The formula is simple, the Bboys and Bgirls make the brand famous (like it did to the other famous sports brands) and the brand gives back to support the Bboy community like it should be!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The sneaker factory owner has invested significantly in the research and development of the beta prototypes according to the 10 required qualities, forgoing the huge design and development costs. Now that we  have the working prototypes, we need to raise the capital to start the business and production, and further more pay for the minimum factory order of 3000 pairs.<br/>Therefore, I have their approval to organize a community “Pre-sale”, for the first 150-300 pairs of sneakers to test and prove that there is a desire for Breakin to have our own kicks!</p>
<p>If minimum 150 pairs are pre-sold ($15,000 USD), then the first batch will be made for only the testing and feedback before starting the company.</p>
<p>If 300 + pairs get pre-sold ($30,000 USD), then the sneaker factory will begin the full mass production of the Numbawonz and further invest financially as a partner in the creation of the first ever Bboy Sneaker &amp; Battle wear company!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The launch of a Breakin Sneaker Brand will be not just the beginning of a shoe, but the beginning of a sustainable Breakin industry. With Breakin set to go to the 2024 Paris Olympics, it will be just a matter of time before the big brands take an interest once again in the Bboy &amp; Bgirl culture. However, these brands only come around when there is media attention, and when the hype dies down, I'm afraid they will abandon the culture like they did in the 80's, and in the mid 2000's in Korea. </p>
<p>For the people in the Bboy &amp; Bgirl Breakin culture that know me, I have dedicated my life to building a better Breakin future for Bboys and Bgirls worldwide. In 2010, I told the community I would launch a criteria based judging system and was the first to launch and execute an objective system with standards in over 30+ countries worldwide through the late beloved R16 World Championships sparking the movement towards a professional Breakin sports industry.</p>
<p>In 2017, through my vlog, I announced that I would launched a Bboy Battle Business prototype that could give Breakin crews an opportunity to earn a living from their passion, which by the community was dubbed ""The Plan"".  In just 4 months after officially launching a Bboy social club, mini battle arena &amp; multi-purpose venue, I have successfully proven that I can turn a Bboy crew ""Dream Runnerz"" into an official city recognized Pro Breakin team who has monthly showdowns against rival cities, in the small city of Chiayi in Taiwan.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/nYZe6dfX3a8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>With that said, majority of my money is tied up in the Bboy Battle Business and developing the league. However, I was approached with this amazing opportunity to build the perfect Breakin sneaker, which has always been a dream of mine.</p>
<p>Breakin saved my life when I was a teenager growing up in a rough neighborhood, from a broken family, hanging out with the wrong crowd. I believe in the power of this dance, artform, street culture and will continue dedicating my life to building, promoting and developing it. If this sneaker will one day force other brands to fully support our culture by spending millions for a piece of the growing market share like they've done with skateboarding, then whether this sneaker succeeds or fails, it will be all worth it to me.</p>
<p>But if this sneaker brand succeeds, my dream is to build a brand that will treat the Breakin culture way that skate brands treat their skaters. According to the international Association of Skateboard Companies, a healthy skateboarding community = a healthy skateboarding business.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the biggest challenges that we face is the existing sneaker brands ingrained in the culture, and the community support for them, despite the brands not making sneakers specifically designed for Breakin, nor no longer supporting the culture and if so at a minimum.</p>
<p>Our goal to overcome this will be the constant education of the Bboy culture and the continuous development of a Breakin industry, which has been the life mission of Karl Dyzee Alba, who has contributed heavily into the development of the pro-Bboy industry through the development of the first criteria based judging system, his educational Breakin vlogs, and his rival city Breakin League developed in Taiwan and promotion of his Bboy Battle Business.</p>

Hotels have long known everyone loves that luxurious feeling, and bathrobes have always been that choice.It can be difficult to understand how underrated a quality bathrobe is unless you have experienced the comfort before. Having an ideal bathrobe waiting for you at any time transforms your ordinary everyday experience into one of sheer comfort and relaxation.
Everyone needs a Bathrobe
Never be surprised by unexpected visitors again as you are always ready to receive them in style. Wear your robe for pleasure when relaxing around the house or collecting your mail.
Great for moving from a nice hot shower, or leaving the warmth of your bed, helping your body to stay warm and prevent the cold chill.


 

Meet Sento Bathrobe, a delightful creation of luxury combined with Japanese design and craftsmanship.
Durable, yet soft and luxurious design with 100% Japanese cotton. Our materials will aid in drying thanks to the intricacy of the weaving. We have created two styles, one made from a textured cotton waffle weave, and the other a quilted cotton filled padding.

 

 

To complete the experience we have created matching Sento slippers, one to match our waffle robe and another to match our quilted robe.  
Both styles provide that ultra plush feel and are among the most comfortable slippers ever created.

 

 

 

QUILTED ROBE FEATURES
PLUSH & SUPER SOFT
100% High Quality Cotton throughout, including the padding (no polyester or other harsh fibers), making this a unique and ultra-soft robe.
Feels great on your skin, like you're wearing your favorite blanket.

PERFECTLY WEIGHTED
Our Bathrobe has a higher GSM than most other bathrobes, designed to promote relaxation and reduce stress.  
With the daily tension of work and life, you know you can always come home to a snug and comfy robe that will help you feel at ease and recharge.

DOUBLE STITCHED HOODIE
Always have a hoodie when you need one during those extra cold nights.

HAND WARMERS (BUILT IN)
Built-in hand warmers that easily slide in and out of the sleeves, to keep you warm and cozy.

WARMTH + INSULATION
Rated for cold temperatures, 100% cotton padding provides insulation that keeps you warm during winter. NO MORE COLD MORNINGS! 

INSIDE POCKET (FOR YOUR PHONE)
Always have your device in reach with our inside pocket.

 PLUS MATCHING QUILTED SLIPPERS
Your feet are the foundation for your entire body, so they deserve the absolute best. That's why these are not your average hotel slippers, we designed them to be long lasting and extremely plush.
Padded closed-toe slippers to keep you warm, double-stitch lining for care free durability, anti-skid sole with grip so you can walk outside with confidence, plush foam inner to keep you comfortable, and it's machine washable.

WAFFLE ROBE FEATURES  
PREMIUM WAFFLE WEAVE
The deep waffle weave is not only timelessly elegant, but also soft, light, absorbent and durable enough for everyday use. Our robe combines elements of the Japanese Yukata with modern bath robe styles to create something new and unique. 

The advantage of waffle is its unique softness. It has the added benefit of being machine washable and, yes, it gets even softer with every wash.

ODOR AND SMELL RESISTANT
Unlike other fabrics and tightly knit dense cotton weaves, water and sunlight can penetrate deeply into the fabric. Easily rinse out 99% of germs, bacteria & mold with warm water. Dries fast for that clean and fresh feeling every time.

LIGHT & BREATHABLE (PERFECT FOR SUMMER)
Just like the Yukata our waffle robe is perfect for summer and bathing. However this lightweight, yet cozily woven waffle cotton robe is a fine choice for year round comfort.

 

INSPIRED BY THE WORD'S FINEST SPAS
The waffle weave robe is most like the robes used at 5 star spas and luxury hotels.

JAPANESE CRAFTSMANSHIP
The core of our waffle robe is a combination of the best Japanese and western designs and styles.

PLUS MATCHING WAFFLE SLIPPERS
Your feet are the foundation for your entire body, so they deserve the absolute best. That's why these are not your standard hotel slippers, we designed them to be long lasting and extremely plush.
With all the features of the quilted slippers but with an open heel for maximum freedom allowing you to glide into and out of your plush slippers with minimal effort. Includes anti-skid sole with grip so you can walk outside with confidence, plush foam inner to keep you comfortable and machine washable.

Over time, these alerts train your mind and rewire your brain to better tune out distractions. The same technology used to treat ADHD, improve creativity in Olympic figure skaters, and train NASA astronauts, is now accessible to you.     We designed Mindset with a single goal: to create the perfect work headphones.  We’re as tired of wires as you are. Connect Mindset to your computer or phone via Bluetooth to listen to your favorite music, completely wire-free. And don’t worry - if you run out of battery, you can plug in an AUX cable to keep the tunes going.Nothing replaces peace and quiet. Mindset listens to your environment and actively cancels out distracting noise. What’s left is pure, pristine silence.Great products take expertise. We partnered with Onkyo, pioneers in high quality audio, to bring you a crisp, uncompromising sound. We’re working with their engineers to tune and craft the perfect listening experience.  Great ear cups make all the difference. Mindset’s gyroscopic hinge ensures the cups gently cradle your head - no more headaches from uneven pressure. Soft microfiber stays cooler than traditional leather, creating a fit you can comfortably wear all day.Tech shouldn’t get in the way of comfort. Small spring-loaded electrodes fit through your hair, and sit gently on your head. Mindset’s upper band is flexible, designed to distribute the weight over your head. The result is a feeling of weightlessness.     Mindset is more than just state-of-the-art headphones. EEG sensors measure your concentration level in real time. Embedded in Mindset are five electroencephalography (EEG) sensors, which measure the electrical activity in your brain. EEG has been used for over 50 years in hospitals for brain imaging and diagnosis.The EEG signal contains profound insight into a user’s state of mind. Sophisticated processing techniques can be used to infer emotional states, anxiety levels, concentration, and more.   The first ever tool to measure your concentration in real time. A world of potential self-improvement.  Using advanced machine learning, Mindset recognizes the patterns in the EEG signal that represent a deep, focused mind. Mindset measures your concentration level in real time, tracking your changes throughout the day.With Mindset, you can schedule deep work sessions to get in the zone. During deep work sessions, Mindset can alert you whenever you get distracted, so you can return to task immediately. No more getting sidetracked, when what you really want is to be crossing things off your to-do list.Over time, each alert trains your mind to better recognize when it becomes distracted, leading to lasting improvements in concentration. Deeper, longer concentration that persists when you take the headphones off. Imagine how this could change your life.   Your workday is as unique as your fingerprint. The more you use Mindset, the better it understands how your concentration changes throughout the day. Over time, Mindset can give suggestions on how to improve your productivity: schedule emails during your downtime, and save your best hours for your deep work sessions.For additional improvement, schedule a neurofeedback session. Think of it like a gym for your mind: use proven clinical methods to train your brain and further strengthen your concentration muscle. Watch as your concentration grows over time.   In a world of open-concept offices, constant emailing, and social media, we are more distracted than ever. Even in the absence of distraction, we’re having a hard time paying attention to anything for more than a few minutes. And it’s getting worse.     Neurofeedback is a widely used technology that trains your mind to better focus. CEOs, professional athletes, military leaders, and other high performers are using neurofeedback to achieve their full potential.However, it’s simply not accessible - it’s expensive, uncomfortable, and takes hours to use. Mindset makes this technology affordable for everyone. 
We spent the last 4 months in Shenzhen, China, the manufacturing capital of the world. We’ve gone through dozens of prototypes, making sure to get each element just right. The result has simply blown us away.        Measuring concentration via EEGBerka, Chris, Gene David, Richard E. Olmstead, and Patrick L. Craven.

<p><strong>Tomorrows’s sunglasses from yesterday’s waste. </strong></p>
<p>Lazlo: sustainable sunglasses that offer a <strong>completely different</strong> view —quite literally— on the role of waste in our society.</p>
<p>When Yuma Labs says <strong>circular</strong> we are not just talking round lenses or John Lennon frames. </p>
<p>Our recycling process goes <strong>full circle</strong>, and our design never out of <strong>style</strong>. </p>

The natural movement of your wrist literally energizes your watch and makes its wheels and gears move. As you move, a spring winds, storing energy for up to 40 hours. No manual winding required!     Smooth, curvaceous and incredibly strong, just like you need your watch to be. The glass face is fashioned from 1.2mm hyperboloid artificial sapphire for ultimate scratch resistance.Only diamond is stronger.  Splashes and rain won’t stop the time. CIGA is water-resistant to 3 ATM waterproofing standards.  Curious about how the intricacy of watch works inside out? Our fully hollow design allows you to see through every part of the mechanics. Giving you the ownership to admire the craftsmanship of the watch at a deeper level. Through our watches, we want you to see, feel and own the watch at work on your wrist.  Customized SEAGULL AAA-Class movement ST2553JK• Energy storage of 40 hours• Movement frequency of 21,600 times/hour• Movement error range: -15 to +30 seconds/ 24 hoursSEAGULL is one of the largest manufactures for movements. The brand is known for its advanced technology and precision. CIGA Design is proud to own a customized version for the watches.  Wear it all the time.Titanium is skin-friendly and hypoallergenic and is widely used in medical, jewelry and other manufacturing industries.

Con Eleonora, la seconda generazione, si è particolarmente dedicata alla ricerca di fibre e filati innovativi, affiancando tessuti funzionali e sostenibili alla produzione più classica.La filosofia dell’azienda è quella di promuovere un abbigliamento che si prenda cura sia del benessere della persona, grazie all’estremo comfort dei tessuti a contatto con la pelle e alle proprietà dei filati impiegati, sia che sia attento alla sostenibilità dal punto di vista ambientale e sociale.I tessuti sono prodotti ad hoc per le esigenze del cliente, evitando il più possibile sprechi e rimanenze, collaborando con fornitori italiani sempre attenti alle innovazioni e alla qualità della materia prima. LA NASCITA DEL PROGETTOIl cancro al seno è il tumore più comune nelle donne e il secondo tumore più comune in generale. Ci sono stati 54.976 casi in Italia nel 2020.Le donne che incontrano questa malattia così diffusa molto spesso devono fare i conti con interventi chirurgici al seno e una lunga serie di terapie (chemioterapia, radioterapia, ...). In questo periodo stressante, pieno di check-up e visite mediche, le donne spesso perdono la fiducia nel corpo, nell'autostima e nell'intimità.I prodotti abitualmente usati dopo l’intervento come i reggiseni post-operatori, la maggior parte delle volte contribuiscono al loro disagio.Dopo molte ricerche di mercato e dopo molte interviste a medici, pazienti ed ex pazienti per comprenderne le esigenze, Chiara ed Eleonora hanno sviluppato reggiseni post-operatori con un design studiato tenendo conto di tutti gli accorgimenti consigliati dagli esperti e con caratteristiche a sostegno dell’estetica, della bellezza e delle differenti forme di ogni donna, per poter ritrovare fiducia in se stesse.LA MISSION
Creare un reggiseno adatto alle donne che hanno subito un intervento di asportazione parziale o totale del seno.
Impiegare materiali che supportano il processo di guarigione e benessere, utilizzando fibre tessili con capacità antibatteriche, lenitive delle irritazioni e con proprietà benefiche per la pelle.
Utilizzare un design valorizzante a supporto della femminilità e unicità.
Scegliere soluzioni ecosostenibili nella scelta del packaging e dei materiali utilizzati
Grazie a questa raccolta fondi e al raggiungimento dell’obiettivo prefissato, Chiara e Eleonora potranno produrre la primissima collezione Wabi Sabi da proporre sul mercato.La collezione prende in prestito il nome dal mondo Giapponese. “Wabi Sabi” è una visione fondata sull’accettazione della transitorietà e imperfezione delle cose, talvolta descritta come “bellezza imperfetta”.La collezione prevede un trattamento “BIFASICO”, ovvero composto da due step fondati rispettivamente sul concetto di rinnovo cellulare e di protezione:
Fase uno: Re-Start
Fase due: Re-Birth

COSA SERVE E COSA DANNO IN CAMBIOPer raggiungere l’obiettivo della prima produzione della collezione Wabi Sabi, Chiara e Eleonora si sono segnate come traguardo iniziale, la copertura parziale o intera del costo della confezione pari a 5.000€.Questi soldi andranno interamente al confezionista per la produzione dei reggiseni. Chiara e Eleonora hanno pensato di chiedere un sostegno concreto a chi è interessato al progetto, a chi ha toccato con mano la malattia o chi semplicemente crede nell’innovazione e nel lavoro di due donne giovani.Gli altri costi che si andranno a sostenere dopo il raggiungimento dell'obiettivo prefissato sono:
7.000€ di tessuti
600€ di accessori (spalline, pizzi,...)
2.000€ di costi di gestione (trasporti, e-commerce, packaging,...)

Q-SKIN® takes care of the skin, offering the wearer breathability, hygiene, comfort and freshness in any situation.OTHER WAYS TO SUPPORT WABI SABIYou can also support this project by spreading the crowdfunding link to all friends and relatives, talking about this initiative, spreading word of mouth and helping Chiara and Eleonora to make their mission known!Follow Wabi Sabi on Instagram:@feeling_nova@textilrossand Facebook:@feelingnova@textilrossThank You!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span>THE ONLY CAMPFIRE-PROOF JACKET</span> – An outdoor jacket needs to be as light and breathable as possible, even campfire-proof ones.  We worked with fabric manufacturers to develop a lightweight laminated Nomex® fabric that is fire resistant and waterproof.  Nomex® is a naturally fire resistant fiber that is used on everything from the Mars Rover to Flight Suits, from firefighting gear to industrial apparel that is now making its way to the outdoor industry.  Finally a jacket that won't melt around the campfire!</p>

<p>Our exterior fabric is tear-proof. Not only is our Nomex® fabric fire resistant and waterproof, but as Kevlar®'s little brother, Nomex® is as strong as it is comfortable. We've searched far and wide to find the perfect fabrics &amp; materials to make this jacket  tough-as-nails.  </p>

<p>Most puffy jackets claim to be waterproof by applying a durable water repellency (DWR) coating that lets water bead up and run off the jacket.  That's great, we did that too.  But we went a step further – our exterior fabric, a 3-layer laminate material, is designed to be waterproof up to a 10 meter water column, with breathability of 10000g/m2. That's the quality and waterproof-ness in most $200+ rain shells. </p>

<p>Since the fabric we selected for our exterior material is waterproof it also is inherently wind proof.  Most jackets on the market are wind resistant which means that they block some of the wind, but not all... Ours blocks ALL the wind – keeping you warmer. </p>

<p>Most insulated puffy jackets use a baffled design.  They do this because their insulation is loose and and they have to keep it in place.  This reduces the warmth and let's be honest, it doesn't look good.  We went with a structured insulation which allows us to design the jacket using large panels.  This creates uniform insulation coverage – reducing cold spots &amp; increasing warmth.  Not to mention it looks way better.</p>

<p> <span>Polartec® Power Fill™ is a premium insulation made from 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) content</span></p>
<p>This proprietary insulation provides greater warmth retention in colder conditions, without added weight or bulk– ideal for a variety of activities where body heat can’t ensure proper warmth. Polartec® Power Fill™ is a soft and pliable matrix of polyester fibers engineered with a distinct geometric shape. A unique process bonds the hollow fibers, which gives Power Fill™ unmatched warmth, durability &amp; comfort. This matrix forms thousands of small air pockets that continuously capture and contain body heat, while maintaining a resilient, equalized thermal layer between the colder air on the outside and the warmer temperatures inside. The polyester fiber's inherent hydrophobic properties also work to ensure that Polartec® Power Fill™ resists moisture absorption and dries quickly, while maintaining a high warmth to weight ratio.</p>

<p>We pride ourselves on making highly-functional apparel. The Element comes with eight hidden pockets - four outside and four inside. The four exterior pockets are on either side of the chest and waist and zippered with premium YKK zippers. Two of the interior pockets are staggered in-between the exterior pocket pairs to prevent bulky spots. They’ve got premium YKK zippers, too. Lastly, we’ve stitched in two interior stash pockets on either side of the main zipper, both big enough to store a 13’’ Macbook Air.</p>

<p>At Trekka we love symmetry.  Most companies out there only give you one chest pocket.  We gave you 4, and there is a reason for that.   Whether you're left or right handed you will find a pocket placement that is natural for you.  Exterior pockets are great if you want to put something in your pocket with out unzipping the jacket letting out precious heat.   </p>

<p>If you have two chest pockets already why do you need two more? Great question. The exterior pockets are to be used if you don't want to lose heat. But what if what you are storing needs to be warm? That is why we have interior chest pockets as well. Phone batteries can die when exposed to the cold, placing them in the interior pockets allows them to be insulated from the cold weather while your body heat keeps it warm.  </p>

<p>Most jackets in the outdoor industry are tailored to absurdly loose fitting.

<h1> <span>THE “WHY” OF THE JACKET</span> </h1>
<p>Almost every premium outdoor jacket is built to conquer big mountains, high winds, low temps, and all the rain and snow you can throw at it. But when they come up against a tiny spark from a campfire...it’s like an arrow right into the heel of Achilles. Time spent around a campfire should be worry-free. But if you’re not quick enough to adjust to a change in wind direction or forget to take your jacket off before tending the fire, your high-priced jacket soon starts to look like a failed Chia pet. Those new holes don’t help with heat-retention either.</p>
<p>We wanted a jacket that could conquer both the mountain and the campfire - one that could literally stand up to all the elements and still look great and feel great to wear. If you’re like us and love to spend hours around a campfire after a long day on the trail, this jacket is made for you.  </p>
<div data-id=""30245637""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1609175581/ktepb2kjdl6cbnmybegr.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<h1><span>IT’S ALSO EVERYTHING-ELSE-PROOF</span></h1>
<p>It doesn’t make sense to have a campfire-proof jacket if it can’t stand up to everything else you have to face to get there. That’s where our outer material comes in. We chose a heavy-duty technical fabric that’s waterproof and windproof without the use of special coatings. It’s resistant to the wear and tear that comes from friction hotspots, jagged rocks, and thorns. It’s also breathable and only comes in at 2oz heavier than the leading premium outdoor jacket. An extra 2oz is worth it when the jacket is campfire-proof.</p>
<div data-id=""30644312""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.ridgedalemill.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/trekka-fire-proof-jacket.gif"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<h1><span>KEEPING YOU WARM BEFORE THE CAMPFIRE</span></h1>
<p>Traditional puffy jackets have a baffled insulation design, which means lots of extra holes from the stitching. More holes means less heat retention. Instead, we designed the Element with large insulation panels, giving you more coverage and less stitching for heat to escape through.</p>
<p>The panels are a high-quality Polartec™ insulation that’s made from 100% post-consumer recycled water bottles and that keeps 85% heat retention when wet. Nobody ever plans to take a polar plunge during a stream crossing. But just in case you do, we’ve got you covered.</p>
<h1><span>KEEPING YOU COMFY</span></h1>
<p>A lot of premium outdoor jackets like to show off all their bells and whistles with exposed drawstrings, fabrics, and webbing. You won’t see any of that on the Element, but that doesn’t mean it’s bells-and-whistles-free. A few of our favorite features are the micro-fleece lining of our exterior waist pockets, giving your hands a little extra warmth and comfort. The zipper has a micro-fleece hood right below the chin – to reduce chafing &amp; prevent the zipper from bouncing around on long hikes.</p>
<p>Keeping your heat from escaping out the top and bottom is also crucial to comfort. We’ve included two cinches on either side of the waist for extra heat retention as well as a cinch at the back of the hood. No more dangling drawstrings. The hood is big enough to go over a climbing helmet, but the cinch system will keep you dome dry and warm when you go au natural.</p>

 WHO IS TREKKA
Trekka Designs is an adventure travel gear company focused on great design. We make the gear we’ve always wanted but have never been able to find. Our newest creation is a premium puffy jacket that can’t be damaged around the campfire. 
Color Options
 Puffy Jacket Features: 

THE ONLY CAMPFIRE-PROOF JACKET – An outdoor jacket needs to be as light and breathable as possible, even campfire-proof ones.  We worked with fabric manufacturers to develop a lightweight laminated Nomex® fabric that is fire resistant and waterproof.  Nomex® is a naturally fire resistant fiber that is used on everything from the Mars Rover to Flight Suits, from firefighting gear to industrial apparel that is now making its way to the outdoor industry.  Finally a jacket that won't melt around the campfire!



Our exterior fabric is tear-proof. Not only is our Nomex® fabric fire resistant and waterproof, but as Kevlar®'s little brother, Nomex® is as strong as it is comfortable. We've searched far and wide to find the perfect fabrics & materials to make this jacket  tough-as-nails.  


Most puffy jackets claim to be waterproof by applying a durable water repellency (DWR) coating that lets water bead up and run off the jacket.  That's great, we did that too.  But we went a step further – our exterior fabric, a 3-layer laminate material, is designed to be waterproof up to a 10 meter water column, with breathability of 10000g/m2. That's the quality and waterproof-ness in most $200+ rain shells. 



Since the fabric we selected for our exterior material is waterproof it also is inherently wind proof.  Most jackets on the market are wind resistant which means that they block some of the wind, but not all... Ours blocks ALL the wind – keeping you warmer. 
Downtown Walk

Most insulated puffy jackets use a baffled design.  They do this because their insulation is loose and and they have to keep it in place.  This reduces the warmth and let's be honest, it doesn't look good.  We went with a structured insulation which allows us to design the jacket using large panels.  This creates uniform insulation coverage – reducing cold spots & increasing warmth.  Not to mention it looks way better.




 Polartec® Power Fill™ is a premium insulation made from 100% post-consumer recycled (PCR) content
This proprietary insulation provides greater warmth retention in colder conditions, without added weight or bulk– ideal for a variety of activities where body heat can’t ensure proper warmth. Polartec® Power Fill™ is a soft and pliable matrix of polyester fibers engineered with a distinct geometric shape. A unique process bonds the hollow fibers, which gives Power Fill™ unmatched warmth, durability & comfort. This matrix forms thousands of small air pockets that continuously capture and contain body heat, while maintaining a resilient, equalized thermal layer between the colder air on the outside and the warmer temperatures inside. The polyester fiber's inherent hydrophobic properties also work to ensure that Polartec® Power Fill™ resists moisture absorption and dries quickly, while maintaining a high warmth to weight ratio.
What are the benefits of our insulation?   
 



We pride ourselves on making highly-functional apparel. The Element comes with eight hidden pockets - four outside and four inside. The four exterior pockets are on either side of the chest and waist and zippered with premium YKK zippers. Two of the interior pockets are staggered in-between the exterior pocket pairs to prevent bulky spots. They’ve got premium YKK zippers, too. Lastly, we’ve stitched in two interior stash pockets on either side of the main zipper, both big enough to store a 13’’ Macbook Air.
8 Perfect Hidden Pockets!

The interior of hip pockets are lined with micro fleece.  Not only does this increase the warmth, but feels so much better than the plastic feeling pockets in other puffy jackets. 


At Trekka we love symmetry.  Most companies out there only give you one chest pocket.  We gave you 4, and there is a reason for that.   Whether you're left or right handed you will find a pocket placement that is natural for you.  Exterior pockets are great if you want to put something in your pocket with out unzipping the jacket letting out precious heat.   


If you have two chest pockets already why do you need two more? Great question. The exterior pockets are to be used if you don't want to lose heat. But what if what you are storing needs to be warm? That is why we have interior chest pockets as well. Phone batteries can die when exposed to the cold, placing them in the interior pockets allows them to be insulated from the cold weather while your body heat keeps it warm.  


Sometimes you just need to quickly throw some stuff in pockets and get moving. Maybe you just bought a couple 40's and don't feel like carrying them in your hands out to the car.  Hey, no judgement here.   Or maybe you are sick of carrying your laptop under your arm.  whatever the case is we've got you covered.  


This jacket should be about YOU not us.  We are not a fan of being a billboard for every large outdoor brand and we don't want you to be a billboard for us.  We know if you love the jacket your friends will know what brand it is without staring at your chest.
Our Logo is Subtle & Low Key
And Yes, Our logo is actually in this picture

Unlike most insulated jacket on the market we used a 4 way stretch fabric for maximum movement.  This gives the jacket some extra movement without the need to make it overly baggy to compensate.  


Even though this jacket doesn't let water in, it will let water out.  Thanks to a 3 layer outer fabric that is laminated with a membrane that is permeated with tiny holes that are big enough to let water vapor from your body out, but small enough to keep the water droplets out. 


DWR is that magical coating all advertisers love to show off with wine rolling off that beautiful white T-shirt.  Of course we added it to our jacket too.  But when it will diminish with time just remember your jacket is still waterproof.


Most jackets in the outdoor industry are tailored to absurdly loose fitting. There is no performance reasoning for this.  Instead it just makes us look like a frumpy doofus.  We went a different route with a tailored fit that actually makes you look great while still being loose and comfortable enough to take on any adventure.  

Because they're the best.


 This jacket is meant to be taken on any adventure.  And for that to happen it has to be packable.   The insulation and lightweight materials allow this jacket to compress to an extremely small size while being warmer than the competition.   

 Even though we have packed this jacked with features.  Our jacket comes in weighing only 2oz more than the leading competition.  Well worth the weight for fire resistance, waterproofness and abrasion resistance.

In case the weather is extremely cold and you need every precious atom of warm air inside your jacket there are two waist drawcords that can be operated with just one hand reducing any air from escaping from the bottom.  


 Single hand use drawcord for if you need to change the fit of the hood  


 The Three-Panel Hood has been design to more comfortably fit your head and if necessary a helmet. This allows for a more natural fit and doesn't leave a seam in the middle causing irritation. 

 THE “WHY” OF THE JACKET 
Almost every premium outdoor jacket is built to conquer big mountains, high winds, low temps, and all the rain and snow you can throw at it. But when they come up against a tiny spark from a campfire...it’s like an arrow right into the heel of Achilles. Time spent around a campfire should be worry-free. But if you’re not quick enough to adjust to a change in wind direction or forget to take your jacket off before tending the fire, your high-priced jacket soon starts to look like a failed Chia pet. Those new holes don’t help with heat-retention either.
We wanted a jacket that could conquer both the mountain and the campfire - one that could literally stand up to all the elements and still look great and feel great to wear. If you’re like us and love to spend hours around a campfire after a long day on the trail, this jacket is made for you.  

IT’S ALSO EVERYTHING-ELSE-PROOF
It doesn’t make sense to have a campfire-proof jacket if it can’t stand up to everything else you have to face to get there. That’s where our outer material comes in. We chose a heavy-duty technical fabric that’s waterproof and windproof without the use of special coatings. It’s resistant to the wear and tear that comes from friction hotspots, jagged rocks, and thorns. It’s also breathable and only comes in at 2oz heavier than the leading premium outdoor jacket. An extra 2oz is worth it when the jacket is campfire-proof.

KEEPING YOU WARM BEFORE THE CAMPFIRE
Traditional puffy jackets have a baffled insulation design, which means lots of extra holes from the stitching. More holes means less heat retention. Instead, we designed the Element with large insulation panels, giving you more coverage and less stitching for heat to escape through.
The panels are a high-quality Polartec™ insulation that’s made from 100% post-consumer recycled water bottles and that keeps 85% heat retention when wet. Nobody ever plans to take a polar plunge during a stream crossing. But just in case you do, we’ve got you covered.
KEEPING YOU COMFY
A lot of premium outdoor jackets like to show off all their bells and whistles with exposed drawstrings, fabrics, and webbing. You won’t see any of that on the Element, but that doesn’t mean it’s bells-and-whistles-free. A few of our favorite features are the micro-fleece lining of our exterior waist pockets, giving your hands a little extra warmth and comfort. The zipper has a micro-fleece hood right below the chin – to reduce chafing & prevent the zipper from bouncing around on long hikes.
Keeping your heat from escaping out the top and bottom is also crucial to comfort. We’ve included two cinches on either side of the waist for extra heat retention as well as a cinch at the back of the hood. No more dangling drawstrings. The hood is big enough to go over a climbing helmet, but the cinch system will keep you dome dry and warm when you go au natural.


FROM THE CAMPFIRE TO THE CITY
Just in case you oversleep after a winter weekend in the woods, the Element is stylish enough to keep you warm and looking good on your way to the office Monday morning. Trekka Designs is all about clean, smooth, minimalist lines. Our jacket has a tailored fit without sacrificing room for layering.

Select the one you prefer on the rewards page (or scroll further up, on the right, if you are on desktop), and simply make a pledge. Your watch will be delivered in September, and way before Christmas! Whichever one you pick, you will be saving an average of nearly 35% off our retail prices.<br/><br/>Add-ons: Obtain additional watches at even greater discounts! After you select your first watch, you can choose additional pieces at a very enticing price.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">NEED MORE INFORMATION?</h3><p> </p><p>1) Will the watch suit your wrist?</p><p>Pictured on a 5 1/5 inch wrist</p><p>Our watches are sized at 33mm, which means most female wrist sizes, from 4.5 inch to 7inch (11.4cm to 17.8cm) circumference, will be able to carry this elegant watch silhouette off beautifully.</p><p> </p><p>2) Detailed Specifications</p><p>Each Artemis Time Art - Glimpses of Nature timepiece is built to the highest standards. Instead of using cheaper, unreliable movements found in most watches at this price point, we have opted to utilise high-grade Ronda Swiss movements, usually used in far-pricier brands.</p><p>The Swiss-Made Ronda Slimtech 1063 measures at only 1.9mm, allowing us to create the watch in such a slim profile. The movement delivers up to a whooping 6 YEARS of battery life using a standard 321/364 battery which comes included, and can be easily changed at any watchmaker/repair shop globally when the time comes.</p><p>Each watch case is built using surgical-grade 316L stainless steel; none of that cheap chromed plated plastic material masquerading as a metal case in most fashion watches.</p><p>The watches are individually rated to 50m of water resistance, so you can be rest assured going about your daily routine!</p><p>Worried about the fragility of our Enamel dials? No worries! We have conducted several drop tests of our watches at various heights, and we are assured that they will stand up to the occasional clumsiness.</p><p> </p><p> 3) Warranty </p><p>We got you fam! Every watch is covered by an International Warranty of 12 months, against all worksmanship issues. We maintain a technical workshop here in Singapore, and will be able to quickly rectify any issues arising from our manufacturing process. That said, quality control is very important to us, and each piece will undergo a rigorous inspection process, so the chances of you receiving a piece with worksmanship issues is extremely slim.</p><p>In the rare event you encounter any worksmanship issues with your watch, simply send it over to us to have it rectified! We believe in a fair and easy after-sales service experience.</p><p>Production has already begun on the watches, and we are ensuring that each piece will receive the necessary attention it requires, especially on the enamelled dials! We are looking at delivery of your watches latest by September 2021,  subsequent to a stringent quality inspection.</p><p>Each watch will undergo 3 levels of Quality Control prior to shipping out (dial inspection, movement inspection and assembly inspection), so you rest assured you will be receiving a beautiful AND functional watch!</p><p> </p><p> 4) Shipping </p><p>Shipping to international destinations will be via registered mail (E-Packets), with tracking. Once we have the tracking numbers, you can sit back (in gleeful anticipation) and await your package to arrive.</p><p>We are a start-up based in Singapore, founded by (surprise surprise) two young lads!

 Over $32,000 raised on Kickstarter! At Artemis Time Art, we fuse quality watch-making with beautiful creative dials, using a range of lost artisanal techniques. For our first collection, we are drawing inspiration from the centuries-old art of Hand-Painted Champlevé Enamelling, to create beautiful and meaningful timepieces for the individual.Are you tired of the standard fashion watches on the market these days, where ""minimalism"" is a cover for lack of design effort? If so, read on, and find out what we are doing differently! VISIT OUR GALLERY FOR HIGHER RESOLUTION IMAGESIf pictures are your thing, visit our full image gallery in higher resolution (KS's compression is pretty heavy) here, before coming back to read the details in-depth:https://artemistimeart.com/pages/gallery Below are amazing pieces we admire, from some prestigious brands. We have always loved the idea of Champlevé Enamel in watches, but could never come close to affording one.Because of the tedious and lengthy process of enamelling, and due to the scarcity of appropriate talent, such watches usually command a respectable price in the market.For a long time, haute horology houses have been utilising enamelling in their watches, which run for tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of dollars. The process is lengthy and tedious; each dial can take hours, if not days, to create.  So, we decided to make our own! And make them available and accessible for everyone.  Our process is essentially an updated version of the traditional art of Champlevé Enamelling. It is a technique which harks back to as early as the 3rd Century, and was prevalently used in jewellery and ornate boxes.First, a metallic plate is carved and etched with the artistic details, forming troughs. Vitreous coloured enamel is then pulverised, liquified and filled into the troughs. The entire dial is then fired in a kiln. The annealing of the enamel creates a smooth, glossy coloured effect resembling stained glass! It is then left to cool and set.Dials are then assembled along with the hands, crystal indices, and movement into the watch. It is secured with a caseback, and tested for water-resistance. Our First Collection: Glimpses of NatureArtemis Time Art's inaugural collection pays tribute to both the lost art of enamelling, as well as charming scenes found in nature. We have also taken effort in creating each dial to pay homage to a different traditional art style from around the world. More importantly, each model is designed with a different personality in mind! You can choose your watch based on how you feel about yourself, and how you wish to express your individualism! ""Migration""  (Limited Edition of 188pcs)  NOTE: In the production model, the crane bodies will be filled with off-white enamel, like the second picture shown. Inspired by the enigmatic patterns found on traditional Japanese kimonos, which are dyed using the Yūzen technique. The dance of cranes is immortalised here, depicting them in flight across a marshland. A combination of earthy hues are used here, which works beautifully in harmony with the rose gold case.  This has also been the most challenging dial for us to create and execute to date, as such it will only be made in a very limited quantity of just 188 pieces, never to be repeated.Each Migration timepiece comes with 12 Genuine Clear Swarovski Crystals indicating the hours, along with a Denim Blue Swarovski 17-facet crystal on the crown. The timepiece will come with two straps: 1) A Genuine leather, Saffiano calfskin strap in mocha brown2) A Gold Milanese Mesh braceletIdeal for: The Traveller, The Lady who pays attention to details.  ""Bee Mine""  Gold and black combinations are always a crowd-winner, and this is best exemplified in Chinese art of laquering, which flourished during the Han Dynasty. Bee Mine is a playful tribute to companionship and love, with two bees hovering around each other. The enamelling technique is used differently in this model, with deep black enamelling forming the empty spaces, framing the embossed gold details.Each Bee Mine timepiece comes with 12 Jet Black genuine Swarovski Crystals indicating the hours, along with a Jet Black Swarovski 17-facet crystal on the crown. The timepiece will come with two straps: 1) A Genuine leather, Saffiano calfskin strap in black2) A Gold Milanese Mesh braceletIdeal for: The Lover, The Romantic, The Best Friend. ""Songbird""A juxtaposition between detail and empty space, the Song Bird pays tribute to Nordic Folk Art, which makes use of simple line elements used in repetition and vibrant colours.Each Song Bird timepiece comes with 12 Genuine Clear Swarovski Crystals indicating the hours, along with a Light Amethyst Swarovski 17-facet crystal on the crown. The timepiece will come with two straps: 1) A Genuine leather, Saffiano calfskin strap in pastel blue2) A Silver Milanese Mesh braceletIdeal for: The Creative Spirit, The Inspirational. ""Tigress"" The Jewish tradition of paper-cut marriage contracts, or Ketubah, is our source of reference for this model. Intricate details combine harmoniously to form a landscape, while the Tigress stands proudly against the green terrain.We love the symbology of the Tigress: a wild and fierce figure, silent but not one to be trifled with.Each Tigress timepiece comes with 12 clear genuine Swarovski Crystals indicating the hours, along with a Light Amethyst Swarovski 17-facet crystal on the crown. The timepiece will come with two straps: 1) A Genuine leather, Saffiano calfskin strap in forest green2) A Silver Milanese Mesh braceletIdeal for: The Independent one, The Wild Spirit  READY TO SECURE YOUR OWN ATA TIMEPIECE?We have several tiers of perks, as well as add-ons. Select the one you prefer on the rewards page (or scroll further up, on the right, if you are on desktop), and simply make a pledge. Your watch will be delivered in September, and way before Christmas! Whichever one you pick, you will be saving an average of nearly 35% off our retail prices.Add-ons: Obtain additional watches at even greater discounts! After you select your first watch, you can choose additional pieces at a very enticing price. NEED MORE INFORMATION? 1) Will the watch suit your wrist?Pictured on a 5 1/5 inch wristOur watches are sized at 33mm, which means most female wrist sizes, from 4.5 inch to 7inch (11.4cm to 17.8cm) circumference, will be able to carry this elegant watch silhouette off beautifully. 2) Detailed SpecificationsEach Artemis Time Art - Glimpses of Nature timepiece is built to the highest standards. Instead of using cheaper, unreliable movements found in most watches at this price point, we have opted to utilise high-grade Ronda Swiss movements, usually used in far-pricier brands.The Swiss-Made Ronda Slimtech 1063 measures at only 1.9mm, allowing us to create the watch in such a slim profile. The movement delivers up to a whooping 6 YEARS of battery life using a standard 321/364 battery which comes included, and can be easily changed at any watchmaker/repair shop globally when the time comes.Each watch case is built using surgical-grade 316L stainless steel; none of that cheap chromed plated plastic material masquerading as a metal case in most fashion watches.The watches are individually rated to 50m of water resistance, so you can be rest assured going about your daily routine!Worried about the fragility of our Enamel dials? No worries! We have conducted several drop tests of our watches at various heights, and we are assured that they will stand up to the occasional clumsiness.  3) Warranty We got you fam! Every watch is covered by an International Warranty of 12 months, against all worksmanship issues. We maintain a technical workshop here in Singapore, and will be able to quickly rectify any issues arising from our manufacturing process. That said, quality control is very important to us, and each piece will undergo a rigorous inspection process, so the chances of you receiving a piece with worksmanship issues is extremely slim.In the rare event you encounter any worksmanship issues with your watch, simply send it over to us to have it rectified! We believe in a fair and easy after-sales service experience.Production has already begun on the watches, and we are ensuring that each piece will receive the necessary attention it requires, especially on the enamelled dials! We are looking at delivery of your watches latest by September 2021,  subsequent to a stringent quality inspection.Each watch will undergo 3 levels of Quality Control prior to shipping out (dial inspection, movement inspection and assembly inspection), so you rest assured you will be receiving a beautiful AND functional watch!  4) Shipping Shipping to international destinations will be via registered mail (E-Packets), with tracking. Once we have the tracking numbers, you can sit back (in gleeful anticipation) and await your package to arrive.We are a start-up based in Singapore, founded by (surprise surprise) two young lads! We are watch lovers, and have often heard from our female friends that there is a lack of compelling, well-design and quality watches at the more affordable end of the price spectrum.As such, we have set out to create what we perceive as ideal watches with Artemis Time Art. Of course, we had alot of feedback and help from our female friends, and we have learnt a lot about female watches through the journey!We would love to hear from you, on any suggestions for future releases.

<p><b>When will the DogTelligent Connected Collar</b>™ <b>ship</b>?<br/>
Answer: Due to a high volume of pre-orders, we will prioritize shipping pre-order
units with a target ship date for
pre-orders as early as September of 2016.</p>
<p>At DogTelligent, we are passionate
about our users and want to ensure you receive the best and most honest
customer experience possible. We look forward to you joining the smartest
community of connected dog owners in the world.</p>
<p><b>How does DogTelligent Connected Collar</b>™ <b>track my dog’s
activity</b>?<br/>
Answer: The DogTelligent Connected Collar™ tracks activities like running,
playing, resting and walking, allowing you to have a detailed look at your
dog’s activity. The Connected Collar™ captures activity data using a 3-axis
accelerometer (like a jogger’s pedometer) and our algorithm identifies the
behavior for you to visualize in the DogTelligent App. This tracking helps you
become a more informed dog parent who provides daily, weekly and monthly
activities that will lead to a healthier pet.</p>
<p><b>What is Virtual Leash and Fence Technology</b>?<br/>
Answer: The DogTelligent Connected Collar™ is designed with many training and
safety features. Our Virtual Leash and Fence Technology allows you to set
specific boundaries for your dog, with parameters you set up in your
DogTelligent app. When the dog reaches a boundary, the Connected Collar™ uses
patent-pending technology to simulate the sensation of a leash yank, and you
get an alert. For instance, if you take your dog on a walk without a leash and
want to keep him/her close, the Virtual Leash technology will activate when
your dog reaches your preset distance limit, say, 5 feet from your mobile
device. This feature requires training.</p>
<p>Boundary training on your mobile device
is called the Virtual Leash; on desktop computers this technology is called
Virtual Fence.</p>
<p><b>How close / accurate is the GPS location</b>?  <br/>
Answer: Position Accuracy is approximately 3 meters (less than 10 feet).
Average range for all GPS technology is about 3 meters.</p>
<p><b>Where does the DogTelligent Connected Collar</b>™<b> work</b>?  <br/>
Answer: The DogTelligent Connected Collar™ is designed to work in the U.S. on
America’s most reliable cellular network, and anywhere you have a Wi-Fi or
Bluetooth connection.</p>
<p><b>How does data sync from the Connected Collar</b>™<b> to my app and
mobile device</b>?<br/>
Answer: The DogTelligent Connected Collar™ can use Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cellular
to sync. The Connected Collar™ collects data and our app interface synthesizes
that data for you, so you will receive analysis and insight into your dog’s
activities. The Connected Collar™ is currently designed to sync every 30
minutes.  </p>
<p><b>If I am away from devices that sync data </b>(<b>Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or
Cellular</b>)<b>, will I lose that data</b>?<br/>
Answer: The Connected Collar™ can store up to 30 days of tracking
information.  Once your Connected Collar™
is back online or in range of a paired Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cellular connection,
it will automatically push all of the saved data to sync with your app.</p>
<p><b>How is the DogTelligent Connected Collar</b>™<b> different from a
microchip</b>?</p>
<p>Answer: The Connected Collar™ is a
complete Tracking, Training and Health Monitoring system that uses breakthrough
GPS, Bluetooth and cellular technology to let you to see where your dog is at
any time, and will alert you if your dog goes beyond your personal limits.
The Connected Collar™ not only allows you, the owner, to use GPS tracking to
find your dog, it also allows any helpful person who finds your dog to access
your contact information via our website or mobile app. As an added benefit,
the DogTelligent app contains your vet contact info, should your dog need
medical attention. Traditional microchips and RFID tags, while useful as a
back-up measure, are a reactive technology. Lost dogs with an embedded
microship must be found and taken to a vet or shelter; hopefully the vet or
shelter has the owner’s contact information. 
With millions of dogs lost every year, only about 20% are returned to
their owners according to the National Council on Pet Population Study and
Policy.</p>
<p><b>How do I charge my Connected Collar</b>™?<br/>
Answer: The Connected Collar™ has an internal rechargeable battery that is
easily recharged with our conductive charger. With typical use, the battery

remaining at any given time.</p>
<p><b>Is my Connected Collar</b>™
<b>under warranty</b>?</p>
<p>Answer: The DogTelligent Connected Collar™
includes a 1-year manufacturer’s warranty from date of purchase from
DogTelligent.com or 1 year from date of activation when purchased from an
authorized retailer. Pet-induced damage is not covered by warranty.</p>
<p>Email us at info@dogtelligent.com and
we will help troubleshoot any problems you might be experiencing. </p>
<p><b>Can I cancel my order</b>?<br/>
Answer:  We are currently only accepting

<p>I've spent a lot of time over the past few years looking at different ring designs (glow rings included), but I always felt something was missing.</p>
<p>I wanted to take the concept of a glow ring and not only make something unique on the inside, but something you'd want to show off to everyone you know..an exciting style both inside AND out.  </p>
<p>I experimented with glow rings in a few different exterior band styles, each of them had something unique about them but nothing quite hit home with what I was looking for...until I found damascus steel.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493824053/wqekwq3dzrjlsr5mq3i6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Damascus rings are typically pretty far out of reach for most people as the price is commonly between $400 - $1,000 per ring.  After speaking with a local forge and working with the material myself over the past few months, I've come up with a more affordable and efficient method to produce these rings.  Not only that, but I am also happy to present the first ever Damascus Steel glow ring to all of our supporters on IndieGoGo!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493824120/mfjci4sxxr0amwuuk0vr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>The history of Damascus Steel alone is enough to write a book on.  We don't need an entire history lesson but it definitely deserves a brief look into its origins.</p>
<p>Around 500 AD, swordsmiths of the Middle East began to produce knives and swords with strength and cutting abilities unequalled by any other civilization of the time. The superiority of these weapons came from the steel that they used to fashion them. The steel was harder and could hold an edge longer than other steels. It is claimed that one of these blades could cleanly slice through a falling silk scarf. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493824173/rpe1q3npth3iknulmx74.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Europeans who saw this feat were astounded: their weapons were not capable of anything close to this. The blades of these weapons also had a characteristic wavy pattern. Since the steel was supposed to be initially created in Damascus, the steel became known as ""Damascus"" steel.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493824201/orzxfpubm2nqnyxhxcrs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The standard Damascus Steel Ring is already stunning to look at by itself.  Each ring has a completely unique grain pattern that really sets it apart from any other material.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493824282/jovpml8pqdtrdldfcemx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>When the glow hits....it's something else entirely. The glow leaks out each side like you would expect, but it also causes the outer edges of the band to radiate....bringing out the damascus grain even in the darkest of settings.</p>
<p>The glow is made of a transparent resin mixed with a strontium aluminate based photoluminescent powder. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493824330/fuchgfhqvybe2wcgtk2x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Rewards for this campaign will come in two tiers.  Glowing and non-glowing Damascus Rings.</p>
<p>The beauty of Damascus steel comes from the grain pattern that is unique to each individual ring.  ""Modern Damascus"" is made from several types of steel and iron slices welded together to form a billet,the patterns vary depending on how the the billet is worked during forging. The billet is drawn out and folded until the desired number of layers are formed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493824381/zycxgqlc1ams9rjlbecn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The rings are available in seven different glow colors: Green, Aqua, Blue, Purple, White, Yellow, and Red.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493824501/dmmsqq31gsiciw3ijl4m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div></div>","I've spent a lot of time over the past few years looking at different ring designs (glow rings included), but I always felt something was missing.
I wanted to take the concept of a glow ring and not only make something unique on the inside, but something you'd want to show off to everyone you know..an exciting style both inside AND out.  
I experimented with glow rings in a few different exterior band styles, each of them had something unique about them but nothing quite hit home with what I was looking for...until I found damascus steel.  

Damascus rings are typically pretty far out of reach for most people as the price is commonly between $400 - $1,000 per ring.  After speaking with a local forge and working with the material myself over the past few months, I've come up with a more affordable and efficient method to produce these rings.  Not only that, but I am also happy to present the first ever Damascus Steel glow ring to all of our supporters on IndieGoGo!


The history of Damascus Steel alone is enough to write a book on.  We don't need an entire history lesson but it definitely deserves a brief look into its origins.
Around 500 AD, swordsmiths of the Middle East began to produce knives and swords with strength and cutting abilities unequalled by any other civilization of the time. The superiority of these weapons came from the steel that they used to fashion them. The steel was harder and could hold an edge longer than other steels. It is claimed that one of these blades could cleanly slice through a falling silk scarf. 

Europeans who saw this feat were astounded: their weapons were not capable of anything close to this. The blades of these weapons also had a characteristic wavy pattern. Since the steel was supposed to be initially created in Damascus, the steel became known as ""Damascus"" steel.

The standard Damascus Steel Ring is already stunning to look at by itself.  Each ring has a completely unique grain pattern that really sets it apart from any other material.

When the glow hits....it's something else entirely. The glow leaks out each side like you would expect, but it also causes the outer edges of the band to radiate....bringing out the damascus grain even in the darkest of settings.
The glow is made of a transparent resin mixed with a strontium aluminate based photoluminescent powder. 

Rewards for this campaign will come in two tiers.  Glowing and non-glowing Damascus Rings.
The beauty of Damascus steel comes from the grain pattern that is unique to each individual ring.  ""Modern Damascus"" is made from several types of steel and iron slices welded together to form a billet,the patterns vary depending on how the the billet is worked during forging. The billet is drawn out and folded until the desired number of layers are formed.

The rings are available in seven different glow colors: Green, Aqua, Blue, Purple, White, Yellow, and Red.

Hold the ring up to any LED light source for only a few seconds to make it glow, a UV based light source will provide a much brighter and longer lasting glow....luckily the sun does a REALLY good job of getting these beauties to glow.
The ring will glow EXTREMELY bright for about 10 minute before fading into a soft glow that will last upwards of 6 hours depending on the color.

In respect to our product we have developed a product that will not only give you cold or hot at the push of a button, but we have actually taken the time to think about the person that`s going to use our product. We have created a simplistic user interaction, so that a child will know how to use our product. We have also created a more traditional style of watch, making it even more user friendly so that anyone can use it. Our interchangeable straps will give you the confidence that you need to be able to wear your Aircon Watch with any clothes you desire. Apart from all those things we think that we live in a world were wireless technology is a must, so why would you connect your watch to an ugly cable. The Aircon Watch uses a magnetically attached wireless charging that we will provide in the box. For this and many other reason even simple ones like being able to have the time and date.

This balancing act is directed automatically and seamlessly by the hypothalamus, a small portion of the brain that serves as the command center for numerous bodily functions, including the coordination of the autonomic nervous system. Much like a thermostat regulates the temperature inside your home, the hypothalamus regulates your body temperature, responding to internal and external stimuli and making adjustments to keep the body within one or two degrees of 98.6 degrees.  Ref:1</li></ul><div data-id=""18327210""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1507142330/hgcajpat5nv0vnqjjzf1.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><h1>How it works?</h1><div> </div><ul>

<li>The secret is in the straps, it contains a small device that has within it our ClimaCon technology. This tiny device will fit on the inner wrist in an area where the nerves are closer to the skin surface so as to allow for maximum transfer of temperature. The watch can be used during any temperature, any season or any time zone.</li>
<li>Imagine that you putting an ice cube on your pulse points (think wrists and sides of your neck) or running them under cold water will cool you down instantly. Since the blood vessels in those areas are close to the surface of your skin, the cold will bring your body temp down much quicker. Ref:6</li>
</ul><h1>Why does this technique work?</h1><div> </div><ul><li>Abstract, Physical work, high ambient temperature and wearing protective clothing can elevate body temperature and cardiovascular strain sufficiently to degrade performance and induce heat-related illnesses. We have recently developed an Arm Immersion Cooling System (AICS) for use in military training environments and this paper will review literature supporting such an approach and provide details regarding its construction. Extremity cooling in cool or cold water can accelerate body (core temperature) cooling from 0.2 to 1.0 °C/10 min vs. control conditions, depending on the size/surface area of the extremity immersed. Arm immersion up to the elbow results in greater heat loss than hand- or foot-only immersion and may reduce cardiovascular strain by lowering heart rate by 10–25 beats/min and increase work tolerance time by up to 60%. The findings from studies in this paper support the use of AICS prototypes, which have been incorporated as part of the heat stress mitigation procedures employed in US Army Ranger Training and may have great application for sports and occupational use.

</div></div>","We will continue to provide the best product possible and most importantly, we will not limit our self to any one region or country, as everyone is entitled to try our technology. Like we said in our campaign use it any place, any time. By the way, we can give you the reassurance that we will ship our product for two main reasons: one we are based of Hong Kong one of the biggest ports in the world shipping products every where in the world, and we will work with the best to get the product to our backers, and two China is so close that we will be able to fix any issue with the assembly line at any time within hours. So rest assured that we will give you the best posible product available on the market. In respect to our product we have developed a product that will not only give you cold or hot at the push of a button, but we have actually taken the time to think about the person that`s going to use our product. We have created a simplistic user interaction, so that a child will know how to use our product. We have also created a more traditional style of watch, making it even more user friendly so that anyone can use it. Our interchangeable straps will give you the confidence that you need to be able to wear your Aircon Watch with any clothes you desire. Apart from all those things we think that we live in a world were wireless technology is a must, so why would you connect your watch to an ugly cable. The Aircon Watch uses a magnetically attached wireless charging that we will provide in the box. For this and many other reason even simple ones like being able to have the time and date. We will continue to develop our product, and to make it the best posible one on the market. Thank you so much for all the great support that you have given us and we look forward to continue.  Life has many troubles and some of them are defined by climate. Maybe you are too hot on a summer’s day and wish you could take all your clothes off. Or, perhaps you are too cold during winter and can’t even send a text because your hands are too shaky from shivering.  Why we can apply this to our body? A close look at the complex systems that keep us functioning can inspire awe. Such is the case with the body's complicated temperature-regulating mechanism. This intricate apparatus balances heat production with heat loss, keeping the body at a temperature just right for optimal function. This balancing act is directed automatically and seamlessly by the hypothalamus, a small portion of the brain that serves as the command center for numerous bodily functions, including the coordination of the autonomic nervous system. Much like a thermostat regulates the temperature inside your home, the hypothalamus regulates your body temperature, responding to internal and external stimuli and making adjustments to keep the body within one or two degrees of 98.6 degrees.  Ref:1How it works? 
What if we could change the signal that our nervous system sends to the brain by using the Aircon watch to generate pulses of heat or cold. With this method we can make our body start to feel more aware of the temperatures and thus stabilize our sensations
According to a 2012 research conducted by Standford University, with a cooling glove, heat exchange is possible through the extremities especially the wrist and palms area. Ref:5
The Aircon watch maintains does temperatures, demonstrated in the test video, reaching the lowest temperature of 12 degrees Celsius and reaching a max temperature of 40 degrees Celsius. These temperatures do not disrupt the upper and lower pain threshold. what it does allow us is to reach faster surface cooling temperatures, 28 degrees Celsius or 82 F.   While the Aircon watch gives you the sufficient temperatures to allow your body to feel the changes, we have to remember that this pulse of heat and cold come in intervals of 15 seconds on and 15 seconds off.   This Method makes the battery last longer and by sending these pulses of temperature change your body can react each time as if it was a new sensation.   We have selected the wrist as the best possible place to use our technology, since a lot of major blood vessels and nerves are closer to the skin in this area of the body, and thus giving us the best chance to achieve the most effective temperature changes. (point, n.d.)   The pulse points. These areas of the body are most commonly known are very effective when trying to bring your temperature down or raising it, usually people run warm or cold water on their wrist to achieve this effect, but what we are proposing is similar to what WUSA 9 news tried during a segment earlier this year. project video thumbnail PLAY (wusa9 news, n.d.)  Bibliography  (n.d.).

Retrieved from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqsVFYANxgI Watch Technique 
The secret is in the straps, it contains a small device that has within it our ClimaCon technology. This tiny device will fit on the inner wrist in an area where the nerves are closer to the skin surface so as to allow for maximum transfer of temperature. The watch can be used during any temperature, any season or any time zone.
Imagine that you putting an ice cube on your pulse points (think wrists and sides of your neck) or running them under cold water will cool you down instantly. Since the blood vessels in those areas are close to the surface of your skin, the cold will bring your body temp down much quicker. Ref:6
Why does this technique work? Abstract, Physical work, high ambient temperature and wearing protective clothing can elevate body temperature and cardiovascular strain sufficiently to degrade performance and induce heat-related illnesses. We have recently developed an Arm Immersion Cooling System (AICS) for use in military training environments and this paper will review literature supporting such an approach and provide details regarding its construction. Extremity cooling in cool or cold water can accelerate body (core temperature) cooling from 0.2 to 1.0 °C/10 min vs. control conditions, depending on the size/surface area of the extremity immersed. Arm immersion up to the elbow results in greater heat loss than hand- or foot-only immersion and may reduce cardiovascular strain by lowering heart rate by 10–25 beats/min and increase work tolerance time by up to 60%. The findings from studies in this paper support the use of AICS prototypes, which have been incorporated as part of the heat stress mitigation procedures employed in US Army Ranger Training and may have great application for sports and occupational use. ( This is an existing military products references) Ref:2          Your place, your rulesDoing any outdoor activity most times depends on the temperature and the climate. On the other hand, being inside all depends on if your heater or air conditioner is on and using up electricity. The Aircon watch offers the convenience that you need by freeing you from an energy wasting air conditioner, never limiting you to the outside temperature, and all within the form of a small watch.Office ManNo worries! As we know, there are many people wearing suits even in the summer time, or uniforms in outdoor work, now you have the solution. Outdoor LoverIf you go running or outdoor photography Aircon Watch could be your best friend.  
Menopause One of the reasons why we developed this product was to help women during menopause. Menopause often has hot flashes which can be extremely annoying to the extent where it becomes painful. But what if you could get some relief from a small device that emits a soothing cool temperature.  Why we need it in the office?It may be the middle of summer, but you’d never know from looking around offices, where, on the hottest days of the year, it’s not uncommon to see workers wrapped up in sweaters at their desks. As temperatures outside rise, most corporate office buildings become hermetically sealed, air-conditioned ice cubes, forcing workers everywhere to grab a Snuggie. In a study of government office buildings, for instance, 60% of workers complained of thermal stress–that they’re too hot or too cold in their workplace. Why can’t we manage to keep offices at a comfortable temperature? Ref.2

Men are fine in shirt-sleeves, but the women have to wear cardigans and scarves. 
First, the metabolic rate varies enormously—depending on height, weight, fitness, the type of work, and of course, gender. Women usually have both lower height and weight, and a higher percentage of body fat than men. In fact modern researchers reckon women pump out about a third less heat than men do, and so don't need as much cooling. 
The second problem is also obvious—women tend to wear lighter clothing, and expose more skin. In an office you don't often see a man's naked knees. Ref.2
Same room different temperature
In the office or at home, everyone might have different temperatures.
Within a lot of research, we've found the answer.

You don’t want to bother yourself to change the tint? That’s Fine
 Zetta² has an automatic mode which instantly recognizes the light condition of surroundings and changes the tint instantly. You can switch modes between manual to auto by putting your finger on the sensor for 3 seconds. 
 



Sunglasses should do their job. Zetta² provides 99.9% UV protection. Even with our unique tint technology, we still thought that eyes protection should be a priority for you while enjoying your favorite activities.
 

 Zetta² uses polycarbonate lenses and Nylon TR90 Frame which are highly durable against impacts, and lightweight. We have done several safety tests such as impact-resistant and optical radiation tests to ensure our sunglasses are safe to wear and optimized for outdoor activities.
 

 

Zetta² is water resistant to sweat, rain, and splashes of water.

<p>We are two long-time friends who have both been watch fanatics since were were kids. Finally, in 2017, we launched the Mission Watch Company.

<p>Because this isn't our first rodeo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our first watch, the <a href=""https://www.missionwatchco.com/products/mission-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mission 1</a> <strong>sold out</strong>. The Mission 1 was released in 2019, a USD $800 watch that was extremely well-received.  Our first customers can be found all over the world and that watch is now a collector's item.   </li>

<p>Three years as a microbrand watch company, and this is our third watch.  For the Mission 3 ""Solen"" we wanted to create a dive watch that didn't look like every other dive watch on the market. </p>
<p>We love dive watches. </p>
<p>We own dive watches. </p>
<p>We didn't want to make a simple copy of the other popular 200 meters dive watches. </p>
<p>We managed to build that watch without straying from our Mission design aesthetic and we believe that we have built another watch that people will love to wear. Whether you're taking the Mission 3 in the water, on a hike or on a run, or just banging it around the great outdoors, this is a watch that fits your day perfectly.</p>

<h3>How Is The RMX2 Mask Revolutionary?</h3>
<p>We are proud to introduce our newest invention: a reusable face mask made with Hydro-X: a bionic material which consists of <strong>titanium particles and upcycled performance fibers</strong>. With our top of the line nanotechnology filtration membrane, the middle layer of our mask <strong>filters 99.9%</strong> of common contaminants as small as <strong>0.075 microns</strong>. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2>MAIN FEATURES</h2>
<p>Everyone knows that face masks can be uncomfortable, suffocating, and unbreathable, so we have reinvented and researched how to change this by researching new fibers to use so that the experience is enhanced greatly.</p>

How Is The RMX2 Mask Revolutionary?
We are proud to introduce our newest invention: a reusable face mask made with Hydro-X: a bionic material which consists of titanium particles and upcycled performance fibers. With our top of the line nanotechnology filtration membrane, the middle layer of our mask filters 99.9% of common contaminants as small as 0.075 microns. 

 
MAIN FEATURES
Everyone knows that face masks can be uncomfortable, suffocating, and unbreathable, so we have reinvented and researched how to change this by researching new fibers to use so that the experience is enhanced greatly.

Our skin-friendly fabric is silky smooth and has excellent moisture regain properties, especially for people who have dry skin or have to wear masks for long periods of time.
 REUSABILITYOur mission is very simple: to create a mask that protects the wearer, and as well protect the environment. Our mask is reusable up to 200 times, as our goal is to help reduce the use of disposable masks, which is causing a great pollution problem. COST COMPARISONS Our mask offers high protection, and is reusable up to 200 times to reduce the use of disposable masks to reduce pollution.  USER REVIEWSFor the athletes' full review,  CLICK HERE RMX2 PROTECTIONThe mid-layer is our RmorX™ Nano Filtration Layer. It is an ultra-thin, nanoporous membrane that filters out 99.9% of particulate matters larger than 0.075μm (including, but not limited to: dust, smog, ash, mites, and allergens). Each square millimeter of the membrane can have billions of pores, with pore diameter between 0.1μm-0.5μm, so water vapors may pass through while water droplets cannot. With 70nm membrane physical filtration, utilizing the nanoporous structure of the membrane, 99.9% of particulate matters larger than 0.075μm can be filtered. Nanoporous membrane is also waterproof, air permeable, and oil resistant.  [please scroll further down to see our nano filter certifications]   STRUCTURE & COMPONENTSThe RMX2 is a face mask that is engineered to provide superior protection and comfort. Our mask is composed of three layers, each with its unique properties:  INCREASED BREATHING SPACEMany reusable masks in the market only care about the design of the mask, neglecting important factors such as the fabric properties. Furthermore, most cloth face masks have one problem: as the user inhales, the inner layer fabric would suck into the nose, making it hard to breathe. With our RMX2 mask, we came up with a unique nose support embedded on the inner fabric, which gives an arch to avoid the fabric from touching the nose -- giving the user extra breathing space. PROBLEMS FROM WEARING MASKSMany people are facing problems with “maskne,"" a term used to describe acne in the area a mask is worn. Maskne flare-up is triggered by occlusion and sweat under the mask.Our silk-like inner layer provides excellent moisture management and skin-care properties as the fiber is composed of collagen peptide amino acid from upcycled fish scales. Its features include moisture permeability, soft and luster as silk.DESIGN CONCEPTIt’s obvious that we now wear masks everyday: going to the grocery store, on walks and run, going on public transports. In fact, many believe that this is part of our culture now, and that mask-wearing will never go away. Our team wanted to come up with a face mask with great protection, and at the same time come up with cool designs and colors. With that in mind, we have designed eye-catching colorful camouflage patterns as part of our identity. AVAILABLE COLORS GOOD FOR EVERYDAY USE AND FOR SPORTS TOO! WHO IS MOST AT RISK?We are all at risk from airborne contaminants. Around 91% of the world’s population lives in places where air quality levels exceed WHO (World Health Organization) limits. Researchers at the University of Bristol assessed the airborne survival of contagious germs in aerosol droplets from coughs and sneezes. They can spread further and faster than you may think. Lab results show that the filtration level of the RMX2 remains at a high level after 200 washes. We strongly encourage the use of reusable face masks. According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Woods Hole Sea Grant, it is estimated that it takes approximately 450 years to decompose a disposable mask.  THE IMPACT OF AIR POLLUTIONAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), air pollution is a major environmental risk to health.   SOURCING & MANUFACTURINGOur masks are all made in Taiwan. Our fabric suppliers are producing a variety of functional and eco-friendly fabrics as Taiwan is known to develop the latest technologies in textiles. All of our factories are carefully selected to ensure high-quality control from sample to shipment.  OUR FIBER CERTIFICATIONSAll of our fabrics are tested for harmful substances. We make sure that we follow international best practices in standard-setting to ensure the quality of our products. OUR NANO FILTER CERTIFICATIONSOur filtration layer is top of the line, lab-tested, and accredited by Nelson Labs and TTRI.  WASHING INSTRUCTIONSOur mask is reusable up to 200 times and is very easy to clean.

<br/>
<b>Bynd Artisan (Collaborator &amp; Manufacturer) </b><br/>The heritage of <a href=""http://www.byndartisan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bynd Artisan</a>
 dates back to 1945 when a book making company was set up along Mohamed 
Sultan Road. It was a family-run business that served a genuine need and
 it gradually grew beyond the boundaries of Singapore and Malaysia. 
Through the intervening years, the business of book-binding has changed 
as technology progressed. Yet at its heart, each and every book has its 
beginning much like in the days of old - hand-designed and prototyped by
 a small band of craftsmen who grew up in the trade. <b><br/>Grandluxe</b> is the parent company of Bynd Artisan.<br/><a href=""www.byndartisan.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.byndartisan.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(www.byndartisan.com)</a><br/><br/><br/><h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>1) Since The Perfect Sketchbook B5 is created using quality materials
 from all around the world, shipment of the various materials may 
potentially run into delays. Prices and availability of raw materials 
may also fluctuate. We have cushioned our budget with a modest amount to
 account for such events. In the event that raw materials have to be 
replaced (very unlikely), supporters will be updated at the soonest 
possible.</p>
<p>2) Cases of top quality paper manufacturers producing badly “sized” 
paper are common. While we will do our very best to ensure that all the 
paper we use are properly sized, there may still be situations where 
paper supplied to us for production is not appropriately sized and 
result in less than ideal outcomes when used.</p>
<p>3) Bynd Artisan has more than 70 years of experience in book-making. 
 There will be regular visits paid to the manufacturing facility so that
 backers can be updated on the manufacturing progress accordingly.</p>
<p>4) While the team puts in its utmost effort in ensuring that the 
books are shipped on time, the shipping efficiency of local postal 
services at various countries are largely out of our control.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>FAQs:</h3>
<h3></h3>
<b>1. Will The Perfect Sketchbook B5 be in stores after this
campaign?</b><br/>This is very unlikely. Unless the demand far exceeds
expectations in this campaign, producing more of The Perfect Sketchbook B5 is
not yet sustainable. That’s why it’s important that you share our campaign on
social media. Each of us is connected by six degrees of separation, and your
ability to reach other deserving artists can help us reach retail.

<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>2.The project has hit the target fund. Can I still back this
project?</b><br/>Absolutely! Hitting the target fund merely confirms
production. The more funds we raise, the more books we can make and the more
likely it is that we can move this towards retail. Personally, I am more
interested in endorsing talented artists with the extra funds. For example,
funds could be used to curate an art show with our sketchbooks. Imagine an
exhibition in which the top talents can showcase their work in The Perfect
Sketchbook B5.  Such an event would be
spectacular.</p>
<p><b>3. Why is there different pricing for the single books? Why
are some single books cheaper than the bundles?<br/></b>Last year, thanks to contributions from 881 backers, The
Perfect Sketchbook Pocket was funded on<a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theperfectsketchbook/the-perfect-sketchbook-for-travel-artists-and-art"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> kickstarter.com</a>. In recognition of our
backers’ contributions, we set aside 900 books at special rates of $40 (without
personalization) and $45 (with personalization). Multiple check-outs of these
single book perks are possible on indiegogo.com. Earlier, a few backers wrongly
informed me that multiple check-outs were impossible unless you used multiple
emails. That is incorrect; I have successfully executed multiple check-outs on
each perk using the same account. <br/></p>
<b><b>
</b></b><p><b>4. I pledged funds and requested a personalized copy of the
book. Where can I submit my personalization information?</b><br/>
Thank you for your pledge.  We will send
out a form for you to submit your personalization information when we start
making The Perfect Sketchbook B5. 
Manufacturing is scheduled to occur in March 2016.</p>
<p><b>5. I donated and requested 10 books with personalization.
Can I request different names/phrases/initials for those books?<br/></b>Absolutely! You can personalize each book with a different
name/phrase/initials. Personalization text is limited to 15 characters
(including spaces).</p>
<p><b>6. Are the sketchbooks going to be
all handmade?</b> <br/>No. Mr Chong merely demonstrated how we crafted 
the prototypes.
Machines will be involved in the actual making of The Perfect sketchbook
 B5.
However, page will still be hand-torn. As with our first campaign, we will
 document the processes involved and we will take you on a journey of 
bookmaking with Bynd Artisan.

</div></div>","The Perfect Skechbook B5. After the success of our first 
Kickstarter campaign, we received so much positive feedback and numerous
 requests for a larger version of The Perfect Sketchbook. In recognition
 of our backers’ generous support, the team is excited to introduce the 
new bigger and better The Perfect Sketchbook B5!.For the complete story of our first Kickstarter campaign,  click here.
The Perfect Sketchbook has been endorsed by many artists and has also been described by Huffington Post as ""a sketchbook for the perfectionist"".

The Team: 

Erwin Lian. (Artist and Creator of The Perfect Sketchbook)Erwin
 is an artist and educator from Singapore. He travels extensively with 
his sketchbooks; recording visages of people he meets, places and 
cultures he has personally experienced. In August 2014, with the support
 of 881 backers, he successfully funded The Perfect Sketchbook - a 
pocket sized sketchbook filled with the finest watercolor paper - 
through Kickstarter. (www.cherngzhi.com) 



Bynd Artisan (Collaborator & Manufacturer) The heritage of Bynd Artisan
 dates back to 1945 when a book making company was set up along Mohamed 
Sultan Road. It was a family-run business that served a genuine need and
 it gradually grew beyond the boundaries of Singapore and Malaysia. 
Through the intervening years, the business of book-binding has changed 
as technology progressed. Yet at its heart, each and every book has its 
beginning much like in the days of old - hand-designed and prototyped by
 a small band of craftsmen who grew up in the trade. Grandluxe is the parent company of Bynd Artisan.(www.byndartisan.com)Risks and challenges
1) Since The Perfect Sketchbook B5 is created using quality materials
 from all around the world, shipment of the various materials may 
potentially run into delays. Prices and availability of raw materials 
may also fluctuate. We have cushioned our budget with a modest amount to
 account for such events. In the event that raw materials have to be 
replaced (very unlikely), supporters will be updated at the soonest 
possible.
2) Cases of top quality paper manufacturers producing badly “sized” 
paper are common. While we will do our very best to ensure that all the 
paper we use are properly sized, there may still be situations where 
paper supplied to us for production is not appropriately sized and 
result in less than ideal outcomes when used.
3) Bynd Artisan has more than 70 years of experience in book-making. 
 There will be regular visits paid to the manufacturing facility so that
 backers can be updated on the manufacturing progress accordingly.
4) While the team puts in its utmost effort in ensuring that the 
books are shipped on time, the shipping efficiency of local postal 
services at various countries are largely out of our control.

FAQs:

1. Will The Perfect Sketchbook B5 be in stores after this
campaign?This is very unlikely. Unless the demand far exceeds
expectations in this campaign, producing more of The Perfect Sketchbook B5 is
not yet sustainable. That’s why it’s important that you share our campaign on
social media. Each of us is connected by six degrees of separation, and your
ability to reach other deserving artists can help us reach retail.



2.The project has hit the target fund. Can I still back this
project?Absolutely! Hitting the target fund merely confirms
production. The more funds we raise, the more books we can make and the more
likely it is that we can move this towards retail. Personally, I am more
interested in endorsing talented artists with the extra funds. For example,
funds could be used to curate an art show with our sketchbooks. Imagine an
exhibition in which the top talents can showcase their work in The Perfect
Sketchbook B5.  Such an event would be
spectacular.
3. Why is there different pricing for the single books? Why
are some single books cheaper than the bundles?Last year, thanks to contributions from 881 backers, The
Perfect Sketchbook Pocket was funded on kickstarter.com. In recognition of our
backers’ contributions, we set aside 900 books at special rates of $40 (without
personalization) and $45 (with personalization). Multiple check-outs of these
single book perks are possible on indiegogo.com. Earlier, a few backers wrongly
informed me that multiple check-outs were impossible unless you used multiple
emails. That is incorrect; I have successfully executed multiple check-outs on
each perk using the same account. 

4. I pledged funds and requested a personalized copy of the
book. Where can I submit my personalization information?
Thank you for your pledge.  We will send
out a form for you to submit your personalization information when we start
making The Perfect Sketchbook B5. 
Manufacturing is scheduled to occur in March 2016.
5. I donated and requested 10 books with personalization.
Can I request different names/phrases/initials for those books?Absolutely! You can personalize each book with a different
name/phrase/initials. Personalization text is limited to 15 characters
(including spaces).
6. Are the sketchbooks going to be
all handmade? No. Mr Chong merely demonstrated how we crafted 
the prototypes.
Machines will be involved in the actual making of The Perfect sketchbook
 B5.
However, page will still be hand-torn. As with our first campaign, we will
 document the processes involved and we will take you on a journey of 
bookmaking with Bynd Artisan.

<p>I hope to make this a regular thing with NEW, custom patches and other special merch each month in support of my messaging work.</p>
<h3><strong>Products</strong></h3>
<p>In this first offering, I have AMAZING 3-inch square patches promoting the right to bear arms: one with an AR and one with an AK, each sporting the ""Shall Not Be Infringed"" rallying cry.</p>

And, they're made right here in the USA. This includes the main zipper on the ADV3NTURE and CLASSIC hoodies, as well as the zippers on the beverage pocket and passport pocket.  We've added Elbow Pads to the arms of the ADV3NTURE Hoodie for added comfort, as well as to reduce wear on the area where your hoodie will come into contact with hard surfaces. They also add a bit of style to your hoodie, so people know you mean business.  It's not quite as complicated as a GPS tracker, but our return home tag, and the honesty of a good samaritan should get your hoodie back to you if you happen to leave it on one of your adventures. It also contains our pledge to plant three trees with every purchase, including the hoodie you receive from this campaign.Here's a closer look! We've made sure that all of the stitching used in our hoodies keep your hoodie intact during your adventures. We use over-lock stitching on the top of the shoulders, so they lay flat, to make the seams comfortable if you happen to be wearing a backpack.  We’ve spent nine months developing a unique fabric that we love. It’s a high-density 100% cotton French terry fabric that is pre-laundered.Our hoodies start with 100% raw cotton grown in North Carolina, where it is combed and spun in a yarn mill. The yarn is then transported to Los Angeles, where the yarns are knitted into our proprietary French terry loop. It is then pre-washed (pre-shrunk) in our manufacturing facility. At that point, the fabric is inspected for any imperfections from the knitting or dying process. Once the fabric passes inspection, it is then ready to be cut and sewn into your new hoodie. After sewing, each hoodie is individually garment dyed for the optimal premium color.Keeping our manufacturing domestic enables us ensure the highest quality of raw materials that are sourced for production, while allowing us to oversee the entire process to ensure high production standards through the entire process. We are also able to ensure that our high environmental standards are being maintained.Hand-crafting our products domestically lets us keep jobs in the US, especially in a time where they’re needed most. We are incredibly proud that all of our apparel is made by hard-working Americans.As you likely know, it costs more to manufacture products in the USA than it does overseas. That's true. It costs 2-3 times the amount to make our hoodies domestically than it would cost to make the same hoodie internationally. The reason for this comes down to what people are paid to make the product. It is also reflected in the salaries that people are paid to produce the raw materials.So why make our products here, when we could save money making them there? For us, the increased costs are worth the benefits of domestic manufacturing. Not only are we able to produce a better product and be able to monitor our environmental impact, but we're keeping jobs in the USA, especially in these times when they're needed most.Because we have moved production to the US, we will be able to reduce the time between the conclusion of this Indiegogo campaign and the day you receive your hoodie. In the past, with our overseas manufacturers, it has take 140-160 days from when we place the order to when the orders were shipped to backers -- much of this time with the product being spent in transit. We've now reduced that time to less than 90 days.Our Indiegogo launched on August 21st and will conclude on September 18th. Once you get your survey, kindly respond to it ASAP. We will need them back before September 29th, so we can begin production on September 30th This will enable us to send your hoodie out to you by November 16th.Being an environmentally conscious brand means we understand the importance of the environment and our affect on it. We are actively taking steps to reduce our carbon footprint by utilizing domestic raw materials and planting three trees to offset our environmental impact.The ""3"" in our name represents the three trees that we plant with every purchase, including this Indiegogo campaign.We are proud to partner with Green Forests Work, a non-profit that plants trees in the Appalachian region in areas that have been deforested due to mining. Even if you don't back our campaign, we encourage you to donate to GreenForestsWork.org and support their important work!To find the size that best suits you, take your favorite hoodie and lay it on a flat surface. Compare the measurements of your hoodie with the measurements below. If washed properly (was cold and lay flat to dry) your hoodie should not shrink more than 1-2%.In addition to the standard sizes XS-2XL, we are offering BIG & TALL sizes. This includes TALL sizes in Large and X-Large, as well as 3X-5XL. These sizes require new patterns to be created, as well as extra fabric in the manufacturing, and extra shipping charges, due to the additional weight. If you order a BIG & TALL size, you will have to pay an additional charge when you receive your survey. Those ordering TALL sizes will be required to pay an additional $10. Those ordering 3X-5XL will be required to pay an additional $15. The additional shipping charges added to your pledge for international orders does not include duties, taxes, customs VAT, or any other fees that may be charged by your country. Unfortunately, there are too many variables for us to properly calculate any additional charges. We are sorry for any inconvenience.",58.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>In summer, I spend time saving Monarchs in our farm and setting them free once they are ready to fly. It always gives me a sense of purpose that I can care for these lovely creatures. I also enjoy watching Monarchs kissing lovely roses and other flowers. It is no wonder that some of my designs showcase this beautiful beloved butterfly.

Inspiration Behind My BSM-Art Collection.
 


When our farm boutique was closed due to the pandemic, I used this time and channel it to something positive.  As we now plan to focus more on online sales, I designed exclusive products for our online boutique.  We hope through Indiegogo, Imelda Roberts' B S M-ART Wear, will expand its network of supporters and friends to make this a successful project.
 



 

 



 

The amazing creatures like birds remind me of many positive feelings - to fly free and be where your heart wants to be, to embrace the joy of possibility, to fly and weather the storm to reach your dreams.  It is a symbol of freedom, fearlessness, and resilience. Their music sends a message of joy, love, and peace.  Take this versatile bag at work or in your travel. 
 

 


 
The unique Zebra symbolizes freedom and individuality.  At the same time, zebras are known to always be part of the zeal or group of zebras to protect each other and be a part of the community.  The group is also known as dazzle fitting for its unique dazzling features only found in this awesome animal. As such, I named this bag, the Dazzling Zebras.

 

 

 

 
The Graceful Giraffes Love Bag reflects upon the wild.  Known as the ""Gentle Giant,"" it stands as a symbol of foresight, grace and unique individuality. 

 

 



In summer, I spend time saving Monarchs in our farm and setting them free once they are ready to fly. It always gives me a sense of purpose that I can care for these lovely creatures. I also enjoy watching Monarchs kissing lovely roses and other flowers. It is no wonder that some of my designs showcase this beautiful beloved butterfly. It is known as a symbol of transformation, sweetness of life, and positive light.

This set includes a UV sterilizer, hand sanitizer, extra long strap, matching gaiter scarf, and more!  It is a stylish bag you will be proud to wear.

Our business has been initiated by the philosophy and purposes of converting the innovative ideas, creative designs and new technologies into electronic products with practical impacts to human world. </p><p>The pandemic outbreak has not only brought us threats, but also a lesson on the importance of health risk prevention. Shortage of face masks due to panic purchase warns us the insufficient sustainability of the current production approach, resulting in the failure of meeting the global demand and the more serious environmental problem with the indecomposable wastes derived from the mask consumption.</p><p>Amulet Technology Limited determines to create a reusable face mask with inspiration from the air purification technology. The new product is designed with an effective purification function, which is different from the traditional filter-type mask.</p><p>UV purification was our initial design concept with possible technology application, however, was later rejected due to the inconvenience usage in a bulky size with a great voltage demand. Based on the initial idea, a new R&amp;D direction has then been explored.</p><p>“Is it possible to apply photocatalytic purification technology into face mask design?” Yes, photocatalytic purification which requires comparatively less electricity power has become our alternative effective solution. With a lighter size longer battery life, the convenience and endurance are greatly enhanced. </p><p>Amulet has successfully obtained the patent for the photocatalytic-purified face mask. We sincerely hope that our reusable masks can be progressively brought on stream and to the market, to further contribute to the society and public health security. Amulet believes in the power of technology, and aims to make the best use of it to reverse the vicious cycle, hence to achieve a sustainable public health and environmental development.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Outpost</strong></p><p>Amulet-designed mask serves as the first line of photocatalytic purification.

Our business has been initiated by the philosophy and purposes of converting the innovative ideas, creative designs and new technologies into electronic products with practical impacts to human world. The pandemic outbreak has not only brought us threats, but also a lesson on the importance of health risk prevention. Shortage of face masks due to panic purchase warns us the insufficient sustainability of the current production approach, resulting in the failure of meeting the global demand and the more serious environmental problem with the indecomposable wastes derived from the mask consumption.Amulet Technology Limited determines to create a reusable face mask with inspiration from the air purification technology. The new product is designed with an effective purification function, which is different from the traditional filter-type mask.UV purification was our initial design concept with possible technology application, however, was later rejected due to the inconvenience usage in a bulky size with a great voltage demand. Based on the initial idea, a new R&D direction has then been explored.“Is it possible to apply photocatalytic purification technology into face mask design?” Yes, photocatalytic purification which requires comparatively less electricity power has become our alternative effective solution. With a lighter size longer battery life, the convenience and endurance are greatly enhanced. Amulet has successfully obtained the patent for the photocatalytic-purified face mask. We sincerely hope that our reusable masks can be progressively brought on stream and to the market, to further contribute to the society and public health security. Amulet believes in the power of technology, and aims to make the best use of it to reverse the vicious cycle, hence to achieve a sustainable public health and environmental development. OutpostAmulet-designed mask serves as the first line of photocatalytic purification. The double-filter feature effectively isolates the air droplets and PM2.5 suspended particles, the design is also user-friendly for removal, cleaning and replacement.  CoreThe defensive core is the exclusive ""Photocatalyst Air Purifying Device"" of the Amulet Guardian masks. Amulet pioneered the application of the new photocatalytic purification technology to the product, generating photo-generated electrons and photo-generated holes in the process of optical reactions.The passing substances then undergo a redox reaction, decomposing and cleaning air with our lightweight and environmental-friendly product. *Engineered to Certification and FFP3 & N99 Filtration StandardDiscovery in PhotocatalysisHow photocatalytic work?   Air ExhaustThe disinfected air flows in through the one-way air valve, preventing air backflow.

It has been an absolute game changer for the industry of backpacks. Pix Backpack has been reviewed by top YouTube bloggers and featured on dozens of media. Everyone loved our product and we received great feedback. However, many backers have continuously asked for the same kind of backpack, only for kids. We made it happen and hope you'll love it as much as we do!Pix Mini vs. Usual BackpackPix MiniDraw right on your backpack. The integrated in-app image editor allows you to create animations and display them on the ambient screen of the backpack. Each little box on the app corresponds to a specific pixel which can be adjusted in terms of color so that you can make up your own pixel art. The only limit is your imagination!Kids can also share animations with their friends. Simply hit the SHARE button and exchange your pixel art with other Pix Mini owners. The animation will appear on your friend’s backpack within a matter of seconds. Shine together with your friends! Make friends with Pix MiniPix Mini is the first backpack that helps you socialize. By displaying self-made artworks on the backpack, your child can communicate his personal interests to his peers. It is a great way to find friends and express your individuality. Make your kid known as ""that kid with the cool tech backpack!""Develop your child's thinkingThe Pix Mini app offers brain-stimulating games designed to test memory and cognitive capabilities of your child. When you play on your backpack, logical thinking turns into an interactive activity. Simply press controllers on your phone device and treat your backpack as the playing screen.  Make your child saferThe glowing animation will make your child clearly visible on the road. The geolocation feature will allow parents to see their kids on the map. Additionally, there is an alarm function that goes off whenever a child moves too far away from the backpack.  Pix Mini is controlled from a free Pix app that can be installed on any iOS/Android smartphone device. The user-friendly interface enables your child to effectively operate the backpack and apply all of the functionalities with ease.   Watch this short video that demonstrates how to use it:  It is still a backpack! In addition to the cool features of Pix Mini, it is still a practical backpack that enables your kid to carry all of the school essentials. The trendy design of the backpack will highlight your kid’s style and maintain his confidence on every single walk to school.How to pack your Pix Mini Pix Mini is a convenient backpack that could be also worn casually and sustain an active lifestyle of a kid. Moreover, it could be easily worn in the event of rain or snow, as the ambient screen stays resistant to low temperature and water splashes.   TimelineThe Pix StoryPix is a consumer electronics startup with a young team of professionals who believe that users should be both the creators and innovators of the product. That’s why, less than a year ago, we released the first smart backpack for adults. The product has been a major success as we managed to hit the total funding of $338,000 on both Indiegogo & Kickstarter. However, after receiving numerous requests to also make one for children, we made a smaller, lighter backpack with a whole bundle of cool perks relevant for kids. That’s how we ended up with Pix Mini. The Pix PhilosophyPix connects portability with the creativity. Our mission is to make people happy while they’re on the go. All people are different and have a common need to express their personality through their looks. That’s why we give it to our consumers and let them to decide what they want to wear. We believe that personal looks should reflect our personality and serve as a way to communicate our views to the world. That’s why we strive our excellence to make the most customizable backpacks ever made. Our Team Social Network LinksWe know that not everyone will be able to afford Pix Mini. So even if you can’t donate a dollar or make a purchase, you can still help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of. We rely on all of our Pix fans!",36.0,3,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Chad &amp; Ashley McLetchie, co-founders of The Viribus Brand! The goal with Viribus is to create a brand that inspires confidence in those who wear our clothing and to remind you that you are not alone. You have Viribus within you, you are strong, and you are part of so many other people that share the same vision we do.</p>
<p><strong>Name and Meaning:</strong> Viribus - Latin phrase: ""With all one's might"". Word translations: Strength, might, power.<br/><strong>Our Vision:</strong> Inspire Confidence. Celebrate Diversity.<br/><strong>Our Mission Statement:</strong> To help embolden humanity with life-inspiring products and experiences.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to us because it's something we've always wanted to find in our lives, and this brand is something we want to create to touch lives and inspire others across the world. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let's break it down. We need to raise funds in order to make an inventory purchase of sweaters. We're estimating about $6,000-7,000 for inventory, which would get us a decent initial set-up of inventory. An additional $1,000 goes towards equipment, storage, and some software expenses, then the remaining funds go towards our marketing budget.</p>
<p>What we're offering you is the chance to buy a hoodie(s), with some discounts for the first few people, and an awesome hoodie combo that includes stickers, a lanyard, and one of our Viribus hoodies!</p>
<p>If we don't meet our entire goal, we will scale back our inventory order and make a smaller purchase. If we surpass our goal, additional funds will go towards increased inventory and increased marketing.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're trying to be a brand that gives back and is actively involved in our community. This is why we've partnered with three non-profit organizations. Each has a different focus and we hope that at least one will resonate with you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Jack.org - Jack.org is Canada's only charity training and empowering young leaders to revolutionize mental health in every province and territory. We do this through three globally-recognized programs: Talks, Chapters, and Summits.</li>
<li>Halton Women's Place - Halton Women’s Place is an organization providing shelter and crisis services for physically, emotionally, financially, and sexually abused women and their dependent children and is dedicated to ending violence against women and their children.</li>
<li>Local Foodbank Organization - In process of securing partnership.</li>
</ol>
<p>While you help support a Canadian brand, you're also helping local Canadians get the help they need. Everyone has their own struggles that they battle each and every day that we don't always know about. We want to do our best to help make a difference in the lives of Canadians across the country.</p>
<p>We're offering you the ability to stay comfy, while also supporting a charity of your choice. Together, we can make a difference. 5% of the proceeds from each sweater order will go to a charity of your choice.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is new for us, so let's break down some of our challenges and how we aim to overcome them.</p>
<ul>
<li>Not raising enough funds<ul><li>We have decided to choose the flexible funding option that way if we don't meet our goal, we can still collect funds. Now, if we don't meet our goal, we still intend on launching this brand. We will scale down our initial inventory purchase, and ensure we still have room for marketing that way we can still fulfill orders, have additional inventory to sell via our website, and have a marketing budget to grow our brand awareness.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>A large investment<ul><li>A risk that we're taking is, well, starting this business in general. We both have put a lot of personal funds and savings into this business, and there's always the possibility that we could lose it all. But with this in mind, we've done our due diligence, conducted research, and used our networks and resources to ensure we're operating as efficiently as possible while ensuring the high-quality service and products we want to provide. We are both dedicated to this project and will do whatever we can to achieve success.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>COVID-Delays<ul><li>Another challenge is COVID-related delays from our suppliers. From the orders we've previously made, and having serious talks with our suppliers, we have every reason to believe that we'll be able to meet our shipment goals and have everything ready to go within a month of the end of this campaign. We aim to have everything shipped by the end of May, and to your doorstep within a week or two of shipping.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Storage for inventory<ul><li>Something we've had to consider is if we order, say, 200 hoodies, where do we put all of that? Our basement office can only hold so many, maybe about 50-75. We've built into our budget money to go towards a small storage locker here in town where we can keep most of our inventory and shipping supplies. That way we can keep a small amount of inventory in the office then ship and refill inventory as needed.</li></ul>

The world’s most comfortable vegan jacket that cuddles you with warmth and coziness
Kapok, a plant fiber that’s powering our insulation - it is lightweight, breathable, and hypoallergenic
Presented by Kapok Knot and Vegan Fashion Week™, two brands that care about people, the Earth, and animal welfare
Japanese quality, service, and efficiency. Our products are ready to be produced in your choice of color and size
Loved by more than 1,700 customers around the globe and more than 50,000 geese saved from being harmed
 Introducing “Vegan Haori Jacket”, the world’s most cozy and stylish vegan jacket made from plant-based fibers    You can rock this jacket whether you need warmth and comfort while reading a book at home or going out for a drink with your friends. The “Vegan Haori Jacket” will give you comfort and style wherever you are.   Goose ApprovedKapok Knot’s Ethical Down Kapok™ sheet is the future of not only cruelty-free fashion but also gives you the ability to have down warmth with less puff.In our survey of 30 geese*, the results were unanimous that they prefer you wear a jacket lined with plant fibers instead of their feathers, especially if the warmth and comfort isn’t compromised.*When questioned, we assumed they were honking with approval. No geese were harmed in the survey  While staying true to the look of the traditional jacket, the “Vegan Haori Jacket” updates it with its lightweight plant based down that is warm, fashionable, and sustainably made.  Kapok Knot’s Vegan Haori Jacket will showcase a fashionable and sustainable option as you look to bring a little bit of your cozy home when venturing outside. Made in JapanWhat does ""Made in Japan"" mean?
Quality is of the utmost importance
Not your average factory. No mass production here, we're hand sewing these jackets because we care about the final product
Slow fashion. The Haori jacket is made to last. Not just from a material standpoint but also from a fashion perspective.
Fair wages. Every worker is skilled in sewing our jackets from scratch and we take pride in hiring passionate people and providing a safe environment to work in. 
  Commercializing kapok has been a challenge for many because of its short fibers. Through many years of research and development, Kapok Knot has successfully innovated kapok into thin sheets that are easy-to-sew, breathable, and as warm as a traditional down. They are called “Ethical Down Kapok™”    Look at how fluffy and soft the kapok fibers are!It’s 1/8th of the weight of cotton because they are so hollow   Because of the hollow fibers, kapok is breathable. It absorbs moisture while transforming that into heat, or warmth. Excess moisture is let out so you don’t have to worry about mold forming.By combining recycled polyester to our kapok fibers, we invented “Ethical Down Kapok™”. Made with kapok fibers and recycled polyester, our Ethical Down Kapok™ are 5mm thin sheets that are easy-to-sew, breathable, and as warm as a traditional down. With this insulation, we are able to produce lightweight AND warm jackets that are ethically made and sustainable.  Kapok is a fiber grown from trees. Meaning that we don’t have to cut down any trees and we can keep harvesting them.We partner with a kapok tree farm based in Indonesia. If we’re able to grow the kapok business, we can help our Indonesian community grow their economy and stay eco-friendly.   Vegan Haori Jacket Features
So comfortable that you forget you’re wearing a jacket
Our insulation is filled with kapok so it’s lightweight and warm
Ethical, sustainable, and vegan fashion
    Our Ethical Down Kapok™ sheet is the key to producing lightweight and warm jacket. While our jackets are as warm as traditional geese down jackets, the weight of each jacket is different.
Traditional geese down jacket = 1 kilograms or 2.2lbs
Vegan Haori Jacket = 700 grams or 1.5lbs 
Our Vegan Haori Jacket weighs about as your pillow or a one bunch of bananas.
