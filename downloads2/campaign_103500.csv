<h3>Update #1</h3>
<div class=""activity-content"">
<p>Hello, everyone! :D</p>
<p>Here’s an update to answer the questions that I’ve received!</p>
<p><strong>Q: How will the game be delivered?</strong><br/> A: Indiegogo keeps track of every funder, so when funding is over, we’ll send you an e-mail containing a link to the <span class=""caps"">DRM</span>-free release of TPD2. As for the iPad version, we’ll gift you a copy of the game. When the campaign is over, we’ll be e-mailing every funder to see which version you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How much will the game cost?</strong><br/> A: We haven’t decided on a final price, but even at The Zombie Tier, you’re getting a great deal with the Hero that normal buyers won’t be getting! Not to mention our gratitude for supporting us!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Will my computer be able to run the game?</strong> <br/> A: We don’t have the tech specs for you yet, but if you can play most modern 2D games on your computer, then you should be okay!</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why can’t I pay with my non-US credit card?</strong><br/> A: We’ve had some issues with international funders who can’t fund the campaign with their non-US credit cards, but also other international funders who have successfully funded! Indiegogo accepts major credit cards and also PayPal payments, so if you’re having trouble, please refer to either of these services. I’m sorry I can’t be much help, but if I find out any more information or alternative payment methods, I’ll let you know!</p>
<p><strong>Q: If I were to fund $1000 and receive all the perks, how would the <span class=""caps"">NPC</span>/Hero/Boss process work?</strong><br/> A: Your Vampire Tier <span class=""caps"">NPC</span> will be in the game and the player will be able to interact/talk with him/her with your talking head from the Machine Tier in the dialogue box. <br/> Both your sprite and talking head will also be featured in the party scene that will appear on The Pocalypse website when funding is over. <br/> Your Hero can be named whatever you like and we will discuss the story behind him/her. It can even be based on your <span class=""caps"">NPC</span>, if you like. Your Hero will have completely separate artwork and animations from your <span class=""caps"">NPC</span> sprite, based on the Hero’s equipment and skills. <br/> Your boss character can also be named whatever you like and will also have a backstory. Maybe your Hero character turns evil and becomes a boss! We can discuss whatever ideas you may have. Your boss will also have different artwork and animations than your Hero. You could even be a 3-story tall plant mutant named Bill! The sky’s the limit!</p>
<p>If you have any more questions, please let me know!</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your support and please keep spreading the campaign! Let’s make it happen! :D</p>

<h3>The Pocalypse Defense 2 - RPG and Tower Defense</h3>
</div>
<div>Hello! My name is Joe Pendon and I'm the artist for the Canadian indie game company, <a href=""http://www.greenpixel.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Green Pixel</a>, and the creator of <a href=""http://www.thepocalypse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Pocalypse webcomic</a>. <br/><br/>We need your help in making our next game: <strong><em>The Pocalypse Defense 2</em></strong>! Not only do we need funding, but we also want to build an enthusiastic and dedicated community that will actively help us create the best game possible!<br/><br/><em>The Pocalypse Defense 2</em> will be an RPG AND a tower defense game based on The Pocalypse webcomic, an on-going project that I've been working on for over a year. I've been fortunate enough to gather thousands of fans and readers over that time and the #1 lesson I've learned is how valuable the feedback of a vocal community is. I've received countless amazing ideas and opinions that have positively shaped the course of my story and I can't imagine where The Pocalypse would be now without fan input.<br/><br/>We want to take this community approach as we create <em>The Pocalypse Defense 2</em>. We want to make this game together with you. That is why I think that crowdfunding is the wave of the future when it comes to game development. As funders, you're not just getting a game -- you're joining a community of fans who share the same goal: making <em>The Pocalypse Defense 2</em> as awesome as we all want it to be! </div>
<div>
<h3><img alt=""About the game"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thepocalypse.com/indiegogoimages/002.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""About the game""/></h3>
</div>
<div>
<em>The Pocalypse Defense 2</em> will be an RPG/tower defense game that will be available on PC/Mac/Linux platforms and on your iPad. Your main goal will be to rebuild your post-apocalyptic survivors' colony and destroy the monsters that attack it!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Based on The Pocalypse, you'll be leading a group of familiar characters, or Heroes - from the incompetent, yet powerful, Powerfist to the battle-hardened, optimistic sniper, Arbiter. Along with many other Heroes and over 30 unique units that will fight to the death, you'll have plenty of firepower to ward off The Pocalypse's monsters! ... Right?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The world of The Pocalypse is a post-apocalyptic wasteland that has been devastated by every post-apocalyptic scenario Hollywood has to offer! You'll be fighting brain-hungry zombies, powerful mutants, cunning vampires, relentless machines, swarms of plant monsters, and every other nightmare from The Pocalypse webcomic!</div>
<h3>Exploring Hammerston and your units</h3>
<div>You'll be free to explore the city of Hammerston like you would in an isometric RPG. There will be various unique battlezones, from barren cityscapes to the stifling plant monster territory. Surrounding them all will be the open-world city that you will be able to explore freely. You will run into NPCs and small encampments that will aid you in your quest by providing you with new units and upgrades.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<img alt=""Units"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thepocalypse.com/indiegogoimages/units.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Find and unlock new units during your quest!""/><br/><br/>
</div>
<div>If you want to check out the units, go to <a href=""http://www.thepocalypse.com/comics/all-your-units-d"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thepocalypse.com/comics/all-your-units-d</a> for a Flash preview!</div>
<h3>Battle</h3>
<div>Entering a battlezone switches you over to the tower defense aspect of the game. You'll be placing your units as effectively and strategically as you can to counter the waves of enemy forces. Think ""Plants Vs. Zombies"", but with more strategy, more weapons, more enemies, more depth, and more awesome (much more)!</div>
<div> </div>
<div><img alt=""Battle"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thepocalypse.com/indiegogoimages/battle.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Use your units wisely!""/></div>
<h3>Rebuilding the colony</h3>
<div>You'll also be given the task to rebuild your colony and make it even better! You'll be able to make a laboratory for new tech, make manufacturing plants for new weapons, and strengthen the colony's defenses (the colony can and will be attacked again and again!). While this feature won't be as robust as ""Sim City"", we want to add another layer of depth to <em>The Pocalyse Defense 2</em>'s gameplay!</div>
<h3>Story</h3>
<div>The game's story will be loosely connected to the webcomic, as the comic's story will be running at the same time we're developing the game. If you wanna check out the comic and catch up on the story, go to: <a href=""http://www.thepocalypse.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.thepocalypse.com</a> !</div>

<h3><img alt=""About Green Pixel"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thepocalypse.com/indiegogoimages/003.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""About Green Pixel""/></h3>
Green Pixel is made up of myself and my good friend, Rich Halliday, who takes care of the programming. We've worked together at small game companies for about 3 years, until the companies had to let us go for financial reasons. So, instead of looking for another game company to work with, we decided to go indie and make our own games! <br/><br/>I moved to Japan with my wife, started The Pocalypse, got a cat, and had a baby. All the while, Rich held down the fort in Canada and we kept in touch and created two games with an ocean and a 13-hour time difference separating us. These games were ""The Pocalypse Defense"", our very first game together, which we made in Flash, and ""BlockHopper"", which is available on Flash as well as the iOS platform.<br/><br/>Now, as I prepare to move back to Canada to re-unite with Rich, we're excited to work on our next game, equipped with everything we've learned these past few years. <br/><br/>With experience working in Flash and the iOS platform, and above all, experience in building a community and accepting its feedback, we're ready to move on to our best game yet!</div>

But hey he gives you one aircraft that's somehow still able to fly the AT-301 air tractor also known as the crop duster. And will give you a few bucks for every farm field you spray for him. Well what can you do, the island looks like a paradise somehow strange enough made completely for flying. <br/>Prove him that your a good pilot because his aircraft hangar has much more scrap metal to offer, and who knows with his contacts around the island what more he can offer.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/501784/files/20140411150847-promo1.jpg?1397254127"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Welcome to the Pilot Tycoon island where almost everything for a pilot is possible. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/501794/files/20140411151030-city-downtown.jpg?1397254230"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Pilot tycoon is not a real flight simulator and is actually more an <b>adventure, action flight simulator game</b>, with a kinda comedy style.

Some of the scenery comes together with that although that is mostly done. The most problems that we were facing with the scenery except that we already have all the objects for it is that it will be hand painted at the end. At the moment we are just using formulas based on the height of the terrain to create the textures on it automatically to give us an idea how its going to look like. <br/>That's why creating the first trailer wasn't that easy as it just shows the first pieces of where we are going and lot of spots are left blank it in it<br/><br/>The reason why we paint it and fill it actually at the end is that its an island and areas made for flying so many things and ideas come from different mission ideas.  Everything was on paper and so were the missions but things kept on changing and so did the whole environment. And we are actually happy we did. <br/><br/><h4>The Gameplay</h4>We will display some of the game play things and issues but we will keep it short to a few things. You can ask any questions in the comments. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/513105/files/20140416111328-promo1.jpg?1397672008"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/>The goal is to make the game simplified, realistic and fun at the same time. There are a few things that aren't going together here. Flying an airplane can be easy but complicated also.  Flying on the other hand is always fun so we didn't need to change that. <br/><br/>So whats the most complicated part about flying, well in most cases that would be the landing of the airplane its not only complicated it also takes a lot of time. <br/><br/><h5>Auto landing</h5>
Of course you can easily land  the Pitt special on the ground but landing a Boeing 747 is kind of different so we developed the auto landing feature for that.  When you arrive near an airfield you can easily choose the auto landing feature to just Finnish your job or transport quickly. Landing manually will of course be more rewarded and there for a visual in game ILS approach will be available. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/513097/files/20140416111019-jet-landing.jpg?1397671819"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><h5>Airplane Physics</h5>Here we had to made some scarifies but were thinking about doing a 2 level difficulty of flying. <br/>At
 the start we made our airplanes to realistic but we noticed that its 
not going to work out directly as we want to create this game for 
everybody.  We still have to decide if this is going to be the same for 
the online rankings or that we create it separately also. <br/><br/><br/><b>Missions Time </b><br/>There is no need to take off every time and fly to your mission objectives all the time. We try to keep the missions as short and bring you right in the action.<br/><br/><b>Graphics</b><br/>One of our biggest struggles i think so far but we are  not going into detail that far but our key is getting the most out of it.  Its not the quality but combining it to make it run on most of the mobile phones. Its one of the things i think every (flight simulator) developer on the mobile with 3d graphics faces.  You want to have as much as detail at once possible. We had to make a lot of sacrifices but like i said were getting the most out of it. <br/>You can compare it creating a website with nowadays technology for a 9600 baud modem.  <br/>With the graphics and models we have we also have the ambition to make a PC/Mac Version from it since we can do so much more. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/513099/files/20140416111051-rah66fun.jpg?1397671851"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><b>Missions</b><br/>Creating the mission in your mind is easy making it reality in the game sometimes is not.  But the beauty is that even when you don't develop anything yet you can already think about the missions and put them on paper an this started already more then a 1.5 year ago.  We will make sure we have a nice thrilling story line put together that wants you to fly and keep on flying and make progress. <br/><br/><b>Properties &amp; Offices</b><br/>Making money in this game and developing your career as a pilot is one of the mail goals of the game. Spending money will be also, There will be various properties available in game. Properties will gain you mostly more start locations for your airplanes and a better way of living. Offices are needed in different places mostly on airports to be able to land and takeoff without to many costs.<br/><br/><b>Airplanes &amp; Vehicles</b><br/>As we said already before there will be over 50 vehicles to choose from.<br/>This doesn't mean all of them are airplanes we are not going to much in to detail on this one yet but for example in one mission you need to use a boat to get to the aircraft carrier to steal a jet. <br/><br/>More on the development will be in the Q&amp;A we will be creating later on and we want you to ask your questions also. We will be happy to answer them.

We want this game to run on a cheap tablet and currently that is possible already but with the license we could offer more graphics on low end devices. Another thing is the limitations of the different areas to visit, with the license the amount of areas will be unlimited and we can create even airports for multiple countries, and we can offer it as downloadable content and also can offer more in the future. <br/><br/>And that is actually just the small story but it would help so much not touching the boundaries each time creating this game and we just want to be free of what we want to make. <br/><br/><a name=""perks"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510052/files/20140415075428-txt-perks.jpg?1397573668"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/513088/files/20140416110804-blueline.jpg?1397671684"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/533330/files/20140425093817-perk-1.jpg?1398443897"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510529/files/20140415110419-perk-5.jpg?1397585059"" src="""" style=""""/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510530/files/20140415110436-perk-10.jpg?1397585076"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510531/files/20140415110458-perk-50.jpg?1397585098"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510532/files/20140415110509-perk-250.jpg?1397585109"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510934/files/20140415130816-perk-400.jpg?1397592496"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510980/files/20140415131412-perk-500.jpg?1397592852"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510535/files/20140415110543-perk-800.jpg?1397585143"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510536/files/20140415110554-perk-1000.jpg?1397585154"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510537/files/20140415110602-perk-2500.jpg?1397585162"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510548/files/20140415111034-perk-0.jpg?1397585434"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/510578/files/20140415111952-txt-the-team.jpg?1397585992"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/513089/files/20140416110830-blueline.jpg?1397671710"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>The team consists about me, friends, freelancers, and flight simulator modelers.

Just when you thought your uncle had the perfect pilot job for you  
arrive at his farm with a small dusty runway. Not really what you

looks more like scrap metal then an airplane. But hey what can you do,  
its time to start your first job.

Spray farm fields and fly over scrap airplanes to the airplane graveyard. Numerous missions to choose from to gain some extra money.
The above was created as promotional material and doesn't really represent the full atmosphere of the game yet.So what about the atmosphere of the game.The 'game story' that you have seen above tells a already a bit of the main story. You have been studying hard to Finnish the flight academy, but your having trouble finding any job, but that uncle you have never heard before is talking about those needs of pilots on his Island and promises you that great career. But when you arrive at the island its not really what you expected. But hey he gives you one aircraft that's somehow still able to fly the AT-301 air tractor also known as the crop duster. And will give you a few bucks for every farm field you spray for him. Well what can you do, the island looks like a paradise somehow strange enough made completely for flying. Prove him that your a good pilot because his aircraft hangar has much more scrap metal to offer, and who knows with his contacts around the island what more he can offer.Welcome to the Pilot Tycoon island where almost everything for a pilot is possible. Pilot tycoon is not a real flight simulator and is actually more an adventure, action flight simulator game, with a kinda comedy style. And the story and adventure plays the main role in it, although the flight physics of each aircraft are realistic. But we will go more in to that in the development section. When i told other people about this game and the idea i sometimes heard 'isn't that just a Grand Theft Auto (Airplane) copy. Well I'm never gonna compare it in any way with that but it is what i actually miss with the current flight simulator games out there. Yes you will be able to buy properties and upgrade your airplanes, you will meet new contacts along your story missions and improve yourself being a pilot. This is definitely not a game where your only job is flying from A to B. So its just one island? No you will be able to fly to different other areas and especially the military missions and airliners missions will take part in other areas. So does the space missions strange enough.First of all lets talk about where we are at the moment. We are currently busy with creating the missions of the game together with the flight physics of each aircraft although 50% of the mandatory airplanes for the missions are already done. Some of the scenery comes together with that although that is mostly done. The most problems that we were facing with the scenery except that we already have all the objects for it is that it will be hand painted at the end. At the moment we are just using formulas based on the height of the terrain to create the textures on it automatically to give us an idea how its going to look like. That's why creating the first trailer wasn't that easy as it just shows the first pieces of where we are going and lot of spots are left blank it in itThe reason why we paint it and fill it actually at the end is that its an island and areas made for flying so many things and ideas come from different mission ideas.  Everything was on paper and so were the missions but things kept on changing and so did the whole environment. And we are actually happy we did. The GameplayWe will display some of the game play things and issues but we will keep it short to a few things. You can ask any questions in the comments. The goal is to make the game simplified, realistic and fun at the same time. There are a few things that aren't going together here. Flying an airplane can be easy but complicated also.  Flying on the other hand is always fun so we didn't need to change that. So whats the most complicated part about flying, well in most cases that would be the landing of the airplane its not only complicated it also takes a lot of time. Auto landing
Of course you can easily land  the Pitt special on the ground but landing a Boeing 747 is kind of different so we developed the auto landing feature for that.  When you arrive near an airfield you can easily choose the auto landing feature to just Finnish your job or transport quickly. Landing manually will of course be more rewarded and there for a visual in game ILS approach will be available. Airplane PhysicsHere we had to made some scarifies but were thinking about doing a 2 level difficulty of flying. At
 the start we made our airplanes to realistic but we noticed that its 
not going to work out directly as we want to create this game for 
everybody.  We still have to decide if this is going to be the same for 
the online rankings or that we create it separately also. Missions Time There is no need to take off every time and fly to your mission objectives all the time. We try to keep the missions as short and bring you right in the action.GraphicsOne of our biggest struggles i think so far but we are  not going into detail that far but our key is getting the most out of it.  Its not the quality but combining it to make it run on most of the mobile phones. Its one of the things i think every (flight simulator) developer on the mobile with 3d graphics faces.  You want to have as much as detail at once possible. We had to make a lot of sacrifices but like i said were getting the most out of it. You can compare it creating a website with nowadays technology for a 9600 baud modem.  With the graphics and models we have we also have the ambition to make a PC/Mac Version from it since we can do so much more. MissionsCreating the mission in your mind is easy making it reality in the game sometimes is not.  But the beauty is that even when you don't develop anything yet you can already think about the missions and put them on paper an this started already more then a 1.5 year ago.  We will make sure we have a nice thrilling story line put together that wants you to fly and keep on flying and make progress. Properties & OfficesMaking money in this game and developing your career as a pilot is one of the mail goals of the game. Spending money will be also, There will be various properties available in game. Properties will gain you mostly more start locations for your airplanes and a better way of living. Offices are needed in different places mostly on airports to be able to land and takeoff without to many costs.Airplanes & VehiclesAs we said already before there will be over 50 vehicles to choose from.This doesn't mean all of them are airplanes we are not going to much in to detail on this one yet but for example in one mission you need to use a boat to get to the aircraft carrier to steal a jet. More on the development will be in the Q&A we will be creating later on and we want you to ask your questions also. We will be happy to answer them.
There has been a lot of development going in to this game for a long time. And since the start i have been funding it myself but i think Indiegogo is a way for people to Pre-Order the game and fund it in the meantime.  We made a lot of progress and this game is going to be finished (even without support).  So why do we need the money.The campaign goal is 3500$ which is actually not even enough for everything,but we hope that this campaign will run successful and will gain more then that.- 3D Engine Unity license cost 1x Android - 1 x I phone 3000$- Unity Pro license (windows phone, Black berry,  extra options) 1500$- Cartoon creation of mission characters- Extra graphics and detail - More lands and countries to visitThe reason we need the licenses is that were currently limited in our possibilities and our visual graphics are also. We want this game to run on a cheap tablet and currently that is possible already but with the license we could offer more graphics on low end devices. Another thing is the limitations of the different areas to visit, with the license the amount of areas will be unlimited and we can create even airports for multiple countries, and we can offer it as downloadable content and also can offer more in the future. And that is actually just the small story but it would help so much not touching the boundaries each time creating this game and we just want to be free of what we want to make. The team consists about me, friends, freelancers, and flight simulator modelers. With the company I'm running i have a lot of experience and contacts with freelancers that are creating various things and objects in the game. There is of course a reason why i started a flight simulator kinda game since i have a background as a glider pilot and always enjoy flying. And so do my friends who are actually active in aviation for example Walter Kroese who is the level designer and airplane flight physics creator for this game but as full time job he is also a Boeing 737 Co-Pilot. Besides that i have been contacting some great people that have been creating airplanes and models for the other famous flight simulators and they granted me permission to use all of their work to be used in this game. I also have a lovely girlfriend who supports me in all the hours I'm working on this game and helps me also with various aspects of the game. When will the game be released?The current release date for all platforms is July 30.On what platforms will the game run?The game is currently developed for the Android, IOS (I phone), Windows Mobile. We also have the ambition to develop a PC,  Mac & Linux version later on.How will the game be released?There will be a free version of the game, this version will be limited by an amount of aircraft and properties and other lands to visit.Will the game contain in app purchases?Maybe Yes and no, the whole game play is made so that you won't need it.

<p>We are a team of 7 passionate, composed of Game Designers,
Level Designers, and Game Developers. We know each-others for several years and
it’s been one year and a half since we decided to work together to create
Strars’Frontier, a game inspired by our experience as gamers, but also as
developers. During the development, we have made partnership with different
talented persons, such as Masami for the Sound Design of our game.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/951736/files/20141022123441-why_we_need_you.png?1414006481"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Since we have been working on Stars' Frontier for one year and a half, you could ask, why start this campain only now ? Because we wanted to be sure that the project would be done and that it would be as good as you deserve it to be, of course !</p><p>This quality is exactly why we need your help. A game is made from a huge amount of audio, visual and animated elements, and we need your help to buy them and turn your game experience to something you will never forget.</p><p>Little by little, we will need :</p><p>- Some software licenses : Using a pro version of some of the softwares we are using, we will be able to make our game faster, smoother and more beautiful. This will cost us about 2000 euros (to get all the licenses we need)</p><p>- Pay the rewards : we want you to get top-level reward, to we will need to invest a lot in this. This amount may change, since we will probably add some things depending of the amount of money we will get, but we will basically use about 1/3 of the money on this - 5000 euros.</p><p>- Hire some artists to design icons, gui and ships : We will use every single other parts of the money to hire artists. A game is not only something you see, but it's a huge part of it. We need people who know how to draw, how to create models, and how to make both beautiful. And because it's a full-time job, we need to pay them.</p><p><br/></p>

Stars'Frontier
will be playable under Windows, Mac, and Linux. That is because we think it is
important for everyone to be able to play on their favorite platform of gaming!


We are a team of 7 passionate, composed of Game Designers,
Level Designers, and Game Developers. We know each-others for several years and
it’s been one year and a half since we decided to work together to create
Strars’Frontier, a game inspired by our experience as gamers, but also as
developers. During the development, we have made partnership with different
talented persons, such as Masami for the Sound Design of our game.Since we have been working on Stars' Frontier for one year and a half, you could ask, why start this campain only now ? Because we wanted to be sure that the project would be done and that it would be as good as you deserve it to be, of course !This quality is exactly why we need your help. A game is made from a huge amount of audio, visual and animated elements, and we need your help to buy them and turn your game experience to something you will never forget.Little by little, we will need :- Some software licenses : Using a pro version of some of the softwares we are using, we will be able to make our game faster, smoother and more beautiful. This will cost us about 2000 euros (to get all the licenses we need)- Pay the rewards : we want you to get top-level reward, to we will need to invest a lot in this. This amount may change, since we will probably add some things depending of the amount of money we will get, but we will basically use about 1/3 of the money on this - 5000 euros.- Hire some artists to design icons, gui and ships : We will use every single other parts of the money to hire artists. A game is not only something you see, but it's a huge part of it. We need people who know how to draw, how to create models, and how to make both beautiful. And because it's a full-time job, we need to pay them.

Ø  Can I have my digital key from steam?
o 
We will soon
register our game on Steam Greenlight. If we meet success, the game will be on
steam!
Ø  In which languages do you plan to
translate the game?
o 
Stars’Frontier will
be in English and in French.
Ø  On which platform the game will be
playable?
o 
PC, Mac, and Linux!

We are a team of local Hong Kongers. Being born and raised in Hong Kong, MTR is in most of our life. Hong Kongers simply could not live without it.
Basically, it's the vein of Hong Kong.

Inspired by the colourful background of each station, some tourists and locals even go through all stations and take photos.
To express our love of the MTR and also our love of tabletop games, we designed and created a set of playing cards, to celebrate our love to Hong Kong and MTR.
We are sure that there will be other people out there, tourists who might visited Hong Kong in the past, those who fancy a visit to Hong Kong, or local Hong Kongers. We hope to share our love of Hong Kong and MTR to you.










We have created a prototype of the cards already.
Our goal is to meet the basic requirements for minimum production of the playing cards. Also, the fund will help us to develop our next project which is a MTR-themed board game.













On the front of each card, it shows the exact lines goes through each station. The stations are chosen according to Railway Development Strategy 2014.
Simplistic and informational.
Each station has a unique colour. Most of the colours are chosen from the ""Station Information"" leaflet at each station. We also take some inspiration from the decorations of the wall or the recently-refurbished enamel board.
(Well, very few colours are altered for aesthetic and design purposes. And for those stations planning-to-be-built, we try our best to find the closest possible colour.)
Together, the 108 cards form a beautiful spectrum.









The card backs are illustrated using the 12 colours of the 12 lines in the MTR system. So there are 2 card backs designed for each deck of 54 cards.





Also as tabletop games lovers, we know the quality of the cards matters very much. Therefore, we choose to use High Quality 330gsm German-Import Paper with Black Core. This makes the card more durable for artistic display and smoother for playing.





For the 4 Joker cards in the 2 decks, we choose the 4 stations with special background decorations. They put the station name into a graphic representation. The decorations of these 4 stations are still using nowadays after many times of renovation.(So, sorry, Yau Ma Tei, we really love your original tricolour design, Maybe we can see you in our stretch goals!!!)



We love the simplistic design of the MTR system map. We just love it.
We create a pair of tuck boxes to store the 2 different decks, stemming from the illustration from respective card backs. While both of them goes together perfectly, taking one of them out to the street is still very convenient.




What's more? These 2 tuck boxes will be packaged into a beautifully designed gift box.

Risks & Challenges
We have already made a prototype. We believe by keeping everything simple already reduces many risks. So we list a few options for your perks here.

Under normal circumstances, your perks should be arrived by October.
We have thoroughly prepared for this campaign and will be open and transparent to all backers if any difficulties are encountered. The designs are 100% finished so there should be no delay in sending the digital proofs to the manufacturer, and then onto production.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<b>
Why Do I Want to Open Weggas?</b></p><p>I've always wanted to do my own thing... I started by running a video store at 
18. For the past 20 years I've been working in front of a computer, the back ten 
with my own website design business. I want to spend less time on the computer 
and interact with people in the community. I want to price product, stock the 
fridge with soda, make popcorn every morning, decide with games or Lego sets go 
into the game library, put together the weekly newsletter, teach people how to 
play board games and everything else. I have a very strong passion for gaming, 
started at the age of 5 years old with Yar's Revenge on the Atari 2600 and I 
never stopped. I want to bring this passion to my community, but most 
importantly... to younger people. I love being a father to my two amazing 
children and I feel Weggas will be an extremely positive place for young people 
to spend their time.</p>
<p>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">
Why I'm Crowdfunding?</b></p><p>Starting a business is very expensive. We all know this, right? :-) I have 
raised money through a personal loan, but it's really not enough to do 
everything I want to do with Weggas. The $6,500 I'm raising will help expand the 
game library, help with store fixtures, marketing and most importantly... get a 
head on the rent to ensure we have time to grow.  I want the community to 
have the best experience possible when visiting Weggas and these additional 
funds will help me do that. Be sure to check out our awesome perks- little ways 
for us to say ""thank you!"" for anything you might be able to contribute.</p>

<b>
Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p><p>Opening any small business is always risky, but there's good news for everyone. 
I've spent many, many hours thinking about how to make this business not fail. 
I've been thinking about this for years actually. I've done my research. I've 
done the opening costs breakdown, priced out cases of hot dogs, the candy bars, 
board game purchase list, etc. But most importantly... Weggas is designed to be 
as low risk for failure as possible. I will continue my web business for my own 
personal life expenses, so the money made from Wegga's can and will go directly 
back into Weggas to ensure that we stay in business and grow accordingly.</p>

And what lies beyond this world?Street Skirmish by Marek MadejWhat makes Infusion unique:
art of the highest possible quality
sf-fantasy-punk flavor
a fresh and interesting world(machine) to explore
dozens of never-before-seen races to play and to fight
playing as a punk character in fantasy world
video game-like dueling mechanics, with combos and specials
player characters starting on really high power level
Infusion is a tabletop RPG project that has been growing in my mind for over 12 years now. What started as a simple, homebrew variation of fantasy game played by me and my friends has evolved into what you can see on this page.That's meMy name is Rafał Sadowski and I’m a fledgling game designer from Warsaw, Poland (the land of the 3 W’s: Winged hussars, Walesa and the Witcher). I’m designing board games, card games, video and mobile games and I already have some minor successes on my account. But roleplaying games were always my favorite kind of games. Nothing can compare to this exciting feeling of freedom they give you. For years I’ve been putting Infusion project away, saying “it’s too big” or “it’s too early”. And finally the day has come to show my work to you, and ask you for help.This is a first step on a path to fund the full game, and I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I do.By backing this project you will be funding the making of first Infusion Fantasypunk RPG playtest.""The Riincal Tournament is one of the most prestigious events for the Infused, who want to make their mark.Every three years it is hosted by the infamous Ferra Twins, Infused of immense power and dark motives. The tournament pits rising champions against eachother in a series of duels fought on incredible arenas in the most unexpected places throughout the Worldmachine by using the Seven Gates - an ancient system of portals scattered in strange places, connected into a dangerous maze. Infused from all over the Worldmachine flock to Riincal ruins in search of recognition and glory, and you are among them.But this year the tourament will be but a background for events way more ominous...""First Infusion Playtest titled ""Seven Gates of Riincal"" is a fully colored pdf book between 30-60 pages that includes:
dedicated, unique art created by some of the best concept artists in the world,
four pre-generated and illustrated characters,
an adventure that will take you and your friends for a joyride through the Worldmachine,
...and all the rules necessary to enjoy the game.
All of the money will be for art for this playtest.Infusion is a one-man work. I manage writing, layouting, creating maps and sketches, but I really want this game to look perfect. My aim is to make this game the best-looking RPG on the market, and money is the only way to make it happen.If we reach the goal, the playtest will be e-mailed to you before February 28, 2014.Each amount of money above the goal will make this playtest look even better with more awesome art. And if we'll reach the goal early, I'll add many interesting stretch goals, such as:
more content,
more pregenerated characters,
interactive website,
maybe even second playtest? Who knows.
And that’s it. Infusion has been my dream for years. Now I want to share this dream with you, step by step. This playtest is my first step on the way to create the corebook, and I need your help to achieve this.The Worldmachine is waiting. Are you in?Look below for description of the game, and scroll down to see what perks await you for helping.Worldmachine was created by the unknown Makers long after all planes of existence vanished from the multiverse. The Worldmachine, also called ""Incar"" by its inhabitants, is populated by dozens of intelligent races from the past realms.Excerpts from ""Incagraphy""All of the continents and seas of this insane world are placed on an inner surface of a gargantuan sphere. Powerful, technomagical sun and other celestial bodies hang in the center of the sphere, while ancient, underground machines called adram tiexu, ""the voice of the gods"" by the fanatic askai provide this unbelievable construct with standard gravity force.Prime Sector - one of six sectors of WorldmachineIt is the world of impossible made common. Take a walk through the streets of Ta'Ren, the ever-changing abandoned city of an extinct race of undead giants. Sneak through the incredible caves of skaia, an underground world, home of the askai, and see how the very soil and rock of Incar blends with machines of old. Gaze upon the gas-lantern lit walls of the Keep Rua, guarded by paladins clad in stained glass armor. See the six Spokes, piercing the earth in the center of each of the six Sectors of Incar, each with a diameter the size of a city.Taren SectorWelcome to the Worldmachine, Brother and Sister. Arm yourself, because no one else here will save you. And may the Ten Thousand Gods and the Holy Interface watch over you.Infusion is a fantasypunk roleplaying game. What does that mean?Fantasy is magic. It's unknown, it's the most daring of dreams came true. A fantasy background allows the game master and the players alike to take their characters and put them in truly extraordinary situations. Everything is possible. Fantasy is swordplay, pseudo-feudal elements of the world and a source of a lone warrior archetype.Punk is the attitude. Punk is about breaking the rules. It's about holding onto the Ring of Power and using it to challenge the Sauron himself. Punk is dirty, gritty, bloody stuff where the anti-heroes might help you in your noble quest or tell you to scram before they rip you apart and make a cool pauldron out of your skull.Infused champion by Marek MadejAnd so, fantasypunk is about taking fantasy and giving it piercings, inks, cigarettes and wicked grins. And the attitude.Andryles – The androgynous offspring of selays and humans. They are all sterile and they do not die of old age. For some they are a proof that the Makers tampered with the genes of all the races they restored to allow all kinds of combinations, which effects are more than just mix of the features of both parents.Tezgans – Charismatic and proud people of the former Empire, perfectionists driven by tradition and passion for chasing the absolute.Askai – The lords of the underground. Ruled by powerful kings and caste of fanatic warrior-priests these underground dwellers rarely live on the surface of the Worldmachine. Their metallurgy skill has no equal and their noble yet stern attitude makes them one of the least trusted nations in Incar.the AskaiShivs – Fierce warriors from Shiphei Islands, famous for their incredible sword-fighting style they call arquilla. Khurites – Bronze-skinned tribalmen; highlanders and hunters who believe in totem spirits and who wear feathered bird masks.  Kanda (The Horned) – Most of these wise, long-lived warriors are extinct. Once rulers of the entire Worldmachine today roam its surface in search of forgotten knowledge and aid younger races, for they have many sins to atone for.Selais – This nation is full of passion. Selaish lives are much shorter than lives of other races of Incar, but they also ""live faster"". Brilliant, focused and beautiful selais are considered the most subtle of all Incarians.Mhyrin – In the language of askai “mhyrin” means “sin”. This cursed offspring of askai and other races is feared and respected on whole Incar. Mothers scare their children with stories about their exploits. It’s one of the rarest and most dangerous races of the Worldmachine.Zurrians – Called ""the Cannibals from Black Glacier"" zurrian tribes are undisputed owners of the harsh, cold sector of Kand. Their pale skin, shark-like teeth and tar black blood make other races fear and despise zurrians.Gwaith – The gwaith come from the flying Echo Jungle of Echo Sector. Of all nations of Worldmachine these furry warriors and huntsmen are the ones closest to nature's secrets.Infusion's game mechanics are based on an amalgam of the elements common in many other roleplaying games. This amalgam has been seasoned with some unique solutions crafted during many years of playing Infusion and reforged into the current system.It doesn’t matter if your’e a D&D player, Pathfinder fan, World of Darkness lover, or Savage Worlds geek. Every player and every game master should find familiar features in Infusion right from the start.For most tests you will roll 2d10, add ability modifiers and sometimes skill or bonus dice (commonly d6) to beat the chosen difficulty level.Everything else revolves around these simple basics.Character sheet for the current version of the gameInfusion wouldn’t exist without many, many incredible works by other people that inspired and influenced the game throughout the years. Some of the inspirations behind it are:Nine Inch Nails music, Frank Herbert’s Dune, John Varley’s Titan, BLAME! by Nihei Tsutomu, Marvel’s X-Men comic series, Planescape: Torment, Blue Byte’s Albion, Larry Niven’s Ringworld, Mortal Kombat, Degenesis, Cyberpunk, The Matrix, Andre Norton’s Witch World, Ursula LeGuin’s Earthsea, Brandon Sanderson’s fantasy books, Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition, Mage: Ascension, Legend of the Five Rings RPG, The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and many, many more.Seven bucks for your copy of the Seven Gates of Riincal?

<p>Hi everyone I’m Taran, the founder and owner of Black-Ronin.com</p>
<p>At Black-Ronin we already produce a wide range of PDF based RPG and Wargaming pieces. Covering everything from tiling  wargame scenery (River sections, cobbled streets, city roads and papercraft building) to our own game-rules covering everything from classic paper and dice RPG games, through skirmish and full blown battlefield wargames.</p>
<p>To date everything that has been achieved has been through my own hard work, and the constant support of friends via social media networking who have shared what I have created all over the world.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, all my hard work comes at a financial cost.</p>
<p>In order to create the best possible product, I need to pay for the artwork that is supplied by my artists, as well as my own time and material costs.</p>
<p>The “Infected Dead- Zombie RPG &amp; Skirmish Wargame” rulebook is due for PDF release on the 1<sup>st</sup> of July 2013, and regardless of any funding received this is going to happen.</p>
<p>However, I would very much like to be able to offer a traditional printed version of the game as well as the PDF one.  This funding will also allow for me to include more original commission artwork and produce a better quality product.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT I NEED.</strong></p>
<p>The £5000 initial funding I need would be spent in the following way:</p>
<p>£2000 on artwork (a full page illustration with our contracted artist averages at around £100 each, with some more detailed pieces being more).</p>
<p>£2000 on advertising &amp; promotion. Social networking has done well for us, but traditional magazine advertising is still the most effective method of promotion. We would also like to produce a professional video advertisement for distribution online.</p>
<p>£1000 for my own time and materials cost. Hey, I have to be honest, this has already cost me a fair amount of cash, in website costs, art commissions, office materials, increased phone bills etc. So it would be nice to be able to recoup some of my initial outlay.</p>
<p>Just being honest lol</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone who pays £5 into this project will receive a PDF copy of the rules and a personal mention in the rulebook itself.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more…</p>

<p>For a £15 perk you get a printed copy of the rules, a PDF copy of the rules, a personal mention in the rulebook itself, 5 limited edition zombie art prints signed by the artist himself.</p>
<p>For a £25 perk you get a printed copy of the rules, a PDF copy of the rules, a personal mention in the rulebook itself, 5 limited edition zombie art prints signed by the artist himself and you get to feature as a character within the game itself (your choice of either human or infected).

There is another thrill around every corner in this competitive first-person shooter, and in a marked shift away from trends that have come to permeate the genre, the emphasis is on building skills rather than stockpiling items. Anyone can pick up Defense Corp – Earth and jump right in: there is no mindless grind to it, there are no character differentials in it, and each player starts out on the same playing field, just like the classic FPS games that have held onto people's hearts for such a long time.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573244589/moulwjnq6cccvhe8mp7r.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573244603/s2hgprbi2a2olqahp264.png"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong>Get in and start fragging</strong></h3><p>Whichever character you choose, you will have full access to the entire game.

There is another thrill around every corner in this competitive first-person shooter, and in a marked shift away from trends that have come to permeate the genre, the emphasis is on building skills rather than stockpiling items. Anyone can pick up Defense Corp – Earth and jump right in: there is no mindless grind to it, there are no character differentials in it, and each player starts out on the same playing field, just like the classic FPS games that have held onto people's hearts for such a long time. Get in and start fraggingWhichever character you choose, you will have full access to the entire game. Every character spawns with the same gun, and every character is equivalent in terms of skills. That means you can play however you want to play – without worrying about whether or not you have started on the wrong foot.  Got skill?What matters in Defense Corp – Earth is the time is your ability, which you can improve over time. There is a high skill ceiling in this fast paces arena shooter, so it rewards the players who stick with it over time. Choose any of the six characters, two skins, and five colors and get started! Each Character has access to 16 Skills of which you choose two to battle with. You can change these skills on the fly during a match while waiting to be respawned! Your Game, Your RulesIn Defense Corp – Earth you will have the option to host your own dedicated server with your own rules and settings! Want to password protect your server and only make it accessible for friends? No problem! Want to host a dedicated server with 24/7 Instagib and a score limit of 1000? Go right ahead.We believe in giving players the ultimate freedom. Once you buy the game, we feel it should always be playable, even if the company behind a game for whatever reason stops support. And community dedicated servers support is the answer to that. Maps & PvP Modes – Always FreeCarrying on the same mindset that has inspired us to include no lootboxes and no in-game currency in Defense Corp – Earth, we pledge never to charge players for maps or PvP modes, which we will continue to develop and release in the future. You can play across all maps, you can play as any character, and you can play in any way that is available – all for the price of the game itself. Again, this is the way that we think things ought to be. Setting an example that others can follow, we want this game to make a bold and clear statement about the state of FPS games today and the direction in which we think they should move.Gameplay To start out, there will be four game modes in Defense Corp – Earth: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Instagib, and Showdown (a round-based CTF variant). Each game mode is distinctive, but they are all involved and exciting, keeping you on the edge of your seat throughout. Forget about missions that seem to drag on! We have worked hard to enrich this game into something that we would be excited to play ourselves.

Community dedicated server support – Host your own server with your own rules. Even if we go belly up, you will always be able to play the game you paid for.

Private games – Don't want to rent a server to host your own dedicated server? Host your own game on the spot and invite your friends for a play session. Choose your maps, game modes, and start playing.

Matchmaking – Don’t feel like joining one of the dedicated servers or hosting your own game with your friends? Jump straight into a match via our matchmaking system.


Map Editor – Explore a full-fledged map editor to create your own worlds. Add weapon spawns, shield spawns, mixing and matching all assets we have used to create our maps and more. (Stretch goal)


16 Skills To choose from.

Rankings - We have support for an ingame rankings board where you are compared with your top 20 friends. There will also be different rank medals based on your overall performance.
 The following game – modes will be available for the Early access launch in 2020.

Team Deathmatch – Fight as a team and frag your enemy team. That's all there is to it!

Deathmatch – It's a free for all: who will come out on top?

Instagib – 1 shot 1 kill for everyone. Watch out: there is a delay between shots.

Showdown – A CTF-inspired game mode. Round-based, point-based intense squad action.
Additional Game Modes for full release

Raids    : Fight of the invaders in an exciting PVE raids. We have some cool idea's how this should look. As ex-hardcore Wow/destiny/Dark souls players we have more than enough experience with boss fights to keep you entertained. But we can't do it without you! (Stretch goal)


Duo        : 2vs2 intense action. Small Maps, ticket respawn-based game mode.

Runner : Grab the Aura and slay as many as you can. Frag while you have an Aura to earn bonus points. Killing an Aura holder transfers the Aura to you. Time survived with the Aura also grants bonus points. Player with the most points at the end of match wins.
We want our game-modes to always be Action packed and put you on the edge of your seat skill wise. There will be no hand-holding, no short cuts. You want to go on that Killing-spree? Beter bring you’re A-game and dust off the good old Hyperglides.Killing spree medalsWield a huge arsenal of weaponsBetween the Slugger, DrumRifle, Grenade Launcher, and others, you’ll have plenty of ways to bring down your enemy. A mix between projectile based and hit scan weapons means there is more to the game then just reflexes. Will you go on a godlike streak? Utilize an array of useful Skills With 16 skills to choose from initially you are bound to have a setup which fits your play style. Our skills are designed to reward skilled players but not be overpowered or game breaking. Plenty of offensive and defensive options for everyone. You are in charge of your character’s skill load-out. LoreAlmost any FPS out there keeps the story and multiplayer separated. For us, that didn’t make sense. In Defense Corp  - Earth the story is tied into the multiplayer aspect. All battles you wage are actually VR training sessions preparing you and your team for an Alien threat. Since pictures say more than thousand words we have prepared two small Origin comics which will show you some of the story. CharactersCharacters in Defense Corp – Earth only differ  cosmetically. Skills are all chosen during gameplay. Each character has it’s own backstory. For the early access launch there will be 6 characters available with each 2 distinctive skins and each skin will have 5 color options.Our character ""C"" with in the middle her default skin, Flanked by her ""cyberpunk"" inspired second skin in two different color options. The OperatorsWorldThe world is set in a sci-fi blend setting with vivid colors, beautiful textures and a unique stylized style. We went for a semi-realistic cartoony style for the world and characters.What We Need & What You GetRight now, we are turning to you, through Indiegogo, for help raising the funds that we need to complete development on Defense Corp – Earth.

Extra Battery Life & Connect to TV Anywhere Anytime     PELDA and Pro are with a unique ultra-slim design that makes them easy to carry but packed with sufficient power to let you game much longer.      Ultra Slim Light & easy to carry    PELDA has a battery capacity of 8000mAh and the Pro version has a capacity of 6000mAh. PELDA Pro is also the first of its kinds that has a micro HDMI port which allows you to connect to TV without any dock.   PELDA & PELDA Pro      
Take a Closer Look        
     PELDA Pro comes with the micro HDMI port through which you can connect it to a TV with a Micro HDMI Cable. Even you don't bring any Switch Dock, you can enjoy the big screen gaming anywhere you like.

As a result, we've lowered all our intended stretch goals by $1,000, thanks to the sponsorship renewal by DTRPG.$1,500. Bag of PDFs. Last year, we built up an interface to make PDFs available to you. When we hit our core goal of $2,500 $1,500 we'll schedule our sponsor's 2016 contributions through the system, they're available to all members in January and February.$4,000. Lenses of Clarion Content Contemplation. We did some great work on our review and column system in 2016, giving editing access to our contributors and improving the review search functionality. If we hit this first stretch goal, we'll double down on that in 2017, putting a week of effort into improving how you can browse our old reviews and columns (and then continuing onward from there!).$6,500. +1 Staff. Our chief programmer (Shannon) dedicates a full week of general work to RPGnet, absent any emergencies with our various machines. Our top priorities for this (and all other work time that we stretch in) will be: aggressively fixing bugs and adding cool features (possibly including blogs, but fundamentally focusing on what our Patrons, Talkative Members, and Lifetime Members want to see).$9,000. Option of vBulletin 5. A dramatic new vBulletin system has been maturing for a few years now. We use it at our Skotos site and we love the further improvements it makes to mobile support. However, we still have some qualms with spam protection, plug-in availability, and some other issues. If we hit this goal we'll consider a vB5 upgrade for RPGnet late in 2017. If we decide vB5 is still not ready, we'll keep it on our schedules to review year by year, and in the meantime we'll substitute with a Cage of Security week of work, where we focus on continuing to secure the site.$11,500. +2 Staff. We dedicate a second full week of general programming & sysadmin work to RPGnet. This will probably occur late in 2017.$14,000. Bag of Holding. A new membership benefit? This stretch goal slot is undecided, so feel free to offer suggestions.Bonus Stretch Goal: If we hit 159 backers, exceeding the size of last year's very successful Membership Drive, we'll automatically bump up to the next stretch goal!Thank you for your support",12.0,0,"7 Campaigns

Inteliscope LLC was established to bring the Inteliscope Tactical Adapter and smartphone app to market. The Inteliscope products are designed and assembled in Sandpoint located in Idaho’s far-north panhandle.
What have we done so far?
What you see in the video are actual working units made on production tooling with no mock-ups. Real beta software was used in filming. All our packaging, branding, web site, and social media has been designed. Feel free to check us out at www.inteliscopes.com and please give us a like on www.facebook.com/Inteliscope
Our software team is commited to provide countinuous improvements to to the app throughout the life of the product.
Why do we need your help?
We need your support to help us fund tooling for a universal adapter to allow all Android smartphones to be used on this platform and to port the app over from Apple to the Android OS.
This will require $25,000. We also need your help to spread the word about The Inteliscope Tactical Adapter. You'll be among the first to have one so you can tell your friends and the whole world too.
What's Next?
Here is our plan for the next few months: June: Finalize Software Development, Build Tooling July: First Universal Components Production Run August: Assemble, Test, Package, and Ship",5.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Even if we do not meet our goal, we still plan on releasing. We will continue to work our full time jobs in order to survive but will continue to create this project as it is a firm belief that this project is worthy of our time and effort. </p>

<p>Slash/Meow's project leads, Darren Rebensdorf and Mercy Maya (myself) have worked together on multiple mobile games in the past.

<p>Too many times we had to overlook simple fixes that could have made the gameplay exceptional because the client didn't ""Like the feel of it"" when it was proven through massive amounts of emails that our players wanted a change. Now, We can finally make those changes as we're the ones who are developing.</p>
<p>One of the biggest impacts for this projects is our use of interns and students. This industry is incredibly hard to get your feet planted in. We plan on giving students the opportunity to work with us so they have something incredible to put on their curriculum vitaes.</p>

An independent video-game developer based in London, United Kingdom. In particular, My name is Ryan Shah; I'm the Project Lead / Coder / Developer / Tea Maker / Insert Job Role here! More about that stuff down the page though! I'm extremely excited to tell you all about Super Distro Horizons; Kitatus Studios' First commercially released project, powered by Unreal Engine 4.Super Distro Horizons is the shortened title of ""Super Distro Horizons Vs. Galaximo's Army"", which to sum it up in just a few words is: ""An N64 and Dreamcast-Style platforming hybrid"". As you can tell, it's not so simple to sum the project up into a few words, so let me explain it a little better:Super Distro Horizons is an upcoming 3D platformer for PC, Mac, Linux, Wii U, PS Vita, Amazon Fire HD, iOS, Android, Ouya and Gamestick. Taking heavy inspiration from titles such as Banjo Kazooie, Conker's Bad Fur Day, Spyro the Dragon, Sly Cooper, Sonic Adventure, Rayman 2, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver and a ton more titles such as Jet Set Radio and much more, Super Distro is the modern tribute to not just a classic genre but a whole era of video-games; The era during the Fifth and Sixth console generations.Harnessing the hubworlds as made popular from N64 platformers and blending in fast and frantic levels as found in titles such as Sonic Adventure, we hope to fuse together the gameplay experiences we experienced growing up with the games industry to create a fresh new game in the sea of first person shooters and puzzles titles that flood the games industry currently.Super Distro has been in development for over a year and in that time, Everyone at Kitatus HQ has put every penny of their money (And even personal Savings) into Super Distro as we believe in the idea so much that we've literally skinted ourselves making this project a reality. As it currently stands, we have put enough money into Super Distro to make the release date and be happy with the final product. But that's not enough for me. Being a perfectionist I don't want to make an ""Alright"" game, I want to make the absolute best possible game we can personally provide to you beautiful people. The reason we need more money is to make this possible, to be able to bring in people from outside to work to fine-tune the animations, the models, double over the code to make it as tight and responsive as possible. I want to be able to perfect the game to make it the game of my dreams and hopefully the game that you all would love to play. And to do that, I need your help.Literally every £1 helps the project, being able to pay for people to go over the animations, models, as well as bring in 2D artists to design the UI system, to pay the entry fee to get onto marketplaces such as iOS & Android stores, to pay for advertising and to make sure none of the people working on the project go starving (For too long). Super Distro will only be possible with your help...Here is a list of the current and planned features for the release of Super Distro:

Hubworld - Travelling around various stages has never been so fun. Or so rewarding! Explore the Hubworld and find secret areas, hidden treasures and maybe a surprise or two... Currently, we have a main hubworld and two sub-hubs planned! One of the sub-hubworlds are already in the game - NeoTokyo! 

Level Builder! - One of the funnest part of video-games in my personal opinion is the ability to create your own levels to share with friends, create obstacle courses or just let your creative juices flow and create new and wonderful worlds to explore! 

Global Leaderboards - Get the best times on one of the games' many stages and post it online for all to see. 


Multiple Pathways - Just can't beat your friends time on a level? Think outside the box; When you start looking at the bigger picture, things might seem a bit more... Shortcut-ty. You'll also net yourself some sweet hidden extras by finding alternative routes, so get hunting!

Local & Online Multiplayer - We're currently developing plenty of extra modes for multiplayer for you to challenge your family/friends/pets at different games based in the Distro universe. Some of these modes include: Race, Battle, Hunt and a whole collection of mini-games inspired by classic and modern video-games!

Free Post-Release Content FOREVER - It's a shame this has to be a feature in video-games these days, but if it has to be so, it has to be so. Every single piece of added content before and after launch is free with every copy of the game. This will include extra levels, extra characters, bonus missions, more multiplayer maps and modes. Anything that we can do to support the game post-launch. And it'll all be free. Forever.

</div><p>VoZ is a historical fiction game and draws inspiration from Alchemy and Mysticism, bringing the ancient precursor to chemistry and ancient texts from our world together in a synergy of the mystical and mundane. A player will learn to transmute the elements and spiritual forces to fight battles in the Afterlife where the digital terrain becomes more and more alive with the placement of every card.</p><p>When a player signs up for the game and logs in, they become a student of the Visions of Zosimos, written by Zosimos the Moravian, a mystic from the 16th century who recorded his visions and alchemical insights in a series of manuscripts. Lost to time, surviving copies were brought to light by Bertold Slate, a professor focused on 16th century mysticism, gnosticism, and hermetic alchemy. As the foremost authority on the works of Zosimos he soon began to attract the attention of other like minded scholars and modern mystics. Things changed when he shared the Visions with a friend who was a mathematician and Computer Science professor. Together they began to create programs that could express the complex formulae of the arcane texts in the language of computers; this game is the interface, allowing novices to be inducted into an eternal struggle for the very nature of existence. Entering the virtual academy, player avatars can explore the materials available for study and create homunculi that will represent them in battles. The player becomes empowered with the addition of cards which are earned through exploration, victory, or purchase. These tools for mastering the maps and adversaries in the great struggle are manifestations of power generated by the arcane mathematical coding of the Visions Program. They allow the initiated to travel the path towards triumph, desolation, or even immortality.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464885711/Voz_Bus_Cards-2_doluoi.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 577.966px;height: 330px;""/></p><p>Want to play the game NOW?!?

<p>Finally, we attend GenCon every year with the game. If you are there or are from the area, please spread the word about us. We are partnered with eBash there every year so we will be in the eBash pavilion. Getting as many people playing the game and interacting with us there, is imperative to our long term success.</p>
<br/><h2>FAQ:</h2>
<p>Can I purchase if I am outside of the US?</p>
<p>-Yes, however, understand that we are a small team with little funding at this time. As such, we do not have plans to localize VoZ to formats external to the United States at this time. While this may change in the future, if you cannot read English, then please understand that you may not get a version of VoZ that is in your native language.</p>
<p>Will there be formats other than PC/Windows?</p>
<p>-Due to the contracts and constraints of the Hero Engine at this time and our current financial situation, we cannot afford to obtain source code access to the Hero Engine. While this may change in the future, at this time, we only plan to release VoZ on Windows/PC machines.</p>
<p>Where can I go to discuss/share my idea(s)?</p>
<p>-We at FI practice Lean StartUp, Agile Software Development and attempt to get early customer engagement at every possible moment. As such, we love to hear questions, comments, concerns, criticism, etc... from the community. You may share any of this with us at our email:  contact@foreverinteractive.com or our forums</p>
<p>Will VoZ be on Steam?</p>
<p>-This is a good question, and for right now, we honestly do not know. There are a lot of constraints we have to contend with in relation to microtransactions, payments, client based downloads, etc... For obvious reasons we are actively working on resolutions to this with the hopes that upon our launch, we will be able to utilize Steam as a partner.</p>
<p>Does VoZ have DRM?</p>
<p>-Due to the inherent nature of the game, it requires a persistent internet connection to be able to play. When the game launches in gold status, despite the fact that it will have PvE, it will still require an internet connection. This is not due to DRM in the strictest sense, but rather the fact that VoZ harnesses MMO features as part of gameplay. However, considering that VoZ requires an internet connection, people may consider this a form of DRM.</p>
<p>When will I receive my backer rewards?</p>
<p>-Digital backer rewards will be sent to you via email upon the release of the in-game storefront.</p>-All other rewards will be distributed between successful completion of your purchase and the release of the full game. For further questions, please contact us at contact@foreverinteractive.com<p></p>
</div></div>","What is Visions of Zosimos?
Visions of Zosimos (VoZ) is an online collectible card game that seamlessly integrates deep tactical turn-based combat in a hex based layout, while harnessing the social aspects of the massively multiplayer online (MMO) genre. VoZ is a PC game for windows based machines, built on the Hero Engine that will utilize a dedicated player client. A single game session will occur in a 3D board environment and allow each player to engage in direct combat with his or her avatar on the board, as well as play various cards from his or her deck enacting a multitude of effects on gameplay. A player achieves victory by defeating all opposing players' avatar(s), and additional game modes are in development which are based on other achievements. We place strategy, balance, and fun at the forefront of our essential tenets of gameplay and strive every day to make this a reality within VoZ.

Free to Play
Turn-based tactical tabletop war game/CCG played on a hexagon game board
In-game Deck builder that allows you to create any combination of cards to build your personalized ultimate deck to fit your unique playstyle 
Fully integrated in-game store that allows you to securely use in-game currency earned through gameplay, as well as real-world money to purchase items in-game
Can be played with up to 6 people simultaneously
PvP game mode, with additional modes (including PvE) in development.
Unprecedented strategic options, not seen before within a video game.
Multiple maps available with distinct stories, lore and environments
Social aspects of a MMO
Microtransaction based monetization system: Card packs, cosmetic items and homunculi.
Unique lore that ties into real world mythos, legends and history.


VoZ is a historical fiction game and draws inspiration from Alchemy and Mysticism, bringing the ancient precursor to chemistry and ancient texts from our world together in a synergy of the mystical and mundane. A player will learn to transmute the elements and spiritual forces to fight battles in the Afterlife where the digital terrain becomes more and more alive with the placement of every card.When a player signs up for the game and logs in, they become a student of the Visions of Zosimos, written by Zosimos the Moravian, a mystic from the 16th century who recorded his visions and alchemical insights in a series of manuscripts. Lost to time, surviving copies were brought to light by Bertold Slate, a professor focused on 16th century mysticism, gnosticism, and hermetic alchemy. As the foremost authority on the works of Zosimos he soon began to attract the attention of other like minded scholars and modern mystics. Things changed when he shared the Visions with a friend who was a mathematician and Computer Science professor. Together they began to create programs that could express the complex formulae of the arcane texts in the language of computers; this game is the interface, allowing novices to be inducted into an eternal struggle for the very nature of existence. Entering the virtual academy, player avatars can explore the materials available for study and create homunculi that will represent them in battles. The player becomes empowered with the addition of cards which are earned through exploration, victory, or purchase. These tools for mastering the maps and adversaries in the great struggle are manifestations of power generated by the arcane mathematical coding of the Visions Program. They allow the initiated to travel the path towards triumph, desolation, or even immortality.Want to play the game NOW?!? For beta keys, interviews, feedback, criticism, information, etc... please contact us at contact@foreverinteractive.comClosed alpha keys are available upon request.

Forever Interactive (FI) is a Wisconsin based independent videogame developer, that runs a virtual, cloud-based studio. We are dedicated to making a deep and meaningful impact on the gaming community, which is why many of us have stayed with FI for many years, pouring our own money into the success of VoZ. As such, we have day jobs that takes away from our ability to dedicate full-time development work to this project.Your assistance will allow us to further expedite the development process and bring the full vision of VoZ to the masses.What We Need & What You GetFunds received from this campaign will be allocated in order of the following breakdown, from top to bottom:
GenCon:
This is by far and large our most important event. GenCon gives direct access to our key customers more than any other convention. Our partnership with eBash is paramount to this and that is why this cost is so high. It unfortunately has gone up since last year, but that is the nature of doing business. 3D Models:The next most important aspect is outsourcing 3d models. By outsourcing these, it will allow us to focus on other, more important aspects of development and allow us to provide you with a high quality deliverable earlier than we expected. Marketing Budget:Word of mouth is king when it comes to advertising. To this end, we are placing our third highest cost priority on the marketing budget. Getting high quality swag and giveaways at conventions and public events is crucial and will allow us to grow the community even faster. Everything Else:We have tons of funding needs beyond just what is listed on the preceeding image, but as a remider, we are, and have been, working for no pay for a long time on this title as well as fronting all operations costs out or our own pocket, so any money we get beyond our goal will help us that much more. More personal money we have free = more money and time we can reinvest into the company and project!With that in mind, when/if we get close to our goal amount we will be announcing stretch goals .

-This is a good question, and for right now, we honestly do not know. There are a lot of constraints we have to contend with in relation to microtransactions, payments, client based downloads, etc... For obvious reasons we are actively working on resolutions to this with the hopes that upon our launch, we will be able to utilize Steam as a partner.
Does VoZ have DRM?
-Due to the inherent nature of the game, it requires a persistent internet connection to be able to play. When the game launches in gold status, despite the fact that it will have PvE, it will still require an internet connection. This is not due to DRM in the strictest sense, but rather the fact that VoZ harnesses MMO features as part of gameplay. However, considering that VoZ requires an internet connection, people may consider this a form of DRM.
When will I receive my backer rewards?
-Digital backer rewards will be sent to you via email upon the release of the in-game storefront.-All other rewards will be distributed between successful completion of your purchase and the release of the full game.

<p><span>We are George and Krasi. </span></p>
<p><span>George is a veteran in the mobile industry. He has been working on mobile applications when any usable SDKs and tools were hardly available. Started with the old J2ME, then Symbian. Lately mostly Android and iPhone.</span></p>
<p><span>Krasi handles anything that runs on a PC - from graphics rendering to data management and networking. He has a masters degree in Artificial Intelligence. His entire career he has worked on performance critical applications. <br/><br/>We are gaming enthusiasts who want to play games in Virtual Reality. So we got an Oculus Rift. The first problem we encountered was the difficult setup. After days of configuration we managed to play the two simple demos. We were disappointed of the quality of the demos and expected a lot more from such a premium product. Not to mention there aren't too many games you can play in VR... and all those cables..man!</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, we were amazed by Google Cardboard and how much you can achieve with so little.</p>That’s why we went on to build our own alternative, based on Google Cardboard and other mobile headsets. It was designed to be wireless, easy to use and accessible to anyone. We don’t want people to make compromise in experience so we strive for the best performance possible.<br/>

Because different games have different requirements, we need to calibrate the software and add a 3D support for each game to be able to deliver proper out-of-this world VR experience. This is where you, guys and gals, come in. You will determine our priorities and choose which games Intugame VR to support first. Votes are included in all of our perks. The number of votes you can use depends on the perk's price. Use them to vote up your favourite game. After purchasing a perk we'll send you a special code and a form to place your vote. Titles in the top will receive VR support first. 


If we reach our initial goal, we are planning on making the 3D gaming possible on your 3D smart TV. Stay tuned for more information.





We are George and Krasi. 
George is a veteran in the mobile industry. He has been working on mobile applications when any usable SDKs and tools were hardly available. Started with the old J2ME, then Symbian. Lately mostly Android and iPhone.
Krasi handles anything that runs on a PC - from graphics rendering to data management and networking. He has a masters degree in Artificial Intelligence. His entire career he has worked on performance critical applications. We are gaming enthusiasts who want to play games in Virtual Reality. So we got an Oculus Rift. The first problem we encountered was the difficult setup. After days of configuration we managed to play the two simple demos. We were disappointed of the quality of the demos and expected a lot more from such a premium product. Not to mention there aren't too many games you can play in VR... and all those cables..man!
On the other hand, we were amazed by Google Cardboard and how much you can achieve with so little.That’s why we went on to build our own alternative, based on Google Cardboard and other mobile headsets. It was designed to be wireless, easy to use and accessible to anyone. We don’t want people to make compromise in experience so we strive for the best performance possible.
We sincerely thanks these guys for the support. We wouldn't make it without their help:",18.0,1,"1 Campaign

Hi, I am William McDonald, together with John Norman and Danielle Dorsey we are Suckerfree Games.  We started Sucker free Games in 2009.  John Norman and I found that we were both interested in creating video games.  John couldn't come up with ideas for the games and I couldn't do the programming.  So we decided to work together.  As we were developing our first game Dungeons, we decided to bring my long time writing partner Danielle Dorsey onto the team.  After the initial development of Dungeons we created a spin off project entitled, ""Kobold's Quest!""  This is our third year, working on Kobold's Quest and we just need a slight push to hit our June deadline.
 
The Impact
If we reach our funding goal our game will be launched on XBLI in late June and for the PC about three months later.  We have been funding this game with personal finances.  Additional out of pocket funding is no longer an option.  We are at a point now where the game can be completed.  But without outside funding it will take longer to release KQ, PC porting will be delayed and Win7 phone porting may not happen.    
 
What We Need & What You Get
We need funds to polish the game's menu/GUI and pay for our creator club membership to release the game on XBLI.  Anything beyond our goal will go towards porting to the WP7 phone and PC versions.
What you can get for pledging is a copy of the PC game when it is released, your name added to the credits as a contributor, a Kobold's Quest pin pack, beta access, a signed mini poster, your name prominently displayed in the credits, a signed poster, a Level / Town named after you, the opportunity to design a peasant or level for the game and be credited as a level designer. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Get the word out and make some noise about this awesome game.  If you have any contacts at Destructoid or Kotaku use them.  We need to get the word out about this game and reach our funding goal.  If you have a redit account, post about it.  Share it with your friends on Facebook.  We appreciate any help you can offer!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

FAR STARS is a sci-fi rpg shooter with a top down or 90 degree angle perspective which will be available on Android, iOS, Mac, PC and Ubuntu ( Linux ) for $ 1. You will be able to save your games on the cloud and continue playing them on any of the above mentioned platforms. Meaning that you can play FAR STARS on a smartphone, save the game on the cloud, and then pick up where you left off on your computer.
Our team is composed of 3 determined members: Cesar Villame aka Zesthar, an amazing artist from the Philippines, Samantha Foster, an adventurous soundtrack composer from the United States, and me, Hugo Barbáchano, an obsessed coder and game designer from Belgium.
The game takes place in an infinite galaxy far far away. Explore at your own risk, as it will not be a walk in the park and life is not permanent in this universe.
There are two separate gameplay modes:
Space Exploration: Fly your customized spaceship throughout open space, battling aliens while dodging asteroids and gathering hard earned loot.

Planet Exploration: Land on planets and explore on foot their vast and dangerous ecosystems battling different alien species armed with your own crafted weapons and vast mental powers while discovering ancient artifacts and again, gathering hard earned loot.
Crafting plays an important role in the game:
- Craft a personalized arsenal of badass weapons and armors.
- Upgrade and expand your ship for a stupid amount of fun.
- Permanently substitute parts of your body with bionic or crystalline implants.
Permanent death. Respawning will cost you! If you can’t pay, your character is lost forever...and ever!

WHAT WE NEED
FAR STARS will be released sooner or later. as for me it is not just another way of making money, but a dream and an obsession.
The game is already under development and we have obtained most of the necessary hardware and software.. But the main factor that will make the difference is time. And as an old proverb says, “Time is gold”.
WHAT YOU GET
Here is where you come in!. By contributing to our game, you will exponentially increase the quality and quantity of its various features including an increased number of quests, AI/enemies, ecosystems, and various other improvements that are listed below. Increased funding will allow us more freedom to focus on developing a great game with lots of cool, awesome features.

BUDGET:
$ 0  50 different enemies + 20 main quests + 4 ecosystems + space
$ 5,0 0 0 80 different enemies + 40 quests + 5 ecosystems + space + cloud saving system
$ 1 0,0 0 0 120 different enemies + 60 quests + 5 ecosystems + space + different endings + improved sound quality + deeper crafting system
$ 2 0,0 0 0  All above mentioned + MULTIPLIED BY 5 !!!
$ 4 0,0 0 0  All above mentioned +  professional voice acting + possibility of multiplayer

FAR STARS es un rpg, shooter de ciencia ficción con una perspectiva de 90 grados, que estará disponible para Andorid, iOS, Mac, PC and Ubuntu (Linux) por $ 1. Podrás salvar tus partidas en la nube y continuar jugándolas en cualquiera de las plataformas anteriormente mencionadas. Lo que significa que puedes jugar a FAR STARS en tu smartphone, salvar la partida en la nube y seguir jugando donde lo dejaste en tu ordenador.
Nuestro equipo se compone de 3 miembros: Cesar Villame aka Zesthar, un increíble artista de Filipinas, Samantha Foster, una temeraria compositora de bandas sonoras de Estados Unidos, y yo, Hugo Barbáchano, un obsesivo programador y diseñador de juegos de España, aunque estoy viviendo en Bélgica en la actualidad.
El juego se sitúa en una infinita galaxia muy muy lejana. Explórala a tu propio riesgo, ya que no va a ser un paseo por el parque y la vida no es permanente en este universo.
Hay dos modos de juego separados:
Exploración espacial: Pilota tu nave personalizada a través del espacio, combatiendo aliens mientras esquivas asteroides y recolectas tu arduamente ganada recompensa.

Exploración planetaria: Aterriza en planetas y explora a pie sus vastos y peligrosos ecosistemas combatiendo diferente especies alienígenas armado con armas creadas por ti mismo y fuertes poderes mentales mientras descubres antiguos artefactos y de nuevo, y recolectas tu arduamente ganada recompensa.
La artesanía juega un papel importante en este juego:
- Crea tu arsenal personalizado de mortíferas armas y armaduras.
- Mejora y expande tu nave para una estúpida cantidad de diversión.
- Sustituye permanentemente partes de tu cuerpo por implantes biónicos o cristalinos.
Muerte permanente. ¡Revivir te costará! ¡Y si no puedes pagar, perderás tu personaje para siempre jamás!

LO QUE NECESITAMOS
FAR STARS será publicado antes o después. Ya que para mí no es sólo otra manera de hacer dinero, sino un sueño y una obsesión.
El juego ya esta bajo desarrollo y hemos obtenido casi todo el hardware y software necesario... Pero el factor principal que marcará la diferencia es el tiempo, y como el antiguo proverbio dice, ""El tiempo es oro"".

</div><p><b>Who I Am</b>:</p>
<p>My name is Aaron.  I’m a business student and a part-time actor
(when I can get work).  I’m also an
obsessive Zelda fan.  The Zelda series is
great, but there are many times when the player thinks, ‘Well how the hell was
I supposed to know that??’  It tickles my
OCD bone to make comprehensive walkthroughs, and I’d like to share that data with
other fans.  The games become much more
fun when you know how everything’s supposed to fit together and make
sense.  That’s where I come in.  </p>
<p><b>What I'm Doing:</b></p>
<p>For fun, I did an Ocarina of Time walkthrough
with “live” commentary (recorded while I play, not added after the fact) on
YouTube.  My running commentary was often
smartass, sarcastic, and biting; but humorous and helpful nonetheless.  (See
video.)  After my Ocarina videos, I
received many requests for a Majora’s Mask walkthrough.  But why stop there?  I’d like to do a full walkthrough for each of
the 17 canon Zelda games (LoZ, AoL, ALttP, LA, OoT, MM, OoA, OoS, 4S, WW, 4SA,
MC, TP, PH, SP, SS, ALbW) on their original consoles and in the “official”
story order (split timeline).  I’m
committed to keeping ads off of my videos. 
I’m not looking to make a profit, only to help out my fellow nerds.  As such, the materials I’ve gathered so far
have set me back quite a bit.</p>
<p><b>What I Need:</b></p>
<p>A big problem I experienced with my Ocarina
walkthrough was the caliber of microphone I used.  The sound quality was pretty bad; I had to heavily
modify it digitally, which further deteriorated the quality and fidelity.  I had audible breaths on the commentary track,
which I’d have to remove manually for each of the 91 videos.  That delayed uploads for days or weeks.</p>
<p>I’ve done my research and found the ideal headset/microphone
to begin recording in January.  It’s a
Sennheiser PC 360, which runs around $400 (and then there's Indiegogo's fees and perks, etc.). 
Since I’m a poor student and unemployed actor who spends a lot of time
perfecting Zelda, I can’t really afford that. 
So I’d like to turn to my fellow fans and ask for donations to help get
me closer to the goal.</p>
<p><b>Why You Should Help:</b></p>
<p>For every $5 donated, I’ll enter donors into a
raffle to choose the name of the Hero (save file title) in Skyward Sword, the
first game I’ll upload (ideally beginning in January).  So if you donate $20 (thank you!), you’ll get
four entries to pick the name.  It can be
anything you want: your name, something offensive, something comical, or just a
bunch of random characters.</p>
<p>If you donate more than $50, you’ll get an entry
for every $5, plus a 2015 Legend of Zelda wall calendar (with pictures from
Wind Waker HD, Spirit Tracks, Skyward Sword, Ocarina of Time 3D, and A Link
between Worlds).</p>

Why support it?I started developing KeeperRL as a hobby, and released it for free. But making the game commercial will let me create something much bigger. I'd like to work on it full-time till December 2014, and deliver the core functionality that I planned for the 1.0 version (see below for details).Ideally, I'd like to work on it for much longer. I believe I can turn it into a big, complex, and very original game, if I have the support. The game will stay opensource!What's the plan?Here is what I'm planning for the 1.0 version (December 2014).

Big, persistent map (about 10 times bigger than now, area-wise), where you can build as many dungeons and play as many adventurers as you like. All the previous Keepers, if they are still alive, are now your enemies.

In-game exchange of maps through an online server. Let other players try to assault your dungeon with their army or an adventurer. Various statistics and a scoreboard of the most deadly dungeons.


Many special locations to explore. Go on quests, recruit more minions and find unique items to boost your black magic.


Much more content: special armor, weapons, items, special attacks, artifacts.


Lot's of work put into balancing and fun gameplay. Big part of this will be listening to user feedback.

<p></p></span><p>Honored is a system designed to preserve your gaming achievements across your favorite systems and consoles. We combine all your records into one archive where you can look back on your conquests, gloat about the present, and plan ahead for future games and consoles.<br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Honored also motivates you to complete the games you already own by offering meta-achievements, recognition unique to Honored for completionists who leave no stone unturned and every bad guy eviscerated.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Lastly, the best part about being among the Honored: <i>physical </i>badges!</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/151355/files/20131023194646-beta_creation.png?1382582806"" src="""" style=""width: 564.844px; height: 179px;""/></p>
<p>By earning achievements and meta-achievements, actively participating in the community, and attending gaming events around the world, you will unlock the opportunity to obtain achievement badges. These are real embroidered patches that compliment a digital counterpart displayed on your Honored profile and other social networks. The physical patches will be manufactured and sent to your home for you to sew onto jackets, pin to backpacks, collect, trade, or simply show off to friends.</p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/151348/files/20131023194223-howhonored_alpha.png?1382582543"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Once you register with Honored we will recognize the achievements you secure on Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Steam, and other gaming services. Our system will track what you earn and mirror your achievements on your Honored profile page while notifying you and your friends when you meet badge requirements.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/151391/files/20131023201430-feed_beta.jpg?1382584470"" src="""" style=""width: 566.91px; height: 520px;""/></p>
<p>For example, let’s say you and your friends just conquered Borderlands 2 on PC, every side mission finished netting you 100% completion. Still celebrating victory over Terramorphous the Invincible you log in to Honored discovering four shiny new badges available for purchase, ready to ship and heaved at your chums in exuberance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We document your brand spankin’ new achievements and award two badges associated with Borderlands 2, one for beating the game and another for hitting 100% completion.</p></li>
<li><p>A few years ago you bought and beat the first Borderlands on a console and you have the achievement record to prove it, we saved it in your profile for you. For beating both games you fulfilled the requirements for a meta-achievement and a badge to match.</p></li>
<li><p>One of your friends gifted you Poker Night at the Inventory 2 last month and you spent a day with it for a few easy achievements. One more meta-achievement is revealed called “Robot Companion Relationship Expert”: Give Claptrap a high five in Borderlands 2 and then proceeded to rob him of his Best Character Award in Poker Night 2. Claptrap put on a birthday hat when we took his picture for this badge, it’s adorable.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These example badges are not in the system, yet, but are just a few samples of the awards you can earn on Honored with new milestones added every week. Every user on Honored has access to a unique store to buy the badges they unlocked and are estimated to be $5 shipped within the continental US once the site launches. So if you decided to purchase every badge you just unlocked in the above example, it would be about $20 shipped to a continental US address.</p>
<p>Honored will also make appearances on the road. Conventions, LAN parties, and eSports events are more opportunities to pick up unique badges. Won a tournament and a random person on the internet doesn't believe you? The proof is on your profile.</p>
<p>Even if you opt not to buy in to the physical rewards and don’t travel to events, you still maintain a profile that stores your achievement history to share with your friends. Announce to Twitter your undying loyalty to Arstotzka after you obtain the token in Papers, Please. Put naysayers on your Facebook wall to rest and post the 100% completion badge for Grand Theft Auto V. Proclaim your League of Legends skill to a competitive coworker with a Platinum division patch printed and taped to their monitor.</p>

<p>The objective is to raise enough funds to launch the beta of Honored covering site development, servers, and the badges. $25,000 is the minimum amount of funding in order to launch and everyone who pitches in gets the opportunity to participate and sound out on the site as we ramp up to a public release. This way if Honored succeeds it is because your voice and generosity helped make it happen. We hope you like the idea of being rewarded for playing a video game with something extraordinary.<br/></p>

The funds being raised here on Indiegogo are being raised specifically for a successful beta launch. We anticipate on securing funding beyond Indiegogo to create a permanent platform while constructing an environment in order to dedicate ourselves as a full time business. We just need your help clearing this initial hurdle.</span><br/></p>

<p>All reward levels get this badge digitally on their Honored profile and reward levels $10 and higher collect the physical badge as well.</p>
<p>Backers at or above the $20 tier are guaranteed a beta invite the moment it becomes available. Rest assured, everyone who pitches in at any reward tier will get a beta invite before the site goes public, if not on the initial rollout then soon after.</p>
<p>The level of success on this Indiegogo determines when beta will launch based upon the number of users we will be accommodating. Hopefully, we will be able to bring the beta to you shortly after the 2013 holiday season.<br/></p>
<p>Individuals eager to power the Honored launch at $50 will be gifted with this radical t-shirt in the size of your choice, available only to Indiegogo supporters.</p>

<p>$150 nets advance membership to our monthly premium delivery service, Alpha Group.</p>
<p>Members of Alpha Group will discover monthly care packages of loot in their mailbox and inbox. Inside the boxes of loot may also hide gifts and other neat treasures from Honored and our gaming partners. Alpha Group members select up to 8 physical badges (provided you unlocked them) to be included in the monthly shipment without paying the individual cost for each badge. Members may be privy to beta invites for new games, sneak previews of new Honored features, and perks when we hold shindigs at conventions including additional high fives beyond the first.</p>
<p>When Alpha Group launches the cost is estimated to be $15 a month, but if you anticipate using the service or simply like getting cool stuff in the mail we are offering a discounted prepaid year of the service only through this campaign. Pioneers get The Honorable Package already valued at $75 plus a year of Alpha Group when the program launches, a $255 value for $150. Alpha Group memberships during this fundraiser are limited to the first 150 interested parties so don’t miss out. Alpha Group is expected to roll out around April 2014 but is unfortunately only available for shipment to US addresses at launch so please check back with us in late 2014 for news regarding Alpha Group International.</p>

<p>Ten contributors at the $1,000 level and three at the $10,000 level will be invited to visit the Honored offices, meet with the team, provide input on site features, obtain a limited badge for VIPs, and have the opportunity to create their own Honored badge. VIP badge creators can distribute their badge to friends, make it available for the entire community to earn as a meta-achievement, or be selfish and not give it to anyone.</p>
<p>The three $10,000 backers will have their travel accommodations paid for (flight must be within the continental US and includes a one night stay at a hotel) and also be invited to a private dinner with the Honored staff and several of our business advisers who just happen to be game industry icons living in the Bay Area. Talk about your game ideas, argue how certain games should have ended, or stare lovingly into the eyes of the lead developer of your favorite game who by sheer happenstance also wanted to hang out for food and drink. At some point in the day we will also take a profile picture of you and use your silhouette in the design of a future badge that is designed to be highly coveted.</p>

<p>In the event our fundraising hits the $125k mark, a celebration will be held honoring you, the Honored supporters, at a to be determined location in Boston during the weekend of PAX East 2014. Supporters of every reward level will get VIP treatment: open bar, music by the sickest nerd ballers, and the opportunity to chat with the entire Honored staff while suggesting new ideas for the site.</p>
<p>We also have a special prize for people utilizing Indiegogo’s sharing tools. We will select the individual with the most referral contributions and contact them for the creation of their own unique Honored badge, just like the VIPs, to be distributed at the whim of the referral master. In the event we also hit our $125k stretch goal, the top referrer and a friend will join us at PAX East 2014 to design your badge and party with us in person. Airfare (from anywhere in the continental US), hotel, passes, we pay for it. If you want to support Honored but can’t afford the top tier rewards, this is an amazing way to help. </p>
<p>We have further stretch goals planned but we will get around to announcing those as they get closer within reach.</p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A: Absolutely, if you live outside of the continental US and are requesting a reward from the $50 or $75 tier, just add an extra $8 to your contribution. If you are only receiving a physical badge and are outside the US, don’t worry about it, we got you covered. Remember that Alpha Group is only available for shipment within the US.

The community team will also chime in with everything that is possible based on achievement data, capabilities of the Honored system, and keeping everything PG-13.</p>

Honored also motivates you to complete the games you already own by offering meta-achievements, recognition unique to Honored for completionists who leave no stone unturned and every bad guy eviscerated.
Lastly, the best part about being among the Honored: physical badges!

By earning achievements and meta-achievements, actively participating in the community, and attending gaming events around the world, you will unlock the opportunity to obtain achievement badges. These are real embroidered patches that compliment a digital counterpart displayed on your Honored profile and other social networks. The physical patches will be manufactured and sent to your home for you to sew onto jackets, pin to backpacks, collect, trade, or simply show off to friends.

Once you register with Honored we will recognize the achievements you secure on Xbox Live, PlayStation Network, Steam, and other gaming services. Our system will track what you earn and mirror your achievements on your Honored profile page while notifying you and your friends when you meet badge requirements.

For example, let’s say you and your friends just conquered Borderlands 2 on PC, every side mission finished netting you 100% completion. Still celebrating victory over Terramorphous the Invincible you log in to Honored discovering four shiny new badges available for purchase, ready to ship and heaved at your chums in exuberance:

We document your brand spankin’ new achievements and award two badges associated with Borderlands 2, one for beating the game and another for hitting 100% completion.
A few years ago you bought and beat the first Borderlands on a console and you have the achievement record to prove it, we saved it in your profile for you. For beating both games you fulfilled the requirements for a meta-achievement and a badge to match.
One of your friends gifted you Poker Night at the Inventory 2 last month and you spent a day with it for a few easy achievements. One more meta-achievement is revealed called “Robot Companion Relationship Expert”: Give Claptrap a high five in Borderlands 2 and then proceeded to rob him of his Best Character Award in Poker Night 2. Claptrap put on a birthday hat when we took his picture for this badge, it’s adorable.

These example badges are not in the system, yet, but are just a few samples of the awards you can earn on Honored with new milestones added every week. Every user on Honored has access to a unique store to buy the badges they unlocked and are estimated to be $5 shipped within the continental US once the site launches. So if you decided to purchase every badge you just unlocked in the above example, it would be about $20 shipped to a continental US address.
Honored will also make appearances on the road. Conventions, LAN parties, and eSports events are more opportunities to pick up unique badges. Won a tournament and a random person on the internet doesn't believe you? The proof is on your profile.
Even if you opt not to buy in to the physical rewards and don’t travel to events, you still maintain a profile that stores your achievement history to share with your friends. Announce to Twitter your undying loyalty to Arstotzka after you obtain the token in Papers, Please. Put naysayers on your Facebook wall to rest and post the 100% completion badge for Grand Theft Auto V. Proclaim your League of Legends skill to a competitive coworker with a Platinum division patch printed and taped to their monitor.




The objective is to raise enough funds to launch the beta of Honored covering site development, servers, and the badges. $25,000 is the minimum amount of funding in order to launch and everyone who pitches in gets the opportunity to participate and sound out on the site as we ramp up to a public release. This way if Honored succeeds it is because your voice and generosity helped make it happen. We hope you like the idea of being rewarded for playing a video game with something extraordinary.



The Honored team is made up of people committing their own free time, money and passion towards the love for video games and the desire to see dedicated gamers rewarded with something uniquely awesome. The funds being raised here on Indiegogo are being raised specifically for a successful beta launch. We anticipate on securing funding beyond Indiegogo to create a permanent platform while constructing an environment in order to dedicate ourselves as a full time business. We just need your help clearing this initial hurdle.




Contributors assisting the Honored beta launch at every reward tier will receive the Indiegogo exclusive “Backer Badge”.













All reward levels get this badge digitally on their Honored profile and reward levels $10 and higher collect the physical badge as well.
Backers at or above the $20 tier are guaranteed a beta invite the moment it becomes available. Rest assured, everyone who pitches in at any reward tier will get a beta invite before the site goes public, if not on the initial rollout then soon after.
The level of success on this Indiegogo determines when beta will launch based upon the number of users we will be accommodating. Hopefully, we will be able to bring the beta to you shortly after the 2013 holiday season.
Individuals eager to power the Honored launch at $50 will be gifted with this radical t-shirt in the size of your choice, available only to Indiegogo supporters.

$75 is when rewards really start to get personal with The Honorable Package. We will thank you personally on Twitter with a tweet plus a follow and send you a slick poster signed by the entire Honored staff.

$150 nets advance membership to our monthly premium delivery service, Alpha Group.
Members of Alpha Group will discover monthly care packages of loot in their mailbox and inbox. Inside the boxes of loot may also hide gifts and other neat treasures from Honored and our gaming partners. Alpha Group members select up to 8 physical badges (provided you unlocked them) to be included in the monthly shipment without paying the individual cost for each badge. Members may be privy to beta invites for new games, sneak previews of new Honored features, and perks when we hold shindigs at conventions including additional high fives beyond the first.
When Alpha Group launches the cost is estimated to be $15 a month, but if you anticipate using the service or simply like getting cool stuff in the mail we are offering a discounted prepaid year of the service only through this campaign. Pioneers get The Honorable Package already valued at $75 plus a year of Alpha Group when the program launches, a $255 value for $150. Alpha Group memberships during this fundraiser are limited to the first 150 interested parties so don’t miss out. Alpha Group is expected to roll out around April 2014 but is unfortunately only available for shipment to US addresses at launch so please check back with us in late 2014 for news regarding Alpha Group International.
The highest tiers of backing is where we wander into VIP territory.





Ten contributors at the $1,000 level and three at the $10,000 level will be invited to visit the Honored offices, meet with the team, provide input on site features, obtain a limited badge for VIPs, and have the opportunity to create their own Honored badge. VIP badge creators can distribute their badge to friends, make it available for the entire community to earn as a meta-achievement, or be selfish and not give it to anyone.
The three $10,000 backers will have their travel accommodations paid for (flight must be within the continental US and includes a one night stay at a hotel) and also be invited to a private dinner with the Honored staff and several of our business advisers who just happen to be game industry icons living in the Bay Area. Talk about your game ideas, argue how certain games should have ended, or stare lovingly into the eyes of the lead developer of your favorite game who by sheer happenstance also wanted to hang out for food and drink. At some point in the day we will also take a profile picture of you and use your silhouette in the design of a future badge that is designed to be highly coveted.


In the event our fundraising hits the $125k mark, a celebration will be held honoring you, the Honored supporters, at a to be determined location in Boston during the weekend of PAX East 2014. Supporters of every reward level will get VIP treatment: open bar, music by the sickest nerd ballers, and the opportunity to chat with the entire Honored staff while suggesting new ideas for the site.
We also have a special prize for people utilizing Indiegogo’s sharing tools. We will select the individual with the most referral contributions and contact them for the creation of their own unique Honored badge, just like the VIPs, to be distributed at the whim of the referral master. In the event we also hit our $125k stretch goal, the top referrer and a friend will join us at PAX East 2014 to design your badge and party with us in person. Airfare (from anywhere in the continental US), hotel, passes, we pay for it. If you want to support Honored but can’t afford the top tier rewards, this is an amazing way to help. 
We have further stretch goals planned but we will get around to announcing those as they get closer within reach.

We appreciate your time in visiting our page and learning about our vision. Any contribution is more than welcome, even if it is only telling a friend to check out our page. Most importantly, SHARE! We are relying on people like you to help get the word out, and tell you friends! We will be making updates weekly during the fundraising process with new videos, pictures of our rewards being manufactured, additions to the stretch goals, partnership announcements, FAQs, and pictures.

Q: Do you ship internationally?
A: Absolutely, if you live outside of the continental US and are requesting a reward from the $50 or $75 tier, just add an extra $8 to your contribution. If you are only receiving a physical badge and are outside the US, don’t worry about it, we got you covered. Remember that Alpha Group is only available for shipment within the US. Check back with us late 2014 for when we start gearing up for Alpha Group International.

Q: What is the design process like for the VIP badge creation?
A: You will be working one-on-one with our lead designer on the actual badge, molding your vision into something that makes you happy and ensuring everything is kosher with our badge manufacturer. The community team will also chime in with everything that is possible based on achievement data, capabilities of the Honored system, and keeping everything PG-13.

Q: I am a game developer, publisher or other video game industry company or personality. Can we talk partnership options and unique badges for my fans?
A: Sure! Email us at partners@gethonored.com.

Q: Do I have to pay to get into the beta?
A: Not at all, just go to http://gethonored.com leave us your email, and we will keep you posted. Provided, people who back us will get into the beta before we send out invites to the general public so keep that in mind.

Q: Why Indiegogo?
A: Of all the crowdfunding platforms out there, Indiegogo's features and support compliment our business plan best. They are the perfect partner for allowing us to deliver a quality closed beta for our user base as quickly as we hope to.

Q: Why do Flexible Funding and not Fixed?
A: Given our timelines and current strategy we want to limit the number of middlemen so we may finish our product in a timely manner. We chose the option allowing us to work directly with Indiegogo rather than third parties, which fixed funding requires.

</p>
<p>Rob Bernard has been a Class A golf professional for 17 years, and is a member of the Canadian National Coaching Staff, working with some of Canada's top professionals as well as the best Junior players in Eastern Canada. Rob's mission is to lower golf scores worldwide, and he's dedicated the last 7 years of his life to developing, testing and simplifying the Center of Gravity Golf system and end-to-end golf curriculum. Rob has worked to simplify the basic principles of the sport so that anyone can understand and go out and play a great round of golf. He's personally taught over 100,000 golfers while touring 38 countries on-tour with his system, and his YouTube video on driving the ball without slicing has racked up over 1 million views, and 500+ glowing testimonial comments, making it one of the most watched golf training videos of all time.

<p style=""color: #FA4C06; font-size: 18px; line-height: 25px; margin-top: 35px;"">Is this an “investment,” in the classical sense, where I see a return on my investment?</p>
<p>The investment you make is in your own golf game. Your support, in the form of a pre-order doesn't give you a financial return, but it does do two very important things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It gives you a lifetime return in playing better golf and loving this game, and</li>
<li>It enables us to build a the best quality video series, and get the word out to as many people as possible.</li>

It's human nature to seek out silver-bullet solutions to difficult problems. We've always been told that the game of golf is hard, and therefore there is always a market for the latest gadgets, and an endless appetite for quick tips and techniques. But mastering golf is not hard at all, it's extremely simple once you understand the basics of motion and swing sequencing. Stepping onto the golf course with knowledge and understanding of what works, and how to apply that knowledge leads to incredible confidence and satisfaction.

Center of Gravity Golf is about giving you knowledge that you can take on the course, and find repeatable, consistent success that will build to mastery. It is about understanding truths, not tips - and understanding comes from knowledge of the fundamentals, something that until now, our industry has never provided. Center of Gravity Golf is the only system that starts with the most basic fundamentals of the sport, explained in language and images that anyone can understand and apply on the golf course, and takes you from tee to putting green, giving you the practical tools you need to find success and reignite your passion for the game.
Golf is my passion, and it's my life’s work. This campaign is not about selling golf videos, it’s truly about changing the game of golf for everyone. We are on a mission to change the face of golf.
Center of Gravity Golf is about improving the experience of golfers world-wide. It is about growing the sport, and love for the sport. It’s about enabling people like you to truly experience the passion and satisfaction that comes from playing this game to the very best of your ability. 
Here’s a testimonial from the Executive Director of the PGA of Ontario:
Who is Rob Bernard, and why should I believe in his system?

Rob Bernard has been a Class A golf professional for 17 years, and is a member of the Canadian National Coaching Staff, working with some of Canada's top professionals as well as the best Junior players in Eastern Canada. Rob's mission is to lower golf scores worldwide, and he's dedicated the last 7 years of his life to developing, testing and simplifying the Center of Gravity Golf system and end-to-end golf curriculum. Rob has worked to simplify the basic principles of the sport so that anyone can understand and go out and play a great round of golf. He's personally taught over 100,000 golfers while touring 38 countries on-tour with his system, and his YouTube video on driving the ball without slicing has racked up over 1 million views, and 500+ glowing testimonial comments, making it one of the most watched golf training videos of all time. (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnopJFvTa3Q). 
How is this different than every other golf training system?
Center of Gravity Golf is a process, not piecemeal tips, and once the process is learned, you forever gain a level of understanding that let's you play confidently and comfortably. Each part of the process leads you to the next set of competencies, so you are always improving your play and your understanding. It's a profound understanding- simplified and made fun to learn and practice.
Why do you need my support and contribution?
Your support, in the form pre-ordering our product, helps us to produce the highest quality materials, and a best of breed video series that will help you feel immersed, and that you will love to learn from.
Is this an “investment,” in the classical sense, where I see a return on my investment?
The investment you make is in your own golf game. Your support, in the form of a pre-order doesn't give you a financial return, but it does do two very important things:

It gives you a lifetime return in playing better golf and loving this game, and
It enables us to build a the best quality video series, and get the word out to as many people as possible.

What if it doesn’t work for me?
This system works for EVERYONE; it never fails and it never will, because the system is based on simple physics and geometry (but made simple!). The system works for young and old, and even people with physical limitations have been able to learn and enjoy golf through this system. 
Nevertheless....if you are the first person that doesn't dramatically improve, I will happily refund all of your investment...you have nothing to lose...but strokes.
Starter Packs ($15 & $50): These levels are designed for supporters who would like to dip in their toes with the system.

Pre-Order the Full Series ($80 to $99): These levels are for people who want to support us at a higher level and pre-purchase the full system at a reduced price. We will be releasing the chapters to our supporters as they are completed.
Personalized Training ($995 & $3,000): These levels are for people or businesses looking to have a corporate team-building, or client day on the range. If you'd like more details or want something special added to the level, please send an email to Kurt: kurt@huckleberryfilmstudios.com.
Sponsorship ($10,000 & $25,000): These levels are designed for companies looking to jump on a great opportunity and sponsor Center of Gravity Golf for one year. If you would like to know more about what you will receive at each level or would like to put together a custom sponsorship package, please send an email to Kurt: kurt@huckleberryfilmstudios.com.
Beyond your financial pledge, PLEASE share this campaign by cutting and pasting the Indiegogo linkto your Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus accounts. 
 The average golf score has not moved down in decades- let's create a revolution in this beautiful sport by helping golfers everywhere get their swing in gear, and enjoy a whole new level of play!

<p>        Peakway Software LLC is a small independent game studio located in North Carolina. We love computer role playing games and playing with friends so we wanted to make a game that combined both of those.

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Game Design &amp; Features</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>MULTIPLAYER</p>
<p>        We've always wanted to experience this style of RPG with a few friends. With that in mind, Isles of Adalar will support up to four player co-op on release. However, we know multiplayer isn't for everyone so we will manually scale the difficulty of every encounter to keep the integrity of the single player game design.</p>
<p>MOD SUPPORT</p>
<p>        Our vision is for Isles of Adalar to become known over time as a nearly endless RPG experience rich with narrative driven content. With this in mind we've designed our game to support mods and user generated content from the very beginning. Everything that exists in game is created using the same level editor that ships inside the game, so the modders have access to all the tools we use ourselves to create campaigns.</p>
<p>        Just shipping tools for modding is not enough to realize our vision. We are going to be actively working to build up a creative community around our game. This starts with making tools as user friendly and efficient to use as possible so that small teams of only a handful of people can make large scale campaigns. But in addition to the tools we will also be giving players extra content that is not used in the base game so that their campaigns can feel unique. This will range from environmental biomes, to different styles of architecture and even new enemies.</p>
<p>ROLE PLAYING AND REPLAYABILITY </p>
<p>        Choice and consequence is at the core of our dialogue system. We use a hybrid (mostly) text based system that features non specific voice lines for NPCs. This allows us to have in depth dialogue with the characters in the world but also gives the player necessary feedback to reflect the NPC's general attitude and response to the player. For example, you may try to intimidate a bandit and if you fail the speech check you may get a voiced response saying something like ""I won't stand for this!"" but the text can be more in depth and context specific.</p>
<p>        Instead of using a speech skill to determine dialogue choices and persuasion success, the player can assign multiple personality traits to their character and these traits will give unique responses. The success or failure of a persuasion attempt is determined by both the player character's level and if a specific type of persuasion logically makes sense in the context of the situation.</p>

 Games only requires a $99/year Creators Club membership and Microsoft

developers can also use homebrew development libraries, which are free

Multiplayer: 2+ player coop and VS Challenger ladder system <br/><br/>
Amount of playable Characters: 7 <br/><br/>
Number of class: 29; Novice, 1st tier: 7, 2nd tier 21( plus dual classing 2nd tier) <br/><br/>
Does my Characters Sprite have to be any certain class or build: No, 7 
is built around personal freedom when it comes to classes, skills, 
stats, equipment. If you want 7 Pillager Priest then go for it.<br/><br/>
Classes: look at the pictures uploaded. <br/><br/>
Is the game linear: No, free roam and the choice in doing any quest. <br/><br/>
What will my Character look like: That depends solely on your equipment,
 your class selection does not determine what you look like. <br/><br/>
Will there be a way to modify my equipment look: Yes, there will be 
multiple colors schemes for each armor piece as well as having the 
ability to upload your own sprites later on. <br/><br/>
How many hours in gameplay is there: 86+ hours of just combat, that is not counting questing, crafting, travel, misc time. The hours calculated were done by a (random number between the highest 
and lowest amount of randomly generated battles+ triggered battles) *5 
mins per battle. considering 30% will be 2-3 min battles+50 % 4-6 min 
battles+20% 6+ mins battles.Now the world size in relation to your characters, 1 region will take 
roughly 4-5 mins to walk across with no enemy encounters or stopping, 
and there are 49 different regions. The map of the world has been drawn 
up since day 1 and I will include it in the post following this one. <br/><br/>
Crafting: Yes, you will be able to craft equipment from smelting down 
other equipment, broken and not broken, as well as potions, foods, 
bombs, and etc through certain classes and npcs. <span> With over 21 weapons and 9 different armors over 3 different 
styles( with possible more styles), crafting and customization of each characters gear will be roughly limitless.  <br/><br/></span></p><p><span>*Pendent, Chest, Boots, Shoulder, 
Leggings, Helm, Gloves, Arm Guard, and Belt can have these perks and 
their values: Character points(Strength, Agility, Dexterity, vitality, 
Intelligence, and Luck), Defense ,Magic Defense, Health and Mana. <br/><br/>
Rings: Hit rate, Magic attack, Physical attack, Defense, Magic Defense, Health and Mana. <br/><br/>
Shield: Defense or Magic Defense<br/><br/>
1 handed: sword, mace, hammer, katar, pistol, dagger, orb, wand, and 
baton ; and 2 handed: sword, mace, hammer, spear, bow, crossbow, steam 
rifle, tome, staff, power bow--Perks are: Attack, Magic attack, Defense,
 Magic defense, Element(Fire, Water	,Earth, Wind, Aether, Light, or 
Dark), Range increase, life leech, Mana leech, Crit damage, Def bypass, 
Mdef bypass, Health, Mana, Crit rate, Break Weapon, Break Armor, or Crit
 Protection</span><br/><br/>
What if I do not like an item's perks: There are npcs and classes that can modify items to make them ""reroll"" their perks. <br/><br/>
So why worry about the time it takes to liberate a region in 7: The way 
the region system works is that the occupied forces will take back 
liberated regions if you take too long. <br/><br/>
What's the overall cost look out going to be: $20 at the end, you can pick it up cheaper if you help the kickstarter. <br/><br/><br/>
The Game ""7"" takes place in the world of Simaril, where magic is used 
daily with the very beginnings of steam machines coming into play. The 
realm is made up of 7 kingdoms, each with 7 regions that need to be 
liberated from the religious usurpers of the throne. <br/></p><p>The player is giving 7 characters to take a realm back from the leaders 
of a religious coup. Each character is a blank slate that the user gets 
to micro manage the character's 6 different stats, the 21(possible up to
 42) different classes with dual classing available, skills and 
equipment. There is only 1 restriction on equipment, which is weight. <br/></p><p>As the player is battling their way through the kingdoms, they must pay 
attention to the amount of time it takes. If the user takes too long to 
take the regions, the regions will start to reoccupy the liberated 
regions. To clear a kingdom, one must take the castle but beware not to 
push straight towards it as the castle will be guarded by additional 
forces equal to the occupied regions in the kingdom. <br/></p><p>The player will also face forces of the 7 elements; Earth, Fire, Wind, 
Water, Aether, Light, and Dark. And battle 200 completely different 
enemies and 20 Bosses. <br/></p><p>This game will be 16 bit and is a turn based game, the sprite you see is
 an example of what we are looking to have for the game(with a head 
included of course). There is a planned co-op mode for up to 7 people, 
vs-mode, map editor, and a end user sprite importer. <br/></p><p>The sprite importer
 system gives the end user the ability to change the sprite look of 
character armor and weapons, with the possibility for enemy forces as 
well. We will also be offering up a sprite service for folks that are 
not very good at making sprites. <br/></p><p>
When all said and done this title will be up on steam for PC, Mac and 
Linux as well as be available for Xbox, PS3/4, Wii-u, iPhone, and 
Android. So you can pull your game and play anywhere with anyone. </p><p>Lastly, If the project is fully funded, the perks will be delivered when the game is complete. <br/></p><p>If you have any questions email me at right.idea.gaming@gmail.com for an answer to your questions. Thanks for reading and I hope for your support!<br/><br/></p><p></p></div>","My name is Brandon Mott, I am the creator and game development lead

developer fees and profit cuts, although development for Xbox Live Indie
 Games only requires a $99/year Creators Club membership and Microsoft 
takes 30% of sales. Microsoft does provide a free membership to the 
Creators Club to students via the DreamSpark program. Indie game 
developers can also use homebrew development libraries, which are free 
of charge, and usually open source.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent...velopment)  If we don't reach the needed funds then this game will most likely never happen, because I can not support the cost of an art team on my current earningsA Summary of the game details.Genre: RPG, Strategy, Turn-based, old school 16 bit graphics
Multiplayer: 2+ player coop and VS Challenger ladder system 
Amount of playable Characters: 7 
Number of class: 29; Novice, 1st tier: 7, 2nd tier 21( plus dual classing 2nd tier) 
Does my Characters Sprite have to be any certain class or build: No, 7 
is built around personal freedom when it comes to classes, skills, 
stats, equipment. If you want 7 Pillager Priest then go for it.
Classes: look at the pictures uploaded. 
Is the game linear: No, free roam and the choice in doing any quest. 
What will my Character look like: That depends solely on your equipment,
 your class selection does not determine what you look like. 
Will there be a way to modify my equipment look: Yes, there will be 
multiple colors schemes for each armor piece as well as having the 
ability to upload your own sprites later on. 
How many hours in gameplay is there: 86+ hours of just combat, that is not counting questing, crafting, travel, misc time. The hours calculated were done by a (random number between the highest 
and lowest amount of randomly generated battles+ triggered battles) *5 
mins per battle. considering 30% will be 2-3 min battles+50 % 4-6 min 
battles+20% 6+ mins battles.Now the world size in relation to your characters, 1 region will take 
roughly 4-5 mins to walk across with no enemy encounters or stopping, 
and there are 49 different regions. The map of the world has been drawn 
up since day 1 and I will include it in the post following this one. 
Crafting: Yes, you will be able to craft equipment from smelting down 
other equipment, broken and not broken, as well as potions, foods, 
bombs, and etc through certain classes and npcs.  With over 21 weapons and 9 different armors over 3 different 
styles( with possible more styles), crafting and customization of each characters gear will be roughly limitless.  *Pendent, Chest, Boots, Shoulder, 
Leggings, Helm, Gloves, Arm Guard, and Belt can have these perks and 
their values: Character points(Strength, Agility, Dexterity, vitality, 
Intelligence, and Luck), Defense ,Magic Defense, Health and Mana. 
Rings: Hit rate, Magic attack, Physical attack, Defense, Magic Defense, Health and Mana. 
Shield: Defense or Magic Defense
1 handed: sword, mace, hammer, katar, pistol, dagger, orb, wand, and 
baton ; and 2 handed: sword, mace, hammer, spear, bow, crossbow, steam 
rifle, tome, staff, power bow--Perks are: Attack, Magic attack, Defense,
 Magic defense, Element(Fire, Water	,Earth, Wind, Aether, Light, or 
Dark), Range increase, life leech, Mana leech, Crit damage, Def bypass, 
Mdef bypass, Health, Mana, Crit rate, Break Weapon, Break Armor, or Crit
 Protection
What if I do not like an item's perks: There are npcs and classes that can modify items to make them ""reroll"" their perks. 
So why worry about the time it takes to liberate a region in 7: The way 
the region system works is that the occupied forces will take back 
liberated regions if you take too long. 
What's the overall cost look out going to be: $20 at the end, you can pick it up cheaper if you help the kickstarter. 
The Game ""7"" takes place in the world of Simaril, where magic is used 
daily with the very beginnings of steam machines coming into play. The 
realm is made up of 7 kingdoms, each with 7 regions that need to be 
liberated from the religious usurpers of the throne. The player is giving 7 characters to take a realm back from the leaders 
of a religious coup. Each character is a blank slate that the user gets 
to micro manage the character's 6 different stats, the 21(possible up to
 42) different classes with dual classing available, skills and 
equipment. There is only 1 restriction on equipment, which is weight. As the player is battling their way through the kingdoms, they must pay 
attention to the amount of time it takes. If the user takes too long to 
take the regions, the regions will start to reoccupy the liberated 
regions. To clear a kingdom, one must take the castle but beware not to 
push straight towards it as the castle will be guarded by additional 
forces equal to the occupied regions in the kingdom. The player will also face forces of the 7 elements; Earth, Fire, Wind, 
Water, Aether, Light, and Dark. And battle 200 completely different 
enemies and 20 Bosses. This game will be 16 bit and is a turn based game, the sprite you see is
 an example of what we are looking to have for the game(with a head 
included of course). There is a planned co-op mode for up to 7 people, 
vs-mode, map editor, and a end user sprite importer. The sprite importer
 system gives the end user the ability to change the sprite look of 
character armor and weapons, with the possibility for enemy forces as 
well. We will also be offering up a sprite service for folks that are 
not very good at making sprites. 
When all said and done this title will be up on steam for PC, Mac and 
Linux as well as be available for Xbox, PS3/4, Wii-u, iPhone, and 
Android. So you can pull your game and play anywhere with anyone. Lastly, If the project is fully funded, the perks will be delivered when the game is complete. If you have any questions email me at right.idea.gaming@gmail.com for an answer to your questions. Thanks for reading and I hope for your support!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Why the small goal?</h3> <p></p>Maze is a First Person Adventure Puzzle game in which you solve mazes by finding your way through them while collecting coins, and dodging enemies and traps. This game is a relatively large title, especially for the low price point. It has a lengthy single player story mode, with a total of 29 levels(mazes), 4 different worlds, and 1 tutorial level. Also besides single player, there is a splitscreen multiplayer battle mode that has 3 different maps. There is also an arcade mode, in which you collect as many coins as possible and save your highscores! There are hours upon hours of content for such a low price point title, so here is the reason explaining the low funding goal. This game has been in development for months. During this time, I have self funded the project. That being said, most of the development has already been paid for! Another reason the goal is low is because we had a previous funding campaign for this game on IndieGoGo, however this campaign was unsuccessful, only giving us a small amount of money to add to development time. <p></p> </div><div>
<p>*This game and it's elements are created originally and solely by Eli, not the entire TreeFall team. </p>
<p>*This is game is planned to release in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, and possibly the PEGI regions of Europe.(If funding does not exceed 3,000 then Europe will be excluded) If you do not live in one of these intended regions, it is probably safer not to donate to get a copy of the game, as it may never make it into your region.</p>
<p>*All physical rewards are only shipped to areas within the United States, if you live outside of this area, please do not select a physical reward, as you will not receive it, thank you.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Development Progress</h3> <p></p>These videos are my story. Each commentary video shows new progress as it is happening in development! If you are new to the series, or if you have never seen Maze before, if you start at commentary 1, you will need to watch all of the series to get a good look at what the game currently is, as Commentary Video 1, was at the very beginning of development and it has come a long way since then! If you are anxious to see newer stuff, start about half way through the series, maybe part 3 or 4 and watch on from there! I hope you enjoy taking this journey with me!</div><div>

</div> <div> <h3>Story</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Here is a brief look at the back-story surrounding the game:</p>
<ul>In the year 2050, humans have become massively lazy as they have become so dependent on technology. Different races of robots have taken the main position in leading the world. The robots do not see the point of human existence, as there contribution to their way of life is so minimal. A few humans have been selected for a training program. The program is called codename: Maze. The robots have created a series of levels that range in difficulty and challenges in order to decide whether or not humans still have the intelligence and ability to complete these puzzles. If a human can make it through all of the mazes in the program, they will spare the human race and all will be well. If no human can pass the test, their existence will come into question.</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Where your money is going!</h3> <p></p>

</ul><h3>Multiplayer</h3><div>There is a multiplayer battle mode in Maze! It is a two-player splitscreen mode! Each player will have a Maze to solve, identical to the other player. The player that collects all the coins and makes it to the finish without dying first, wins the match! There will be items and other things that will cause the matches to become a battle, and more difficult for more fun replay value! :D </div><h3>Arcade Mode</h3><div>This mode is only unlocked after the single player adventure has been beaten! In this mode, there will be a time limit, and players will go through a large maze collecting as many coins as possible within the time limit!

<h3>Stealing Cthulhu</h3>
<p>Stealing Cthulhu is my guide to Lovecraftian storytelling for roleplaying games. Its central idea is: by stealing, adapting and combining Lovecraft's ideas, you can create scenarios that seem new and horrific. It includes Cthulhu Dark, my rules-light system for Cthulhu gaming. Many thanks to everyone who contributed.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The book is 175 pages and 30,000 words long (6 by 9 inches), with original art by Jennifer Rodgers. It is annotated throughout by Kenneth Hite, Gareth Hanrahan and Jason Morningstar. It's designed for use with any roleplaying system: Call of Cthulhu, Trail of Cthulhu, Nemesis, Cthulhu Dark or whatever you enjoy playing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first part of the book breaks down Lovecraft's stories, giving you ideas and storytelling structures to use in scenarios. The second part goes through a selection of Mythos creatures, considering what they can do for your games.</p>

If you contribute $150 or more, you can write your own footnotes and annotations, which I'll put in the book. I'll send you a preview PDF so you can do this. These should be scenario ideas, historical references or references to other interesting material. I'll work with you so that we get footnotes and annotations that work with the style of the book.
 
No advertisements, please, although references to published scenarios are fine. (For example, if you publish Cthulhu scenarios, then you can add references to those scenarios in appropriate places.)
 
Personal annotations
If you contribute $300, you get all kinds of good stuff. Best of all, I'll personally annotate your book for you. This means I can say things I wouldn't say in the published version: ""This is the best tip in the book"", ""If you're ggoing to break one rule, break this one"", ""If I did a Shub-Niggurath adventure, this is how I'd do it"". If there's something special you'd like me to write, tell me.
 
I'll also list your name as a patron. And I'll run a game for you at some point. If you like, you can name a Lovecraftian creature and I'll run a game about that creature.
 
 
 
 
If you're writing in the book...
If you take one of the perks that involves writing in the book, including the dedication, please don't suggest anything blatantly commerical or obscene. I'm sure you knew that anyway. But, if someone asks me to dedicate the book to Ronald McDonald, I will politely say no.
 
With all these write-in-the-book perks, we'll work together to get something that fits with the style of the book.
 
 
Playing Characters
Because the fundraiser reached $10000, everyone will get Playing Characters, a PDF about playing characters in roleplaying games. Also, you'll get a postcard of the cover artwork. Thanks very much for your support.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</p><p>X-Tactics is at its heart a game of <b>turn-based tactics</b>, but with dynamics focused on investigating missions and battles in <b>treacherous close-quarters combat</b>, as you might find in an urban setting.</p><p>Your agents won’t be able to take ridiculous amounts of damage to the face, and you will need to  <b>keep on the move</b> and play by taking <b>calculated risks </b>to achieve victory rapidly before things get out of control.</p><p>A typical missions consists of a strategic map, followed by a series of tactical skirmishes.</p><p><br/></p><h3>STRATEGIC PHASE</h3>

Like <i>Valkyria Chronicles</i> each mission has a ""strategic phase"" where you spend command points to decide on the overall strategy and order in which to send your agents to investigate and neutralise the dangers in the mission. <p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p>
</p><h3>SKIRMISH PHASE</h3><p>After you have decided on which agents to send to handle which areas, those areas that involve combat transition to the ""skirmish mode""<b>.</b> This mode is a turn-based tactical experience more in line with <i>Final Fantasy Tactics</i>.</p><p><br/></p><h4>The Battle Field<span><br/></span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Because we are focused on close-quarter tactics battle fields tend to smaller than your typical tactical game, but we do this to reduce the initial setup phase, and instead </span><b style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">focus on mechanics that require you to keep your agents on the move</b><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">.</span>
</h4><p>Some features that keep things spiced up include:<br/></p><p></p><p></p><ul>
<li>flanking to reduce enemy defences</li>
<li>characters have support and affinity bonuses required to use skills</li>
<li>destructible furnishings</li>
<li>special bonus areas and traps!</li>
</ul><p><br/></p><h4>Enemy Waves<span><br/></span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">In spirit of our goal to keep a fast paced tactical experience, many skirmishes, consist of </span><b style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">waves of enemies</b><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">, where new waves start after a determined initiative time, so if you are not fast in </span><b style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">clearing</b><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""> your current enemies, you're likely to be overwhelmed by more than you can chew!</span>

</h4><p>Also by fine controlling your initiative queue expert players can unleash devastating <b>dual and team combos.</b></p><p>Here is an explanation from a friend that might be easier to understand:</p><blockquote>""I will translate that to the American readers: shit’s going to battle like DnD. Initiative will be based on speed and turn order will be thereby determined."" - <a href=""http://crotchetyoldgamer.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Crotchety Old Gamer</a>

<b>FAQ</b><br/>
</h1><p><b>Q: Is this a micro transactions based game?</b><span><br/></span><b>A:</b> <b>Not really. </b>We don't want to have micro transactions like those of many mobile games these days. For example we won’t be selling keys to unlock treasure chests you find exploring the city, or anything like that.</p><p></p><p></p><p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Will this be a Japanese Card Battle/Puzzle game?</b><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: No.</b> This is not a card battle or puzzle game. We founded GAMKIN together to take on more exciting challenges.<br/></p><p><b>Q: Will there be in-app purchases?</b><span><br/></span><b>A:</b> <b>Probably.</b> Our goal is to make X-Tactics a live game and grow it together with our community, we want to evolve the game constantly. It is likely there will be some form of in-app purchases for early access to certain content. We are still working out this part of the business model. As developers and gamers, we want to do this in a way that <b>everyone can have fun playing, and allow us keep on evolving the game</b> and adding new content and mechanics.</p><p><b>Q: What about handheld?<span><br/></span>A:</b> We'll be adding a free digital download together with the ""Urban Explorer"" tiers ($20~25) and up, and signed physical copies with at a new $50 +plus shipping tier, that includes all the benefits of current ""Urban Investigator"" ($50). If the stretch goal is met we'll ask all our current Urban Investigator supporters if they want to participate in the new tier, so you don't have to worry.</p><p><b>Q: What languages will you support?</b><br/><b>A:</b> <b>Currently we have Japanese and English underway.</b> French and Spanish targeted shortly after release. We hope to support other languages, but it might take some more time for that.<br/></p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Q: Will the characters be animated?<span><br/></span></b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A:</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Yes</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, the characters will be animated. However animation is costly so we are using portrait images as placeholders during development to test systems and gameplay. We expect to cover the animation costs with the funds from this campaign.  However this is a tactical game, so it is not like we will have incredible animated assets like Dragon's Crown, but are aiming for animated look that keeps in line with our art style.</span></p><p></p><p><b>Q: How will the PC version use GPS data?</b><span><br/></span><b>A: It will not. </b>Our plan is that the PC version will have access to episodic content and multiplayer features. The idea is that the PC version will have let you play more complex missions that would be unsuitable for short burst of mobile play. But you can sync your play data between platforms.</p><p><b>Q: Will I need a Mobile device if I want to play on the PC version?</b><span><br/></span><b>A:</b> <b>No, but we highly recommend it.</b> It will be perfectly possible to play the PC version without a mobile device, but you will be missing out on part of the fun! </p><p></p><p><b>Q: Will I need a PC to play the Mobile version?</b><span><br/></span><b>A: No, but we highly recommend it.</b> It will be perfectly possible to play the Mobile version without a PC, but you will be missing out on part of the fun! </p><p><b>Q: Will there be an Ouya, Amazon Fire TV, PS4, Xbox One, Wii U version?</b><span><br/></span><b>A:</b> <b>Maybe.</b> At this moment we already have quite ambitious goals, so we don’t want to promise anything at this time, even with stretch goals, but if things go well, we will be porting the PC version over to these consoles as time and resources allow.</p><p><b>Q: Who is the Associate Producer?</b><span><br/></span><span><b>A: A friend &amp; supporter. </b>We have been very fortunate to have received some extraordinary funding from a very successful business person of the industry here in Japan. This person has been very generous, and is very interested in our success and technology, but this person is not affiliated with our studio in any way.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><h3><b>Our contact info:</b></h3><b>Website</b>:  <a href=""http://gamkin.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://gamkin.com<br/></a><b>Address</b>: Cerulean Tower 15F, 26-1 Sakuragaoka-cho, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 150-8512, Japan<br/><p></p><p><span></span></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/792789/files/20140816180331-Screen_Shot_2014-08-07_at_9.27.24_PM.png?1408237411"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

We're GAMKINGAMKIN, is an Indie studio formed by Square-Enix, Capcom and SEGA veterans, as well as talented young creators. Established at the end of 2013, and dedicated to creating new forms of entertainment by combining their game development expertise with other media. Besides working on games, GAMKIN also works on interactive children's television in Japan, and collaborating with local game schools and text publishers to help bring up a next generation of game developers.

X-Tactics takes place in a world, similar to our own, but one where top-secret government agencies and secret societies, maintain the peace and world order by manipulating the truth, news and many historical events.X-Tactics puts you the player in the role of the head of one of these secret agencies, and at the command of a ragtag cast of secret agents, adventurers and treasure hunters, that risk their lives trying to keep the truth from leaking.Wrapped in dark humour and a stylish anime punk art style, X-Tactics brings a new twist to modern conspiracy theories and urban legends.""The Truth is dangerous, we can’t let it destroy the peace""-Adam White, Secret AgentX-Tactics differs greatly from other tactical games in that there are not armies, generic characters, or job systems, instead we decided to go with fighting game aesthetics and have designed a unique roster of characters, each with their own unique skills and play styles, while still giving you the freedom to customise character skill growth to match your strategies and preferred play style. 
We want you to think about what each
character brings to the table at an individual level, as you would if you we’re
sending highly trained special agents out to fulfill dangerous missions.
Your AgentsTo give you an idea of what some of the initial secret agents have for skills we here list a few for each, although they can learn new skills by completing character based side-quests.*abilities listed here are tentative and might change before release.And more to come!
Some other character that are at different stages of development include, Werewolf, Voodoo Doctor with Zombies, Digital Genie, Deep One, Cyborg, among others. Additional characters like these will join you in future episodes after release.           Special GuestsWe thankfully we have many of friends in the games industry here, and some members of our team have also worked in the animation industry so we are arranging at this time for some very special guest characters from other games and anime to cross over into the X-Tactics universe and perhaps if your capable enough even recruit them into your team!Design Goals

When we set out to make X-Tactics we didn’t want to make just another tactical game, nor attempt to create some sort of spiritual successor.Our goal as developers here at Gamkin is to create something new. However we have combined tactical gameplay from classics like that of Final Fantasy Tactics and Valkyrie Chronicles, together with new mechanics and aesthetics inspired by fighting game, like Street Fighter, to create a new gameplay experience, that we at least have not seen done before.Mobile Experience vs PC & Handhelds ExperienceThe PC and Handheld versions will have extended maps and allow more characters per mission. Internally we think of the the PC version akin to chess, and the mobile version akin to a smaller fast paced speed-chess. Because of this we aren't doing a simultaneous release, because the PC/Handheld version is not a port and requires quite a bit of development. But you will be able to sync your play data between devices and platforms.Core Gameplay Mechanics
X-Tactics is at its heart a game of turn-based tactics, but with dynamics focused on investigating missions and battles in treacherous close-quarters combat, as you might find in an urban setting.Your agents won’t be able to take ridiculous amounts of damage to the face, and you will need to  keep on the move and play by taking calculated risks to achieve victory rapidly before things get out of control.A typical missions consists of a strategic map, followed by a series of tactical skirmishes.STRATEGIC PHASE

Like Valkyria Chronicles each mission has a ""strategic phase"" where you spend command points to decide on the overall strategy and order in which to send your agents to investigate and neutralise the dangers in the mission. 
SKIRMISH PHASEAfter you have decided on which agents to send to handle which areas, those areas that involve combat transition to the ""skirmish mode"". This mode is a turn-based tactical experience more in line with Final Fantasy Tactics.The Battle FieldBecause we are focused on close-quarter tactics battle fields tend to smaller than your typical tactical game, but we do this to reduce the initial setup phase, and instead focus on mechanics that require you to keep your agents on the move.
Some features that keep things spiced up include:
flanking to reduce enemy defences
characters have support and affinity bonuses required to use skills
destructible furnishings
special bonus areas and traps!
Enemy WavesIn spirit of our goal to keep a fast paced tactical experience, many skirmishes, consist of waves of enemies, where new waves start after a determined initiative time, so if you are not fast in clearing your current enemies, you're likely to be overwhelmed by more than you can chew!
Initiative SystemX-tactics uses an Initiative based system similar to that of Final Fantasy Tactics, where each character is lined up based on their speed, and where really fast characters might even take turns twice as fast than slower characters.
Also by fine controlling your initiative queue expert players can unleash devastating dual and team combos.Here is an explanation from a friend that might be easier to understand:""I will translate that to the American readers: shit’s going to battle like DnD. Initiative will be based on speed and turn order will be thereby determined."" - The Crotchety Old Gamer
Team Rage GaugeYour team has a “rage gauge"" that accumulates based on how good your attacks are, and how much damage you have taken, similar to those of Fighting Games. This gauge when full can then be used to unleash special super attacks.
Health and DefenseThere are no healer characters, and there are no healing potions so to speak of. Instead characters have a health meters that works like those of fighting games.
Fighting game style health meter with temporary and permanent damage
Reflex-based block and counter attack gameplay
Enemies can also counter attack, but you can counter block
Complete missions without taking damage (PERFECT) if your really good

The health and defense system raises stakes and constantly shifts battle’s flow between risky frontal attacks to neutralize the enemy before reinforcements arrive, and trying to take cover and protect the wounded so they don't fall in battle.In a nutshell this means you can't just send tank characters to the front and keep them alive with healers as support, no slugfests allowed.4 PLAYER COOPPlay with up to 4 friends together in online coop online for special missions, where each player gets to bring in one hero of their choice. We have designed the experience to be similar to playing an old school D&D session with your friends.Urban Exploration

Location Based Missions
X-Tactics features location based missions, where you can protect your school, or workplace from outbreaks of dangerous creatures, and other dangers together with your friends.Also certain hidden character story lines are unlocked by certain combinations of characters and locale types (schools, libraries, stores, etc...). So be sure to explore your surroundings and find out what secrets you may find! Real-world Data Sources
Local weather conditions, and other events like day & night cycles and moon phases, to play part in unlocking certain missions and events.Local conditions also affect missions, so if you enter a mission at nighttime, it is dark, if it is raining, it will rain, and so on. This also has gameplay effects that range from what enemies you may encounter, to providing certain combat benefits and handicaps to certain characters and enemies. After all ranged attacks don’t work well in strong winds, and slippery floors can make movement more difficult than usual. Geocaching and Urban Treasure Hunting
The mobile version of X-Tactics also uses your device's GPS, to investigate nearby areas, search for hints, and treasure!X-Tactics will also provide user-driven Geocaching abilities, so you can organise your own treasure hunts with your friends!""Geocaching is an outdoor recreational activity, in which the participants use a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver or mobile device and other navigational techniques to hide and seek containers, called ""geocaches"" or ""caches"", anywhere in the world."" -Wikipedia
Google Glass Companion


We're fortunate enough to be part of the Glass Explorer program, thanks Google! So we have a pair of glasses and are working on a companion app to assist with the Urban Exploration part of X-Tactics. Of course this is totally experimental so we can't promise anything yet, but hope to have an early alpha ready for Spring 2015.Episodic Content
Our team members have years of experience hosting live games from MMORPGs to more casual games, and we also have experience as a company hosting interactive TV on a weekly basis here in Japan, so we are aiming to leverage this knowhow to add episodic updates, with new missions, items and occasionally new heroes and enemies on a weekly basis, as free updates to all our players, although some content will need to be unlocked, so it might not be readily available to everyone at the same time.Stretch Goal FeaturesAgency CustomisationUNLOCKED!You will now be able to upgrade and expand the different sections of your agency to provide you bonuses that range from intelligence and training benefits, to improved searching facilities (for urban exploration).Items Crafting Systems(Stretch Goa $17,500)Right now X-Tactics has an item system, but we want to add a crafting system so you can customise your own equipment.Ranked Endless Survival Mode(Stretch Goal $25,000)
Play Endless Survival missions, and see how far you get!We will be adding location based ranking, so you can how good your are compared to your peers in your neighbourhood, town, city, region, country, continent and world wide!Friendly PVP(Stretch Goal $35,000)
We will add PVP skirmishes, but want this to be friendly so it will not be ranked in game, but are considering exposing an API so players can organise their own tournaments.Let's build X-Tactics togetherOur IndieGoGo campaign is just not about funding the development of X-Tactics, our goal here is to find like-minded collaborators who want join us on this journey to make X-Tactics the most it can be. So come join us, and leave your mark in the game!Campaign Funds BreakdownThe campaign's funds will be used in a fairly straightforward manner to help us pay for the many in-game assets we still need to produce and stretch goal implement costs.70%: Will be used for Development costs, mostly in-game assets and effects20%: Is needed to create the digital and physical rewards for this campaign10%: Will be used for taxes, service fees, and our plans for a new world orderRelease RoadmapOur current roadmap, without the Handheld stretch goals yet in there.Because X-Tactics depends in large part on Urban Exploration, it only makes sense that we go with a Mobile-first strategy, but the PC version and Google Glass version will all share the same account, so you can play with your same characters and agency wherever you are!After release and depending on demand, and resources we'll be porting to consoles, but we are a small team, and porting to too many devices simultaneously is not something that can realistically handle without compromising gameplay at this time.All perks include everything in lower tier perks.[GET IT] $5, High Five - Our eternal gratitude and gifts :)

FAQ
Q: Is this a micro transactions based game?A: Not really. We don't want to have micro transactions like those of many mobile games these days. For example we won’t be selling keys to unlock treasure chests you find exploring the city, or anything like that.Q: Will this be a Japanese Card Battle/Puzzle game?A: No. This is not a card battle or puzzle game. We founded GAMKIN together to take on more exciting challenges.Q: Will there be in-app purchases?A: Probably. Our goal is to make X-Tactics a live game and grow it together with our community, we want to evolve the game constantly. It is likely there will be some form of in-app purchases for early access to certain content. We are still working out this part of the business model. As developers and gamers, we want to do this in a way that everyone can have fun playing, and allow us keep on evolving the game and adding new content and mechanics.Q: What about handheld?A: We'll be adding a free digital download together with the ""Urban Explorer"" tiers ($20~25) and up, and signed physical copies with at a new $50 +plus shipping tier, that includes all the benefits of current ""Urban Investigator"" ($50). If the stretch goal is met we'll ask all our current Urban Investigator supporters if they want to participate in the new tier, so you don't have to worry.Q: What languages will you support?A: Currently we have Japanese and English underway. French and Spanish targeted shortly after release. We hope to support other languages, but it might take some more time for that.Q: Will the characters be animated?A: Yes, the characters will be animated. However animation is costly so we are using portrait images as placeholders during development to test systems and gameplay. We expect to cover the animation costs with the funds from this campaign.  However this is a tactical game, so it is not like we will have incredible animated assets like Dragon's Crown, but are aiming for animated look that keeps in line with our art style.Q: How will the PC version use GPS data?A: It will not. Our plan is that the PC version will have access to episodic content and multiplayer features. The idea is that the PC version will have let you play more complex missions that would be unsuitable for short burst of mobile play. But you can sync your play data between platforms.Q: Will I need a Mobile device if I want to play on the PC version?A: No, but we highly recommend it. It will be perfectly possible to play the PC version without a mobile device, but you will be missing out on part of the fun! Q: Will I need a PC to play the Mobile version?A: No, but we highly recommend it. It will be perfectly possible to play the Mobile version without a PC, but you will be missing out on part of the fun! Q: Will there be an Ouya, Amazon Fire TV, PS4, Xbox One, Wii U version?A: Maybe. At this moment we already have quite ambitious goals, so we don’t want to promise anything at this time, even with stretch goals, but if things go well, we will be porting the PC version over to these consoles as time and resources allow.Q: Who is the Associate Producer?A: A friend & supporter. We have been very fortunate to have received some extraordinary funding from a very successful business person of the industry here in Japan. This person has been very generous, and is very interested in our success and technology, but this person is not affiliated with our studio in any way.Our contact info:Website:  http://gamkin.comAddress: Cerulean Tower 15F, 26-1 Sakuragaoka-cho, Shibuya-ku, Tokyo 150-8512, Japan",48.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>A pair of Cybershoes® comes with a dedicated wireless receiver. The receiver connects via USB to your PC. Cybershoes® use radio, not Bluetooth, for stability and performance. </p>
<p>3 hours of charging (Micro USB) give you 8-10 hours playtime. Don't walk with the shoes around your house, as they're slippery. The shoes support up to 220lb / 100kg, which is actually also the limit for the Cyberchair. As long as you do not stand on the shoes, and use a sturdy chair and base (like the one from our premium package), Cybershoes® can be used almost regardless of weight!</p>
<p><strong>Safety Note:</strong> Cybershoes is a balancing toy for VR</p>
<p>Do not walk around with the Cybershoes on – they are slippery, and you risk to fall. The chair has no safety belt hence it is possible to fall off the chair. Also, it is possible to fall over with or without the chair. Thus being said – use the device cautiously and at your own risk.</p>

<p>We started this journey 4 years ago to make first shoes for walking in virtual reality. VR is an endless space, but until now it was not really easy to walk in. New frontier needs new shoes. Now, proven @CES, we are officially first and only VR shoemakers worldwide. We make the shoes for VR explorers. Now you can go beyond the boundaries between you and your game character. Now you can step into the game and unleash VR. The market is full of big, clunky and extremely expensive treadmills which are for most VR users not affordable. So we invested our time (4 years) and money to develop the shoes for walking in virtual reality. </p>
<p>After a successful Kickstarter campaign, we now want to offer you a Cybershoes station for the <strong>full immersive gaming experience</strong>.</p>

You can now step into new worlds like never before with Cybershoes®, a VR accessory that is worn on your feet and allows you to literally walk and run through virtual reality.










Cybershoes vs VRGO by Gadget Inspectors 18.05.2019

 
BREAKING NEWS 22.03.2019
Booyakasha!!! Check this out!Cybershoes team made you JUMP!

 

Your room is small but the world of VR is endless and you want to enjoy and explore it. Very often, moving with the joystick makes people sick.
  

 

You want to be in the game and become one with your game character but you are limited to the joystick and the couch. Our idea is simple: you need swivel chair, your Cybershoes and full immersion can start.



Do we share the same childhood dream to enter the television?Now you actually can! With Cybershoes on your feet, it is not about a third or first-person game experience. It is about getting in the boots of your favorite game character.Cybershoes is high-end locomotion solution for a home that lets you feel like being in an arcade.
Are you Ready Player One?

Our Cyberbuddies, let's shape future of VR together!




Cybershoes® is compatible with any VR game that supports free locomotion. Arizona Sunshine, Doom VFR, Fallout, Minecraft and Skyrim, just to name a few.




Fitness Through Gameplay Low stress and impact experience allow you to exercise while you play. 






INSIDE-OUT TRACKING: Following the trend, this makes the Cybershoes comfortable and less expensive.


With Cybershoes® on your feet, all of your movements are controlled by your own legs, so you can feel like you’re exploring ancient cave ruins or fleeing from a grasping horde of the undead.


While seated, the user straps on the Cybershoes® over his or her shoes. One size fits all.

Easy Setup 
The calibration and linking to your VR rig is incredibly simple and getting ready to play is as easy as sitting in your favorite swivel bar stool and strapping on the Cybershoes to your feet.
Use a chair that can rotate around its axis. While walking in a game, the user is halfway seated. This ensures Cybershoes® is comfortable and secure and allows the full 360 degrees movement and full immersion in VR world.  Cybershoes® walking movement is very intuitive and the virtual space is not limited by real space.  Advanced Immersion Through Natural Movement The Cybershoes are able to immerse players in the experience by letting them control their in-game movement by actually walking in place, the player actually feels as if they are their in-game character. So, as you play using the Cybershoes, your brain perceives that you’re standing and not sitting when you explore a different world.
  The shoes keep their orientation. You can walk in the direction of your feet while looking around from side to side. Accurate Directional Tracking The player’s vision is independent of the walking direction of the Cybershoes, meaning you can fully observe your surroundings while you walk, duck or bend to pick up objects thanks to highly accurate motion trackers in CybershoesWe disabled side-steps with Cybershoes because it made people sick during the events! But you still can strafe like in a real life.VR Oasis Mike is showing how to strafe with Cybershoes:The seated position makes it impossible to pick up things from the ground. That's why we came up with Z-scaling. Then you can actually reach the virtual ground and fully duck when needed. Plus: the eye-height can be calibrated on the fly.Sebastian from MRTV is demonstrating in this video what is Z-Scaling.Thanks to the new treadmill support software from Valve, Cybershoes now integrates optimally with SteamVR for a more immersive experience.Cybershoes comes with first-class treadmill support in the Steam Platform. Thanks to Valve, thanks to developer Joe and his team, Cybershoes will be delivered with native Steam integration. You can play all steam VR Games with free movement feature. Here is a preview of the Cybershoes icon ""Cybershoes_status_ready"" :Yes, Cybershoes® does help.The reason is: When you walk in real life, you naturally move your head slightly from side to side and up and down. These are exactly the same movements that you perform while using Cybershoes®. 

Cybershoes® is compatible with any SteamVR application that utilizes touchpad or thumbsticks for free locomotion, as well as the HTC Vive, the Oculus Rift, the Pimax, and Microsoft Mixed Reality via the Steam platform. 

 

You can play Oculus games through Steam. 

""Cybershoes, the Quest, and the Promise of VRThe ideal of VR is untethered, unrestricted movement. The user should be fully immersed in audio and visual stimuli with the body as the controller. Cybershoes and the Oculus Quest come pretty close to fully realizing that ambitious dream. "" vrfitnessinsider
We will start working on compatibility with the Oculus Quest as soon as we get one!
Cybershoes and Pimax for the great experience.


 




We took our product to E3 (Los Angeles), Gamescom (Cologne), Tokyo Game Show and CES (Las Vegas) to share our Cybershoes® with the industry and the response was overwhelming! People from all over the world came, stopped by our booth and were blown away by how simple and effective the shoes are.



Over 3800 people have tested the current generation of Cybershoes® at E3 (Los Angeles), Gamescom (Cologne), Tokyo Game Show and CES (Las Vegas). '

A pair of Cybershoes® comes with a dedicated wireless receiver. The receiver connects via USB to your PC. Cybershoes® use radio, not Bluetooth, for stability and performance. 
3 hours of charging (Micro USB) give you 8-10 hours playtime. Don't walk with the shoes around your house, as they're slippery. The shoes support up to 220lb / 100kg, which is actually also the limit for the Cyberchair. As long as you do not stand on the shoes, and use a sturdy chair and base (like the one from our premium package), Cybershoes® can be used almost regardless of weight!
Safety Note: Cybershoes is a balancing toy for VR
Do not walk around with the Cybershoes on – they are slippery, and you risk to fall. The chair has no safety belt hence it is possible to fall off the chair. Also, it is possible to fall over with or without the chair. Thus being said – use the device cautiously and at your own risk.
Cybershoes® Gaming Station

comes with a pair of Cybershoes®, Cybercarpet & Cyberchair.


We started this journey 4 years ago to make first shoes for walking in virtual reality. VR is an endless space, but until now it was not really easy to walk in. New frontier needs new shoes. Now, proven @CES, we are officially first and only VR shoemakers worldwide. We make the shoes for VR explorers. Now you can go beyond the boundaries between you and your game character. Now you can step into the game and unleash VR. The market is full of big, clunky and extremely expensive treadmills which are for most VR users not affordable. So we invested our time (4 years) and money to develop the shoes for walking in virtual reality. 
After a successful Kickstarter campaign, we now want to offer you a Cybershoes station for the full immersive gaming experience.



The Cybershoes benefits go beyond gaming as they can be employed in training and planning for industrial facilities, physical rehab programs for the elderly, and architecture and construction previews.

Cybershoes address the directional pad/joystick of the left controller. Make sure the possible speed of walking is fast enough, otherwise it does not make fun. With Cybershoes you will want to walk and run quite fast. Cybershoes output the walking direction relative to HMD orientation or relative to the left controller.Options:* You can use Cybershoes along with teleportation (touch=walk&run  press = teleportation).* You can set the game to touch = walk, press = run. * Of course, a dedicated Cybershoes setting is a great idea and we will be happy working together with you (SDK, and further guidelines). General information: We target the OpenVR SDKGo through this thread to get more info: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr/issues/937
 You can find everything there.If you have more questions you can contact us directly mail(at)cybershoes.ioThere are more options: HTC wireless adapter, TP CAST wireless adapter (available for HTC and Oculus), and our favorite: the IKEA Regolit lamp. Modification of the IKEA Regolit couldn’t be easier: just leave the lampshade off! It’s inexpensive, convenient, and practical. We've finished the prototyping phase since the last iteration was tested hard during CES. Now we are optimizing production process, configurations, and logistics.Everyone who helps us here to make the dream of walking in VR come true will get their perk at these exclusive prices.The first 3600 radio transceivers have already arrived! The journey has begun.Since 2015 we have been in the pursuit of making walking in virtual reality a possibility because we believe walking is the most fundamental way of how space can be accessed. We realized how closely VR content is linked to this potential. We do love good content but our passion is to dig deeper – to the fundamentals of the Man-Machine Interface.THANK YOU ALLLet's make this happen together!!!Additional Questions?

Why Help?

Many of you know the overwhelming passion I have for motorsport. With the help of many others, I have been working diligently to secure marketing partners for 2012. 

The team I raced with last season wants me back, and has the seat waiting for me.

We're within a month of the first green flag of the 2012 U.S. Legends Modified (LMOD) championship - securing funding to get my season started is very, very important.

It's simple, if this campaign doesn't pull through, then I don't race.


The Goal

I need $2,000 by March 22nd. That will be enough to compete in the first race. 

Depending on how things go, I might be able to compete in an additional race beyond that.

If we don't reach the $2,000 goal, then all of the money raised will be invested into a fund. With that, I'll continue my search for a program to increase my driving and competition experience. 

I will also allocate some extra money to open up a ""Store"" tab on my website!

TITLE PROMO!!!!

T.A.N.G.R. (There Are No Good Races) is
a browser RPG card game, it takes place in a dark fantasy world where
everyone is evil and the only good race.. is a dead one (well, except
for the undead.. they're dead, but still bad as a school day).



Every single card is a splinter of a
God's mind, Gods whom fell during the Last War.
Challenge the other summoners and
collect the strongest splinters to become a God yourself!!!
(Actually.. you won't really become a
God.. but you'll climb the ranks, get in-game prices and brag about
it with the other players!)


Only certain summoners can use these
cards, YOU are one of them! 

And you're not a good fella.. 



You'll have every kind of creature in
your hand: gargantuan Dragons, stitched up Undead, nightmarish
Beasts, Demigods, Dwarf mobsters and tons of other weird and
corrupted creatures!

• Perform deadly combos with your
cards.
• Choose among hundreds of available
creatures
• Level up your cards
• Collect gems to improve them
• Challenge other players to climb
the ladder
• Join PvE events against huge World
Bosses.




Here we have a card explained in detail and a card summary. Everything is still work in progress, but you can get an idea.







Players will be free to explore different areas of the game using a map. You'll be able to explore  dungeons, complete quests and challenge other players, roaming monsters and bosses. 




Webtemple is a
five years old italian software and web developement company.
From the passion
for gaming of the founder members comes the newborn Webtemple Games,
which is willing to develope more and more titles in the future.
STAFF:

• Andrea Mangialavori : Stealth Coffee Break Leader
• Paolo Bernardinis:      Senior Print Crusader
•                         :           Ninja Senior Developer

• Ermes Buttolo :           Mortal Kolorist Rainbows Enslaver
• Nakia Spizzo:              Dirty Paper Staff Enforcer
• HAL9000:                     IA Developer

The company is still very young and we
need a little boost in order to guarantee a quality and full of new
features gameplay to our players.


T.A.N.G.R. project
is only the tip of the iceberg in our minds. Our goal with this

Another important thing is that the game will be developed even if we don't reach the main goal. This, of course, will take more time.


Most certainly! The game with all its
features will be available for everyone.


This is always a
hard topic and we'd like to be honest.. There will be fees for
certain features (you know, servers arent' free, and we have to pay
our graphic team as well as taxes...), but it won't be a Pay to Win
game.
That's
why every feature will be purchasable
both with WTG tokens (obtainable with cash) and 

in-game currency
(obtainable with in-game quests, PvP and rewards).
The only
difference is WTG tokens will make things like obtaining new cards
and gems a little bit faster.
Players will also be able to trade,
sell and buy cards in the auction house.


This being said, we do not wish to
create a game which favors cash players.


This campaing's goal is 50.000 $, and
we need this sum to take care of the basic game developement.




If we'll reach this goal, we'll be able
to form a bigger developement team and add other features like guild
and heroes systems as shown below:

<p>Please note that all pictures and video are barebones. Meaning it's still fresh and new. A rough draft. Characters will become more detailed as we hire better artists. Menu interfaces and battle animations will become more unique. Even the character sprites will become more detailed and animated. But our story and plot will remain the same.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Undertoe Productions is a small multimedia group specializing in video games and music. Our goal is to offer fun, original, and unique games to the players for hours upon hours of enjoyment. As of right now, we are only two people looking to achieve our dreams, but looking to expand in the future. One is a video game enthusiast with a wild and overactive imagination who dreams of becoming a video game developer. The other is a career musician who dreams of writing music for movies, games, etc, with some impressive credentials - including past work with Cleveland Records, Electric Lady Studios, and even Sanctuary Records and Atlantic Records! Any contributions made go towards finalization of our debut game and helps us achieve our dream!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Current Project</h3>
<p>""Paradigm Shift"" is a traditional turn-based RPG designed as a nostalgic trip back to what made RPGs a mainstay in the 16-bit era. It features elements of dark fantasy and post-apocalyptic cyberpunk. Our opening sequence movie gives a brief glimpse as to what causes the cataclysmic change in the world. We will reveal more as we move along!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Your Contribution Does and Where It Goes</h3>
<p>In addition to helping us achieve our dreams, your contribution helps so much more! We are looking to hire talented artists and scripting designers to use their skills in our production. Your contribution helps us pay these people for their hard work and dedication, which will shave MONTHS off of production time! Furthermore, your contribution also helps with software and hardware upgrades to make production smoother and easier, which also cuts down on production time. We at Undertoe Productions are not looking to profit until after the game is officially released. As of right now, ALL contributions made go towards development, software and hardware upgrades, advertising, and hiring artists and scripting designers who are also trying to make a living doing what they love! Your help does not go to a big company or corporation. Your help goes directly to independent talented people who also want to achieve their dreams of making a living doing what they love to do. <br/><br/></p>
<h3>Can't Contribute Financially? No Problem!</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can help financially, but not to worry! You can help us by sharing! That's right, just a simple pasting of the page url somewhere. The more exposure, the better! Even if it doesn't look like something you would be interested in, you may know someone who will be! Every ""like"", every share, all of it brings us more exposure to a wider audience and can help us achieve our goals of providing our players with a thrilling and unique gaming experience!</p></div>","Available in the US and the UK!

Just imagine a game world in which all the characters interact with each other, buy shares, lobby their interests, try improving their lives.Organize routs (banquet hall) and make meaningful relationships among influential people as well as give gifts, help people realize their ambitions which in turn will help you  get access to huge resources. Every character can conceal a threat or access to game resources down the line. Therefore, it is necessary for you to consciously make friends! Keep in mind that every “resident” is endowed with intellect and knows  how to behave and calculates what to do one step ahead. In addition, he is also connected by the threads of friendship or enmity with other characters, forming his unique network of contacts.For example, if you improve your relationship with a businessman who has two influential friends in the congress, then your relationship with those congressmen can become much easier which will open up new opportunities later.  On the other hand, you will have the risk of starting a financial war with some ""oligarch"" and his friends, if you stop getting along well with each other.   Increase your social status by winning luxuries at the auction. Earn money on horse races betting on horses. The price of rare coins or paintings will go up! Don’t forget to buy houses to get an annual rent; cars, yachts and planes are measure of your luxurious life.    Any property is a tool for making relationships: if someone collects rare coins or paintings so as you, then it will be easier to make friends with them because of common interests.   The game starts from 1870 and continues till date. There is an inheritance system where you can leave a bequest to your heirs to go on playing for them! If one of the heirs has analytical abilities and pragmatism, then you should give a financial monopoly to him.  If you think that someone is suitable for the position of Senator of the Congress, then you should take care of his election campaign in advance.Promote your relatives to official posts, divide spheres of influence and appoint them as managers of your companies. Build a clan network and capture all strategically important resources.Be ready to meet the opposition of other clans. The most powerful families in the game will be fighting for world influence. Will you have enough the fortitude to win that fight?    We’ve been working on this game for the past one and half years! During that time we managed to make the best possible: the corporate style, the design is complete, about 60% of the functionality is completed. However, we want to add some more interesting features into the game and release a better version than what we’ve described above.It is extremely important for us to get your feedback about our project and know what you feel about the game. There are many ideas on how to develop the game further therefore we often need a second opinion to gain ideas that might be useful for the future Plutocracy gamers though we have taken care of all the possible scenarios. We humbly thank everyone of you who believed in us and supported our project.

<p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p><b>What’s Game of Quests all about?</b></p>
<p>Our mission is to encourage our users to
take up activities which will help them to make a difference to themselves and
their community. Currently available activities are jogging, cycling, visiting
a library etc. For every accomplished activity a user is rewarded with some EXP
and Gold. This way you we create an opportunity for our users to develop their
avatars and themselves at the same time.</p>
<p><b>Is it free?</b></p>
<p>Game of Quests is based on “free 2 win”
model, so there is no need to worry that at some point you will be made,
directly or indirectly, to pay. Micro-transactions will be present in our app
and they’ll grant access to additional premium content, but they'll not be a
necessity by any means.</p>
<p><b>Is it a fitness app?</b></p>
<p>It may seem so that at this point Game of
Quest is mainly a workout monitoring project. However, we aim fay beyond that.
At the moment our app features various check-in possibilities as well.
Furthermore, essentially we are developing a game in which actions and
decisions made in real life form a passionate storyline.</p>
<p><b>Neither jogging nor cycling is of my
taste. Is Game of Quests still for me?</b></p>
<p>At the moment those are the main physical
activities we track. However, please note that we also reward activities such
as going to the cinema, library or museums of all sorts. Additionally, our up
is under continuous and heavy development – we constantly keep focus on
enlarging the set of activities we can implement into our app.</p>
<p><b>Is Internet connection required?</b></p>
<p>Our latest release requires constant
Internet connection. However, we keep the amount of mobile data used to an
absolute minimum.</p>
<p><b>Do I need to create 3 characters to play
this game?</b></p>
<p>A single avatar can be developed
independently in three classes (as a warrior, a mage or a driud), according to
kind of activity you make. The goal is to pursue the development of them all as
far as possible.</p>
<p><b>How do I create my character?</b></p>
<p>It’s super easy. Download our app,
register (via facebook or an e-mail account) and log in. Creator will appear
once you log in.</p>
<p><b>How to download Game of Quests app?</b></p>
<p>Our app is available in Google Play (here:

<p><b>Is it available on iOS as well?</b></p>
<p>We would love to make it available for iOS
users as well. However, your support here is crucial. Check out our Indiegogo
goals and help us to make it happen!</p>
<p><b>Why a world of fantasy?</b></p>
<p>Its a world that fits the assumptions of
our app. Still, we want to create another universes for players that aren’t
interested in a world of fantasy.</p>
<p><b>Will it work on my device?</b></p>
<p>Our app works on devices which run Android
2.3.2 and higher.</p>
<p><b>When the final version of your app will be
released?</b></p>
<p>If everything goes as scheduled, we will
release our complete app at the end of July (Android and iOS)</p>
<p><b>Will there be more quests for mage?</b></p>
<p>It’s one of our priorities and we are
working on it. At the moment we rely on Google Places API, which allows to
check in at cinemas, libraries, and museums (we miss theatres too!).</p>
<p><b>How does app obtain my localization and
speed?</b></p>
<p>To do that we use GPS and other location
providing services. But don’t worry, we don’t store or share your localization
with other 3<sup>rd</sup> party services. Your privacy and data security is our priority.</p>

Internet connection. However, we keep the amount of mobile data used to an
absolute minimum.
Do I need to create 3 characters to play
this game?
A single avatar can be developed
independently in three classes (as a warrior, a mage or a driud), according to
kind of activity you make. The goal is to pursue the development of them all as
far as possible.
How do I create my character?
It’s super easy. Download our app,
register (via facebook or an e-mail account) and log in. Creator will appear
once you log in.
How to download Game of Quests app?
Our app is available in Google Play (here:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameofquests.app)
Is it available on iOS as well?
We would love to make it available for iOS
users as well. However, your support here is crucial. Check out our Indiegogo
goals and help us to make it happen!
Why a world of fantasy?
Its a world that fits the assumptions of
our app. Still, we want to create another universes for players that aren’t
interested in a world of fantasy.
Will it work on my device?
Our app works on devices which run Android
2.3.2 and higher.
When the final version of your app will be
released?
If everything goes as scheduled, we will
release our complete app at the end of July (Android and iOS)
Will there be more quests for mage?
It’s one of our priorities and we are
working on it. At the moment we rely on Google Places API, which allows to
check in at cinemas, libraries, and museums (we miss theatres too!).
How does app obtain my localization and
speed?
To do that we use GPS and other location
providing services. But don’t worry, we don’t store or share your localization
with other 3rd party services. Your privacy and data security is our priority.",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>
<br/><b>About Our Stretch Goals</b>
</h3>
<p>The $3.5M budget we’ve presented is for our full vision for Indivisible's core, but we have plenty of ideas for stretch goals.</p>
<p>We have two primary aims in mind for Indivisible’s stretch goals: 1) Make the game into an even better game and more desirable product, 2) Without greatly extending the development schedule of the core game.</p>
<p>As such, most gameplay-oriented additions are currently being considered as content for a post-release expansion.</p>
<p>Also, please note that these are not the exact costs of each stretch goal item in question, but instead represent a balancing of the costs across multiple goals. Adding multiplayer functionality, for example, is rather expensive and would require an unreasonably large sum compared to other stretch goals.</p>And as we did with Skullgirls, we will always look for ways to spend any extra money to make the game better or faster, should things come in cheaper than expected.<br/> <p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FlCAo-aq3PjE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlCAo-aq3PjE%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FlCAo-aq3PjE%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

<p>Lab Zero is proud to announce our new action/RPG, currently titled Indivisible.</p>
<p><i>Indivisible</i> is inspired by classics like <i>Valkyrie Profile</i> and <i>Super Metroid</i>, but with the unique character, world, and gameplay depth Lab Zero is known for, and will feature a stunning soundtrack by legendary Japanese game music composer, Hiroki Kikuta.</p>
<p>This is a <b>fixed funding</b> campaign, which means <i>Indivisible</i> will only happen if we reach our goal. <b>505 Games </b>has generously agreed to contribute a further $2 million toward its development <b><u>only if</u> </b>we reach that goal. So for us here at Lab Zero, your contribution counts for more than double!</p>
<p>If funded, <i>Indivisible</i> will be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam Windows / Mac / Linux. The final product will support the English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese and Russian languages.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><span><b>Overview</b></span></h3>
<p>Indivisible is a side-scrolling RPG in the vein of Valkyrie Profile, spanning a huge fantasy world inspired by our own world’s various cultures and mythologies.</p>
<p>Players will navigate beautiful environments using a variety of different traversal abilities, and engage monsters in fast-paced combat.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Ajna</b></h3>
<p>Meet Indivisible’s protagonist, Ajna.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443739856/mzod29ugunr8uef6g3jr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A good-natured tomboy with a rebellious streak, Ajna was raised by her father on the outskirts of their rural town. Her father raised her to be fair-minded and tough, and trained her in martial arts so that she might defend their home.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443739881/ne633fsh1l8ab2rmecgd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>When their town is attacked by local warlords, Ajna discovers a mysterious power - the power to absorb certain individuals into her being. Furthermore, fusing with these “Incarnations” will not only allow her to summon them into battle, but also grant Ajna new weapons and abilities.</p>

<p>Determined to confront the warlords and find out more about these strange new abilities, Ajna sets out on a globe-spanning quest that will reveal her true nature and much more.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The World of Indivisible</b></h3>
<p>While Indivisible’s thematic core is inspired by Southeast Asian mythology, the game is full of lands and characters inspired by a variety of cultures and myths. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Incarnations</b></h3>
<p>Throughout Ajna’s quest she’ll encounter many “Incarnations,” people who she can absorb into herself. There are many of them to recruit, and each has their own story and personality. She will unite a unique cast hailing from far away lands, discovering aspects of herself in the process. There are many Incarnations, and the more you find, the more powerful Ajna will become.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Many Incarnations will fight alongside Ajna, and some will also grant her the ability to manifest new weapons and abilities that will help her explore the game’s varied environments.</span><br/> </p>

<p>The world of Indivisible is presented as a side-scrolling platformer: Ajna can run, jump, crouch and dash.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as Ajna fuses with more Incarnations, she’ll gain new weapons and abilities. In addition to their obvious uses in battle, each weapon can be used in the world to traverse various obstacles.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443740000/bpaccukmt1hvxvnfjosp.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For example, an upgrade to her Martial Arts abilities might allow her to jump off of walls, while an axe might let her cut down certain obstacles in her path.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443740041/d0zgn4eyf6hcuvlqmhhq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444025447/mv3jgyzgftxylljhpzxp.png"" src=""""/></p></div>
<p>Should Ajna collide with an enemy while exploring, you’ll seamlessly transition into...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Battle</b></h3>
<p>Indivisible’s battle system is inspired by Valkyrie Profile’s, but we’re leveraging our combat expertise to make it more active and give it even more depth and customization.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443936689/gsl1ywhwxmue8wlgk9re.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with the combat in Valkyrie Profile, each character in your four-person party is mapped to one of the face buttons. Tapping this button will make that character attack.</p>
<p>Essentially, your party functions as a single, customizable fighting game character - the key to success is mastering your party’s attacks to create combos, and experimenting with new Incarnations and attacks to make the most out of every round.</p>
<p>However, unlike Valkyrie Profile, Indivisible’s battles are not strictly turn-based. We’re taking a more active approach, where characters can attack any time they have actions available. Actions recharge in real time for you and your enemies, so waiting for more characters to be able to act at once allows for bigger combos and gives you more strategic options.</p>
<p>In addition to the basic controls, as Ajna develops an affinity with her weapons and Incarnations, new attacks will be unlocked. The additional attacks will be activated by tapping a button and holding either up or down.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443930973/a8jyknag7ikeonmqoktb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Furthermore, as you upgrade your party’s weapons, they’ll be able to attack multiple times per turn, giving you more options than ever before.</p>
<p>Finally, successful combos will build your Iddhi meter. Iddhi can be used to cast spells between actions, defend against incoming enemy attacks, and execute super attacks. Every party member will have a super, and in the full game, Ajna will be able to transform into her formidable Heruka form to unleash divine retribution.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443740289/bfsembjf6kiiv2sv8foa.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Of course, text is a poor substitute for actually playing it - download the playable prototype right now and give it a shot!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Ajna’s Inner Realm</b></h3>
<p>Along with her ability to absorb certain people, Ajna will also discover she can meditate and enter a mysterious dimension growing inside her.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443740560/oeotncdi6fjvvx8iv963.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Incarnations Ajna absorbs live in this “Inner Realm,” which gradually grows and evolves the more powerful Ajna becomes. Beginning as some rocks in a void, it will eventually develop into a safe haven and secret base reminiscent of Ajna’s hometown.</p>
<p>Once she discovers it, Ajna’s Inner Realm becomes the central hub for the game, where most of the game’s quests, upgrade and saving functionality resides. Simply pressing a button will send Ajna inside herself, sparing players a lot of needless trekking back to towns. Your own custom town, anywhere, at the touch of a button!</p>
<p>Most of the game’s Incarnations are for expanding and adding functionality to Ajna’s Inner Realm. For example, quests to upgrade your weapons and armor may come from a blacksmith Incarnation you discover, or a biologist might unlock a bestiary.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444031644/fmlfekfqzi1qdsjuuixb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Additionally, talking to your battle Incarnations may send you on quests to help them resolve their stories and unlock new abilities.</p>
<p>To summarize, Ajna's Inner Realm will let you immediately:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Save almost anywhere in the game</p></li>
<li><p>Upgrade weapons and armor</p></li>
<li><p>Start side quests</p></li>
<li><p>Talk with your Incarnations to learn more about them, or jog your memory on what you’ve got to do next</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Character Progression</b></h3>
<p>While Indivisible will have an experience points system, our goal is to never require grinding to advance or enjoy the game. Progression will be about giving you more tools to work with, rather than just more power.</p>
<p>Stat bonuses from leveling up will be relatively small, while upgrades from weapons and armor will be significant. Additionally, characters will learn their other directional attacks as you level, make them more flexible and giving you more combat options as you advance through the game.</p>
<p>The primary stats that will level up based on experience will be HP and action charge speed. Damage will increase for all party members based on the number of Incarnations Ajna collects, while upgrading your weapons will give you more attacks. Similarly, Armor upgrades will be powerful and noticeable.</p>
<p>Weapon and armor upgrades aren’t purchased with money, but will require Ajna to find items in the exploration part of the game, as well as complete a short quest with the Blacksmith or Armorer in her Inner Realm.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Game Length</b></h3>
<p>We’re targeting a playtime of around 20-30 hours for Indivisible’s main scenario, not including sidequests.</p>
<p>This is the approximate length of some of our favorites: Chrono Trigger, Valkyrie Profile, and more. The priority here is on solid and fun content, not simply filling time to hit a number.</p>
<p>These shorter RPGs are also more eminently replayable, and we’d like to expand on that if we successfully fund the core game.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Your Feedback Will Make Indivisible Better</b></h3>
<p>As Skullgirls fans know, Lab Zero strongly believes in directly engaging its community to make better games.</p>
<p>We’d like to keep this going with Indivisible, but it’s a bit more complicated when you’re talking about a story-driven single player game that (presumably) people don’t want to be spoiled.</p>
<p>As such, if Indivisible is funded, we’ll migrate the playable prototype to Steam and periodically update it with new stages and challenges to enjoy. Each update would feature a new region or dungeon, and also let players test out new Incarnations and abilities while fighting new monsters.</p>
<p>We think this approach will let players experience gameplay and provide feedback, without giving too much away.</p>

<p>With Indivisible, Lab Zero is continuing in Skullgirls’ winning formula of beautiful graphics, high-res hand-drawn animation, and a stellar soundtrack from a noted Japanese game music composer, Hiroki Kikuta.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Engine</b></h3>
<p>Indivisible will be built in Lab Zero’s very own Z-Engine, the engine responsible for Skullgirls.</p>
<p>The Z-Engine has the most advanced 2D sprite support there is today, and supports streaming of massive high-res animations, dynamic character coloring, and real-time lighting on sprites.</p>
<p>While initially created for fighting games, the scripting system in the Z-Engine is robust and flexible enough to support any 2D game genre.</p>
<p>The only reason we were able to complete the playable prototype in such a short time is because of the flexibility of the Z-Engine, allowing us to rapidly prototype and realize our vision for Indivisible’s gameplay.</p>
<p>Finally, Skullgirls will run on just about any toaster-level PC, and we don’t expect Indivisible will end up too far off from that.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Characters and Animation</b></h3>
<p>Lab Zero’s animation work on Skullgirls laid the groundwork for Indivisible - while the style may be slightly different, we’ll be using the same production method.</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Lab Zero’s animation process, check out this mini-documentary we released back in 2012!</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F5VkDXBsIXso%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5VkDXBsIXso&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F5VkDXBsIXso%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>As the video explains, every frame of animation has three layers: line, shading and color.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443930603/m5pxtibareofrzhrw99j.png"" src="""" style=""width: 618.138px;height: 332px;""/></p>
<p>For Skullgirls, characters were drawn with thick, tapered lines to give each frame a more illustrative style and stand out from backgrounds during the fast-moving fighting gameplay. However, with Indivisible, we’re going with thinner and more uniform lines to emphasize a more unified and consistent animated style.</p>
<p>Lab Zero’s palletization technology was used in Skullgirls to provide alternate character colors, as well as accessories like glasses and face masks. For an RPG like Indivisible, this tech and other aspects of the game engine will allow us to visually represent weapon and armor upgrades, easily differentiate enemy types, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, we’re adding a new “dye” layer to color the lines, giving us more artistic flexibility and to help the characters really pop.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Environments</b></h3>
<p>Indivisible’s world is divided into regions, each being a large level inspired by a different culture or mythos. With the memory available to us on the new systems, our goal is for there to be no loading whatsoever within a region for a seamless play experience.</p>
<p>Each of these massive levels will be constructed from a 3D tileset and individually polished with detail elements, such as plants and rocks to mask any visible tiling.</p>
<p>In addition to the tileset-created areas, each area of the game will also be punctuated with unique, detailed set pieces reminiscent of Skullgirls stages.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Audio</b></h3>
<p>For Indivisible, Lab Zero has once again partnered with a legendary Japanese game music composer: Hiroki Kikuta.</p>
<p>If you don’t recognize the name, Kikuta-san is responsible for the amazing soundtracks to Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu III (Secret of Mana 2), Soukaigi, and Koudelka, among others.</p>
<p>And here’s a brief message from the man himself:</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FzwQkqbHY_58%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzwQkqbHY_58&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FzwQkqbHY_58%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>For the playable prototype, Kikuta has composed three tracks:</p>

<p>We sought out Kikuta-san because his music is memorable and fantastic, and he’s also got the ethnic and tonal range an RPG like Indivisible needs.</p>
<p>To say it is an honor to be working with him would be an understatement, and we’re proud to be working together to make the best musical experience we can.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443741118/kjjl6i5ieb2qggc5m1oe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By now you’ve probably noticed that rather large amount of money we’re asking for in this campaign. However, this isn’t the actual budget for the game.</p>
<p>The total budget for Indivisible is $3,500,000.</p>
<p>If we raise our goal of $1,500,000 or more, 505 Games will provide the remaining $2,000,000 we need to complete the game. So, effectively, up to the initial goal your contribution is worth more than double.</p>
<p>And the more we raise beyond the initial goal, the better the game gets and the better the publishing arrangement with 505 gets for Lab Zero.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not a campaign to “gauge interest” – Indivisible’s budget represents a more equitable funding split, where your support directly influences not only the game, but also the post-release benefits Lab Zero receives.</p>
<p>Indivisible will not happen if we don’t hit our goal. But should the campaign succeed, Lab Zero will have a better outcome than we would’ve gotten through a more traditional publishing deal – that’s the risk we took, and we feel it’s a worthwhile tradeoff.</p>
<p>Additionally, this represents the complete budget for our entire vision of Indivisible.  If we are lucky enough to be in that situation, we will not be adding additional gameplay content to the core game as stretch goals As such, all additional content funded through stretch goals will be released in post-release updates.</p>
<p>So how will this money be used?</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444009947/yypphtghmd1virbxkpso.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Fortunately, it’s pretty straightforward: virtually all of the initial $1,500,000 will go into developing the game, with the exception of the 8% we need to pay Indiegogo and PayPal.</p>
<p>Having a publishing partner means that just about every dollar you give will go towards making the game: 505 Games will be involved in the game development and helping to fill in the gaps in other areas of production, such as QA and localization. Not only does this make budgeting easier, it frees us up from distractions so we can focus on delivering the game.</p>
<p>After accounting for pre-production and ramp-up time, the full budget will support a spending rate of around $10,000/man-month - this includes employee salaries, benefits, office rent, utilities, equipment, legal costs, and all other business overhead. This is widely considered a sort of baseline average spending rate for the games industry.</p>
<p>We'd love to break down our budget more, but the reality is that we can only calculate these numbers roughly. Unlike fighting game characters, which have a pre-defined set of things you need to create, each area of the Indivisible will have varying amounts of environment art, characters, monsters, etc.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The Prototype</b></h3>
<p>Let’s take a moment to discuss that playable prototype you’ve (hopefully) played by now.</p>
<p>We began working on the prototype in early May. Between salaries for the core Lab Zero staff, art contracting and music contracting, we spent around $250,000, which was provided by 505 Games.</p>
<p>We felt that in order to justify asking for so much money, we had to do more than just present an idea for the game, and give players something they could actually touch and enjoy. In addition to making an abstract game idea more concrete for backers, it helped us figure out some important parts of our development pipeline before asking for your money.</p>
<p><span>There’s a lot we’d still like to do in the final game that we weren’t able to do in the prototype:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create more visual consistency in the environments</p></li>
<li><p>Support for more graphical configuation options, such as anti-aliasing</p></li>
<li><p>Support for graphical post-processing effects</p></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Better object management and streaming systems, to allow us to create richer environments</span></li>
</ul>
<div> </div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Staffing</b></h3>
<p>Indivisible is a new game by the core staff responsible for Skullgirls, but we can’t complete it without growing the team.</p>
<p>For example, Indivisible will need level design and environment staff that a fighting game like Skullgirls wouldn’t need. And we need to hire more programmers and artists to more efficiently produce content.</p>
<p>We have people in mind for many of these roles already, and will update you if we’re funded and can confirm their hiring. Depending on how the campaign turns out, additional staff may be hired to get the game out faster and more efficiently without sacrificing quality.</p>
<p>In addition to the full-time staff, we’ll still be employing our stable of talented animation contractors, voice director Cristina Vee, and others, which will speed up development and help us make the most of your contributions.</p>

<p>Lab Zero Games is a consumer-facing studio created by the core creative staff behind the critically-acclaimed fighting game Skullgirls. We’re passionate gamers, and strive to make games that appeal to people like us.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on communicating with our fans to make both a better game and a better game community. Skullgirls was very much Lab Zero’s vision, but it became a better game thanks to the community’s involvement and feedback. And we’re excited to bring the same community-driven iteration to a single player game.</p>
<p>We always try to be as transparent as business allows. This means letting our fans and supporters know what’s going on, even when it’s bad news.</p>
<p>And we try to do the right thing for the greater gaming community, even when it doesn’t directly benefit us.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Skullgirls’ Indiegogo Campaign</b></h3>
<p>In February 2013, we crowdfunded new Skullgirls DLC characters, story and stages. The campaign was a success, and not only did we deliver everything we promised, we even managed to over-deliver when some things came in cheaper than originally anticipated.</p>
<p><i>Promised</i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">5 new characters</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">5 new story modes</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">6 new stages</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">6 new music tracks</span></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Delivered</i></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">5 new characters + 1 free “Clone” character</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">5 new story modes + 1 free “Clone” character story mode</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">12 new stages + 2 new variants</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">12 new music tracks</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We intend to approach Indivisible similarly, and will commission additional music, monsters or environment setpieces if things come in under budget.</p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>The People</b></h3>

Indivisible is funded!From Lab Zero Games, thank you from the bottom of our hearts!Now that the game is funded and the campaign proper is over, we'll be using Indiegogo's ""InDemand"" feature to continue selling the game and, hopefully, funding additional stretch goals.InDemand functions pretty much exactly the same way the campaign did, but we've retired most of the custom tiers and are continuing to offer the rest. At some point in the future, we will likely retire tiers for most of the physical goods in order to prepare for manufacturing.We intend to leave this open as long as possible in order to try to fund as many stretch goals as we can, so there's still value in telling your friends to check the prototype and the campaign out! Indivisible was originally budgeted to have around 60 minutes of music from Kikuta-san, and thanks to your support, we can expand that by another hour! Lab Zero Games has partnered with anime powerhouse Studio TRIGGER to create an original animated opening for Indivisible!The animation will be storyboarded in Los Angeles by the animation studio, Titmouse, and the final animation will be directed by legendary animator Yoh Yoshinari, director of TRIGGER's excellent Little Witch Academia series. 

Indivisible is currently budgeted to only have voices in battle. With this additional money, we’ll expand the voice acting to cover all interactions with major characters.
Voice acting will be directed by the incomparable Cristina Vee. We'd like to hire SAG-AFTRA union voice actors so we can access a range of talent that better fits the characters in Indivisible! 
After the game is released, we’ll update it with multiple endings and a hardcore “post-game” bonus dungeon, with new monsters and more!
The multiple endings will likely be limited to New Game+, and may change depending on when in the game you defeat the final boss or who is in your party when you beat them!

The Hardcore Bonus Dungeon will be found inside Ajna's Inner Realm, and will literally be filled with her inner demons. Facing one's inner demons is tough, so she'll be an optional party member for this.

About Our Stretch Goals

The $3.5M budget we’ve presented is for our full vision for Indivisible's core, but we have plenty of ideas for stretch goals.
We have two primary aims in mind for Indivisible’s stretch goals: 1) Make the game into an even better game and more desirable product, 2) Without greatly extending the development schedule of the core game.
As such, most gameplay-oriented additions are currently being considered as content for a post-release expansion.
Also, please note that these are not the exact costs of each stretch goal item in question, but instead represent a balancing of the costs across multiple goals. Adding multiplayer functionality, for example, is rather expensive and would require an unreasonably large sum compared to other stretch goals.And as we did with Skullgirls, we will always look for ways to spend any extra money to make the game better or faster, should things come in cheaper than expected. 

Lab Zero is proud to announce our new action/RPG, currently titled Indivisible.
Indivisible is inspired by classics like Valkyrie Profile and Super Metroid, but with the unique character, world, and gameplay depth Lab Zero is known for, and will feature a stunning soundtrack by legendary Japanese game music composer, Hiroki Kikuta.
This is a fixed funding campaign, which means Indivisible will only happen if we reach our goal. 505 Games has generously agreed to contribute a further $2 million toward its development only if we reach that goal. So for us here at Lab Zero, your contribution counts for more than double!
If funded, Indivisible will be released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam Windows / Mac / Linux. The final product will support the English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Japanese and Russian languages.

Overview
Indivisible is a side-scrolling RPG in the vein of Valkyrie Profile, spanning a huge fantasy world inspired by our own world’s various cultures and mythologies.
Players will navigate beautiful environments using a variety of different traversal abilities, and engage monsters in fast-paced combat.
Ajna
Meet Indivisible’s protagonist, Ajna.

A good-natured tomboy with a rebellious streak, Ajna was raised by her father on the outskirts of their rural town. Her father raised her to be fair-minded and tough, and trained her in martial arts so that she might defend their home. 

When their town is attacked by local warlords, Ajna discovers a mysterious power - the power to absorb certain individuals into her being. Furthermore, fusing with these “Incarnations” will not only allow her to summon them into battle, but also grant Ajna new weapons and abilities.
 

Determined to confront the warlords and find out more about these strange new abilities, Ajna sets out on a globe-spanning quest that will reveal her true nature and much more.
 
The World of Indivisible
While Indivisible’s thematic core is inspired by Southeast Asian mythology, the game is full of lands and characters inspired by a variety of cultures and myths. 








 The monsters of Indivisible will draw inspiration from a variety of mythologies, and will get our own unique spin. Of course we will also be creating our own creatures, as well.

Incarnations
Throughout Ajna’s quest she’ll encounter many “Incarnations,” people who she can absorb into herself. There are many of them to recruit, and each has their own story and personality. She will unite a unique cast hailing from far away lands, discovering aspects of herself in the process. There are many Incarnations, and the more you find, the more powerful Ajna will become.
Many Incarnations will fight alongside Ajna, and some will also grant her the ability to manifest new weapons and abilities that will help her explore the game’s varied environments. 
READ ABOUT THEM ALL HERE!
 Exploration
The world of Indivisible is presented as a side-scrolling platformer: Ajna can run, jump, crouch and dash.
Furthermore, as Ajna fuses with more Incarnations, she’ll gain new weapons and abilities. In addition to their obvious uses in battle, each weapon can be used in the world to traverse various obstacles.

For example, an upgrade to her Martial Arts abilities might allow her to jump off of walls, while an axe might let her cut down certain obstacles in her path.


Should Ajna collide with an enemy while exploring, you’ll seamlessly transition into...
 
Battle
Indivisible’s battle system is inspired by Valkyrie Profile’s, but we’re leveraging our combat expertise to make it more active and give it even more depth and customization.

If you’re not familiar with the combat in Valkyrie Profile, each character in your four-person party is mapped to one of the face buttons. Tapping this button will make that character attack.
Essentially, your party functions as a single, customizable fighting game character - the key to success is mastering your party’s attacks to create combos, and experimenting with new Incarnations and attacks to make the most out of every round.
However, unlike Valkyrie Profile, Indivisible’s battles are not strictly turn-based. We’re taking a more active approach, where characters can attack any time they have actions available. Actions recharge in real time for you and your enemies, so waiting for more characters to be able to act at once allows for bigger combos and gives you more strategic options.
In addition to the basic controls, as Ajna develops an affinity with her weapons and Incarnations, new attacks will be unlocked. The additional attacks will be activated by tapping a button and holding either up or down.

Furthermore, as you upgrade your party’s weapons, they’ll be able to attack multiple times per turn, giving you more options than ever before.
Finally, successful combos will build your Iddhi meter. Iddhi can be used to cast spells between actions, defend against incoming enemy attacks, and execute super attacks. Every party member will have a super, and in the full game, Ajna will be able to transform into her formidable Heruka form to unleash divine retribution.

Of course, text is a poor substitute for actually playing it - download the playable prototype right now and give it a shot!
 
Ajna’s Inner Realm
Along with her ability to absorb certain people, Ajna will also discover she can meditate and enter a mysterious dimension growing inside her.

The Incarnations Ajna absorbs live in this “Inner Realm,” which gradually grows and evolves the more powerful Ajna becomes. Beginning as some rocks in a void, it will eventually develop into a safe haven and secret base reminiscent of Ajna’s hometown.
Once she discovers it, Ajna’s Inner Realm becomes the central hub for the game, where most of the game’s quests, upgrade and saving functionality resides. Simply pressing a button will send Ajna inside herself, sparing players a lot of needless trekking back to towns. Your own custom town, anywhere, at the touch of a button!
Most of the game’s Incarnations are for expanding and adding functionality to Ajna’s Inner Realm. For example, quests to upgrade your weapons and armor may come from a blacksmith Incarnation you discover, or a biologist might unlock a bestiary.

Additionally, talking to your battle Incarnations may send you on quests to help them resolve their stories and unlock new abilities.
To summarize, Ajna's Inner Realm will let you immediately:

Save almost anywhere in the game
Upgrade weapons and armor
Start side quests
Talk with your Incarnations to learn more about them, or jog your memory on what you’ve got to do next

Character Progression
While Indivisible will have an experience points system, our goal is to never require grinding to advance or enjoy the game. Progression will be about giving you more tools to work with, rather than just more power.
Stat bonuses from leveling up will be relatively small, while upgrades from weapons and armor will be significant. Additionally, characters will learn their other directional attacks as you level, make them more flexible and giving you more combat options as you advance through the game.
The primary stats that will level up based on experience will be HP and action charge speed. Damage will increase for all party members based on the number of Incarnations Ajna collects, while upgrading your weapons will give you more attacks. Similarly, Armor upgrades will be powerful and noticeable.
Weapon and armor upgrades aren’t purchased with money, but will require Ajna to find items in the exploration part of the game, as well as complete a short quest with the Blacksmith or Armorer in her Inner Realm.
 
Game Length
We’re targeting a playtime of around 20-30 hours for Indivisible’s main scenario, not including sidequests.
This is the approximate length of some of our favorites: Chrono Trigger, Valkyrie Profile, and more. The priority here is on solid and fun content, not simply filling time to hit a number.
These shorter RPGs are also more eminently replayable, and we’d like to expand on that if we successfully fund the core game.
 
Your Feedback Will Make Indivisible Better
As Skullgirls fans know, Lab Zero strongly believes in directly engaging its community to make better games.
We’d like to keep this going with Indivisible, but it’s a bit more complicated when you’re talking about a story-driven single player game that (presumably) people don’t want to be spoiled.
As such, if Indivisible is funded, we’ll migrate the playable prototype to Steam and periodically update it with new stages and challenges to enjoy. Each update would feature a new region or dungeon, and also let players test out new Incarnations and abilities while fighting new monsters.
We think this approach will let players experience gameplay and provide feedback, without giving too much away.

With Indivisible, Lab Zero is continuing in Skullgirls’ winning formula of beautiful graphics, high-res hand-drawn animation, and a stellar soundtrack from a noted Japanese game music composer, Hiroki Kikuta.
 
Engine
Indivisible will be built in Lab Zero’s very own Z-Engine, the engine responsible for Skullgirls.
The Z-Engine has the most advanced 2D sprite support there is today, and supports streaming of massive high-res animations, dynamic character coloring, and real-time lighting on sprites.
While initially created for fighting games, the scripting system in the Z-Engine is robust and flexible enough to support any 2D game genre.
The only reason we were able to complete the playable prototype in such a short time is because of the flexibility of the Z-Engine, allowing us to rapidly prototype and realize our vision for Indivisible’s gameplay.
Finally, Skullgirls will run on just about any toaster-level PC, and we don’t expect Indivisible will end up too far off from that.
 
Characters and Animation
Lab Zero’s animation work on Skullgirls laid the groundwork for Indivisible - while the style may be slightly different, we’ll be using the same production method.
If you’re not familiar with Lab Zero’s animation process, check out this mini-documentary we released back in 2012!

As the video explains, every frame of animation has three layers: line, shading and color.

For Skullgirls, characters were drawn with thick, tapered lines to give each frame a more illustrative style and stand out from backgrounds during the fast-moving fighting gameplay. However, with Indivisible, we’re going with thinner and more uniform lines to emphasize a more unified and consistent animated style.
Lab Zero’s palletization technology was used in Skullgirls to provide alternate character colors, as well as accessories like glasses and face masks. For an RPG like Indivisible, this tech and other aspects of the game engine will allow us to visually represent weapon and armor upgrades, easily differentiate enemy types, etc.
Finally, we’re adding a new “dye” layer to color the lines, giving us more artistic flexibility and to help the characters really pop.
 
Environments
Indivisible’s world is divided into regions, each being a large level inspired by a different culture or mythos. With the memory available to us on the new systems, our goal is for there to be no loading whatsoever within a region for a seamless play experience.
Each of these massive levels will be constructed from a 3D tileset and individually polished with detail elements, such as plants and rocks to mask any visible tiling.
In addition to the tileset-created areas, each area of the game will also be punctuated with unique, detailed set pieces reminiscent of Skullgirls stages.
 
Audio
For Indivisible, Lab Zero has once again partnered with a legendary Japanese game music composer: Hiroki Kikuta.
If you don’t recognize the name, Kikuta-san is responsible for the amazing soundtracks to Secret of Mana, Seiken Densetsu III (Secret of Mana 2), Soukaigi, and Koudelka, among others.
And here’s a brief message from the man himself:

For the playable prototype, Kikuta has composed three tracks:



We sought out Kikuta-san because his music is memorable and fantastic, and he’s also got the ethnic and tonal range an RPG like Indivisible needs.
To say it is an honor to be working with him would be an understatement, and we’re proud to be working together to make the best musical experience we can.
 

By now you’ve probably noticed that rather large amount of money we’re asking for in this campaign. However, this isn’t the actual budget for the game.
The total budget for Indivisible is $3,500,000.
If we raise our goal of $1,500,000 or more, 505 Games will provide the remaining $2,000,000 we need to complete the game. So, effectively, up to the initial goal your contribution is worth more than double.
And the more we raise beyond the initial goal, the better the game gets and the better the publishing arrangement with 505 gets for Lab Zero.
To be clear, this is not a campaign to “gauge interest” – Indivisible’s budget represents a more equitable funding split, where your support directly influences not only the game, but also the post-release benefits Lab Zero receives.
Indivisible will not happen if we don’t hit our goal. But should the campaign succeed, Lab Zero will have a better outcome than we would’ve gotten through a more traditional publishing deal – that’s the risk we took, and we feel it’s a worthwhile tradeoff.
Additionally, this represents the complete budget for our entire vision of Indivisible.  If we are lucky enough to be in that situation, we will not be adding additional gameplay content to the core game as stretch goals As such, all additional content funded through stretch goals will be released in post-release updates.
So how will this money be used?

Fortunately, it’s pretty straightforward: virtually all of the initial $1,500,000 will go into developing the game, with the exception of the 8% we need to pay Indiegogo and PayPal.
Having a publishing partner means that just about every dollar you give will go towards making the game: 505 Games will be involved in the game development and helping to fill in the gaps in other areas of production, such as QA and localization. Not only does this make budgeting easier, it frees us up from distractions so we can focus on delivering the game.
After accounting for pre-production and ramp-up time, the full budget will support a spending rate of around $10,000/man-month - this includes employee salaries, benefits, office rent, utilities, equipment, legal costs, and all other business overhead. This is widely considered a sort of baseline average spending rate for the games industry.
We'd love to break down our budget more, but the reality is that we can only calculate these numbers roughly. Unlike fighting game characters, which have a pre-defined set of things you need to create, each area of the Indivisible will have varying amounts of environment art, characters, monsters, etc.
 
The Prototype
Let’s take a moment to discuss that playable prototype you’ve (hopefully) played by now.
We began working on the prototype in early May. Between salaries for the core Lab Zero staff, art contracting and music contracting, we spent around $250,000, which was provided by 505 Games.
We felt that in order to justify asking for so much money, we had to do more than just present an idea for the game, and give players something they could actually touch and enjoy. In addition to making an abstract game idea more concrete for backers, it helped us figure out some important parts of our development pipeline before asking for your money.
There’s a lot we’d still like to do in the final game that we weren’t able to do in the prototype:

Create more visual consistency in the environments
Support for more graphical configuation options, such as anti-aliasing
Support for graphical post-processing effects
Better object management and streaming systems, to allow us to create richer environments

 
Staffing
Indivisible is a new game by the core staff responsible for Skullgirls, but we can’t complete it without growing the team.
For example, Indivisible will need level design and environment staff that a fighting game like Skullgirls wouldn’t need. And we need to hire more programmers and artists to more efficiently produce content.
We have people in mind for many of these roles already, and will update you if we’re funded and can confirm their hiring. Depending on how the campaign turns out, additional staff may be hired to get the game out faster and more efficiently without sacrificing quality.
In addition to the full-time staff, we’ll still be employing our stable of talented animation contractors, voice director Cristina Vee, and others, which will speed up development and help us make the most of your contributions.
 


Lab Zero Games is a consumer-facing studio created by the core creative staff behind the critically-acclaimed fighting game Skullgirls. We’re passionate gamers, and strive to make games that appeal to people like us.
We pride ourselves on communicating with our fans to make both a better game and a better game community. Skullgirls was very much Lab Zero’s vision, but it became a better game thanks to the community’s involvement and feedback. And we’re excited to bring the same community-driven iteration to a single player game.
We always try to be as transparent as business allows. This means letting our fans and supporters know what’s going on, even when it’s bad news.
And we try to do the right thing for the greater gaming community, even when it doesn’t directly benefit us. If you’ve played Ultra Street Fighter 4 or Mortal Kombat X on PS4 with your PS3 stick, that’s because we licensed our technology to those games to use, completely free.
We even try to be cool on Twitter!
You can trust that Lab Zero will bring the same passion, persistence and grit to Indivisible that we brought to Skullgirls.
 
Skullgirls’ Indiegogo Campaign
In February 2013, we crowdfunded new Skullgirls DLC characters, story and stages. The campaign was a success, and not only did we deliver everything we promised, we even managed to over-deliver when some things came in cheaper than originally anticipated.
Promised

5 new characters
5 new story modes
6 new stages
6 new music tracks

Delivered

5 new characters + 1 free “Clone” character
5 new story modes + 1 free “Clone” character story mode
12 new stages + 2 new variants
12 new music tracks

We intend to approach Indivisible similarly, and will commission additional music, monsters or environment setpieces if things come in under budget. The People

<h1><i>The Story.</i></h1>
<p><i>King Rowan, the supreme ruler of the land, wants to protect the magic tree of Destiny from people who might misuse its power. This tree is very special – whoever eats its fruit gains strength like no one else in the realm. This could be very dangerous especially if the kings from the neighbouring lands heard about it and tried to seize the kingdom from Rowan. The king is afraid, so he calls his closest advisors to his court and says: ""My dear, wise advisors, you are the men I trust the most. I have a task for you. You shall go and find me the greatest army of 7 watchmen who will protect the Tree of Destiny. One of you who will manage to assemble the best army, will be given a great fortune. This is a very important task and I hope, it goes without saying, to keep it a secret. Now go. I rely on you.""</i></p>

<br/>Watchmen of Destiny is a card game for 2-5 people. Your role, as a player, will be to hire 7 watchmen who, at the end, may be given the prerogative to protect the Tree of Destiny. Watchmen you hire may be of different species (dog, cat, otter, owl &amp; rabbit) and classes (warrior, assassin, ninja, mage &amp; hunter). Each class has different abilities that can help you during the game.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460225218/w_cards_gberal.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Watchmen don’t offer their services for free, you have to pay them in order to hire them. Some of them will accept just two pieces of gold, but others could be more demanding. But remember, the more expensive watchman you hire, the stronger army you have! Also, the road back to the king’s castle will be long and nights will be cold, so each watchman has to have a tent to lay his head during these cold nights. It’s good to assemble the army fast, but the most important thing is that they are the strongest (=most valuable). The king’s reward is awaiting you!</p>
<p>Watchmen of Destiny is played over a series of rounds, and each player can do 4 steps in his turn. Note that <b>step 1 is obligatory</b>, others are optional. Steps 2, 3, and 4 can be played in any order. Steps 2 and 4 can be played more times. All the watchmen could be either hired or used as a means of payment. Your resources for the transactions are all the pieces of gold on the cards you have in your hand, combined.</p>
<h1><b>Each player can do 4 steps in his turn:</b></h1>
<p><b>Step 1: Pick out one item for the round</b><br/>Pick one item out of two or three items, that are at your disposal. Each item card has its own special effect and it will determine how many cards you draw and how many actions you can perform.</p>

<b>Step 2: Purchase the tent(s)<br/></b>Each tent costs one (1) piece of gold. You have to discard a watchman card in order to purchase a tent. Pieces of gold on cards you discard = number of tents you purchase<br/><p></p>

Steps 2 and 4 can be played more times. All the watchmen could be either hired or used as a means of payment. Your resources for the transactions are all the pieces of gold on the cards you have in your hand, combined.
Each player can do 4 steps in his turn:
Step 1: Pick out one item for the roundPick one item out of two or three items, that are at your disposal. Each item card has its own special effect and it will determine how many cards you draw and how many actions you can perform.


Step 2: Purchase the tent(s)Each tent costs one (1) piece of gold. You have to discard a watchman card in order to purchase a tent. Pieces of gold on cards you discard = number of tents you purchase


Step 3: Hire a watchmanThe principle of hiring a watchman is the same as the principle of purchasing a tent. Each watchman has a different price. Pieces of gold on cards you discard has to be at least the price of the watchman


Step 4: Perform actionsEach round you can perform different number of actions, depending on the item you chose. Type of actions depends on watchmen in your army.

End of the round: At the end of each round players exchange their items in a special way that is described in the rulebook in detail.
End of the game: When one of the players hires his 7th watchman, the game ends on that round. Neither the cards in your hand nor empty tents count for the points at the end of the game. Each player counts the points (you can find details in the rulebook). Different species hired for your army (by you) can DRAMATICALLY influence extra points for the victory. The player with the most points is the winner of the game.

Risks and challenges

There are none, manufacture will take place soon, and you can pre-order Watchmen of Destiny, which will be sent to you in September 2016.

<h3>""What is he talking about?""</h3>
<p>   I've always loved the feel and sensation of an actual arcade machine. Both hands fully engaged, your friend alongside you, and the unique beautiful artwork. There are lots of emulators and remakes of classics, you can even play them on your phone! But no keyboard or touchscreen can beat a real joystick and buttons. Or the ""next game"" quarter rack.</p>
<p>   After lots of research, designing, and planning, I'm ready to build my own arcade machine from parts, not kits. Originally it was going to be a full-size, upright cabinet like you would see in an arcade. However, my current apartment is small, and lumber is heavy. Then I thought of using steel tubing for a basic frame that could be folded up. Easier to move, but heavier and more expensive. How could I fit my dream into a practical size, weight, and budget?</p>
<p>   What I am building will be portable, maybe even mobile. Real arcade controls, connected to a MAME computer, all inside a small, lightweight box. Simply plug it in to the wall and your TV, and let the memories begin!</p>

<li>Everything is being assembled from parts. This means the buttons ($2 each) and joysticks ($10 each), the computer to run it all ($150), and the building materials.</li>
<li>Your input is as important as your donations. I'll ask for your opinions on everything from color scheme and artwork, to game selection and programming. You want Batman? That was MY idea! My Little Ponies? I'll think about it! Maybe. On the bottom. Really small.</li>
<li>Every $5 gets you a vote for the overall theme!</li>
<li>I pledge to be fully transparent and open during this project. I'll provide receipts, photos, etc. I NEED YOUR HELP to do this, and EVERY DOLLAR HELPS! With Indiegogo, I get some money even if I don't reach my goal, which means I can get that much more built.</li>

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Our goal is to create products that save lives! Life Save-R Gunlock is a patented key-less firearm safety device (Patent #6560910) that will be 100% made in America and has unique features such as being water resistant, aesthetically pleasing, stainless steel and GPS tracking which would entice any gun enthusiast. We want to put the best possible product out there to encourage the use of a gun lock on all firearms in the home so that we can protect and save the lives of innocent children who may get their hands on a loaded gun. </p>
<p>Life Save-R Gunlock is easily removed in 2 seconds or less and there are no numbers you need to read so it's just as easy to unlock it with light or in the dark. This is the best way to keep your gun safely locked without compromising the ability to respond to a situation in your home.</p>
<p>Child safety is our main focus, and in an effort to expand on that we are going to set up a non-profit foundation to help families that have been affected by gun violence in our community. This foundation will be ran completely separately from the corporation and will be a source of hope and education for hurting families around the country by helping them pay for counseling they maybe couldn't afford before, going into schools to speak to young students directly and offering financial support to families that could not otherwise afford a funeral service. So with each dollar you donate, it is not just going toward the production and sale of a product, but to the eventually founding of a non-profit. <b>We will give 100% of the funds that we raise to our non-profit foundation 18 months after we go into production for Life Save-R Gunlock.</b></p>

<p>Our slogan is that 'It's easier to childproof a gun than it is to bulletproof a child'. We want to improve gun safety in this country with a high quality product made right here in America. The bottom line is that gun safety is a major issue that needs to be addressed and we can help save lives one gun at a time.</p>

per/year. Our average price point is $139.00 with base models starting at
$99.00 and reaching $189.00 with custom plating patinas; design custom

<h3>What We Need:</h3>
<p>The $30,000 is what we need to go in to production and start taking orders for the gunlock. Right now we can get them made one at a time but that takes 4-6 weeks and is much more expensive on the smaller scale, both of which hurt our ability to service the customer. In order for this idea and this company to be successful in our goals, we need start-up capital to be ready to take as many orders as possible. Once we have access to increased funds, we would be able to fulfill orders within 1-3 business days.</p>
<p>A breakdown of how the money will be spent:</p>
<p></p>

<p>This product and organization can help make a huge difference in our country. With the politically charged issue of gun regulation swirling around in the political sphere with no real solution in sight, why don't we take gun safety into our own hands? There are in excess of 300,000,000 registered firearms in circulation in the United States which is almost one for every man, woman and child  in the country. Life Save-R Gunlock could have helped prevent so many of these tragic shootings that have happened in the last 15 years. With no key that a child can find and no combination the child can guess, this product offers true safety and a fail-safe proof way to secure a weapon without compromising the ability to use the weapon in defense of your home or business.</p>

Contribute to our company now, and we will re-purpose it to found our non-profit organization 18 months after we go into production!
A good example of what we aim to prevent:



Over the course of less than 5 months, 71 children were affected by a gun that was not secured effectively. We want to help lower these numbers through not only the use of our product, but through outreach and education in the community.
Unique Features:
So what is unique about the Life Save-R Gunlock?

                     




It is a key-less gun lock that utilizes five tactile ""touch sensitive"" fingers to lock the firing chamber of your gun with over 32,000 combinations available. There are no numbers on the lock meaning that it's just as easy to unlock it in the dark as it is during the day. It can be unlocked in under 2 seconds under adverse conditions in the dark.
GPS capability that will alert the gun owner via text when the gun is moved while it is not in their possession which allows for immediate response to an unauthorized user.
Impossible to take off of the gun without knowing the 5 position tactile sequence. We even have a video that demonstrates destructive testing. Using a power chop saw with a carbon tipped blade It takes over 8 minutes to cut through the lock housing.  The Life Save-R Gunlock passed the test and remained locked in the firearm.  View the video below and YOU be the judge:

It's made with 100% stainless steel, there are no plastic components which could wear out or fail and it is guaranteed for life.
Water resistant which makes it viable for hunting, fishing and camping. Once the gun lock is installed on your firearm, the entire gun becomes protected from moisture, dirt or debris getting in the barrel or firing chamber.
California Department of Justice has approved this gun safety device which means we have met the highest standards for quality, design and craftsmanship.
       Testimonial from a Steve Hall, a police officer from CA:

""I am a 15-year veteran with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. In my Career, I’ve seen countless numbers of accidental discharges occurring from various types of hand guns and rifles.

This gun lock is aesthetically pleasing with fully customizable options that allows for the product to look its best while installed. This will help eliminate one more reason some gun owners choose to resist the use of gun locks.

The Life Save-R Gunlock goes from the muzzle tip through the barrel and locks in the firing chamber so a bullet cannot be discharged from the gun with the Life Save-R Gunlock installed. Additionally, you can keep a fully loaded magazine in your semi-automatic and the other chambers in a revolver's cylinder can still be loaded.

Our market share projections are infinitesimal. We need only
4 Basis points or (0.0004%) of the existing 300 Million firearms in public
circulation market penetration to attain our sales goal of 120,000 units
per/year. Our average price point is $139.00 with base models starting at

basis point per year with a goal of 300,000 units sold by 2018. With your help,
we can reach this goal and help make our country safer.
This graph shows how that market share compares to other countries:

           So while the US has around 89 guns per 100 people, no other major country comes close. The US is where this product is needed the most and where our market share will be the easiest to obtain.



What We Need:
The $30,000 is what we need to go in to production and start taking orders for the gunlock.

In order for this idea and this company to be successful in our goals, we need start-up capital to be ready to take as many orders as possible. Once we have access to increased funds, we would be able to fulfill orders within 1-3 business days.
A breakdown of how the money will be spent:



Websites - $2500 - used toward a website update which will allow for a more mainstream ordering process that will accomodate an increased number of sales through a much more advanced shopping cart that can display all customizable options. The updated shopping cart will also allow for inventory control, barcoding to keep track of custom orders and it handles shipping options. This will help us keep labor down and make the business much more efficient. It will also go towards the maintenance of our social media pages. 


Prototype - $5000 - Take the existing CAD designs that need to be converted into a 3-D format and provided to a 3-D printing company who will produce the working prototype parts of the gun lock. We currently have existing prototypes but they are the original machined design so we need to verify the functionality of the current designs and have a working prototype prior to going into full-scale production. The new designs are rather simple and just a tweak of the original but it is still prudent to verify that everything is working perfectly before having the product parts casted.


Beginning Productions - $5000-$5500 - Mold Process (Investment Casting Process) - Take our 3-D printed parts from testing the prototype and request a quote from an investment casting house and ask them to produce a score of production-ready parts for us. They will create the molds and become full-scale production ready within 4-6 weeks.


Engraving and Design - $4000: Commission a local engraving artist to custom create intricate designs that will be used for the exquisite engraving patterns available through the customized version of the Life Save-R Gunlock. 


Waterproofing - $3000 - A production company will make a latex skin and will stamp a dye that will be placed in our product to make it water resistant. It will go over the inner stainless steal parts and will seal the product.


GPS Capabilities - $2000-$3000 - Consult with an engineer to get them to map out how to make the GPS function to our specifications within the confined space and send a signal to a 3rd party source (i.e. Qualcom) that will send a text/email to an IOS device or android. The technology has been developed and is in use in mobile devices, we just need to fine tune it to our device. 


Operating capital - $6000 - This is to sustain the business and pay for monthly expenses including marketing materials, transportation to gun shows and other operational costs.


Packaging - $2350 - used toward the design and ordering of the packaging. We want to use a local artist to make a unique design that will speak to the custom attributes of the Life Save-R Gunlock.

As we stated earlier, our aim after this company is established is to start a non-profit foundation that will focus on helping those affected by gun violence and particularly families that have lost a child. This foundation will be ran completely separately from the corporation and will be a source of hope and education for hurting families around the country by helping them pay for counseling they maybe couldn't afford before, going into schools to speak to young students directly and offering financial support to families that could not otherwise afford a funeral service. So with each dollar you donate, it is not just going toward the production and sale of a product, but to the eventually founding of a non-profit.



It's time we put the issue of gun safety into the hands of the gun owner. It's the owner's responsibility to make sure that each firearm is secure and locked and this product allows for the user to keep that gun that is used for home defense to be loaded but fully secure.  Help us make this a reality so that we can start saving lives and helping families today.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">  <b>CaesarIA</b> is an open source, real time strategy game released by Impressions Games in 1998 — Caesar III. <br/><br/>   I remember the first time I played Caesar III. It was a wonderful 
amazingly smart game that made me feel that the city lived its own life 
even after I finished playing. This feeling stays with me ever since. 
One can spend hours observing the life of the city even without 
interfering with it: the plebes and the patricians, the merchants and 
the students — everything and everyone is in balance. This game has 
given me enormous pleasure during many days I have been playing it. 
During any activity in this game such as constructing new buildings or 
taking care of its citizens' health, bargaining with neighbors or 
waiting for the barbarian besieges, you have the feeling as if you were a
 real governor to be known even in Rome.<br/><br/>   
CaesarIA aims to expand the possibilities of this classical 
city-building simulator and to add new features to the city life. 
Currently, the game works on following OSs: Windows, Linux, Mac, Haiku 
and Android.<b></b></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">    Up to now, apart from some minor donations, I spent my own money 
developing this game. In addition to my own work, there was a small 
group of the game's fans supporting me with AI and code. Now the project
 is at the stage when it is impossible to develop it without new 
textures, buildings, sounds and other materials. The estimated cost I 
need to order new graphic resources is approximately 10000$. Another 
reason for adding these new resources is because they can help avoiding claims from the right-holder's side and would make a legal release 
of this remake possible. The funds I ask for in this campaign will help 
me pay the programmers, painters, composers motivating them to release 
their work under an open license.<br/><br/>   
At the present moment I did all the work I have planned to do about the 
world of the game. However, there is still plenty of place for further 
developments. I am just one man and aid from other people could help the
 game to get its own style and become something even more than its 
predecessor ever was. </p>

<p>My name is Michael Fox and games are a huge part of my life. Ever since I was a kid I've been mildly obsessed with small bits of cardboard and plastic miniatures, often trying to modify the games I played into new things and seeing if they could be broken. As a grown up, I'm still playing a lot of games but now I also get to do a little bit more...</p>
<p>In April 2010 I started a blog about games: <a href=""http://littlemetaldog.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Little Metal Dog Show</a>. Named after the fact that when I was a kid I always had to be the dog when we tried to play Monopoly (I've moved on to bigger and better games now, don't worry). It's allowed me the chance to play and talk about an incredible range of things that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to. My favourite thing about the whole project though? The podcast.</p>
<p>In the beginning I didn't really know how I wanted the actual show to go. Somehow I managed to stumble into getting interviews with some interesting folks, and The Little Metal Dog Show was born. Since then, I've managed to get interviews with everyone from incredible designers to documentary film makers, mathematicians to artists... as long as you have something interesting to say about games, you're welcome on the show.</p>
<p>The definite highlight of doing the podcast was invariably the busiest four days of my life - Essen SPIEL 2011. It was my first visit to the biggest games fair in the world and I spent all my time running around, grabbing interviews and talking to pretty much everyone I bumped into. Eventually these interviews were released as four episodes of the show that ended up being some of the most popular I've put out. </p>
<p>Pretty impressive considering I did the whole thing on an iPhone - I simply didn't have the money to buy a proper mp3 recorder. It was a pretty convoluted production process but I managed to put them out and people enjoyed them!</p>
<p>Now SPIEL 2012 is looming on the horizon and I'd love to cover the show again. However, if it's possible, I have even less money than last year! Ahhh, the joys of setting up your own business... Anyway, this is (hopefully) where you guys come in. A few friends suggested that I try a crowd-funding campaign in order to fund the Essen episodes, so here we are!</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! </p></div>","Hey there! 
My name is Michael Fox and games are a huge part of my life. Ever since I was a kid I've been mildly obsessed with small bits of cardboard and plastic miniatures, often trying to modify the games I played into new things and seeing if they could be broken. As a grown up, I'm still playing a lot of games but now I also get to do a little bit more...
In April 2010 I started a blog about games: The Little Metal Dog Show. Named after the fact that when I was a kid I always had to be the dog when we tried to play Monopoly (I've moved on to bigger and better games now, don't worry). It's allowed me the chance to play and talk about an incredible range of things that I otherwise wouldn't have been able to. My favourite thing about the whole project though? The podcast.
In the beginning I didn't really know how I wanted the actual show to go. Somehow I managed to stumble into getting interviews with some interesting folks, and The Little Metal Dog Show was born. Since then, I've managed to get interviews with everyone from incredible designers to documentary film makers, mathematicians to artists... as long as you have something interesting to say about games, you're welcome on the show.
The definite highlight of doing the podcast was invariably the busiest four days of my life - Essen SPIEL 2011. It was my first visit to the biggest games fair in the world and I spent all my time running around, grabbing interviews and talking to pretty much everyone I bumped into. Eventually these interviews were released as four episodes of the show that ended up being some of the most popular I've put out. 
Pretty impressive considering I did the whole thing on an iPhone - I simply didn't have the money to buy a proper mp3 recorder. It was a pretty convoluted production process but I managed to put them out and people enjoyed them!
Now SPIEL 2012 is looming on the horizon and I'd love to cover the show again. However, if it's possible, I have even less money than last year! Ahhh, the joys of setting up your own business... Anyway, this is (hopefully) where you guys come in. A few friends suggested that I try a crowd-funding campaign in order to fund the Essen episodes, so here we are!
So, what will your pledge do? Well, it'll help pay for transport and accommodation to sunny Essen as well as a decent portable audio set up. Free wifi in Germany seems to be a far and distant dream, so it'll also cover paying for a connection. Also: the occasional Currywurst and Mezzo Mix. I am nothing if not easily maintained. Also, if you've not tried Mezzo Mix, you're missing out.
Of course, I don't expect you folks to just fling millions of dollars in the bucket for nothing. We have splendid button badges and stickers! If you like, we'll even send you hand written postcards filled with gratitude from western Germany's finest industrial city! Some lucky folks will also get packs of promotional items and - if you're feeling sufficiently odd and affluent - there will even be DINNER. 
(Please note, it will invariably be Currywurst. Sorry. But I promise currywurst is very tasty.)
Also, everyone who chooses to donate $10 or more will get access to a exclusive supporter-only episode of the show: ""The Road To Essen"".

<p>1949, North Pole. A military research base is built on the site of an alien spaceship crash. The base officially does not exist, it is top secret. For over 70 years only a few people on earth knew of its existence. During that time the base was running flawlessly. It's old construction didn't allow any hi-tech upgrades to be installed. The decision is made – and a new base is built, several kilometers away from the north. The project is called North82.</p>
<p>North82 is the most advanced, self-sufficient research base in the world. Its construction is made using only state of the art technology, even some developed from alien research. Botanical labs, water generating systems, electricity from plasma generators, and alien technology make North82 the most advanced base humans have ever built. The base is used to run genetic research – combining alien and human DNA, also doing further development of alien-based technology and weapons. But then, something happens...</p>
<p>Players get to North82 as a group of special ops characters with a mission to recon and secure the base that has lost communication with the outside world. They find a bloodbath right after exiting the elevator. The whole area is devastated after grenade explosions, wires are hanging from walls and ceiling, furniture is destroyed – all this gives you the impression that there has been regular fighting of some kind. It looks like alien life forms, modified during genetic experiments, have escaped their capsules and have slaughtered the whole crew, making North82 an empty dark tomb.<br/>Mankind has only one chance to solve the mystery of what happened at North82, and to save itself from extermination. They only have one opportunity to know for sure what has happened at the North Pole.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Destroyed hallways of North82 are the dominant part of building the climate of the game. Bloody, destroyed laboratories will increase the mood of thrill while you move through hallways full of alien life forms.<br/>Elements of the base have been transferred to boards, each of them having an unique property, which will influence the way you play. Because of this every scenario will be played differently each time you complete it.</p>
<p>Between 2 and 5 players can play the game. One of the players always controls the aliens; the rest play as special ops characters. The system ruling our game is called Inverse RPG System. The Game Master sets all the goals for the players to complete. He also uses his evil aliens to prevent them from achieving those goals. Each of these aliens can be upgraded by the GM, and become an even worse nightmare for the players. They do what they can to survive – they acquire new equipment and new skills throughout their game.<br/>The mechanics of the game have to be easy to understand. That's why all the necessary information is on the cards and on the boards. You don't have to remember anything,, all the mechanics the players will need to know are right next to them.</p>
<p>Just imagine this. You get a game board that can be set up in limitless ways. You don't have to worry about scenarios that get boring over time. Think about a game where all the mechanics are designed in such a way that you don't have to worry about strict rules while setting up your game with friends. North82 is the game that you have just imagined.</p>
<p>When you set up your base using all the board elements, you create an unique experience. From saving a lost scientist, getting important data, repairing devices, stopping a self-destructing mechanism and getting an antidote for an unknown illness... North82 doesn't limit you at all.</p>
<p>You control the scenario. You create the game.</p>
<p><img alt=""North82 Online Scenario Generator"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://netius.pl/indiegogo/north82/prezentacja/online-generator.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""North82 Online Scenario Generator""/></p>
<p>If you think you will have to spend hours describing every aspect of your scenarios then you are in for a treat. North82 will have its own online scenario generator!</p>
<p>The generator will let you set up all the necessary board elements, you can add descriptions, notes and all kind of things you will need during the game. You can then export it into a PDF file and print it. Yes, with board setup overview you can select one of the predefined templates and edit it. Or you can create a new one from scratch.</p>
<p>The generator is a work in progress – it will be developed regardless of which goal we achieve. We only need a main goal.</p>

1949, North Pole. A military research base is built on the site of an alien spaceship crash. The base officially does not exist, it is top secret. For over 70 years only a few people on earth knew of its existence. During that time the base was running flawlessly. It's old construction didn't allow any hi-tech upgrades to be installed. The decision is made – and a new base is built, several kilometers away from the north. The project is called North82.
North82 is the most advanced, self-sufficient research base in the world. Its construction is made using only state of the art technology, even some developed from alien research. Botanical labs, water generating systems, electricity from plasma generators, and alien technology make North82 the most advanced base humans have ever built. The base is used to run genetic research – combining alien and human DNA, also doing further development of alien-based technology and weapons. But then, something happens...
Players get to North82 as a group of special ops characters with a mission to recon and secure the base that has lost communication with the outside world. They find a bloodbath right after exiting the elevator. The whole area is devastated after grenade explosions, wires are hanging from walls and ceiling, furniture is destroyed – all this gives you the impression that there has been regular fighting of some kind. It looks like alien life forms, modified during genetic experiments, have escaped their capsules and have slaughtered the whole crew, making North82 an empty dark tomb.Mankind has only one chance to solve the mystery of what happened at North82, and to save itself from extermination. They only have one opportunity to know for sure what has happened at the North Pole.
 
Destroyed hallways of North82 are the dominant part of building the climate of the game. Bloody, destroyed laboratories will increase the mood of thrill while you move through hallways full of alien life forms.Elements of the base have been transferred to boards, each of them having an unique property, which will influence the way you play. Because of this every scenario will be played differently each time you complete it.
Between 2 and 5 players can play the game. One of the players always controls the aliens; the rest play as special ops characters. The system ruling our game is called Inverse RPG System. The Game Master sets all the goals for the players to complete. He also uses his evil aliens to prevent them from achieving those goals. Each of these aliens can be upgraded by the GM, and become an even worse nightmare for the players. They do what they can to survive – they acquire new equipment and new skills throughout their game.The mechanics of the game have to be easy to understand. That's why all the necessary information is on the cards and on the boards. You don't have to remember anything,, all the mechanics the players will need to know are right next to them.
Just imagine this. You get a game board that can be set up in limitless ways. You don't have to worry about scenarios that get boring over time. Think about a game where all the mechanics are designed in such a way that you don't have to worry about strict rules while setting up your game with friends. North82 is the game that you have just imagined.
When you set up your base using all the board elements, you create an unique experience. From saving a lost scientist, getting important data, repairing devices, stopping a self-destructing mechanism and getting an antidote for an unknown illness... North82 doesn't limit you at all.
You control the scenario. You create the game.

If you think you will have to spend hours describing every aspect of your scenarios then you are in for a treat. North82 will have its own online scenario generator!
The generator will let you set up all the necessary board elements, you can add descriptions, notes and all kind of things you will need during the game. You can then export it into a PDF file and print it. Yes, with board setup overview you can select one of the predefined templates and edit it. Or you can create a new one from scratch.
The generator is a work in progress – it will be developed regardless of which goal we achieve. We only need a main goal.
We need the money to manufacture the game. All elements are already made but we want the best quality there is. We need approximately 20 000$ to publish our game in the basic form,  and your contributions will help us bring the game to life.

If you'd like to help out, you can pledge any amount! But there are certain perks at certain levels:

North82 will be done by 2013. The premier date is dependent on the production time. The Indiegogo campaign is 120 days long, after this we will need 2 more months to finish all aspects of the game production. As you have read earlier, the whole game has  already been made, so we don't need to develop the content. It could look different if we reach one of our stretch goals. The production time may  take  longer then,  as we would need time to publish the textbook, create new  figures and  new rooms etc.
 
 

We have something special for you. We’ve prepared handmade dicetower for those of you who have made the highest contribution. It’s made out of the best quality material and it’s extremaly silent. Dicetwer is made and signed by Nukedamage.

 
This is how we tested North82. Picture was made about year ago, when our baby game was just a prototype :)
 

 
Payments are processed through Paypal which ensures the security of your transaction and refund, in the event of us not reaching our funding goal. That does not mean that you need to have a Paypal account, nor that you have to create one. You can use any Credit Card.
Please note that the published product may have differences regarding sizes, quantities or layout because of production limitations/adjustments.",45.0,0,"1 Campaign

Every year he visits her, placing a yellow lily and lit candle on her gravestone before watching it burn until extinguished. This tradition had never been broken - until today.

You see, she's missing. She was involved in the old lighthouse incident, you may remember her name - Lily. I've asked the local authorities to look for her, but they haven't got a clue. They tell me horrible things that no parent should hear. They tell me to accept that she may have died. Worst, they tell me they can't help. I can't sleep until I know where she is, if she's safe, if she's scared, and if she's trying to come home but can't find home. Help me find her. Look for her at the Lighthouse, as that was her last known location. </p><p>- Elizabeth Beaumont</p><p>Inside the envelope he finds an address and a single, yellow lily.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503022094/kwkwk8qzwutx3vy03xr1.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503023196/ehuxuv9qxhxlzwcrte7i.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503023212/z9hqgsofliakjz6hvaux.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503023226/ut2rudbcqe3igeci57n5.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503023241/gqjfado9lqsyrbnsjewh.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503023270/x3hzdiqjgd5hrghryxl4.png"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503023310/ui3zd817ipp34jqnmxwp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503023432/pdn5qfdhxf7c3zq7omxe.png"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/516/482/662e1146e6906c69de4e7cfbef22a216_original.PNG?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1500109214&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=dc762f17372962974253f1dccebf61e0"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/516/485/64b489bc9a96a3bcd0197aa858b12d9a_original.PNG?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1500109231&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=7d531d5659bae98b55fcedf26996223f"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/430/294/13776ef8767db845d5e27bff7a51bd80_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1499581806&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=5474a552ad58c86391b31cc6c28de9b8"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/417/158/6ccff257867953a130438b3d8e4534a0_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1499467263&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=4da8db399217cd0968a528a9daec9f1a"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/417/175/b50d73ba9c267162adb5727a361e63a6_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1499467383&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=c6e3213083da7812b849c87f69f45b05"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/472/929/fe8abeeed6b90c6ff8b00c6fe7fd8b60_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1499840438&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=7e6cf700c600b1af584c26d3ad250b43"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/417/168/2281d39288d46a09beb8cb546ef7fc19_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1499467344&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=82689b2b081f1c4cc6d7b489cd404dd9"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/017/430/143/dec056038de3ec1569de71ccf2d7cf87_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1499579948&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=6f869f740c7c6e5c71e85db81198255d"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Shadow Knights Team is so thankful to have the incredibly talented Mimi Page composing The Lighthouse soundtrack.

Irvine is a man who solves the problems that the city doesn't have the inclination to follow-up on, little less solve. Many of the lucrative cases that come to his office are from locals with various requests, from spouses looking to expose infidelity in their relationships to business owners looking to gather enough evidence to incriminate their partners.February 19, 1964 is an important anniversary for PI Irvine as it’s the day he lost his first born, Lily, to cancer 7 years prior. Every year he visits her, placing a yellow lily and lit candle on her gravestone before watching it burn until extinguished. This tradition had never been broken - until today. As he packs to leave his office, candle in hand, he notices a letter slide under his door, the envelope marked: ‘Irvine.’He opens it and reads:Mr. Irvine, My daughter hasn't come home for 2 years, 4 months and 9 days. You see, she's missing. She was involved in the old lighthouse incident, you may remember her name - Lily. I've asked the local authorities to look for her, but they haven't got a clue. They tell me horrible things that no parent should hear. They tell me to accept that she may have died. Worst, they tell me they can't help. I can't sleep until I know where she is, if she's safe, if she's scared, and if she's trying to come home but can't find home. Help me find her. Look for her at the Lighthouse, as that was her last known location. - Elizabeth BeaumontInside the envelope he finds an address and a single, yellow lily.        The Shadow Knights Team is so thankful to have the incredibly talented Mimi Page composing The Lighthouse soundtrack.

She is a talented traditional artist and designer who has worked on video games children’s books, portraits, murals, and much more.""It all started with my IBM PS/1 with its mouse driven graphical interface courtesy of ROM. I was partial to the Microsoft Works “window” which opened to reveal a glaring royal blue word processing screen and blinking white cursor. I would type up short stories to my hearts content, which were ALWAYS scary, and print them on my high tech deafening dot matrix printer. It was the beginning of a fascination for me really, my love for all things computer.Then it happened, from floppy to CD, my Sony VAIO PC with its impressive 166MHz processor with 16MB of RAM, and a 28.8-kbps modem. It shipped with a 3D graphical interface on top of Windows 95. I got my first graphics tablet, corded pen and all. I could sit in Microsoft Paint all day and night. I was an artist from the get go, but art on the computer was combining my two loves and sent my imagination into a frenzy as pixelated as it was. This is what I wanted to do and I knew it with every teenage fiber of my being.I painted, and painted. For more than 20 years I’ve been painting. From murals for schools to illustrations for books, and at Shadow Knights Studio, this traditional brush to canvas gal is painting on a computer. I am living my childhood dream and I feel so grateful to call myself a Knight.Fun Fact for all you Sony VAIO enthusiasts; there is a hidden meaning in Sony's VAIO logo. The first two letters represent an analog signal and the last two are the 1 and 0 of the digital world."" - D.M.Mimi Page | Composer Mimi Page is a singer-songwriter, producer and composer born and raised in Los Angeles, California.

We have shipped games before our most recent shipped title was Love Monsters for iOS.Our process is to speak openly to our fanbase, because we know communication is key. With that said, our biggest hurdle has always been 3D modeling and animations. We're mostly programmers and our biggest obstacle is getting assets we can use to build our worlds. We've contracted out work and so far it has been pretty successful but the problem is environmental cohesion can be lost. [i.e. making sure a cup looks like it is set in the same decade as a chair or table]We believe we have done a great job so far in bringing all the art pieces we have together and we will continue to build our worlds to the highest quality without compromise. We will continue to vocalize our progress on a consistent basis so fans can follow our progress and even learn how we solve problems in real time to develop games.

Until December 18th 2020 you get the chance to get discounted and limited perks while supporting our indie game studio to bring this unique game to life.Thank you very much for your support ❤️ ! The Wandering Village is a city building simulation game. In a world where mysterious plants are spreading all over the earth, emitting toxic spores as they grow, a group of people seeks shelter on the back of a giant, wandering creature they call ‘Onbu’.Become their leader, build their settlement and form a symbiotic relationship with the creature to survive together in this hostile, yet beautiful post-apocalyptic world that now surrounds you. Key Features
Build a village on the back of a giant creature
Farm various crops
Send out foraging missions to gather rare resources
Survive a variety of different biomes and events
Build a relationship with a giant and influence its actions
Ecology/Biology inspired gameplay
Unique blend of 3D and hand-drawn, hand-animated 2D graphics
   At its core, The Wandering Village is a city building and resource management game with rogue-like and survival elements. Farm various crops to keep your villagers fed, send out foraging missions to gather rare resources and scout the environment while constantly expanding the settlement. Of course, living on the back of a living, breathing beast comes with its own challenges, such as helping to maintain the creature’s health and building trust. This might even lead to the beast paying attention to your requests as it wanders through a variety of different biomes, each with its own perks and challenges, always trying to outrun the threat of the toxic spores. (In-game Screenshot)The ultimate goal, for both the humans and the creature, is to find a place where they can settle down and live in peace again. And if they don’t find this place, maybe they can figure out a way to fight back the plants and create it themselves. Core MechanicsSurvival - Escape from the toxic spores and keep your villagers and the creature alive against ever-changing threats. Symbiosis - Live both from and in harmony with the giant creature and form a relationship with it as you trek together through the post-apocalyptic world. Building - Build an infrastructure where your people can live together, work together and survive together. Farming - Plant, cultivate and harvest various crops to keep your villagers and the creature fed and healthy, or grow new kinds of resources. Foraging - Send scouting parties to explore the different biomes surrounding you, discover rare resources and bring them back to your village, opening up new possibilities.  How to support us!  After we came up with the concept for the game, we first started thinking about the general look and feel of the game’s world and how it would affect gameplay. We quickly settled on a blend of painted 2D backgrounds and static assets and hand-animated 2D characters in a 3D world, since it combined the strengths of our team members, was easy to navigate in-game and just looked really charming in our opinion. Initial world sketch.The creature, ‘Onbu’, was probably the most important part of the process as it is both the map where the game takes place and a character in itself. We started with concepts that were pretty close to existing animals, but moved away from this approach over time as we wanted something that you could more sensibly build a village on. Thus, the designs slowly but surely evolved into our very own earthen fantasy creature, the ‘Onbu’. Concept art of Onbu. Process sketches of Onbu.Onbu wanders through a post-apocalyptic world, which was the next part of our art-design process. We wanted this world to be a stark contrast to Onbu to emphasize that it is toxic, wild and uninhabitable. Onbu on the other hand should feel like an island, an oasis, the only thing that makes survival possible for the humans building the settlement on its back. Concept art of the world. Various sketches of the world.Speaking of the humans, the first step in designing them was figuring out their scale, not only to make sense gameplay-wise, but also to be visible enough at any zoom level. As for the design itself, our goal was to make them look friendly, maybe even cute, but also to have them reflect that the world they live in is a dangerous one, which is why we gave them protective clothing. Villagers as they appear in-game. Process sketches.Next were the buildings, which had to look functional while conveying both the original culture of the villagers and their adaptations to living in their new environment. They are constructed from simple materials, and since Onbu’s back is so high up and winds are strong, many of them are powered by wind energy. Colorful flags can often be seen attached to them as they are used to communicate with other villagers. Concept art of farming buildings. Process sketches of various buildings.Various other species besides humans have survived the apocalypse. Most of these creatures are a mix between something familiar, like mammals, and something that seems alien, like giant insects. With this approach, we hope to achieve a result somewhere in the middle, ideally something that is weird, but kinda cute. First sketches of other creatures. InspirationOur main inspirations for the game were the evocative drawings of french artist Moebius and the works of Studio Ghibli, specifically Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind and Princess Mononoke.   The WorldMysterious plants are spreading all over the world, turning the ground toxic and infertile and the air unbreathable.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In 2007, Digital Leisure created ""Space Ace"" for the HD DVD format using video that they spent a long time (and a lot of money) cleaning up from the original film that Don Bluth, Gary Goldman and their teams had created back in 1983 and 1984. Sadly, HD DVD was considered a dead format by the time the game was ready to ship, and so the development was thrown away and the product (although finished) was cancelled.</p>
<p>The <a href=""http://pcmuseum.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Personal Computer Museum</a>, Canada's only interactive computer museum, has resurrected this project and officially licensed it from Digital Leisure. The license allows us to produce up to 250 copies of the game and sell them to you.</p>
<p>This is not the first time the Personal Computer Museum has taken on a project like this. In 2011, the museum received a donated copy of a game called <a href=""http://www.pcmuseum.ca/extraterrestrials.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Extra Terrestrials for the Atari 2600</a> which received a limited distribution run in 1984. The museum was granted the rights to publish a limited reproduction run of the game as a fundraiser. This project is similar in nature.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The project itself is essentially complete but we need your funds to actually manufacture the run of discs with a booklet and sleeve. The game includes the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original 1.33 aspect ratio of the game. The ""cropped"" 1.78 version has been dropped due to technical limitations, but since most people will want the original version of the game we have decided that is what we will be including.</li>
<li>Video commentary from Don Bluth, Gary Goldman and Rick Dyer</li>
<li>Options for number of lives and various other similar options</li>
</ul>
<p>The game will require an HD DVD player in order to work. Your copy will ship shrinkwrapped and you can decide to open it or keep as a collectible. Each copy will be individually numbered and you will be able to clearly see the number without opening the package. Requests for specific numbers will be entertained and dealt with on a first-come, first-served basis. The game can be played in any of the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Xbox 360 with the Microsoft HD DVD player</li>
<li>Stand-alone HD DVD player</li>
<li>A PC equipped with an HD DVD player and the appropriate software</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>There are five perks available. First if you aren't interested in obtaining a physical copy of the game but just want to support our efforts there is the ""Ace"" option for only $5 USD. Our featured package is the ""Valiant Package"":</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Resurrecting a cancelled video game (especially one as complete as this one) is always good for the industry as it gives a chance for the blood, sweat and tears of those behind the project to get some closure. This particular campaign will also help fund-raise for the Personal Computer Museum which not only preserves old technology such as computers, cell phones and so on but is also home to Canada's largest collection of video games. Preservation of video game history is extremely important to us and a successful campaign here will allow us to continue our efforts. </p>

<div>These funds will help cover the costs of the trek from Duluth down to Indianapolis (and back!), as well as our hotel stay and food.  <br/><p>BASIC 1 - A Learning Time is for level 1 characters, and BASIC 2 - A Frightful Time follows immediately afterward for level 2. Both were written with the Pathfinder Beginner Box in mind. That said, they are <em>ver</em>y easily adapted to the core Pathfinder game, or the 3.5 version of the world's oldest RPG.</p>
<p><br/>A0 - Crow's Nest Island is for level 1 characters and leads directly into the events of Adventure a Week's A-series, using the Pathfinder Core and standard 3.5 rules sets. It's available in standard PDF and Fantasy Grounds 2 format. </p>
<p><br/>All three books have maps done by 3x ENnie award winning cartographer Todd Gamble, and are currently enjoying 5 star ratings on Paizo.com.</p>

<p>Gbanga <strong>Famiglia Rise and Fall</strong> is a mafia-themed open world game that
is based on the real world through open data. It turns traditional game
concepts such as racing, heists and strategic organization into an immersive
mobile massive multiplayer online (MMO) outdoor game that you will play everywhere and at all times.</p>
<p><em>We at game studio Gbanga have worked on this type of games since 2007
(see links further down), in 2010 we launched the 2D-mafia game Famiglia I and
this year we want to bring the genre to the next level. On this page we explain
you how.</em></p><p><em><br/></em></p>

Mafioso</h1>
<p>You take the role of an up and coming mafioso who starts in his own
neighborhood. To earn your initial capital, you have to take control of
surrounding bars, restaurants and banks. The raised funds can be invested in
pimping your owned establishments and in travel to remote places
effortlessly.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the police detects you and starts monitoring your
operations. That means, sometimes, you have to escape from the police
helicopter in a spectacular car chase and you must hide from a satellite by
avoiding public squares.</p>
<p>On your way to success, other players and non-player characters (NPCs) can support you, but also
regularly will ask you to return a favor. Like that, you will find yourself
soon as a car driver in a bank hold-up, under DEA observation or patrolling and
defending another ally player’s territory while he is on vacation.</p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">What Is Rise And Fall?</h1>
<p>Game experts would call Rise and Fall an expressive next-generation
cross-platform open-world open-data real-time mixed-reality location-based MMO
game with first-person and third-person gameplay that you will play
everywhere.</p>
<p>The game world is designed to <strong>resemble the real world</strong> to
provide as much open world space as possible with the familiarity that one
needs to carry out geo-based quests. You will be able to do
<strong>long-distance car races</strong> from New York to San Francisco or from
Paris to Dakar. In real time, and yes, it will take you hours! But you can take
breaks ;)</p>
<p>Players <strong>compete over territory</strong> in the persistent MMO world
by playing mini-games and accomplishing quests. They can expand their area of influence by <strong>walking for real</strong> in the real world which -through <strong>GPS</strong>- triggers the virtual avatar to move along with your current location.</p>
<p>The Mafioso players earn a virtual fortune that they can invest to reinforce
their hoods by hiring automated bouncers that patrol the neighborhood and to solidify
their influence by improving the establishment that they own.</p>
<p>Are you ready to <strong>explore</strong> one of the largest open worlds?
Will you become a <strong>notorious gangster</strong> or an business-minded and
reliable ally? How are you going to <strong>maintain</strong> your territory in
a world of scarcity?</p>
<p>Rise and Fall will be released on mobile devices running iOS and
Android.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/321332/files/20140121073315-Quest_System_580px.png?1390318395"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Game World</h1>
<p>The world is more and more controlled by <strong>up and coming
Mafiosos</strong>. It still is not sorted out who is in charge, which areas
belong to whom. This is your opportunity to establish a reign of power, a
<strong>mafia legacy</strong>. But watch out: all other players try as hard as
you do. And space and influence is exclusive…</p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Reality-Inspired World
Generation</h1>
<p>The world of Rise and Fall is based on <strong>real maps</strong> with real
buildings, streets, rivers and lakes. This makes it spacious, extremely
diversified and – of course – realistic. If <strong>you know your
neighborhood</strong> from everyday life, you also know the game world and you
can align your strategy accordingly.</p>
<p>It is filled with <strong>real-world establishments</strong> such as bars,
restaurants and banks. All of them are incorporated in the daily quests that
you have to achieve.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/321333/files/20140121073350-Open_World_Racing_580px.png?1390318430"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Player Choice</h1>
<p>The vast infinity of the game world opens infinite possibilities for the
player. You can engage in mini-game fights, simply explore the world or
strategically gain influence in several cities around the globe.</p>
<p>You are able to accomplish quests such as escape from the police helicopter
or helping as a driver in a bank hold-up.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/321405/files/20140102001834-Famiglias_580px.png?1390321498"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Thriving Community</h1>
<p>In our previous mixed-reality games, we have seen engaged players teaming up
in global groups, meeting at local meet-ups to discuss strategies and to
exchange tricks on how to handle gameplay situations in the physical world.</p>
<p>For Rise and Fall, we want to embrace the same social behaviour. It is why
we will provide a handy feed system with powerful location-based filters,
aggregation of content from public sources like tweets with certain hashtags
and play-style depending news like available nearby quests and resources
occurrences. It will be easy for all players to post content to that stream
from communication tools of their choice, through Twitter hashtags, registered
Facebook groups and in-game chat.</p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Challenging Mini-Games</h1>
<p>Each establishment has its assigned mini-game. For example, you have to
score high in a game with pizza in a pizzeria. In a bank, you have to open the
safe. At a police station, you have to hide from the CCTV surveillance
camera.</p>
<p>The scores of the mini-games <strong>determine the current owner</strong> of
the place. If you score best at Piranha Bar, you are the proud owner of that
establishment and will receive <strong>protection money</strong> until an

<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Geo-Based Quests</h1>
<p>Mini-games are only part of where the action takes place. Quests are
<strong>breathtaking episodes</strong> of criminal daily life. It is a very
divers game element where you interact with the environment, are faced with the
police, assist other players or fight against them.</p>
<p>You have to deliver mysterious parcels from your real-world office location to a public square, investigate in-door places, escape
from the police helicopter, pick up thieves at crime scenes, and fly
helicopters to offshore islands.</p>
<p>Successfully accomplished quests are <strong>rewarded</strong> with
alliances, increased influence and piles of virtual cash.</p>

<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Game API</h1>
<p>One of Rise and Fall‘s main principles is to empower the player in all ways
possible. It is why we want to provide a powerful application programmining interface (API) that enables players to
add content and additional gameplay mechanics that they like.</p>
<p>The API will have basic functions like authentication, access to stats and
inventory, but also interfaces to directly control your player identity and
non-player characters (NPCs) and to create and to manipulate world objects!</p>
<p>The idea behind the API is to provide as much freedom as possible. And we
hope that players will come up with indeed fun and helpful tools that we didn’t
believe in in the first place, but are happy to allow within the explorative
and fun world of Rise and Fall.</p>

<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Technology</h1>
<p>We use a collection of tools that we have used in the past, including:</p>
<p>·<span> </span> Unity engine <em>(for the iOS &amp; Android
clients)</em></p>
<p>·<span> </span> OpenStreetMap.org</p>
<p>·<span> </span> Geonames.org</p>
<p>·<span> </span> SmartFoxServer <em>(for the MMO server part)</em></p>
<p>We are an experienced team of software developers. If there is not a tool or
library available online, we develop our own plugin or framework that we’ll
want to share on GitHub.</p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Team</h1>
<p>Gbanga is an <strong>independent developer</strong>. We are a group of four
passionate and engaged game developers with interdisciplinary backgrounds. We
have been working on  mixed-reality games (similar to Rise and Fall) for
almost 7 years resulting in highly optimized agile iterations of game
development where we use bi-weekly development cycles that result in daily intermediate versions of apps that are ready to use for our testers.</p>

<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Why Indiegogo?</h1>
<p>Indiegogo is a well for creative endeavors that go beyond the current state
of the industries they operate in. We feel that Indiegogo can support our
vision of a <strong>genre-defining game</strong> without limiting our ideas by
a publisher.</p>
<p>Since the gameplay and genre of Rise and Fall is that new, we also count on
you as a smart backer with your valuable <strong>feedback that
influences</strong> how we implement the game.</p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Stretch Goals</h1>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We have decided to split our development
into different phases to make sure the game project comes to life for sure.
With the initial goal, we can fund the development of the basic game with an
open world and mini-games. With additional funds, we will be able to focus on
deeper game mechanics, a more sophisticated environment and an infinite rich
treasure of quests through the Game API.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Different than in other crowd-funding
campaigns, we are very transparent and open with our additional stretch goals
from the beginning. We believe that our backers should know from the beginning
which features might be added to the game in a later funding stage. We hope you
also prefer this approach.</span></p>

<p>We are planning to use the funds for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Basic salaries for our team of four</li>
<li>Purchase of required software plugins and licenses to speed up
	development</li>
<li>Work for hire for sounds, soundtrack, art assets and models</li>

</ul><p></p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Schedule</h1>
<p>The following is a rough schedule of the game. Possibly, the development
progress is faster. However, we wanted to outline a defensive plan that we can
honestly guarantee:</p>
<ul>
<li>April 2014: Milestone <strong>A</strong>, game engine with two
	mini-games; alpha phase starts...</li>
<li>May 2014: <strong>B+C</strong>, world-wide real-world map, collect
	items and build stuff</li>
<li>June 2014: <strong>D+E</strong>, more mini-games, power-ups and defence
	items; beta phase starts...</li>
<li>August 2014: <strong>F+G</strong>, transportation, racing and quest
	system</li>
<li>September 2014: <strong>H</strong>, multi-layer strategy; public
	launch...</li>
<li>November 2014: <strong>I</strong>, cross-platform</li>
<li>January 2015: <strong>J</strong>, offline mode</li>
<li>March 2015: <strong>K</strong>, game API</li>
</ul><p>Based on tools and added staff, we can improve speed significantly.</p>
<p></p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Business Model</h1>
<p>Gbanga Famiglia Rise and Fall is a sophisticated game- and service. We
therefore need money to update the game regularly and to maintain the server
infrastructure that runs the game.</p>
<ul>
<li>We plan to offer the game app for free to invite as many players to
	participate in the game world as possible</li>
<li>As part of the <em>Freemium</em> model, we want to offer in-game
	purchases for the customization of the character and unlocking extended
	features. However, purchasable items should never be helping to win more
	easily.</li>
<li>Further, we want to offer a subscription service that unlocks extended
	features on an ongoing basis. Every month, subscribed players will
	automatically unlock all extended features from in-app purchases and some
	extras only available to subscribers. Subscribed players will never be
	offered or prompted to buy other in-app purchases during natural
	gameplay.</li>
</ul><p>Gameplay comes first! We are aware that free-to-play games are not the first
choice of experienced players (core &amp; hardcore gamers). It is why we want
to put the emphasis on the subscription model with classic uninterrupted
gameplay experience that, at the same time, supports our ongoing server costs
and content updates. On the other hand side, the free-to-play option with in
app purchases will open up the game to newbies and occasional players that want
to have a look at the game or which might be just used to the <em>Freemium</em>
model.</p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h1>
<p>Gbanga is a small independent game studio and Rise and Fall is an
extraordinary visionary project. However, we are an experienced team that is
used to work on tight budgets and ambitious deadlines.</p>
<p>We are very experienced in creating mixed-reality games like <em>Rise
and Fall</em> that use open data and GPS location. However, we want to
address your concerns and potential threads and how we mitigate risks:</p>
<p><strong>Project duration</strong>: To make sure that the game, we will work
in an iterative, agile method, prioritizing features on a daily basis. We have
worked with agile methods for several years. We're currently in our 100th
sprint.</p>
<p><strong>Feature complexity</strong>: Most of the features that we envision
in this game are novel, but we already worked on those exact problems in other
games in the past. Already in 2009, we have processed huge amount of map
data from OpenStreetMap. Our precursor game <em>Gbanga Famiglia
1</em> used GPS as a core gameplay element and was real-time MMO
multiplayer on iPhone and Android. We introduced the Puppetmaster
API in 2011.</p>
<p><strong>Difficult usability</strong>: The game concept is based on an open
world and we plan to have as little as possible overlay user interfaces. Most
interactions are very natural, like taking a cab to the airport or entering a
restaurant. Also the mini-games are simple to use and are designed to be easily
and quickly comprehensible.</p>
<p><strong>Feature overdose</strong>: There is a natural filter in the game.
It's location. You cannot make everything at the same place, but you have to
walk around to find new features. </p>
<p><strong>Vandalism through Game API</strong>: User contribution and
programmatic control is vulnerable to vandalism and unfriendly activity. We
have learned the lesson with our first Game API in 2011. Everything will be
controlled through user authentication, user management and reporting. It is
why all activity through the API is logged and is marked in-game accordingly.
Players can also opt out all together to see such content. And we can “roll
back” potential vandalism.</p>
<h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">FAQs - frequently answered questions</h1>
<p>Are you experienced at all?</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Yes, we are. After 7 years of
	developing mixed-reality games together as a team, we feel very confident
	to deliver a fun and working game.</i></span></li>
</ul><p></p><p>Flexible Funding? What if you don't reach your funding goal?</p><ul>
<li><i>We are aware of the biggest risk in crowd-funding: not reaching the funding goal. We have set up the flexible funding mode because we are already developing the game. Crowd-funds will allow us to develop the game quicker, release it sooner and with more artistic freedom than with other sources of funding.</i></li>
<li><i>We will deliver all perks to the backers, no matter if we reach our full funding goal or not.</i></li>
</ul><p></p>
<p>What distribution platform will Rise and Fall be released on?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Based on the stretch goal reached, we will publish the game on
	different platforms. Initially, it will be available on iOS and Android. If
	we reach stretch goal I, we will port the game to a console like OUYA or
	create a PC/Mac version.</em></li>
</ul><p>Is Rise and Fall a multiplayer game?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gbanga Famiglia Rise and Fall is a multiplayer game where all
	players share the same persistent game world. This means the game requires
	connectivity to a game server. </em></li>
</ul><p>Does Rise and Fall require a permanent internet connection?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yes, and no. For the real-time gameplay mechanics such as
	player-vs-player activities and discovering new areas, an internet
	connection is required to transmit player actions and downloading new map
	data. However, we are considering implementing an offline mode (see stretch
	goal J) where a lot of data is pre-fetched and player activity then synched
	back to the server once there is connection again.</em></li>
</ul><p>What is the power consumption of Rise and Fall while using GPS and
3G/4G?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We are aware of this drawback of a real-time MMO mobile game. We
	will implement the location-aware part in a way that is friendly to the
	battery. For instance with a ""travel"" mode that is constantly polling the
	location and a ""relax"" mode that assumes you are stationary until you press
	a ""travel"" button.</em></li>
</ul><p>Is Rise and Fall working in my town or neighbourhood?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Most probably yes. We use
	data from the open source project OpenStreetMap for the generation of our
	game world. Since it is contributed by volunteers, it means both, that on
	one side, it is never complete and on the other hand side, you can add
	missing towns, streets and buildings easily by contributing some mapping
	work on OpenStreetMap's website. We provide a <a href=""http://gbanga.com/games/rise-and-fall/map-coverage/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">coverage map</a> that we have created for Rise and Fall. Red areas
	and grey-black lines indicate that there are buildings and streets, white
	means there is possibly nothing. Make sure you zoom in
	closely:</em><br/>

<p>How can you have such a small budget for a complex game like Rise and
Fall?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We already have started working on the project and have a playable
	alpha version with a lot of work in it. To make it a full game that is fun
	to play, some more work is needed, for which we are looking for funding.
	However, the complete scope of the project can only be realised as part of
	our stretch goals (see section above).</em></li>
</ul><p><em>Is Rise and Fall a sequel?</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Yes, in April 2010 we developed Gbanga Famiglia, our first
	mafia-themed MMO game. The game was an early attempt to the mixed-reality
	genre, still in 2D at the time. In a few month, we built everything, the
	concept, the graphics, the programming of client and server. The game was
	quite a success among hardcore players that enjoyed using their GPS-powered
	iPhones in a different way for the first time.</em></li>
</ul><p>Can I pledge to your campaign via PayPal?</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Probably yes. We have set up a PayPal account which currently
	works. If you have trouble paying through PayPal, please let us know
	at <a href=""mailto:indiegogo@gbanga.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">indiegogo@gbanga.com</a>.</em></li>
</ul><h1 style=""font-family: 'BatmanForeverAlternate', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Mixed-Reality Gaming</h1>
<p>Mixed-reality games incorporate real-world elements in virtual games. This
can be visual, audible or tangible.</p>
<p>We take map material and other sources of data to create a virtual world
that looks pretty much like the real world. It is very likely that even your
neighbourhood or home street is featured in the game world. As a Rise and Fall
player, you will play a mafioso and will visit as many real-world places that
can then try to take over. Possessed establishments will then give you
protection money in return.</p>

<p>Mixed-reality is a term we borrowed from Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino,
both scientists that have worked on Augmented Reality, something what we have
seen in movies like Terminator and Minority Report. However, we believe that
the immersion of gameplay should be more similar to the movie The Game (1997,
featuring Michael Douglas) where your life is in the first place, and the game
tries to adapt to your lifestyle to entertain you more smoothly.</p>

is based on the real world through open data. It turns traditional game
concepts such as racing, heists and strategic organization into an immersive
mobile massive multiplayer online (MMO) outdoor game that you will play everywhere and at all times.
We at game studio Gbanga have worked on this type of games since 2007
(see links further down), in 2010 we launched the 2D-mafia game Famiglia I and
this year we want to bring the genre to the next level. On this page we explain
you how.
""A mafia-based MMO that's about the size of Earth"" PocketGamerThe Rise Of A New
Mafioso
You take the role of an up and coming mafioso who starts in his own
neighborhood. To earn your initial capital, you have to take control of
surrounding bars, restaurants and banks. The raised funds can be invested in
pimping your owned establishments and in travel to remote places
effortlessly.
In the meanwhile, the police detects you and starts monitoring your
operations. That means, sometimes, you have to escape from the police
helicopter in a spectacular car chase and you must hide from a satellite by
avoiding public squares.
On your way to success, other players and non-player characters (NPCs) can support you, but also
regularly will ask you to return a favor. Like that, you will find yourself
soon as a car driver in a bank hold-up, under DEA observation or patrolling and
defending another ally player’s territory while he is on vacation.
What Is Rise And Fall?
Game experts would call Rise and Fall an expressive next-generation
cross-platform open-world open-data real-time mixed-reality location-based MMO
game with first-person and third-person gameplay that you will play
everywhere.
The game world is designed to resemble the real world to
provide as much open world space as possible with the familiarity that one
needs to carry out geo-based quests. You will be able to do
long-distance car races from New York to San Francisco or from
Paris to Dakar. In real time, and yes, it will take you hours! But you can take
breaks ;)
Players compete over territory in the persistent MMO world
by playing mini-games and accomplishing quests. They can expand their area of influence by walking for real in the real world which -through GPS- triggers the virtual avatar to move along with your current location.
The Mafioso players earn a virtual fortune that they can invest to reinforce
their hoods by hiring automated bouncers that patrol the neighborhood and to solidify
their influence by improving the establishment that they own.
Are you ready to explore one of the largest open worlds?
Will you become a notorious gangster or an business-minded and
reliable ally? How are you going to maintain your territory in
a world of scarcity?
Rise and Fall will be released on mobile devices running iOS and
Android.

Game World
The world is more and more controlled by up and coming
Mafiosos. It still is not sorted out who is in charge, which areas
belong to whom. This is your opportunity to establish a reign of power, a
mafia legacy. But watch out: all other players try as hard as
you do. And space and influence is exclusive…
Reality-Inspired World
Generation
The world of Rise and Fall is based on real maps with real
buildings, streets, rivers and lakes. This makes it spacious, extremely
diversified and – of course – realistic. If you know your
neighborhood from everyday life, you also know the game world and you
can align your strategy accordingly.
It is filled with real-world establishments such as bars,
restaurants and banks. All of them are incorporated in the daily quests that
you have to achieve.

Player Choice
The vast infinity of the game world opens infinite possibilities for the
player. You can engage in mini-game fights, simply explore the world or
strategically gain influence in several cities around the globe.
You are able to accomplish quests such as escape from the police helicopter
or helping as a driver in a bank hold-up.

Thriving Community
In our previous mixed-reality games, we have seen engaged players teaming up
in global groups, meeting at local meet-ups to discuss strategies and to
exchange tricks on how to handle gameplay situations in the physical world.
For Rise and Fall, we want to embrace the same social behaviour. It is why
we will provide a handy feed system with powerful location-based filters,
aggregation of content from public sources like tweets with certain hashtags
and play-style depending news like available nearby quests and resources
occurrences. It will be easy for all players to post content to that stream
from communication tools of their choice, through Twitter hashtags, registered
Facebook groups and in-game chat.
Challenging Mini-Games
Each establishment has its assigned mini-game. For example, you have to
score high in a game with pizza in a pizzeria. In a bank, you have to open the
safe. At a police station, you have to hide from the CCTV surveillance
camera.
The scores of the mini-games determine the current owner of
the place. If you score best at Piranha Bar, you are the proud owner of that
establishment and will receive protection money until an
opponent player beats your hi-score.
Like your influence decreases over time, your scores “wear out” over
time to make it easier for opponents to beat you and to encourage you
to revisit places that you own.Updated: An early-stage pre-alpha tutorial quest where the player hijacks a car and rides to a specific nearby place.
Geo-Based Quests
Mini-games are only part of where the action takes place. Quests are
breathtaking episodes of criminal daily life. It is a very
divers game element where you interact with the environment, are faced with the
police, assist other players or fight against them.
You have to deliver mysterious parcels from your real-world office location to a public square, investigate in-door places, escape
from the police helicopter, pick up thieves at crime scenes, and fly
helicopters to offshore islands.
Successfully accomplished quests are rewarded with
alliances, increased influence and piles of virtual cash.

Game API
One of Rise and Fall‘s main principles is to empower the player in all ways
possible. It is why we want to provide a powerful application programmining interface (API) that enables players to
add content and additional gameplay mechanics that they like.
The API will have basic functions like authentication, access to stats and
inventory, but also interfaces to directly control your player identity and
non-player characters (NPCs) and to create and to manipulate world objects!
The idea behind the API is to provide as much freedom as possible. And we
hope that players will come up with indeed fun and helpful tools that we didn’t
believe in in the first place, but are happy to allow within the explorative
and fun world of Rise and Fall.

Technology
We use a collection of tools that we have used in the past, including:
·  Unity engine (for the iOS & Android
clients)
·  OpenStreetMap.org
·  Geonames.org
·  SmartFoxServer (for the MMO server part)
We are an experienced team of software developers. If there is not a tool or
library available online, we develop our own plugin or framework that we’ll
want to share on GitHub.
Team
Gbanga is an independent developer. We are a group of four
passionate and engaged game developers with interdisciplinary backgrounds. We
have been working on  mixed-reality games (similar to Rise and Fall) for
almost 7 years resulting in highly optimized agile iterations of game
development where we use bi-weekly development cycles that result in daily intermediate versions of apps that are ready to use for our testers.
Our past games include Gbanga Famiglia (iOS, experimental AR version for Android), Pilotifant and After Party.

Why Indiegogo?
Indiegogo is a well for creative endeavors that go beyond the current state
of the industries they operate in. We feel that Indiegogo can support our
vision of a genre-defining game without limiting our ideas by
a publisher.
Since the gameplay and genre of Rise and Fall is that new, we also count on
you as a smart backer with your valuable feedback that
influences how we implement the game.
Stretch Goals
We have decided to split our development
into different phases to make sure the game project comes to life for sure.
With the initial goal, we can fund the development of the basic game with an
open world and mini-games. With additional funds, we will be able to focus on
deeper game mechanics, a more sophisticated environment and an infinite rich
treasure of quests through the Game API.
Different than in other crowd-funding
campaigns, we are very transparent and open with our additional stretch goals
from the beginning. We believe that our backers should know from the beginning
which features might be added to the game in a later funding stage. We hope you
also prefer this approach.

Reward Chart

Use Of Funds
We are planning to use the funds for the following:

Basic salaries for our team of four
Purchase of required software plugins and licenses to speed up
	development
Work for hire for sounds, soundtrack, art assets and models
Rental of required game server infrastructure

Office rent and power
	bills

Manufacturing and shipping of
	T-shirts, stickers and postcards
Indiegogo, Paypal and transaction
	fees

Schedule
The following is a rough schedule of the game. Possibly, the development
progress is faster. However, we wanted to outline a defensive plan that we can
honestly guarantee:

April 2014: Milestone A, game engine with two
	mini-games; alpha phase starts...
May 2014: B+C, world-wide real-world map, collect
	items and build stuff
June 2014: D+E, more mini-games, power-ups and defence
	items; beta phase starts...
August 2014: F+G, transportation, racing and quest
	system
September 2014: H, multi-layer strategy; public
	launch...
November 2014: I, cross-platform
January 2015: J, offline mode
March 2015: K, game API
Based on tools and added staff, we can improve speed significantly.

Business Model
Gbanga Famiglia Rise and Fall is a sophisticated game- and service. We
therefore need money to update the game regularly and to maintain the server
infrastructure that runs the game.

We plan to offer the game app for free to invite as many players to
	participate in the game world as possible
As part of the Freemium model, we want to offer in-game
	purchases for the customization of the character and unlocking extended
	features. However, purchasable items should never be helping to win more
	easily.
Further, we want to offer a subscription service that unlocks extended
	features on an ongoing basis. Every month, subscribed players will
	automatically unlock all extended features from in-app purchases and some
	extras only available to subscribers. Subscribed players will never be
	offered or prompted to buy other in-app purchases during natural
	gameplay.
Gameplay comes first! We are aware that free-to-play games are not the first
choice of experienced players (core & hardcore gamers). It is why we want
to put the emphasis on the subscription model with classic uninterrupted
gameplay experience that, at the same time, supports our ongoing server costs
and content updates. On the other hand side, the free-to-play option with in
app purchases will open up the game to newbies and occasional players that want
to have a look at the game or which might be just used to the Freemium
model.
Risks & Challenges
Gbanga is a small independent game studio and Rise and Fall is an
extraordinary visionary project. However, we are an experienced team that is
used to work on tight budgets and ambitious deadlines.
We are very experienced in creating mixed-reality games like Rise
and Fall that use open data and GPS location. However, we want to
address your concerns and potential threads and how we mitigate risks:
Project duration: To make sure that the game, we will work
in an iterative, agile method, prioritizing features on a daily basis. We have
worked with agile methods for several years. We're currently in our 100th
sprint.
Feature complexity: Most of the features that we envision
in this game are novel, but we already worked on those exact problems in other
games in the past. Already in 2009, we have processed huge amount of map
data from OpenStreetMap. Our precursor game Gbanga Famiglia
1 used GPS as a core gameplay element and was real-time MMO
multiplayer on iPhone and Android. We introduced the Puppetmaster
API in 2011.
Difficult usability: The game concept is based on an open
world and we plan to have as little as possible overlay user interfaces. Most
interactions are very natural, like taking a cab to the airport or entering a
restaurant. Also the mini-games are simple to use and are designed to be easily
and quickly comprehensible.
Feature overdose: There is a natural filter in the game.
It's location. You cannot make everything at the same place, but you have to
walk around to find new features. 
Vandalism through Game API: User contribution and
programmatic control is vulnerable to vandalism and unfriendly activity. We
have learned the lesson with our first Game API in 2011. Everything will be
controlled through user authentication, user management and reporting. It is
why all activity through the API is logged and is marked in-game accordingly.
Players can also opt out all together to see such content. And we can “roll
back” potential vandalism.
FAQs - frequently answered questions
Are you experienced at all?

Yes, we are. After 7 years of
	developing mixed-reality games together as a team, we feel very confident
	to deliver a fun and working game.
Flexible Funding? What if you don't reach your funding goal?
We are aware of the biggest risk in crowd-funding: not reaching the funding goal. We have set up the flexible funding mode because we are already developing the game. Crowd-funds will allow us to develop the game quicker, release it sooner and with more artistic freedom than with other sources of funding.
We will deliver all perks to the backers, no matter if we reach our full funding goal or not.

What distribution platform will Rise and Fall be released on?

Based on the stretch goal reached, we will publish the game on
	different platforms. Initially, it will be available on iOS and Android. If
	we reach stretch goal I, we will port the game to a console like OUYA or
	create a PC/Mac version.
Is Rise and Fall a multiplayer game?

Gbanga Famiglia Rise and Fall is a multiplayer game where all
	players share the same persistent game world. This means the game requires
	connectivity to a game server. 
Does Rise and Fall require a permanent internet connection?

Yes, and no. For the real-time gameplay mechanics such as
	player-vs-player activities and discovering new areas, an internet
	connection is required to transmit player actions and downloading new map
	data. However, we are considering implementing an offline mode (see stretch
	goal J) where a lot of data is pre-fetched and player activity then synched
	back to the server once there is connection again.
What is the power consumption of Rise and Fall while using GPS and
3G/4G?

We are aware of this drawback of a real-time MMO mobile game. We
	will implement the location-aware part in a way that is friendly to the
	battery. For instance with a ""travel"" mode that is constantly polling the
	location and a ""relax"" mode that assumes you are stationary until you press
	a ""travel"" button.
Is Rise and Fall working in my town or neighbourhood?


Most probably yes. We use
	data from the open source project OpenStreetMap for the generation of our
	game world. Since it is contributed by volunteers, it means both, that on
	one side, it is never complete and on the other hand side, you can add
	missing towns, streets and buildings easily by contributing some mapping
	work on OpenStreetMap's website. We provide a coverage map that we have created for Rise and Fall. Red areas
	and grey-black lines indicate that there are buildings and streets, white
	means there is possibly nothing. Make sure you zoom in
	closely:


How can you have such a small budget for a complex game like Rise and
Fall?

We already have started working on the project and have a playable
	alpha version with a lot of work in it. To make it a full game that is fun
	to play, some more work is needed, for which we are looking for funding.
	However, the complete scope of the project can only be realised as part of
	our stretch goals (see section above).
Is Rise and Fall a sequel?

Yes, in April 2010 we developed Gbanga Famiglia, our first
	mafia-themed MMO game. The game was an early attempt to the mixed-reality
	genre, still in 2D at the time. In a few month, we built everything, the
	concept, the graphics, the programming of client and server. The game was
	quite a success among hardcore players that enjoyed using their GPS-powered
	iPhones in a different way for the first time.
Can I pledge to your campaign via PayPal?

Probably yes. We have set up a PayPal account which currently
	works. If you have trouble paying through PayPal, please let us know
	at indiegogo@gbanga.com.
Mixed-Reality Gaming
Mixed-reality games incorporate real-world elements in virtual games. This
can be visual, audible or tangible.
We take map material and other sources of data to create a virtual world
that looks pretty much like the real world. It is very likely that even your
neighbourhood or home street is featured in the game world. As a Rise and Fall
player, you will play a mafioso and will visit as many real-world places that
can then try to take over. Possessed establishments will then give you
protection money in return.

(Image source: Wikipedia, Reality-Virtuality
Continuum)
Mixed-reality is a term we borrowed from Paul Milgram and Fumio Kishino,
both scientists that have worked on Augmented Reality, something what we have
seen in movies like Terminator and Minority Report. However, we believe that
the immersion of gameplay should be more similar to the movie The Game (1997,
featuring Michael Douglas) where your life is in the first place, and the game
tries to adapt to your lifestyle to entertain you more smoothly.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey guys, my name is Bobby and I'm an aspiring game developer from Toronto Canada. I own a small business called Highcastle Studios. I'm very passionate about creating games and this is my shot at making my dreams come true. My project ""Point Perfect"" is already making a splash on Steams Greenlight voting platform. Point Perfect is sort of a casual game for the hardcore gamer. In this whimsical world, the mouse cursor is your ship. Navigate it through all sorts of retro arcade perils. Draw boxes around enemies for the mothership to shoot down. Easy to learn, but hard to master. Point Perfect's gameplay is dynamic in the sense that every game you play is different. Randomly generated levels and bosses each time you play. My video showcases an early build of the game. Expect lots of unlockables, extras, and easter eggs in final version.</p>

The money will go towards all of the sound effects and music that needs to be purchased for ownership. There has also been a lot of hidden costs on software and marketing and there will only be more of it. And finally, there is some money needed for distribution when the game is finished (e-commerce etc.)</p>
<p>So what do you get?  Well, how about becoming a hidden boss character in my published game!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The road to get to this stage of development has been very rewarding but also very stressful. Your contributions will help so much with all of the hidden costs, but more importantly will help inspire me to make the best game I can for you guys. Its a good feeling to know that there are others who share your vision. I think my game offers something unique for the casual gamer. It really does have to be played to believe it. With your donation, I promise to create the best product I can.</p>

<b>You play Tony, a young man passionate about football</b>, who lives football, sleeps football, eats football, who... football -)  A charming boy, he firmly believes in his chances of success. He even believes it a bit too much! This is what he wrote in his personal blog, for example:<br/><br/>
<span style=""font-style: italic;"">
""I'm the best, and the whole world will soon learn that! Think I'm crazy? Look, I'm training so much that I have more techniques than Pele and Maradona’s kids! What? You didn’t know they had one LOL? Will you come with me and help me to ridicule all the so-called best players in the world? ""
</span><br/><br/>
We warned you! :-)<br/><br/>

But he's right on one point... He's really good! Help him penalize Cristiano, Zlatan and other kings of football!
</p>
<div style=""width: 100%; text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/794968/files/20140818022946-how_to_play.png?1408354186"" src="""" style=""margin-top: 40px;""/></div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Tony has decided to travel the world to prove to everyone he is the best with the ball. So he will go through all the cities with the greatest players in order to make them pathetic. What better way to start than in Brazil?
<br/><b><b>Tony’s primary goal is to make it to the stadium to confront the players. He’s therefore going to run through the city or take shortcuts by cutting along the beach.</b> He will have to avoid all the obstacles that stand in his way, for example: 
</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>In town :</b> scaffolding, traffic lights that drop and fall on him, drones remotely controlled by children, fire hydrants, etc.</li>
<li>
<b>On the beach :</b> sand castles, kites, parasols, coconuts, birds which attack him to take his ball, etc.</li>
<li>
<b>In town &amp; on the beach :</b> some...monsters! And yes, it seems that the city is not very safe these days :-) In Soccer Dash, you will face and collect the monsters like trophies!</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
In addition, to avoid some obstacles he can shoot with his ball to knock out others. <b>He must also score goals sometimes to access hidden levels, for example.</b> Of course, there will also be many options of all kinds, each making it crazier!
<br/>
Once at the stadium, the gameplay completely changes. We switch to some very dynamic QTE (quick time events), and the challenge is to dribble and ridicule the pro players who stand in our way!

<b>Humor is omnipresent</b> at the visual level, but also in the situations, as this enormous confidence Tony has will certainly play tricks on him at times!

Currently you can see this interview with his former teacher, who gets out of hand and brings out old records on Tony.

We’re developing Soccer Dash with our own funds, and spend most of our time on it. To enable us to have a chance to go as far as possible in the development of all the crazy options and levels that we have in mind, we need support.
In fact, <b>the creation of such a game is expensive</b>, especially if you pay attention to all the details that make it a quality game.
<br/><br/>
As we’re developing Soccer Dash with our own funds, the budgets below do not include our compensation, but only the external costs (hiring a graphic designer and an additional developer for specific needs, for example). <b>This is very important because it means that even if the campaign does not reach its goal, we can still launch the game</b>, but in a less abundant and therefore less interesting version.
<br/><br/>
<b>Every euro received will be used to push the realization further</b>, both in terms of quality graphics &amp; sound, and the quantity and the madness of the options available in the game, hidden levels, etc. We have extremely positive feedback from the first tests of the alpha version, and we know that Dash Soccer has a huge potential to bring you fun as players. <br/><br/>
We know that a lot of games that have benefitted from a crowd funding campaign have been slow to emerge. We believe that if you, friends, are willing to help us, then <b>the least we can do is to provide you with the game as soon as possible</b>, while meeting our requirements in terms of quality. That's why we have a tight production schedule, with realistic goals.
<br/><br/>
<b>If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us before making a donation.</b> We want to be as transparent as possible. We know there are many other games that are also seeking funding. That is why we want the people who are supporting us to know exactly what they are supporting, what their money is being used for!

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Soccer Dash est un jeu d'arcade pour plate-formes mobiles Android et iOS, un runner nouvelle génération doté d'un gameplay tout frais. Mais de quoi s'agit-il ?<br/><br/>
<b>Vous incarnez Tony, un jeune homme passionné de football</b>, qui vit football, qui dort football, qui mange football, qui... football :-) Garçon charmant, il croit fermement en ses chances de réussite. Il y croit même un peu trop ! Voilà ce qu'il écrit par exemple dans son blog perso :<br/><br/>
<span style=""font-style: italic;"">
""Je suis le meilleur, et le monde entier l'apprendra très bientôt !

Vous pensez que je suis un dingue ? Ecoutez, je m'entraîne tellement que je suis plus technique que le gamin de Pelé et Maradona ! Quoi ? Vous ne saviez pas qu'ils en avaient un lol ? Pourrez-vous me suivre et m'aider à ridiculiser tous les soi-disant meilleurs joueurs de la planète ?""
</span><br/><br/>
On vous avait prévenu ! :-)<br/><br/>

Mais il a raison sur un point.. Il est vraiment doué ! Venez l'aider, venez mettre à l'amende Cristiano, Zlatan et les autres rois du ballon rond !
</p>
<div style=""width: 100%; text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/959358/files/20141025190025-commentonjoue.png?1414288825"" src="""" style=""margin-top: 40px;""/></div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
Tony a ainsi décidé de parcourir le monde pour prouver à tous qu’il est le meilleur balle au pied. Il va donc parcourir toutes les villes où se trouvent les plus grands joueurs, dans le but de les mettre minables. Quoi de mieux pour commencer que le Brésil ?
<br/><b>Le premier but de Tony est déjà d’atteindre le stade pour affronter les joueurs. Il va donc courir dans la ville ou bien prendre des raccourcis en coupant par la plage.</b> Il lui faudra éviter toutes les embûches qui se dresseront sur son chemin, par exemple :
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>En ville :</b> des échafaudages, des feux tricolores qui se décrochent et lui tombent dessus, des drones télécommandés par des enfants, des bouches d’incendie, etc.</li>
<li>
<b>Sur la plage :</b> des châteaux de sable, des cerfs-volants, des parasols, des noix de coco, des oiseaux qui lui foncent dessus pour lui prendre son ballon, etc.</li>
<li>
<b>En ville &amp; sur la plage :</b> des...monstres ! Et oui, il semblerait que la ville ne soit pas très sûre ces temps-ci :-) Dans Soccer Dash, vous allez affronter et collectionner les monstres <b>comme des Pokemons !</b>
</li>
</ul>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
En plus d’éviter certains obstacles, il pourra shooter avec son ballon pour en dégommer d’autres. <b>Il devra marquer des buts aussi par moment pour accéder à des niveaux cachés par exemple.</b> Bien sûr, il y aura aussi beaucoup d’options en tous genres, que l’on va faire plus délirantes les unes que les autres !
<br/>
Une fois arrivé au stade, le gameplay change totalement. On passe à du QTE (quick time events) très dynamique, et le challenge est de dribbler, et ridiculiser les joueurs pros qui se dresseront sur notre chemin !

Nous développons Soccer Dash en fonds propres, et y passons le plus clair de notre temps. Pour nous permettre d’avoir une chance d’aller le plus loin possible dans le développement de toutes les options dingues et les niveaux que nous avons en tête, nous avons besoin de soutien.
<br/>En effet, <b>la création d'un tel jeu coûte cher</b>, surtout si l'on porte attention à tous les détails qui font que le jeu sera de qualité.
<br/><br/>
Comme nous développons Soccer Dash en fonds propres, les budgets ci-dessous ne comportent pas notre rémunération, mais uniquement les frais externes (engager un graphiste et un développeur supplémentaires pour des besoins spécifiques par exemple).
<b>C'est très important, car cela signifie que même si cette campagne n'atteint pas son objectif, nous pourrons tout de même sortir le jeu</b>, mais dans une version moins fournie et donc moins intéressante.
<br/><br/>
<b>Chaque euro reçu nous servira à pousser la réalisation plus loin</b>, aussi bien en termes de qualité graphique &amp; sonore, que sur la quantité et la folie des options disponibles dans le jeu, des niveaux cachés, etc.
Nous avons des retours extrêmement positifs des premiers tests de la version alpha, et nous savons que Soccer Dash a un potentiel énorme pour vous distraire en tant que joueurs.<br/><br/>
Nous savons que beaucoup de jeux qui ont bénéficié d'une campagne de crowdfunding ont mis beaucoup de temps à sortir. Nous pensons que si vous, les amis, êtes prêts à nous aider, alors <b>la moindre des choses pour nous est de vous fournir le jeu le plus vite possible</b>, tout en respectant nos exigences en terme de qualité. C'est pourquoi nous avons un planning de production serré, avec des objectifs réalistes.
<br/><br/>
<b>Si vous avez la moindre interrogation, n'hésitez pas à nous contacter avant de faire une donation.</b> Nous voulons être le plus transparents possible. Nous savons qu'il y beaucoup d'autres jeux qui sont aussi en recherche de financement. C'est pourquoi nous voulons que les gens qui nous soutiennent sachent exactement ce qu'ils soutiennent à quoi va servir leur argent !

READY TO BECOME A SOCCER SUPERHERO...AND KICK SOME ASSES?

Soccer Dash is an arcade game for mobile Android and iOS platforms, a new generation runner with a fresh gameplay. But what is it?
You play Tony, a young man passionate about football, who lives football, sleeps football, eats football, who... football -)  A charming boy, he firmly believes in his chances of success. He even believes it a bit too much! This is what he wrote in his personal blog, for example:

""I'm the best, and the whole world will soon learn that! Think I'm crazy? Look, I'm training so much that I have more techniques than Pele and Maradona’s kids! What? You didn’t know they had one LOL? Will you come with me and help me to ridicule all the so-called best players in the world? ""

We warned you! :-)

But he's right on one point... He's really good! Help him penalize Cristiano, Zlatan and other kings of football!



Tony has decided to travel the world to prove to everyone he is the best with the ball. So he will go through all the cities with the greatest players in order to make them pathetic. What better way to start than in Brazil?
Tony’s primary goal is to make it to the stadium to confront the players. He’s therefore going to run through the city or take shortcuts by cutting along the beach. He will have to avoid all the obstacles that stand in his way, for example: 



In town : scaffolding, traffic lights that drop and fall on him, drones remotely controlled by children, fire hydrants, etc.

On the beach : sand castles, kites, parasols, coconuts, birds which attack him to take his ball, etc.

In town & on the beach : some...monsters! And yes, it seems that the city is not very safe these days :-) In Soccer Dash, you will face and collect the monsters like trophies!


In addition, to avoid some obstacles he can shoot with his ball to knock out others. He must also score goals sometimes to access hidden levels, for example. Of course, there will also be many options of all kinds, each making it crazier!

Once at the stadium, the gameplay completely changes. We switch to some very dynamic QTE (quick time events), and the challenge is to dribble and ridicule the pro players who stand in our way!







Humor is omnipresent at the visual level, but also in the situations, as this enormous confidence Tony has will certainly play tricks on him at times!

Currently you can see this interview with his former teacher, who gets out of hand and brings out old records on Tony.









We’re developing Soccer Dash with our own funds, and spend most of our time on it. To enable us to have a chance to go as far as possible in the development of all the crazy options and levels that we have in mind, we need support.
In fact, the creation of such a game is expensive, especially if you pay attention to all the details that make it a quality game.

As we’re developing Soccer Dash with our own funds, the budgets below do not include our compensation, but only the external costs (hiring a graphic designer and an additional developer for specific needs, for example). This is very important because it means that even if the campaign does not reach its goal, we can still launch the game, but in a less abundant and therefore less interesting version.

Every euro received will be used to push the realization further, both in terms of quality graphics & sound, and the quantity and the madness of the options available in the game, hidden levels, etc. We have extremely positive feedback from the first tests of the alpha version, and we know that Dash Soccer has a huge potential to bring you fun as players. 
We know that a lot of games that have benefitted from a crowd funding campaign have been slow to emerge. We believe that if you, friends, are willing to help us, then the least we can do is to provide you with the game as soon as possible, while meeting our requirements in terms of quality. That's why we have a tight production schedule, with realistic goals.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us before making a donation. We want to be as transparent as possible. We know there are many other games that are also seeking funding. That is why we want the people who are supporting us to know exactly what they are supporting, what their money is being used for!









Achieving this goal will enable us to:

Refine the first version of Dash Soccer: hidden levels (flying in the sky, going to the beach, etc.) an options package (fireball, American football armor, tokens magnet, etc.), skins galore (skins of the hero, his outfit, his cap, some game options), awesome monsters to confront and collect!

Release an iOS version faster (Soccer Dash will indeed firstly be launched on Android) 
Fund a communication campaign to promote the game and give it a chance to find its audience

















Achieving this goal will enable us to:


Create the stadium level: remember, Tony runs in the city to get to the stadium and face the greatest players. Once there, his time will be counted and he must dribble against the pros he encounters on the lawn. The gameplay will completely change. We switch to some very dynamic and exciting QTE (quick time events). This level will be totally crazy!
Add options (riding on the shoulders of another character, for example)
Add 8 collectible monsters
Add 5 hero outfits
Translate the game into 4 languages
Continue the communication campaign to promote the game












Achieving this goal will enable us to:

Add the concept of missions to complete

Improve the stadium level with several new QTE sequences
Add a bonus underground level with different gameplay but shhh …Surprise!
Translate the game into 8 additional languages






We are an independent video game development studio, located in Paris, France. Our main concern is to design games with particularly detailed gameplay and gamefeel, to provide the richest and most exciting game experience possible.
The team consists of two people, cofounders of the Agooloo Studios:



Euthmane MERADI : artist, game designer

Romain LENOIR : game data analyst, designer

PRÊT À DEVENIR UN SUPER-HEROS DU FOOTBALL?

Soccer Dash est un jeu d'arcade pour plate-formes mobiles Android et iOS, un runner nouvelle génération doté d'un gameplay tout frais. Mais de quoi s'agit-il ?
Vous incarnez Tony, un jeune homme passionné de football, qui vit football, qui dort football, qui mange football, qui... football :-) Garçon charmant, il croit fermement en ses chances de réussite. Il y croit même un peu trop ! Voilà ce qu'il écrit par exemple dans son blog perso :

""Je suis le meilleur, et le monde entier l'apprendra très bientôt !

Vous pensez que je suis un dingue ? Ecoutez, je m'entraîne tellement que je suis plus technique que le gamin de Pelé et Maradona ! Quoi ? Vous ne saviez pas qu'ils en avaient un lol ? Pourrez-vous me suivre et m'aider à ridiculiser tous les soi-disant meilleurs joueurs de la planète ?""

On vous avait prévenu ! :-)

Mais il a raison sur un point.. Il est vraiment doué ! Venez l'aider, venez mettre à l'amende Cristiano, Zlatan et les autres rois du ballon rond !



Tony a ainsi décidé de parcourir le monde pour prouver à tous qu’il est le meilleur balle au pied. Il va donc parcourir toutes les villes où se trouvent les plus grands joueurs, dans le but de les mettre minables. Quoi de mieux pour commencer que le Brésil ?
Le premier but de Tony est déjà d’atteindre le stade pour affronter les joueurs. Il va donc courir dans la ville ou bien prendre des raccourcis en coupant par la plage. Il lui faudra éviter toutes les embûches qui se dresseront sur son chemin, par exemple :



En ville : des échafaudages, des feux tricolores qui se décrochent et lui tombent dessus, des drones télécommandés par des enfants, des bouches d’incendie, etc.

Sur la plage : des châteaux de sable, des cerfs-volants, des parasols, des noix de coco, des oiseaux qui lui foncent dessus pour lui prendre son ballon, etc.

En ville & sur la plage : des...monstres ! Et oui, il semblerait que la ville ne soit pas très sûre ces temps-ci :-) Dans Soccer Dash, vous allez affronter et collectionner les monstres comme des Pokemons !



En plus d’éviter certains obstacles, il pourra shooter avec son ballon pour en dégommer d’autres. Il devra marquer des buts aussi par moment pour accéder à des niveaux cachés par exemple. Bien sûr, il y aura aussi beaucoup d’options en tous genres, que l’on va faire plus délirantes les unes que les autres !

Une fois arrivé au stade, le gameplay change totalement. On passe à du QTE (quick time events) très dynamique, et le challenge est de dribbler, et ridiculiser les joueurs pros qui se dresseront sur notre chemin !








L’humour est omniprésent au niveau visuel, mais aussi dans les situations, puisque cette énorme confiance qu’a Tony lui jouera sûrement des tours par moment !

Actuellement vous pouvez voir cette interview de son ancien professeur, qui dérape et ressort des vieux dossiers sur Tony (activez les sous-titres de la video pour obtenir la version française).









Nous développons Soccer Dash en fonds propres, et y passons le plus clair de notre temps. Pour nous permettre d’avoir une chance d’aller le plus loin possible dans le développement de toutes les options dingues et les niveaux que nous avons en tête, nous avons besoin de soutien.
En effet, la création d'un tel jeu coûte cher, surtout si l'on porte attention à tous les détails qui font que le jeu sera de qualité.

Comme nous développons Soccer Dash en fonds propres, les budgets ci-dessous ne comportent pas notre rémunération, mais uniquement les frais externes (engager un graphiste et un développeur supplémentaires pour des besoins spécifiques par exemple).
C'est très important, car cela signifie que même si cette campagne n'atteint pas son objectif, nous pourrons tout de même sortir le jeu, mais dans une version moins fournie et donc moins intéressante.

Chaque euro reçu nous servira à pousser la réalisation plus loin, aussi bien en termes de qualité graphique & sonore, que sur la quantité et la folie des options disponibles dans le jeu, des niveaux cachés, etc.
Nous avons des retours extrêmement positifs des premiers tests de la version alpha, et nous savons que Soccer Dash a un potentiel énorme pour vous distraire en tant que joueurs.
Nous savons que beaucoup de jeux qui ont bénéficié d'une campagne de crowdfunding ont mis beaucoup de temps à sortir. Nous pensons que si vous, les amis, êtes prêts à nous aider, alors la moindre des choses pour nous est de vous fournir le jeu le plus vite possible, tout en respectant nos exigences en terme de qualité. C'est pourquoi nous avons un planning de production serré, avec des objectifs réalistes.

Si vous avez la moindre interrogation, n'hésitez pas à nous contacter avant de faire une donation. Nous voulons être le plus transparents possible. Nous savons qu'il y beaucoup d'autres jeux qui sont aussi en recherche de financement. C'est pourquoi nous voulons que les gens qui nous soutiennent sachent exactement ce qu'ils soutiennent à quoi va servir leur argent !









Atteindre cet objectif nous permettra de :

Peaufiner la première version de Soccer Dash : des niveaux cachés (s'envoler dans le ciel, aller sur la plage, etc.) un paquet d'options (ballon de feu, armure de foot US, aimant à pièces, etc.), des skins à gogo (skins du héros, de sa tenue, de sa coiffe, de certaines options du jeu), des monstres impressionnants à affronter et à collectionner !
Sortir plus rapidement une version iOS (Soccer Dash sortira en effet tout d'abord sur Android)
Financer une campagne de communication pour faire connaître le jeu, et lui laisser une chance de trouver son public

















Atteindre cet objectif nous permettra de :


Créer le niveau du stade : rappelez-vous, Tony court dans la ville pour arriver au stade et affronter les plus grands joueurs. Une fois arrivé là, son temps sera compté et il devra dribbler les joueurs pros qu’il croisera sur la pelouse. Le gameplay change alors totalement. On passe à du QTE (quick time events) très dynamique et excitant. Ce niveau sera totalement fou !
Ajouter des options (monter sur les épaules d'un autre personnages par exemple)
Ajouter 8 monstres à collectionner
Ajouter 5 tenues vestimentaires au héros
Traduire le jeu en 4 langues
Continuer la campagne de communication pour faire connaître le jeu












Atteindre cet objectif nous permettra de :

Ajouter la notion de missions à remplir

Enrichir le niveau du stade de plusieurs nouvelles séquences QTE
Ajouter un niveau bonus sous-terrain avec un gameplay différent mais chhhut.. Surprise !
Traduire le jeu en 8 langues supplémentaires






Nous sommes un studio de développement de jeux vidéos indépendant, situé à Paris en France. Notre préoccupation principale est de concevoir des jeux avec un gameplay et un gamefeel particulièrement soignés, pour offrir une expérience de jeu la plus riche et excitante possible.
L'équipe est composée de 2 personnes, cofondateurs des studios Agooloo :

Nous avons déjà sorti un jeu sur Google Play : Scooter of Love, qui a eu plusieurs couvertures nationales (TV, radio, presse écrite).




Pour ceux d'entre vous qui ne le savent pas encore, les contreparties d'une campagne de crowdfunding sont ce que nous vous offrons lorsque vous nous faites un don pour nous soutenir.

	Votre nom appaîtra dans la partie ""producteurs"" du générique du jeu, sauf si vous voulez rester anonyme.
	




Un pack de 180000 pièces

Une version du jeu sans publicité
	Aucune bannière ni affiche de pub dans le jeu.
	




Un pack de 25 coeurs de résurrection

VOUS dans Soccer Dash
	Nous vous dessinerons avec la tenue vestimentaire de votre choix et vous placerons dans la boutique online de Soccer Dash. D'autres joueurs du monde entier pourront donc vous choisir pour représenter le héros dans leur version du jeu !

<p>Ici le chapitre 1, nous emmène au prémice du Kolaps, de l'effondrement de la société et du combat que devra mener l'humanité pour survivre. ( le chapitre 2 est en cours de réalisation)</p>
<p>En terme de jeu il va proposer d'incarner des hommes des agences de protection des citoyens (APC) ou ceux que ces derniers appellent Vampires.</p>
<p>Les APC sont des entités semi gouvernementales et surtout semi privées, assemblées par des sociétés privées. Elles on vu le jour dans la première moitié du 21eme siècle afin de répondre aux problèmes de financement des forces de l'ordre et de sécurité civile. Elles postulent pour des contrats émis par le gouvernement dans le cadre de la défense, de la police, d'aide aux populations .... et bien d'autres choses plus ou moins inavouables .... en mettant à son service des escouades d'hommes contre rémunération.</p>
<p>Les Vampires sont des créatures extrêmement sanguinaires qui font leur apparition dans les décombres de la mégalopole de Strasbourg après l'attentat initiant l'intrigue de Ground Zero. Les agents APC survivants à leurs attaques ont commencé à leur donner des surnoms. Bien que ces derniers ont appris à respecter l'intelligence et la combativité des Vampires ils sont encore loin de se douter de leurs motivations et la portée de leur conscience. </p>
<p>Les personnages peuvent être joués grace à des fiches de profils prétirés ou bien en utilisant les règles de création de personnage permettant de donner une touche plus personnelle à son unité.</p>
<p>Les lois du jeu sont présentées pour 2 joueurs classiquement. Cependant le système d'activation permet un nombre de joueur plus grand, jusqu'à un joueur par figurine. Biensur, il est recommandé de monter des scénarios pouvant très bien être gérés par un ""maitre de jeu"" opposé à un groupe de joueur.</p>
<p>Tous ces éléments combinés poussent Kolaps: ground zero sur le chemin du jeu de rôle tactique, et ce qu'il a pour vocation de devenir.</p>

<p>Le KOLAPS a besoin de progresser avec vous.</p>
</div></div>","Kolaps : ground zero s'offre un reboot au chapitre 1 avec une offre prêt à jouer.
Kolaps : ground zero est une escarmouche tactique avec figurines naissant dans un futur proche et dystopique de notre Europe. L'univers du jeu va mêler des élèments d'horreur, de fantastique, de cyberpunk et de mythologie. Il sera a réserver à un public mature et averti.
Cet univers ne sera livré que progressivement dans le cadre de chapitres. 
Ici le chapitre 1, nous emmène au prémice du Kolaps, de l'effondrement de la société et du combat que devra mener l'humanité pour survivre. ( le chapitre 2 est en cours de réalisation)
En terme de jeu il va proposer d'incarner des hommes des agences de protection des citoyens (APC) ou ceux que ces derniers appellent Vampires.
Les APC sont des entités semi gouvernementales et surtout semi privées, assemblées par des sociétés privées. Elles on vu le jour dans la première moitié du 21eme siècle afin de répondre aux problèmes de financement des forces de l'ordre et de sécurité civile. Elles postulent pour des contrats émis par le gouvernement dans le cadre de la défense, de la police, d'aide aux populations .... et bien d'autres choses plus ou moins inavouables .... en mettant à son service des escouades d'hommes contre rémunération.
Les Vampires sont des créatures extrêmement sanguinaires qui font leur apparition dans les décombres de la mégalopole de Strasbourg après l'attentat initiant l'intrigue de Ground Zero. Les agents APC survivants à leurs attaques ont commencé à leur donner des surnoms. Bien que ces derniers ont appris à respecter l'intelligence et la combativité des Vampires ils sont encore loin de se douter de leurs motivations et la portée de leur conscience. 
Les personnages peuvent être joués grace à des fiches de profils prétirés ou bien en utilisant les règles de création de personnage permettant de donner une touche plus personnelle à son unité.
Les lois du jeu sont présentées pour 2 joueurs classiquement. Cependant le système d'activation permet un nombre de joueur plus grand, jusqu'à un joueur par figurine. Biensur, il est recommandé de monter des scénarios pouvant très bien être gérés par un ""maitre de jeu"" opposé à un groupe de joueur.
Tous ces éléments combinés poussent Kolaps: ground zero sur le chemin du jeu de rôle tactique, et ce qu'il a pour vocation de devenir.






Grace à son offre de lancement ""Reboot: chapitre 1"",  Kolaps est désormais apte à débuter sa vie. C'est ce starter pack qui est dédié à lancer le jeu et il a besoin de vous.






Voici les objectifs:


650€ : En faisant l'acquisition d'un de ces Starters vous permettrez dès le premier palier  à la machine KOLAPS de prendre sa vitesse de croisière, l'aidant à sortir de nouvelles références ( fin de la 3eme vague entre autre )... OK


1000€ : En atteignant cet objectif plus haut vous offrirez des blisters complets pour les figurines incluant cartes d'activation et de profil pré tiré... OK


3000€: Déclenchons la finalisation et la mise sous presse du chapitre 2 qui sera livré chez tous les souscripteurs des starters niveaux 6 à 9 ..... l'impulsion pour le chapitre 3 sera également donnée.


5000€: La dernière affiliation du chapitre 2 pourra se lancer et la figurine de Tinker Lily sera livrée avec le livret du chapitre 2.


????€: Un autre palier ? je l'espère !

Single player campaign starts in late 1920s and spans 
to 2000s and beyond, but can be won (or lost) earlier.<br/><br/><h4>Global Strategic mode<br/>
</h4>
<p>The realtime mode where player will manage the resources of 
organization, recruit or otherwise obtain new members and respond to 
arising threats and various events. Campaign will include various historical and alternative-historical 
events with a chance to change history.</p>
<p></p>

<h4>Battle Mode</h4>
<p>The turn-based tactics battle mode is the way organization responds 
to any arising event. 
Battle mode designed to be fast and intensive despite turn-based origin. Players will have the opportunity to build their own battle maps with the built-in editor and immediately plug them into ongoing campaign. The editor is available in the <a href=""http://dunenkoff.itch.io/twnh"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">demo prototype</a> right now.<br/></p>
<h3>
</h3>
<h4>Your Heroes<br/>
</h4>
<p>Organization employs three types of heroes: supers, operatives and scientists, with a possibility of multiclassing. Every hero has his own story/background which explains his abilities 
and weaknesses. Heroes (with exception for a few story characters) are randomly generated and can be customized.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/857886/files/20140915053211-goodguys.png?1410784331"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Characters can be good or evil, and characters have morale, they 
can defect to the enemy and possibly you'll have to battle them later on.</p>
<h4>Economics</h4>
<p>Even though heroes do not require to be paid, you have operating costs –
 base building/maintenance, upgrades, researches, everything has its 
price. Governments of the world contribute to your cause if they're 
happy with your performance and problem-solving-to-overall-damage ratio.
 At some point, player can decide to make the organization public to 
make more money by selling licensed merchandize, but that will create 
another set of problems with marketing and PR damage control.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Technology and research<br/>
</h4>
<p>Every new piece of technology captured from enemies, human or otherwise,
 will open new scientific horizons for your organisation, giving you the
 opportunity to research, design and build new weapons, armour, base 
upgrades and even supernatural abilities for your heroes.</p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h4>Customization</h4>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Heroes</strong> are different - in their backgrounds and 
abilities. To make them even more unique, character editor will allow 
players to completely redesign every hero's costume, pick props and 
weapons.</p>
<p>To make <strong>battle</strong> experience (almost) unique for 
everyone, the map editor will be included with the game, and every map 
built with it or downloaded from external resources can be immediately 
plugged into ongoing single-player campaign. </p>
<p>Customization and modding of campaign is also planned. Players will 
have the opportunity to create their own campaign events and possibly 
the entire campaigns as well.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Multiplayer</h4>Multiplayer mode consists of 1v1 battles and is planned to allow players
 to engage each other in battles using heroes built during single player
 campaign. To ensure fair fights and proper balance, multiplayer will 
utilise matchmaking system based on character stats.<br/><ul></ul>

<p>It stopped being a hobby quite some time ago. I'm doing this full-time to build the game you all can enjoy for months, and a decade later go ""oh, dude, remember TWNH? That was Epic!"".</p>
<p>That's why I need funding to do so - some new equipment (the prototype I spent 2 months building was made on an old Macbook that didn't survive the pressure and completely died on me yesterday, I'm using an ancient PC to communicate right now), software licenses and subscriptions, hiring the people to do stuff I can't do. I also need to support a family of three and not thinking every minute what we're gonna eat tomorrow.</p>
<p><b>A note why this campaign is on flexible funding</b>. I live in a rural town in south Russia. Our government doesn't want us to live like normal people and our banking system is 19th century. The treatment we get from various financial institutions in the world doesn't let me to use PayPal on this campaign and credit card payments (<i>which are only available on flexible funding</i>) are my only option. I hope you understand that I'm not planning to run away with the money I get. <b>This game will happen</b>.<br/></p>

</div></div>","The World Needs Heroes is a 3D RTS/RPG/turn-based tactics mix for PC, Mac and Linux. No DLC, no hidden cost, no microtransactions, no DRM. Get once - yours forever.


The game is early in development, but there is a public demo prototype you can download and play right now.



The game is also on Steam's Greenlight, you can support it by voting there!
Please read below why this campaign is on flexible funding.



 It's late 1920s. The war, prohibition, economic depression, all took their toll on the world.  Crime is raging everywhere, great powers arise, and they're up to no good.Player takes charge of V.A.L.O.R. - a secret international organization that employs superheroes, martial artists and scientific geniuses
to fight crime, defend the Earth against alien invasions, stop wars, 
prevent political assassinations and generally save humanity from 
self-destruction. What V.A.L.O.R. stands for is a mystery - organization founder died before he could share that secret. Valiant Allies League Of Righteousness? We'll never know, but there's a contest for that, and one winner and two runner-ups will get all the rewards of Scout (TIER 3) perk!

Single player campaign starts in late 1920s and spans 
to 2000s and beyond, but can be won (or lost) earlier.Global Strategic mode

The realtime mode where player will manage the resources of 
organization, recruit or otherwise obtain new members and respond to 
arising threats and various events. Campaign will include various historical and alternative-historical 
events with a chance to change history.


Battle Mode
The turn-based tactics battle mode is the way organization responds 
to any arising event. 
Battle mode designed to be fast and intensive despite turn-based origin. Players will have the opportunity to build their own battle maps with the built-in editor and immediately plug them into ongoing campaign. The editor is available in the demo prototype right now.


Your Heroes

Organization employs three types of heroes: supers, operatives and scientists, with a possibility of multiclassing. Every hero has his own story/background which explains his abilities 
and weaknesses. Heroes (with exception for a few story characters) are randomly generated and can be customized.


Characters can be good or evil, and characters have morale, they 
can defect to the enemy and possibly you'll have to battle them later on.
Economics
Even though heroes do not require to be paid, you have operating costs –
 base building/maintenance, upgrades, researches, everything has its 
price. Governments of the world contribute to your cause if they're 
happy with your performance and problem-solving-to-overall-damage ratio.
 At some point, player can decide to make the organization public to 
make more money by selling licensed merchandize, but that will create 
another set of problems with marketing and PR damage control.

Technology and research

Every new piece of technology captured from enemies, human or otherwise,
 will open new scientific horizons for your organisation, giving you the
 opportunity to research, design and build new weapons, armour, base 
upgrades and even supernatural abilities for your heroes.

Customization

Heroes are different - in their backgrounds and 
abilities. To make them even more unique, character editor will allow 
players to completely redesign every hero's costume, pick props and 
weapons.
To make battle experience (almost) unique for 
everyone, the map editor will be included with the game, and every map 
built with it or downloaded from external resources can be immediately 
plugged into ongoing single-player campaign. 
Customization and modding of campaign is also planned. Players will 
have the opportunity to create their own campaign events and possibly 
the entire campaigns as well.

MultiplayerMultiplayer mode consists of 1v1 battles and is planned to allow players
 to engage each other in battles using heroes built during single player
 campaign. To ensure fair fights and proper balance, multiplayer will 
utilise matchmaking system based on character stats.
For a more detailed gameplay features description, visit official TWNH wiki.




Genre - real-time strategy with roleplaying game features and turn-based tactical battles

Platforms - PC, Mac, Linux, if everything goes well - consoles, if everything goes really good - tablets


Timeflow - the entire campaign is 20+ hours, with lots of 2-5 minute battles 


Battles variety - 100+ battle maps in 20+ environments plus map editor included

Difficulty - hardcore!





There's going to be two types of background music in the game - one for radio that plays in global strategic mode, current to the campaign time (i.e. plays jazz in 1920s and boogie in 1950s) and the actual soundtrack for battle scenes. Kevin MacLeod is my idol and the soundtrack genius, and if he's unavailable for hire, I'll look for someone with the same skill. Listen to this, he's incredible!







Initially, the game will have only English and Russian localizations. At this point, I'll hire a team of translators to localize the game to French, German, Spanish, Italian, Polish and Czech.


The World Needs Villains Too will be released as an update to the Heroes free for all, no additional costs. Yes, the game where you play for bad guys, with it's own strategic 
gameplay mechanics, you thought I didn't plan that from the start? It's good to be bad, remember?


Going to PS4, Xbox One, iOS and Android, complete with Villains Update.



I'll prototype the actual board game based on this setting and send it to Fantasy Flight to publish. All backers TIER 6 and up get a copy.



Most of the rewards are self-explanatory, and I'd like to focus on two things - monograph and designs.Monograph is not just an art book - it's the illustrated history of The World Needs Heroes from the very beginning, including arts, designs, parts of the document, work-in-progress materials, and to make it more interesting - narrative.Designs work this way: you design, draw, describe a thing for a game, game artist I hire draws concept art by your design, it gets into the game AND on a poster that gets signed and sent to you.



Hi there! My name is Kyr Dunenkoff and I'm the guy behind The World Needs Heroes game.


36 years old. 20+ years of experience in computer science. 10+ years in game development. Part of the Star Wolves, Fantasy Wars and Majesty 2 teams. Programmer, 
3D-artist, former web-developer, former 
iOS-developer. Moonlighting as a rock deejay in local bars. Play 
guitar, bass, some drums. Avid videogamer (yeah, that's right, #gamergate, I'm a gamer). Husband and father. Badass intellectual. Chaotic good. Russian.

  


It stopped being a hobby quite some time ago. I'm doing this full-time to build the game you all can enjoy for months, and a decade later go ""oh, dude, remember TWNH? That was Epic!"".
That's why I need funding to do so - some new equipment (the prototype I spent 2 months building was made on an old Macbook that didn't survive the pressure and completely died on me yesterday, I'm using an ancient PC to communicate right now), software licenses and subscriptions, hiring the people to do stuff I can't do. I also need to support a family of three and not thinking every minute what we're gonna eat tomorrow.
A note why this campaign is on flexible funding. I live in a rural town in south Russia. Our government doesn't want us to live like normal people and our banking system is 19th century. The treatment we get from various financial institutions in the world doesn't let me to use PayPal on this campaign and credit card payments (which are only available on flexible funding) are my only option. I hope you understand that I'm not planning to run away with the money I get. This game will happen.






$1800 - IndieGoGo Fees

$5600 - Taxes (I have to pay them, apparently)

$3000 - New working machine, pen tablet, various small equipment

$1500 - One-year 3DSMax subscription, industry standard, it doesn't get better than this for gamedev needs

$600 - One-year Adobe products subscription - Photoshop, AfterFX, Illustrator, all the good stuff

$250 - Quixel Suite, the best tool to create textures for 3D models, used by all the best gamedev studios out there, if you haven't seen what Quixel is capable of, go see, it's amazing


$1500 - One-year Mixamo subscription. With their auto-rigger feature, this one will save me a day or two on rigging a character. With the amount of characters planned, I'd say it'll save me about 2 months of time.

$5000 - Hire a composer to do a soundtrack. Because I can't do that myself.

Everything else - ""developments costs"", coffee, pizza, new pair of socks, etc.


  

Traditional risks of game development are going over the costs, failure to meet deadlines and failure to overcome technical and creative difficulties. Also, anything can happen even in the team of one, even when I'm safe from inter-team communication problems and don't spend months arguing with teammates about features.

I'm making the game for all of you, and I value nothing more than your approval and satisfaction.
  
Besides supporting the game on Greenlight, the best thing you can do is spread the word, tell all about it to your nerdy, geeky, comicbook-loving friends in a personal convo or over social media.Also make sure to follow the development progress, genuine interest makes me motivated, and the more questions you ask about the game, the more ideas I get.",22.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Pro Gamer Grips for Xbox One</p>
<p>Going beyond any other gamer grips for the Xbox One controller. Designed to put your hands in the most ergonomic position for optimized game play. The pistol grip gives greater control and comfort by putting your hands in the optimal position for finger dexterity and button contact points for the Xbox One controller.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>Our ultimate goal was to create the most effective gamer grips for the Xbox One controller. It creates a better balance and distributes weight to require less contact in holding the controller so your fingers are free for better positioning and more accurate game play. The Pro Gamer Grips are high quality and durable - with a secure fit - so there’s no need to modify the controller. We have already started the production process and are ready for tooling - molds and production evaluation units will be completed before the end of the Kickstarter and we will be ready to progress to a production run to minimize lead time to delivery for backers.    </p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why use Pro Gamer Grips</p>
<p>The Xbox One controllers are designed for all ages, which means it is designed to fit the smallest hand size while still being playable for larger sized hands. This puts the burden of supporting the Xbox One controller on your smallest 2 fingers on a surface that is tapered to accommodate a child’s hand. This limits control and positioning, making the controller a sub-optimal fit for adult hands.</p>

<p>Platform Optimisation           </p>
<p>Pro Gamer Grips create an optimised platform to enhance your natural  playing ability.</p>
<p>The most natural resting position for your thumbs is level, slightly bent with the tip of your thumb on the analog stick. The Pro Gamer Grip’s asymmetric design places your thumb closer to its optimal resting position giving you greater range of movement and agility. Most sticker grips or controller skins available give you a better texture and feel but fail to place your hands in the best position. The result with these grips or going grip-less is your hands can become fatigued or cramped. With the Pro Gamer Grips, your hands are now naturally in the perfect position for gameplay.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Benefits</p>
<p>Perfect Fit: Ergonomic design puts your hands in the optimal position of game play</p>
<p>Weight Distribution: Creates a more balanced control surface allowing for superior grip control</p>
<p>Pro Design: Asymmetric design counters the original controller’s tapered grip to deliver a larger grip area requiring less force to control.</p>
<p>Perfect Hand Sizing: No need to scrunch fingers, adapts controller to optimise for 18+ ages.</p>
<p>Gameplay: Ergonomic for improved comfort extending gameplay</p>
<p>Quick Switch: Fast &amp; easy to put on and take off</p>
<p>Bulletproof Construction: Solid one piece construction requires no modification to controller.</p>
<p>Rubberized Grip: Improves control and comfort while adding counter balancing weight</p>
<p>Adapter Support: Headset adaptors will still fit without modification.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prototype and Design</p>
<p>Pro Gamer Grips have been designed to be more comfortable and ergonomic for larger hand sizes.  Designed in Australia by the founder and a team of engineers whose primary focus was to create a better interface between the player and the control surfaces of the Xbox One Controller. We have worked exhaustively to create and hone the final design resulting in absolutely the best gamer grips for the Xbox One.</p>
<p>The secret to the design is its asymmetrical structure. By increasing the circumference of the grip your hands have greater purchase on the grip with the palm of your hand and fingers. Therefore less effort is required to hold whilst positioning the fingers at an ideal position for greater control of movement. This results in a grip with a more natural feeling whilst playing and increases your ability to make more sensitive movement adjustments.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No over-engineering here KISS (keep it simple stupid) is our motto. We have meticulously worked through each design feature to ensure it didn’t overcomplicate things. This culminated in rubberized grips that feel amazing in your hands, fit firmly to the controller without fixatives, are durable and prevent long term fatigue by sticking to the hands naturally through its finger grips, palm contours and textured surface.</p>
<p>None of this would give you the right feel if there were play or creak in the grips. So we have designed them to be extremely strong and secure, and we have made them out of the best materials to ensure they are hard wearing and long lasting. We have worked hard to ensure that the quality of Pro Gamer Grips meets our high expectations of quality and durability.</p>

<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>We have navigated thorough the prototyping process from concept to prototype evaluation to get ourselves to this point. Our goal is to be ready for a fast progression to sign off on the final moulding. We have already factored into the schedule time for production evaluation and tooling corrections if required. We have worked to mitigate any delay risks by initiating tooling prior to the ending of the Kickstarter. We have no known financial risks – and we worked hard to ensure we can deliver our product at a great value, we are 100% funded for the production run and all associated costs with the Kickstarter. All we need is your support!</p>

The secret to the design is its asymmetrical structure. By increasing the circumference of the grip your hands have greater purchase on the grip with the palm of your hand and fingers. Therefore less effort is required to hold whilst positioning the fingers at an ideal position for greater control of movement. This results in a grip with a more natural feeling whilst playing and increases your ability to make more sensitive movement adjustments.
 
No over-engineering here KISS (keep it simple stupid) is our motto. We have meticulously worked through each design feature to ensure it didn’t overcomplicate things. This culminated in rubberized grips that feel amazing in your hands, fit firmly to the controller without fixatives, are durable and prevent long term fatigue by sticking to the hands naturally through its finger grips, palm contours and textured surface.
None of this would give you the right feel if there were play or creak in the grips. So we have designed them to be extremely strong and secure, and we have made them out of the best materials to ensure they are hard wearing and long lasting. We have worked hard to ensure that the quality of Pro Gamer Grips meets our high expectations of quality and durability.

Risks & Challenges
We have navigated thorough the prototyping process from concept to prototype evaluation to get ourselves to this point. Our goal is to be ready for a fast progression to sign off on the final moulding. We have already factored into the schedule time for production evaluation and tooling corrections if required. We have worked to mitigate any delay risks by initiating tooling prior to the ending of the Kickstarter. We have no known financial risks – and we worked hard to ensure we can deliver our product at a great value, we are 100% funded for the production run and all associated costs with the Kickstarter. All we need is your support!",0.0,3,"1 Campaign

The aggressive donut minions preferred fighting to working and the baker lost control. It was up to the villagers to destroy them while the baker shut down the factory and went into hiding. Everything was peaceful until donut minions suddenly appeared and started attacking! Help us fight them and defend the village! </span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Here are our donut minions based on your feedback!</span></span></span></span></span></span></p><h2 dir=""ltr""><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong><img alt=""donut minions"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/medias/982183/pictures/full/20130812104625-Donut_Minions_sketches.jpg?1376329626"" src="""" style="""" title=""donut minions""/></strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></h2><h2 dir=""ltr""><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong> </strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></h2><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>3) Boss Battle</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>We saw an overwhelming response for Version 1 of the Donut Boss.

It’s really cool to imagine what order these expressions might happen in. Is the donut surprised when it first sees you or angry?WE WANT YOUR FEEDBACK: Let us know what you think in the Indiegogo comments section with #donutface - Ian and Anthony Developer Diary: October 8    Hey Everyone, here’s our latest update for this week. We’re really excited to show you the final concept art for Ian!Many of you commented that the hair didn't look quite right so we worked tirelessly with the concept artists to give that cut just the right amount of bowl. We also gave him this manly five o'clock shadow.    Below you’ll find a progression of Ian’s character, where we ultimately tweaked #2 to the final designs you see above.WE WANT YOUR FEEDBACK:Let us know what you think of Ian’s final concept art in the Indiegogo comments with #ian - Ian and Anthony     Developer Diary: September 30Hey Everyone,We wanted to share the initial concept art for the Baker, who will be the creator of  the donut minions! The final Baker concept is the last image (with the blue shirt). We asked the concept artists to give him an epic mustache and cover him in food stains so it looks like he’s just been making some mutant pastries.WE WANT YOUR FEEDBACK! Let us know what you think of the Baker in the Indiegogo comments section with #baker.We’ve received a lot of great feedback on our update from last week!

Starting today, we'll be making weekly developer diary updates (every Monday) so we can continue updating you guys on game progress and get more of your feedback. The game is planned to be released Summer 2014!GAME UPDATESAwesome Donut Minions Updates:Bacon Maple Bat has a pair of bacon wings to swoop down from the sky! Hopefully someone’s thought to dry those wings or this could get greasy. Cinnamon Twist Snake looks super delicious, but don’t take a bite because he will bite back! Eclair Hound may look like a friendly puppy, but a simple “Sit! Stay!” is not gonna cut it. WE WANT YOUR FEEDBACK: What kind of attacks do you think the new donut minions should have? Let us know in the Indiegogo comments section with #moredonuts.  We have more facial expressions for Maple Bar! He’s one of our favorite donut minions so we’re hoping you’re as excited as we are. He’s like a cool swamp monster in an old horror film with these faces below:  Stevie Update:We have a color update to Stevie's character with some new facial expressions...like happy, sad, shocked, and...I don’t even know what that last one is, but it looks like a face that Stevie would make!Stevie will also be wearing his signature jorts so you can see him in all his jort-wearing glory in Food Battle: The Game. Let’s just hope the animators never decide to make him bend over!  Thanks again for all of your support, comments and tweets! We'll be using all the funds raised to make this game as awesome as humanly possible! More updates to come next week…stay tuned…Ian and Anthony DEVELOPER DIARY: AUGUST 22  Last night during our live stream extravaganza we released some really awesome new concepts!

This will be our final developer diary before our campaign ends THIS FRIDAY, August 23rd, and we have a bunch of new things to share with you! 1) CHARACTERSFood Battle: THE GAME will include Anthony, Ian, Ian's Pet Donut Hole (who is waiting to be named by one of you!), the Baker, Stevie, and Charlie the Drunk Guinea Pig, the winner of our very first survey!  Check out these cute sketches of Charlie + Anthony!          2) WEAPONSLast week, we showed you concept art for the Churro, Celery Stick, Egg Roll and Red Hot Chili Pepper. Today, we have even more to show you! Tell us in the comments section what you think of the Taquito using #weapons!     DEVELOPER DIARY: AUGUST 12    Hey everyone! Thanks for all of your awesome feedback. With your help, we made some good revisions and decided on which donut boss to feature. Keep reading to learn more about Anthony's weapons and hear about the game story.1) WEAPONSThe player's weapons will be crucial for defending the village against all of the evil donut minions! Check out this concept art for some of our weapons that are currently in development. They will be used to fight off enemies, plus solve puzzles throughout the game! Let us know what you think of these new weapons with the hashtag #weapons in the comments. Plus check out the ""Survey"" section (above) to put a vote in for this week's survey: What power should Anthony's churro have!  2) THE STORYWe've put a lot of effort into creating an epic story for Food Battle: THE GAME. It begins in a small village that once had a prosperous donut factory. The greedy baker tried splicing donut and human DNA to replace his workers with donut minions and it went HORRIBLY WRONG! The aggressive donut minions preferred fighting to working and the baker lost control. It was up to the villagers to destroy them while the baker shut down the factory and went into hiding. Everything was peaceful until donut minions suddenly appeared and started attacking! Help us fight them and defend the village! Here are our donut minions based on your feedback! 3) Boss BattleWe saw an overwhelming response for Version 1 of the Donut Boss. We have updated the art below! This will be used for our SIGNED concept art perk at the $100 tier! P.S. Check out these awesome churro concepts we've had mocked up for our week 3 survey!    DEVELOPER DIARY: AUGUST 2Hey everyone! We’re excited to show you concept art today! This is the first installment of our Developer Diary series that will give you guys a behind-the-scenes look at the making of Food Battle: THE GAME! 1) CONCEPT ART PROCESSWe are collaborating with talented concept artists from Liquid Development, a studio that has worked on games such as Halo 4, Borderlands, Mass Effect 2 and Fable 2! Pretty awesome, right? CLICK HERE to see what other titles they have worked on...we’re sure you have played a few of them! The concept art process helps us nail down the spirit and art direction we want for the characters and environments. These sketches are not literal, in-game art yet so we’ll keep you posted when we get to that part of the game creation process!We wanted to show you work-in-progress (not finished) concepts so we can get your feedback while we are still making creative decisions! 2) CHARACTER CONCEPTSTHE BOSS: Ian's Pink Frosted Sprinkled Donut MonsterTell us which version of the Donut Monster you like BEST in the COMMENTS tab! Tag your feedback with the hashtag #LikeThisDonutBoss.Version 1: His mouth and teeth are made from the frosting dripping from the donut hole. His donut shape is smoother and rounder than Version 2. His hands and legs are more dough-y and he has frosting on his fingers and arms.Version 2: He has actual teeth and his eyes are more squinty. His arms and legs are more human. Tell us what POWERS and/or WEAPONS you think the Donut Boss should have in the COMMENTS tab! Tag your feedback with the hashtag #DonutPower.Sketch #1: The monster has a whip in this sketch. We're not sure we like the whip but we thought we could give him a different weapon to hold. What weapon do you think he should have?Sketch #2: He looks like he’s ripped off a part of his donut-self to throw dough at the player.Sketch 3: The donut monster is shooting something like donut jelly made of acid...or fire...or lasers! You can also see someone hiding. We’re not gonna tell you who it is...but you can probably guess.  THE DONUT MINIONS: These little evil guys will be a common enemy you see in the game so we want to make sure we get them exactly right. Our favorite ones are A and D.Let us know which are your favorite donut minions in the COMMENTS tab! Tag with the hashtag #badlittledonuts. THE PLAYER: You'll be playing as me (Anthony)! Here are some very rough sketches capturing how the player might look when he moves.  3) ENVIRONMENT CONCEPTWe’ve easily clocked in thousands of hours playing The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker. Our concept artist knows it is one of our all-time favorite games and painted this level (below) which we are calling The Grasslands. We want it to be a big, brightly-colored, open environment that a player could imagine themselves exploring.  4) TO ALL YOU ANDROID USERSWe’ve seen all your comments and we hear you! We’re excited to announce we will be offering Food Battle: THE GAME on the Android platform as part of this campaign. Help us reach our goal to make this game for you! We’ve just posted a new Beta access perk for Android users only (look to your right)! GIVING BACK: CHARITY FAQBy contributing to Food Battle: THE GAME, you’ll ALSO help out a good cause! 10% of the total proceeds you contribute will be donated to three charities that we feel strongly about – Do Something, Child's Play and FEED USA.How will this work?You guys determine how much each organization receives from this charity pool based on the number of votes received. We want everyone to have a say in how much each charity gets so you don't need to participate in the campaign in order to vote. (Each charity will receive a percentage of the pool corresponding to the percentage of total votes received from our Smosh fans: for example, if Do Something receives 50% of the votes, Do Something will receive 50% of the pool, if Child's Play receives 30% of the votes, Child's Play will receive 30% of the pool, and if FEED USA receives 20% of the vote, FEED USA will receive 20% of the pool.) BETTER YET, we are guaranteeing a minimum donation of $1,500 to each charity!CLICK HERE to vote.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p></p>
<p>This project was born because there is no casual game for all platforms as we see in our favorite video game consoles. We can not take the game console to any part or play with people who do not have the same console for this, we intend to make a game we can play on all possible platforms, PC, Mac, Linux, Web, smartphones and tablets on iOS and Android.

<b>iParty</b> it’s a social environment
on Internet for people who like popular games, contest games, mini-games and
sports games. In iParty there is a world ranking for all players, subdivided in ratings by countries and associations of friends (guilds). It will be a meeting
point where to spend time in a fun and competitive way and will also help with
the daily stress, fostering communication between. Therefore, the main
objective is having fun and that they can play between 5, 30 minutes or hours
if the players have that free time.<br/><span>We can translate our project until 42 languages.<br/>Do you want to be our Kekovenger?</span>

<h4>What happens if we do not get the minimum of funds</h4>
<p>iParty is an scalable project. We can make the games in the above order. For example, if we have $10 000 we can make the contest games like the Buzz game of PS3 with 3 game modes. $20 000? only board games, $25 000 more? ok, all Mini-Games, and so on. You investment will be used for make games, <b>yes or yes</b>! :)</p>
<h3>What you get</h3>
<p><b>Why we want use IndieGoGo for that part of game development?</b></p>
<p>With IndieGoGo we can have a flexible investment for develop our games and use all money as possible and don't trash any ""gold coin"" ;)</p>
<p><b>Why not traditional investors?</b></p>
<p>Is easy to answer. We have initial investment that we spend in all as possible that you cannot see in a game, but we want iParty be a special product that every investor can have a unique digital content to enjoy something which no game has: <b>exclusive content, unique and customizable</b>. We want an active community that provide us feedback from the from scratch and have a custom game with custom collaborator appearance.</p>

This project was born because there is no casual game for all platforms as we see in our favorite video game consoles. We can not take the game console to any part or play with people who do not have the same console for this, we intend to make a game we can play on all possible platforms, PC, Mac, Linux, Web, smartphones and tablets on iOS and Android.




iParty it’s a social environment
on Internet for people who like popular games, contest games, mini-games and
sports games. In iParty there is a world ranking for all players, subdivided in ratings by countries and associations of friends (guilds). It will be a meeting
point where to spend time in a fun and competitive way and will also help with
the daily stress, fostering communication between. Therefore, the main
objective is having fun and that they can play between 5, 30 minutes or hours
if the players have that free time.We can translate our project until 42 languages.Do you want to be our Kekovenger?


Our company has invested $60,000 in the next areas:






What we need
We need the investment for make the games that you will see below. So if there are more than 125k we will make amazing bonus features and rent low latency servers near your city as possible.















What happens if we do not get the minimum of funds
iParty is an scalable project. We can make the games in the above order. For example, if we have $10 000 we can make the contest games like the Buzz game of PS3 with 3 game modes. $20 000? only board games, $25 000 more? ok, all Mini-Games, and so on. You investment will be used for make games, yes or yes! :)
What you get
Why we want use IndieGoGo for that part of game development?
With IndieGoGo we can have a flexible investment for develop our games and use all money as possible and don't trash any ""gold coin"" ;)
Why not traditional investors?
Is easy to answer.

We want an active community that provide us feedback from the from scratch and have a custom game with custom collaborator appearance.
Every person that want to support us can have an amazing perk, you can send us your picture, your face, your objects, a funny photo dressed like you want or simply tell us the appearance you want. Our characters are designed for to be high customizable. Do you want to see the design potential?
""Keko"" is the name for this little monsters. They are all day watching the TV and like to change their appearance like the things that watched.
We have no Marvel / DC rights: is our non-monster appearance test for fun. We don't release the game with no rights :)

Technology






The technology used to develop the product is Unity3D 4,
software well known for its quality and extensive export to different
platforms.
The product is designed for all audiences. Today there are a variety of diverse devices with Internet connection and ability to play 3D content. For this we use Unity3D in its latest version, version 4. Includes  platforms: Mac, PC, iOS, Android, Web (Google Chrome client, Flash or native plugin), PlayStation, XBox, Wii and even Linux based systems.

Is possible to adapt to those platforms easily and to make a backend server with statistics in all platforms, for share game points, promote the competitions between players and play for example with a game console and a
tablet device.



The technology currently is not a big problem if you have the necessary resources and appropriate licenses. It all depends on how well the product works and goes adapting it to the different platforms.

¿What is GetGetOne?
GetGetOne is a massively multiplayer strategy game whose objective is conquering and ruling the world, by getting the highest possible number of digital spaces on Google Maps. 
We need your help to complete our online platform and the mobile app for Android and iPhone. We have been working on this project for three years, researching new mobile geolocation systems, with advanced algorithms that allow us to control where the user is located and to create finely controlled digital borders on Google Maps. 
We want to change the way in which people interact with their environment and to offer a leisure platform that would also generate new and innovative channels of communication for businesses.



GetGetOne in the press

¿What is a digital area?
A digital area is a polygon or circle-shaped space, defined on Google Maps, that comes to life when you can do things in it when you are near it with your phone.


¿How does GetGetOne work?
When you register for GetGetOne you get 1000 free points that allow you to go anywhere in the world and acquire a digital area with your cell phone. Your mission would be to invest your points to defend this area from your enemies, or use them for attack others and conquer the world. You can get new points by logging in to our web platform or travelling to specific places.
GetGetOne and social networks
Points are the most important part of the game. Without them, the competition and the gaming actions could not take place. But in GetGetOne we don’t want to make people work, but to make things easy and fun. That is why users could get points just by linking their GetGetOne account with their social networks. These points would be generated by our platform depending on the feedback obtained by the users activity in the network, as well as their degree of influence, friends and comments received. More activity, more points, faster growth.
GetCoins
GetGetOne is a game: an easy and funny game that offers incredible tools to attract people to a specific place. Being a game, GetGetOne has a point system in which you will be able to develop a series of actions. With these actions you will be able to generate more points and do more things. Our points are called Getcoins and are obtained through activity carried out in social networks, or by purchasing them in the virtual shop in our platform. All the actions carried out from the website will require some time to execute. Investing points reduces this time.
If you are the owner of an area, you will be able to:

Buy shields
Buy new areas
Acquire areas from other users
Enlarge the already acquired area

If you are a visitor in an area you will be able to:

Check in
Attack the area and conquer it
Help defend an area belonging to a friend

In the end, the goal is to be able to survive and conquer the greatest number of areas, getting real visits from other users and notoriety in social networks. That will allow you
to get known and increases the virality of your actions.





You have advantages with your cell phone
As we said above, actions will require to spend points and time, and most of them can be carried out from the website and from your mobile device. A great way to save time will be to use your cell phone as you
move through the city, as the execution of these actions would be immediate. 



About GetGetOne
The idea came up a few years ago, as a we attended a conference with some friends. It was about mobile technology, Bluetooth and point of sale marketing campaigns. This all happened before the social network boom and even back then we believed in gaming applied to marketing, before knowing that years later it would be so widely used.
We raised some money, the friends, family and fools round; we founded the company in 2012 and produced the first prototype later that year.

















We got 1000 people to sign up for the prototype invitation,
and tried the service. In less than a week, more than 600 areas were created all around the world.
Sadly, we ran out of funds and we had to leave the
project in stand-by for a few months. Then we saw the opportunity of pages like Indiegogo or Kickstarter to take advantage of all the experience we had gathered and convince many more users that our game could be fun and valuable.
The prototype we launched needed polishing. A lot. We
needed to change the positioning of our offer. We received lots of feedback and we are applying it to the change we are presenting now.
















¿What will we do with the money?

Now we have a web and mobile prototype (iPhone only), flexible servers and all necessary infrastructure to assume production, but we do not have enough funds to reposition our product, finish the web and mobile platforms, and hire again programmers, designers and salespeople.

Our goal is to raise 25.000€ for:

Design: UI analysis and improvements.
Programming: Code analysis and improvements.
Programming: API analysis and improvements.

Programming: Finishin mobile apps.


Sysadmin: Servers
Marketing and sales


If we do not reach our goal, we will reduce our roadmap to the basic services necessary to launch a minimum viable beta product. If it is not possible, we will let you know and establish more specific production phases. If we reach our goal we will establish stretch goals and the idea will be able to advance much faster.

Where can I get the game?
On www.supraball.net. You can play the alpha version right away, it's all free.

Why Crowdfunding? We aren't gonna lie. We're developing the game either way, because we love it too much. But almost all of us are doing it in our free time. A successfull crowdfunding would allow us to increase the production speed by about 500% and have it done much earlier. It would also raise the production quality by far.

And apart from time
constraints, certain key development positions, like the one of a qualified 3D
artist, are hinged on further financial support.






  What's the money for?
The money will be used to hire programmers and artists working fulltime on the game.The more funds we raise, the more efficiency we can bring to the development.
If the received money is not sufficient for fulltime jobs, we'll use it to pay people for individual small jobs.

them, for a total of nine life points. If Edik is hit three times by a monster,
you will restart immediately at the same spot where you died, until game over.
The game will be easier if you try every possible option during your journey,
like side quests.</p>
<p>The side quests in <i>Out of Body</i> make your journey easier by rewarding
Edik a level for each completed quest. Edik can upgrade his abilities when he
levels up with skill points. One level, one skill point. You give up skill
points to obtain new attacks or add more life points (to die less often).</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1358780/files/20150406050808-map_the_north_forest_armor_on.jpg?1428322088"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/><br/></p>
<p>And to be fair: When Edik becomes a hunter, he’ll gain armor points.
During a mission you can choose to activate the armor points in your life. But
be careful – it’s a bonus for when it’s absolutely necessary. If you lose your
armor points in a mission, they’re gone forever, even if you die. They’ll reset
after a game over or on a new mission. The only way to keep them during a
mission is to take the armor potion to refill, but be sure to have at least one
armor point left to do this.</p><div style=""text-align: center;"">

<p>For those of you who want to create a hunter or an NPC, you don’t need
to be a god with a pencil. A simple sketch with a good description of your character
will do. You can use your face, or the face of someone you like, if you want. Our
team’s redesign of your character to fit the game must also be approved by you.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of what our artist does to create a character. To make
Fett Heiss more cute, he removed the scar and added white his belly.</p>

Projected
Release Date: Q4 2017
Resolution
& Frame-rate: 1920x1080, 60fpsLanguages: English and French.
Availability: PC. Possibly other platforms in the future.Support us on Steam Greenlight.Out of Body is the first game from
Sword Shield Studio, an indie team of two brothers, based in France. The game
is currently in early stage development, exclusively for PC. Out of Body
is an action-adventure game in 2D side-scrolling with wonderful traditional
animation. Out of Body is a hardcore and beautiful action-adventure game set mostly in the
spirit world. This incredible world is composed of multiple dimensions, which exist
independently but are interconnected through portal gates. The atmosphere in
each dimension is unique; you can find yourself in a lovely forest, in deep
space or in a dark future.You’ll complete your journey in 10 chapters, each set in one dimension.
The current backgrounds and animations are subject to improvements for the
final product.You play Edik Grann, a high school student. A demon stole his soul and
Edik will have to move into the spirit world. Trapped in an unknown world, your
hero’s purpose will be to take back his soul to return to his body on earth. As
a spirit, Edik will become a hunter to maintain his sanity and track down the thieving
demon. During your journey you will be aided by other hunters to achieve your
goal. Find this f*cker and punish him.This is the moment when the demon grabs Edik's soul.This big dog named Speise will help Edik in his quest for revenge. And
yes, he is this girl’s father. (Dogs can make cats in the spirit world!)Out of Body’s gameplay is still in
progress. We hope to make an appealing action game with a customized skill tree
for your character. The spirit of the combat system is to reward skills. Edik
doesn't have a lot of life in the beginning because he’s new to the spirit
world. You start the game with three lives and three life points in each of
them, for a total of nine life points. If Edik is hit three times by a monster,
you will restart immediately at the same spot where you died, until game over.
The game will be easier if you try every possible option during your journey,
like side quests.
The side quests in Out of Body make your journey easier by rewarding
Edik a level for each completed quest. Edik can upgrade his abilities when he
levels up with skill points. One level, one skill point. You give up skill
points to obtain new attacks or add more life points (to die less often).
And to be fair: When Edik becomes a hunter, he’ll gain armor points.
During a mission you can choose to activate the armor points in your life. But
be careful – it’s a bonus for when it’s absolutely necessary. If you lose your
armor points in a mission, they’re gone forever, even if you die. They’ll reset
after a game over or on a new mission. The only way to keep them during a
mission is to take the armor potion to refill, but be sure to have at least one
armor point left to do this.


This book will cover everything you need to know about the game’s
artistry. A4 paper size.





Add your drawing to the gallery menu. See below what you can include.


Don't worry about your drawing skills. Draw whatever you want, using the
characters of Out of Body. Don't forget to add a caption and your name
or pen name.
Remember: The most beautiful drawing will be included in the Art Book.
Your drawing in the gallery should be sized 1920x1080.









For those of you who want to create a hunter or an NPC, you don’t need
to be a god with a pencil. A simple sketch with a good description of your character
will do. You can use your face, or the face of someone you like, if you want. Our

<p><b>Greetings and welcome to Dragon Bait
Miniatures inaugural Indiegogo campaign for my new range of 28mm Fantasy
Adventurers!  My name is Joe Corsaro and for over thirty years I have been
collecting miniatures and playing role-playing games.  I have always been
a huge fan of the old-style fantasy miniatures, especially the <i>Dungeon Dweller</i> range produced
by Heritage Models during the late 1970's.  The realistic gear, classic
poses and flag-stone bases of these miniatures captured the essence of what a
fantasy adventurer should look like.  I
wanted to recapture the character and personality of these old school
miniatures but refined and upgraded to suit the types of adventurers being used
in current role-playing game systems. I
was fortunate to enlist the aid of two great talents in producing these
miniatures – Mike Burns, a long-time friend who was able to turn my vague ideas
into some great concept images and the legendary Kev ‘goblin-master’ Adams, who
is doing a truly tremendous job sculpting these highly detailed Fantasy
Adventurers.</b></p>
<p><b>So, if you are tired of having to
make do with poorly conceived, mass-produced figures that are dull and soulless
- do not despair . . . A unique band of adventurers, well-armed and equipped,
full of character and attitude have arrived!

As the last line of defense, they are usually well protected and therefore you can safely rely on them. They are even more special because you can equip your deck with up to two starting buildings that will be placed on the field at the beginning of a match! Buildings range from simple “MG Nests”, to “Barracks”, and even to a “Missile Silo”. But also business-related buildings like a “Marketing Department” or a “Management Office” will be available to add some more business flavor to the game … you are the CEO of a corporation afterall.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/272498/files/20131221030841-strategies.png?1387624121"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Could you imagine a cyberpunk game without software like viruses, trojan horses and such? We can’t! Why not play the “Attacker Worm” for instance which will deal some digital damage to your enemy? But strategies even reach beyond just software. In the business world, there are a lot of different strategies, like holding a conference, having a backup plan or committing to the recycling of your scrambled vehicles and drones.

Logically, this leads to one major problem … the more powerful cards a player receives, the more powerful his deck will become. Tactics and versatility alone won’t matter and a new player rarely stands a chance against a veteran player (taking game experience aside).</span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Dusk of D.A.W.N. will revolutionize this part of the gameplay! A deck in our game is only limited through the “deck capacity”. It’s not referring to the amount of cards, but points! The more powerful a card is, the more deck capacity it will consume. This way, if you are only using the most powerful cards, your deck will run empty quite fast, which will result in a deadly effect while in a match.</span></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So if you opt for using a deck of few, but powerful cards, you will have to rely on good luck and your ability to perfectly play these cards.

Play the Alpha Version now on www.duskofdawn.com!




Dusk of D.A.W.N. is a collectible card game which sets itself apart from the mass.The combat against enemy corporations breaks up the typical restrictions of most lane based card games and creates a whole new realm of tactical and strategical opportunities.
Players have the ability to create a deck out of over 100 cards and four different card types with cards of different qualities ranging from common to legendary. This deck is then used in battle against other corporations in PvE and PvP matches. The goal ist to defeat the opposing corporation by lowering its energy to 0. This is done by breaking the opponent’s line of defense, created with his own cards, by using attacks and a multitude of different abilities. To give the tactical depth another level, many cards have specific resistances to the two available damage types - physical and digital!

In this turn-based combat, it is vital to economically make use of actions and credits. You will receive credits each turn, but you can gain more or less due to certain card effects. However, to play the most fearsome cards, you will have to save up a lot of credits and the process of saving credits can be quite dangerous!Each turn, you’ll have 5 actions at your disposal. They are consumed for each attack, for each played card, but also when using certain abilities of your cards. We want our players to think about their actions and not to mindlessly attack with everything they got.Our very own cyberpunk setting also comes with a sophisticated and distinct art style. Every card in the game has its unique illustration that comes with much detail and reflects certain aspects of the card itself and it’s inherent abilities.There are about 120 different cards that have already been added to the game. They fall into one of four categories: Unit, Building and Strategy Cards have a place on the playing field in their respective colums while Tactic cards are used instantly to shift the direction of a given match. Many cards also have a specific subtype that deepens the strategic possibilites even further. The ""Field Medic"" for example can only heal humanoid unit cards, but not vehicles or drones.Units are your foremeost line of defense on the field. Almost every unit is able to attack the enemy, but many also have very unique special abilities relating to their own likeness, e.g. the Replicating Crawler possesses the ability to charge his power cells and then use this energy to create a clone of itself if free space is available.Buildings form the mighty foundation of your corporation. As the last line of defense, they are usually well protected and therefore you can safely rely on them. They are even more special because you can equip your deck with up to two starting buildings that will be placed on the field at the beginning of a match! Buildings range from simple “MG Nests”, to “Barracks”, and even to a “Missile Silo”. But also business-related buildings like a “Marketing Department” or a “Management Office” will be available to add some more business flavor to the game … you are the CEO of a corporation afterall.Could you imagine a cyberpunk game without software like viruses, trojan horses and such? We can’t! Why not play the “Attacker Worm” for instance which will deal some digital damage to your enemy? But strategies even reach beyond just software. In the business world, there are a lot of different strategies, like holding a conference, having a backup plan or committing to the recycling of your scrambled vehicles and drones. Strategy cards will be the vanilla topping of your decks!Actions like using an instantaneous artillery strike, forging the orders of your enemy units or performing a fusion with another corporation (to strengthen your own corporation) count as tactics. They always result in a direct effect to the game board and are removed afterwards. Use them wisely to surprise your enemy and gain the upper hand!If you know other CCGs already, you will know that most of them come with one inherent problem: You are supposed to create a deck of a fixed amount of cards. Logically, this leads to one major problem … the more powerful cards a player receives, the more powerful his deck will become. Tactics and versatility alone won’t matter and a new player rarely stands a chance against a veteran player (taking game experience aside).Dusk of D.A.W.N. will revolutionize this part of the gameplay! A deck in our game is only limited through the “deck capacity”. It’s not referring to the amount of cards, but points! The more powerful a card is, the more deck capacity it will consume. This way, if you are only using the most powerful cards, your deck will run empty quite fast, which will result in a deadly effect while in a match.So if you opt for using a deck of few, but powerful cards, you will have to rely on good luck and your ability to perfectly play these cards. Otherwise, you might be defeated pretty quickly ...In a card game with so many cards available you need a quick way to test different strategies. That is why we created our deck management system with an easy-to-use interface and the ability to create multiple decks to choose from. Keep score on how you fare in your matches and replace cards that don't fit your strategy on a whim.Collecting the same cards over and over out of bad luck feels … well, bad. This is why we wanted our players to be able to counter this problem of old.Whenever you have a surplus of cards, you can disassemble these to gain research energy. This energy will enable you to craft cards of a higher rarity - and you are the one to decide which rarity you are aiming for! Just select the edition of cards and the desired rarity and you are good to go. The higher the rarity, the more research energy will be consumed and the less likely the success chance will be.But even if the process of crafting a card fails, you will still get a random card being one grade lower than the desired rarity level. And if you are the type of person who wants to defy the odds, you can even spend shares and increase your chance of success to a whopping 100%.With this feature, even collecting already owned cards won’t feel like bad fortune!Every player can create a maximum of ten different decks with different strategic directions, but we wanted to add an additional layer in order to offer even more strategic diversity. Every time you win a match, your corporation will gain experience points and advance over the course of 20 levels. With each gained level you will unlock a new division which you can assign to your deck.These divisions offer bonuses that will be available during your entire match with a specific deck. If you as a player want to specialize in vehicle combat, you might want to unlock the “Vehicle Manufacturer” which reduces the playing costs of all vehicle cards and also bolsters their defensive capabilities by improving their resistances. If you have many expensive cards in your deck you might think about activating the division “Prosperous Corporation” and gain additional credits every turn.The game will always be free to play. Everyone with a modern device can access it from anywhere they want. We do offer additional virtual items, accessible for ""Shares"", which represent the virtual currency in our game. Everything in our store can also be earned by just playing the game. There is no shop-exclusive premium currency.Every time you complete a match, your corporation will not only gain experience, but also a certain number of shares which you can use for any item available in our shop. The number of shares are dependent on how well you do in a match.And there is more: When you deal damage during a match there is a chance that your enemy will drop a random card which will be added to your card pool after the match is finished. Just like that. You can then decide to utilize this card in one of your decks or you can also invest it to get some research energy.And as we told you above, decks only have a limited capacity, so players will not be able to incorporate all their rare and powerful cards into a single deck and simply obliterate any opposition. Also, our legendary cards are only available through our Research & Development feature (aside from being a reward for backers) and will not be sold directly in the game store.We are very grateful for every pledge we receive and we know how important it is to give back. Right now we are not in a position to do so, but with your help we will get there. That is why we have decided to spend 5% of the profits from Dusk of D.A.W.N. to back other campaigns on Indiegogo. And we want to encourage other people to do the same. Crowdfunding does not work without giving, and if you believe in the keepitgogoing factor we would like to encourage you to visit www.keepitgogoing.org to find out more about the project and the possibility to participate in this campaign.We opted for modern technologies under the umbrella that is called HTML5. We didn't want to bother our players with the need to install plugins or the necessity to download huge software packages before they can play. Playing the game is as easy as opening a web page and logging in. Dusk of D.A.W.N. will work on almost every modern device capable of displaying websites. You can play almost anywhere you like. Start a match on your break at the office and continue at home on your couch with your tablet. It is as easy as that. And before you ask: Matches against other players are synchronous. There is no click-and-wait in our game. You can play directly against other players and chat with them like in any modern client game.Fjord Games is a young company and Dusk of D.A.W.N. will be our debut title. Nevertheless every project member brings experience to the table. Our artist Hjalmar Boulouednine has worked as an illustrator for a couple of well-renowned publishing companies in the past. The game designer Marcel Zons is currently employed in that capacity in an AA-Studio and working on a highly-appraised game while Patrick Nimmich, the project manager and developer, has been working in web development for years for some very large companies. He also has extensive experience as technical project manager and has worked in quality assurance during his studies at the Hamburg University.Over the last couple of months two more people joined our team. Martin Saß has just finished writing his bachelor thesis about Dusk of D.A.W.N. after having made a very positive impact on our development progress as an intern and he went on to became a crucial member of the team. Merlin Györy is a sound designer and composer by trade and got so inspired by the project that he wanted to contribute. He became the Sound Designer of the game and is now responsible for not only the amazing soundtrack, but also the sound effects of the game. You can already find some of his work on our Youtube-Channel.In order to create the best gaming experience possible, a lot of work needs to be done. The final product has to surpass what is usually available on the browser game market. To make this game a reality, we need to spend money on development, art, music and content production. While we do most of the work ourselves, there might arise the need to hire additional illustrators or software developers. Then there is also the need for bigger servers, because a consistent gaming experience comes with the necessity for stability and lots of bandwidth. We don't want you to experience lag or server breakdowns and we need to prepare for that. Finally there is the matter of legal fees. In Germany, setting up an international game with international players and customers comes with lots of regulations and we don't want to close down because of legal mistakes.Should we surpass our goal, we have prepared some very interesting features, which we will reveal in detail as we approach our goal.We do realize, that we are a startup company, which does come with a lack of a track record. But even though we are a young team, we have already gained a wealth of experience in our respective fields. And we are very engaged. We have been working as a team for over a year now and have taken our time to come up with the right concept to start with. We have already put in lots of 16-hour-days and have been foregoing most of our free time. Also the game is already in a basic playable state, so the final product is already in reach. This is something most campaigns for games do not have. People are actually playing Dusk of D.A.W.N.The Technology - We are working with cutting-edge technologies in web development. Most of these technologies can change very rapidly and with that come certain risks. Certain updates could force us to rebuild parts of the game and that could lead to delays. We have actually postponed the launch of this campaign to be sure, that we could deliver on the game and as it stands now, we are convinced that we can. We also stay ahead by constantly preparing for future updates and developing our game in a very modular fashion.While we have thourougly planned ahead for any foreseeable risks and challenges, there is always a chance that something goes wrong. We will do everything in our power to mitigate any delays and we will communicate transparently and frequently about the development process and the state of the project.In case you want to upgrade your already claimed perk: We are tracking how much money you have pledged so far. We will provide the highest possible perk to you considering all your previous pledges. Unfortunately, IndieGoGo doesn't seem to offer a function to upgrade perks automatically.Please note that any given dollar values have been calculated by us according to exchange rates at the time of the campaign creation. Due to different conversion fees and varying exchange rates these values will probably not be 100% accurate.Booster Pack Alpha contains:5x Random Common Card

My goal is to create a website full of articles written by fans of that particular thing and a forum full of purist escapism fans. I don't want any infection from politics or modern day ""journalism"" which is of course just activism parading as games journalism. I got sick and tired of reading the same BS ""Hot Takes"" from our existing options in terms of ""video game news"" websites and rather than just complain I have undertaken doing something about it myself. Short TermIn the immediate 90 days from the start of this campaign my goal is simple.  I need to pre-seed the website with interesting content as well as narrow down a pool of well qualified writers & editors for the website, adapt and grow the websites forum & build out and maintain a discord for fans.  My stretch goal here is to also figure out how to best utilize video to also spread the news.Within 90 days I hope to have a clear picture of the websites operating expenses, what it will cost to purchase the content, pay the editors and also pay moderators.  I will use that data to budget 2019 operating expenses and develop a plan to cover them each month.I currently DO NOT plan to run ads on the website, I don't want to design around it and everyone hates ads.  I instead will pursue the PBS style of funding by relying on interesting Merch, Monthly Patrons & Bi-Yearly fundraising drives.   Long TermMy long term goal is to have the site stable.  By this I mean to have found the websites ""voice"" for the articles & videos, establish a content schedule & begin establishing direct connections with game studios and industry folks, once credibility is established so we can do some more inside reporting.  A goal is to also always have a warchest of 6 months operating expenses maintained so the site can continue to deliver amazing content even if funding dips from month to month. Beyond that, beyond having a website dedicated to pure escapism it's hard to know where we will go but I hope it's an awesome place for people to hang out and have fun. Where Will The Money Go?Graphic Design Of The Website (I Have Pre-Funded This)HTML Coding Of The Website (I Have Pre-Funded This)Vbulletin Software (I Have Pre-Funded This)Developers To Design The Forum(I Have Pre-Funded This)Payment For ArticlesPayment For EditorsPayment For Mods/Social Media ManagerOngoing Graphic DesignMerch CreationServer/Firewall/CDN Costs I picked $5000 as a goal because it's all going to help.  The more we raise the more we'll be able to put into the site, the longer we'll be able to cover to get our feet off the ground.  I don't expect this fund to completely cover all costs, I have already invested about $5,000 and will commit some amount monthly from my Youtube Channel's income until we get off the ground.  The bigger the warchest the better chance we have to survive and grow past this first year. Huge Shout Out To Crypto.Fashion for helping me fufill the T-shirt Orders!  This is a HUGE help & they have ALWAYS supported the channel so make sure you check out their site! -Jeremy Stretch GOALS!Since this is more of a warchest let's lay out some Goals.

We’re in the process of creating <em><strong>Smash the Bloc</strong><strong>k</strong></em> - a kick ass modern update of games like Breakout - for iOS.

<h3 class=""p1""><strong><em>What You're Helping Us Do.</em></strong></h3>
<p class=""p1""><em>We’re aiming to raise <strong>USD$15,000</strong></em> <em>(~GBP£10,000).</em></p>
<p class=""p1"">It may seem like a lot, but in the increasingly competitive world of mobile games, indies have to compete on a level of quality equal to the big boys. To do that requires using the best talent we can. Code, art, animation, audio, design, marketing, PR – <em>it all costs time and money</em>.</p>
<p class=""p1"">The majority of the money raised (after the IndieGoGo fees, and the costs of making all the kick-ass rewards - you're going to love them!) will be going to pay the dev team.</p>
<p class=""p1"">That's the simple part.</p>
<p class=""p1"">These guys rock, they're all brilliant at what they do, and they deserve all the love and hugs we can give them. But they also deserve a bit of cash for the weeks and months of work they've done so far! Hugs don't pay the rent!</p>
<p class=""p1"">As with a lot of indies, we’re usually unable to pay people fully upfront, instead relying on trust and revenue shares to compensate the talented folks who make the game. That’s all fine and dandy, but it relies on good sales, and takes a while to come through even when those sales happen.</p>
<p class=""p1"">With that in mind we’d love to get some cash before release, to reward everyone for their hard work. They’ve all – code, art, audio, the lot – gone above and beyond the call, creating some <em>wonderful</em> stuff. It only seems fair (and extra nice!) to pay them early if we can – that’s where you come in!</p>

<p class=""p1"">The game's more than likely going to be launched for free, and will be out on iOS this <em><strong>summer</strong></em>. We’re <em>hoping</em> for an August launch.

The game's more than likely going to be launched for free, and will be out on iOS this summer. We’re hoping for an August launch. We don’t want to rush it for no reason. If we think it needs the extra time, it’ll get it. That’s what’s great about being indie!
Until then, check out the Gallery tab for more images from the game, plus behind-the-scenes videos that take you through some of the features. You'll even spot some footage of the game from before it had a decent artist (ie: not me) creating the assets!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>This project would pay for the software development of a ""parametric deformation"" system for polygonal mesh clothing attachments in the virtual world Second Life. A developer will be paid to create the software utilizing the Snowstorm open-source code for Second Life. A system of algorithmic functions and UI changes in the user client, This software would allow for mesh clothing to automatically deform to the avatar shape of an individual. The developer, Karl Stiefvater (formerly Qarl Linden) is a well renowned game developer and was responsible for creating the majority of the original coding involved in this project as a former employee of Linden Labs and he has graciously agreed to do this project. Karl has worked on Riven the sequel to Myst, the Matrix 2 &amp; 3, as an instructor on CG Society and is the founder of Lume, Inc. You can find out more about Karl on his web site: <font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#ff0057""><u><a href=""http://www.qarl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.qarl.com</a></u></font></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>This project came about as a result of a request for these features to the developers of Second Life, which was embraced by over 800 members who supported it with votes using the JIRA sytem. Unfortunately, the JIRA was downgraded to a ""someday/maybe"" status recently so that the developers could focus resources on stability and other issues for future releases. This was this initial impetus for searching out Karl and privately funding him to do the work, since the developers of Second Life who support such projects within the Snowstorm open source codebase, were unable to pursue the matter.</p>
<p>Please take a moment to review the JIRA and the many comments on it. The live JIRA document requires an SL account, but can be located here: <a href=""https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/SH-2374"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/SH-2374"">https://jira.secondlife.com/browse/SH-2374</a></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The deformer system would alleviate a variety of problems which occur during the creation process and also in the use of those products by individuals; It would automatically adjust the items when worn to fit the size and the shape of the person. This would allow them to retain a personal identity they have created which is a primary psychological motivator in virtual worlds. Currently, clothing items do not fit, they change you to fit them, adjusting your size and shape. A deformation system would eliminate a significant amount of technical and operational difficulty for creators and consumers within SL.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When completed, this will be a single mesh deformation layer. It will not be a multiple layer hierarchy or a full set of mesh adjustment sliders. As public domain, this code will be the basis for others to implement a wide variety of additional changes but will initially serve the basic purpose of a single mesh deformer: To eliminate the need for rigging, weight adjustment, alpha maps and multiple sizes of clothing. For the consumer of mesh clothing this will result in purchased mesh clothing items fitting to your shape automatically without the need for alpha maps and re-sizing of your avatar shape. The ability to adjust the cage deformer via a slider may or may not be able to be implemented at this initial stage, though the existing sliders will continue to work. Additional funded projects will be considered to add functionality such as a layered hierarchy after this initial goal is accomplished.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In order for this project to be completed, we need to raise the funding goal to pay for the development fee. 100% of the proceeds of this project go to the developer, Karl, and to pay for the fees associated with this site.</p>
<p>The code and any resulting user client would be available under the snowstorm open source codebase for Second Life to anyone who wished to use it. Generally, this code is used for the development of third party viewers. When completed, this code would be public domain, available to those residents of second life who are either software developers, creators or consumers of mesh clothing and attachments. It is our hope that the developers of Second Life will adopt this code to include it into the official client releases as well.</p>

<p>In <strong>Making Profit: The Boardgame</strong> every player is both factory manager and investor at the same time. As factory manager you have to decide: should you run the factory for profits or develop it instead... and what area to develop - resource or products? As investor you have to choose the factories to invest into - should you stick close to your own plant or are there more lucrative options made available by opponents? But there are so few actions available each turn... and at the end the winner is the one with most combined wealth.</p>
