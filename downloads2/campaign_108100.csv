<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of University students who are looking to film the pilot episode for a web series called ""Lost And Found"". The series focuses an ensemble of young people learning to deal with the world without adults - from figuring out basic survival necessities, to teenage issues in day to day life that they have to navigate under these new circumstances.</p>
<p>The series will also have a focus on the impact of pollution and climate change, and look at the narrative that this generation has been given - that it is the young people's job to fix the world because it is ours to inherit. What will drive the show is the resilience of the characters and how they react to everything around them, pushing them forward and aiming to show young people watching that they can push forward too.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Money donated will go to the following areas - </p>
<ul>
<li>CATERING - to feed the hard working cast and crew during the shoot</li>
<li>COSTUMES AND SET DRESSING - our incredible production designer Tan will be using this to find the perfect costumes for each character and making the set look like the near-distant future</li>
<li>PERMITS - as we are hoping to film locally in and around a playground, we need to pay for permits to allow us to film in our desired locations</li>
<li>TRAVEL - much of our amazing crew is travelling from quite far to come shoot this and we know that transportation can rack up pretty quick, so we're hoping to cut down some of the costs for them.</li>
<li>MARKETING - in order to actually get our pilot episode out there and seen, we know that it can cost to reach audiences, and to continue the series we'll need to market it.</li>
</ul>
<p>To say thank you we have some perk tiers, which you can check out and whatever amount you donate we will have a perk to say thank you for your contribution!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This pilot episode is the major project my crew and I are working on for our course at university - and we're all hoping to make it </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As this is a student production, we know that there are going to be a lot of challenges we will have to overcome throughout the shoot. For many of us, this is the first time we've worked on a production of this size, mostly having done basic 2-5 minute short videos with no budget at all. It's definitely going to be a learning curve, but we're all dedicated and up to the challenge.</p>
<p>We know that we're a team, and have trust in each other to achieve what we want to the absolute best of our abilities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sharing this campaign on Facebook, Instagram or any other social platforms to get the word out and help us achieve our goal would be absolutely amazing! </p>
<p>Thank you for your time and we hope to speak to you soon!</p>

I am an award-winning deaf filmmaker. I am the creator of  THE TWO ESSENCES.  Aspire to be a show runner, I recognize the thriving market of the digital streaming platforms and network industry, which lack stories about Deaf People of Color and varied deaf-centric content. </p><p>THE TWO ESSENCES is deserving of positive representation of Intersectional and diverse Deaf Talents of Color in film and television. Essence Chamberlain-Dubois is a free spirit, snaPPY, 38 year-old, self-taught freelance Day Trader and part-time housewife with three children. She decides to go back to school to pursue a degree in business at a black school where her 18 years old and self-centered deaf daughter, Zoë Essence, is also attending. This mortifies Zoe Essence. This is a story about a first and second generations’ mixed race Deaf and Hearing family. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490908414/qcgmst9lkmmdoz9egfg8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1490908721/jdmcuqo4u3goepqf4rpw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Jade Bryan, CEO of Jade Films and Entertainment commented: “There is a market for movies that feature Deaf Talent of Colors and their stories due to the fact we have been overlooked in the media and film industry."" Jade Films believes in creating jobs behind the camera for people whom are usually shun due to their Deafness but are exceptionally capable of doing an exemplary job in front of the camera or behind the camera! Hollywood and the entertainment industry have been sleeping on a segment of the population for too long. It is time to for the moviemakers to come out with our own stories.</p><p>The Production budget is $75,000 to shoot 6 episodes. The fund is primarily to finance our production costs like lighting equipment, legally necessary permits and production insurance, cameras, memory cards, hard drives, gasoline, car rental, lodging, feeding cast and crew. Creating the look of the shows are expensive! </p><h2><u>YOUR INVESTMENT</u></h2><p>Almost all the films produced by Jade Films are solely independent productions and has been self-financed up until this point. However, making a pilot series is an expensive endeavor and we want to make sure we have the financial support to take the film on the next level, where we will need at least $75,000 to produce a pilot series of high quality and caliber. </p><p>When the final product is completed, we will market it to various festivals, including Cannes, Tribeca, Sundance as well as popular streaming networks such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon, etc.</p><p>Passionate people make all the difference with something like this and every single person's contribution will make a difference. One of the main reasons we decided to use Kickstarter was because we loved the idea that our campaign, like our pilot project, will be a collaborative effort by people who truly care about our stories. Your help and support will be invaluable to us on this journey.</p><h2><u>CAN WE EXCEED THE GOAL?</u></h2><p>Yes!

</div></div></div>","Our campaign will end at after 2AM, July 16. However, you can still donate and we'll honor your perks. http://jadefilm.com/hearmyowntunethefilm/donate... My name is Jade. I am an award-winning deaf filmmaker. I am the creator of  THE TWO ESSENCES.  Aspire to be a show runner, I recognize the thriving market of the digital streaming platforms and network industry, which lack stories about Deaf People of Color and varied deaf-centric content. THE TWO ESSENCES is deserving of positive representation of Intersectional and diverse Deaf Talents of Color in film and television. Essence Chamberlain-Dubois is a free spirit, snaPPY, 38 year-old, self-taught freelance Day Trader and part-time housewife with three children. She decides to go back to school to pursue a degree in business at a black school where her 18 years old and self-centered deaf daughter, Zoë Essence, is also attending. This mortifies Zoe Essence. This is a story about a first and second generations’ mixed race Deaf and Hearing family. Jade Bryan, CEO of Jade Films and Entertainment commented: “There is a market for movies that feature Deaf Talent of Colors and their stories due to the fact we have been overlooked in the media and film industry."" Jade Films believes in creating jobs behind the camera for people whom are usually shun due to their Deafness but are exceptionally capable of doing an exemplary job in front of the camera or behind the camera! Hollywood and the entertainment industry have been sleeping on a segment of the population for too long. It is time to for the moviemakers to come out with our own stories.The Production budget is $75,000 to shoot 6 episodes. The fund is primarily to finance our production costs like lighting equipment, legally necessary permits and production insurance, cameras, memory cards, hard drives, gasoline, car rental, lodging, feeding cast and crew. Creating the look of the shows are expensive! YOUR INVESTMENTAlmost all the films produced by Jade Films are solely independent productions and has been self-financed up until this point. However, making a pilot series is an expensive endeavor and we want to make sure we have the financial support to take the film on the next level, where we will need at least $75,000 to produce a pilot series of high quality and caliber. When the final product is completed, we will market it to various festivals, including Cannes, Tribeca, Sundance as well as popular streaming networks such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO, Amazon, etc.Passionate people make all the difference with something like this and every single person's contribution will make a difference. One of the main reasons we decided to use Kickstarter was because we loved the idea that our campaign, like our pilot project, will be a collaborative effort by people who truly care about our stories. Your help and support will be invaluable to us on this journey.CAN WE EXCEED THE GOAL?Yes! If we can surpass our $75,000 production goal, it would not only be a dream come true, but it would allow us to finally produce a great show based on our perspective that millions and millions of deaf and signing people have been longing for! Exceeding our goal would help offset our significant expenses, which include the costs to rent the space, locations, pay for sign language interpreters, feed our actors/crew, actors pay, equipment rental, travel/lodging, hire a good crew, script copies, postage, and postproduction.OUR PRODUCTION TEAMJade Bryan - Creator/Writer/Producer/DirectorJuliana Shadlen - Added Writer/Director of Photography/EditorAl Rivera - Director of Photography/GafferDamon L.

<h3>THE SHOW</h3>
<p><i><strong>Dave’s (I Can’t Believe I Made it to Hollywood) Show!*</strong></i> is a sweet and funny webseries about a man with autism pursuing his dream of becoming a celebrity interviewer.   </p>
<p>The show follows the lovable Dave as he goes from a job stuffing envelopes by day to interviewing the biggest celebrities in the world by night.  We chronicle his journey from small town New Jersey to big time Hollywood. We meet his family and legions of supportive friends. We watch the producers of the series wrangle their unpredictable star, hustle to get celebrities on board, and struggle to keep the production running around Dave’s regimented meal schedule (“I DO NOT like to miss my lunch.”) </p>
<p>But this isn’t a charity case.  Not by a long shot.  Dave conducts the most charming, funny, and wonderfully weird celebrity interviews you’ve ever seen.  He treats the most famous people in the world like his closest friends.  <strong>Howie Mandel</strong> fell in love with Dave’s unfiltered honesty and <strong>Amy Schumer</strong> said it was one of the best interviews she’s ever done (even though Dave told her he thought Snatched was “meh.”)  In addition to Howie and Amy, Dave has interviewed <strong>Lewis Black</strong>, <strong>Jay Leno</strong>, <strong>Regis Philbin</strong>, and <strong>Frankie Valli</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, with six episodes filmed, we’re looking for partners to help us make Dave’s dream a reality.  That’s where you come in! We need funds to finish these episodes and give Dave his own YouTube channel.   </p>
<p><i>*Dave named the show.</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>FUNDING</strong></h3>
<p>Because we have already shot most of the show, all of the funds will go directly to finishing the first six episodes.  We're looking to raise $19,000.  We're budgeting $3,000 to finish each of the six episodes ($18,000) plus $1,000 to make a custom show open.</p>
<p>If we raise the full amount, we'll be able to finish all six episodes.  If we don't raise the full amount, then we'll make as many episodes as possible. </p>
<p><strong>But if we raise MORE than the full amount,</strong> <strong>Dave will get to interview more celebrities!   So feel free to keep contributing!</strong></p>
<p>These funds will be used for,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Hiring an experienced editor.</p></li>
<li><p>Hiring a sound mixer. </p></li>
<li><p>Hiring a graphic designer and animator to create GFX used in the series.</p></li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>First of all, thanks for your interest in donating! <strong>A little bit about us to start with: </strong>we are WetSuit Productions, a student-run production company completing a project that leads us towards graduation! </p>
<p>Camp Cedar Lake - as it stands - is a pilot episode for what we hope to be a comedy series designed for streaming services. We've essentially taken every awkward memory from our pubescent years and rolled it into one acne-filled half-hour.</p>
<p>If we had one sentence to describe it, it'd go something like this....... <i>On the first day of camp, an aspiring drummer must decide whether he's destined for fame, or being the subject of one budding YouTuber's clickbait titles - the answer might shock you. </i></p>
<p>This one goes out to everyone who made a best friend at camp, or learned a valuable new skill, or wishes they could go back to those years. This one also goes out to everyone who still might be in that time of their life. Camp is a special, special place, and Cedar Lake just wants to do you proud. </p>
<p>If you donate, you'll be helping us immortalize such a unique time in one's life. And we hope that we can inspire and encourage the younger generations to go to summer camp. It's cool, we swear. We'd be forever grateful for your contribution. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>You might be thinking, ""five thousand dollars?!"" Don't worry, we're on the same page. The truth is, these things cost a lot of money. Your funds will help us get the proper insurance and transportation required to get all of our cast and crew on location safely.

</div></div>","Short Summary
First of all, thanks for your interest in donating! A little bit about us to start with: we are WetSuit Productions, a student-run production company completing a project that leads us towards graduation! 
Camp Cedar Lake - as it stands - is a pilot episode for what we hope to be a comedy series designed for streaming services. We've essentially taken every awkward memory from our pubescent years and rolled it into one acne-filled half-hour.
If we had one sentence to describe it, it'd go something like this....... On the first day of camp, an aspiring drummer must decide whether he's destined for fame, or being the subject of one budding YouTuber's clickbait titles - the answer might shock you. 
This one goes out to everyone who made a best friend at camp, or learned a valuable new skill, or wishes they could go back to those years. This one also goes out to everyone who still might be in that time of their life. Camp is a special, special place, and Cedar Lake just wants to do you proud. 
If you donate, you'll be helping us immortalize such a unique time in one's life. And we hope that we can inspire and encourage the younger generations to go to summer camp. It's cool, we swear. We'd be forever grateful for your contribution. 

What We Need & What You Get
You might be thinking, ""five thousand dollars?!"" Don't worry, we're on the same page. The truth is, these things cost a lot of money. Your funds will help us get the proper insurance and transportation required to get all of our cast and crew on location safely. You'll also help us feed our team, shelter them, and make sure we have the equipment we need to make something truly beautiful.
We want to make sure that your kindness doesn't go unnoticed. We have a whole arsenal of fun prizes that you can get from donating - things likes social media shout outs, tickets to our premiere, and even photoshoot sessions with our team's photographers. We have so much more to offer, and we hope you'll stick around to find out!

<h3>This is us</h3>
<p>We are Ruggero and Andrea, two Italians living in Toronto, Canada. We left our country last October due to a difficult economic situation that's affecting many young people living in Italy. We met here for the first time and soon we found out that we have a lot of things in common, especially in video making. This led us to open a YouTube channel in January, which is called Chapters. Basically it is our story, divided in tiny little videos just to give people a perception of what we're experiencing from the other side of the ocean. After a long fun day spent travelling to Niagara Falls and shooting, an idea came to mind: why don't we start a cycling journey on the West Coast of the United States and we film every single moment of this adventure? We really love American culture and people. It will be a 30 days trip with just two bicycles, our backpacks and our video equipment.</p>
<p>Everybody has dreams, we have the American dream.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Perks &amp; needs</h3>
<p>We have to raise 9000 dollars to cover all travel expanses. We want to spend the less we can, we just need a bed and some food to keep us healthy. We still have to buy the 2 touring bicycles and a proper apparel, which will have a big impact on our budget. We have the video equipment we need (a DSLR, a drone and a GoPro), but we'll have to buy also some hard drives to storage all the footage which is going to be huge.<br/>The rest of the budget covers all the perks we're giving you. The biggest reward you can get is one of the bicycle that we're going to use for the journey. We'll give it personally to you after the end of our trip, only if you have the possibility to come to Los Angeles and pick it up.</p>
<p>And... Ah, of course! You will have a great video everyday, uploaded on our YouTube channel.</p>

<h3>THE STORY</h3>
<p>The word Snowflake is a derogatory expression. Used to characterise young adults as being more prone to taking offence and less resilient than previous generations, lacking the emotional ability to confront views that challenge their own. </p>
<p>Snowflakes portrays the left and right divide and how the idealistic want change but not quite sure how to make it happen.</p>
<p>The pilot will focus on the protagonist Penny, our bleeding hearted heroine. Set in the shadow of Brexit, that asks what happens when the woefully unprepared but well-intentioned try to make a stand. We see Penny finding plenty of enemies and some unlikely allies as she launches her haphazard campaign to become an MP as the caseworker for the local council in Bedling, while still trying to fix the problems of her boss's eccentric constituents.</p>
<h3>THE THEME</h3>
<p>The themes of this pilot are current and subjective. Focusing on the point of view of political apathy, local government, austerity and a calling for new politics, Snowflakes depicts a Tory Britain in a satirical and humorous way.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497707040/fef3he0xshkbbjoznfsb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>PRODUCER'S STATEMENT</h3>
<p>Comedy is within our lives every day and I felt it was something I wanted to further explore as a producer, reflected in a  mockumentary style. When I was first told about the idea of Snowflakes, which is in tune with society right now, I instantly knew this was a story that has the gravitas and longevity to become a series and not just a pilot. </p>
<p>Through continuous research to understand the political system, in order to help deliver a pilot that our audience will love, it has consistently brought me closer to recognise that the face of politics is changing. Therefore, it should be documented through the medium of television whilst bringing out a sense of enjoyment. </p>
<h3>THE CREW</h3>
<p><strong>PRODUCER – Elliot Barker </strong></p>

<p>After first pursuing an accountancy degree, Elliot Barker realised it was engagement within the arts that brought out his best qualities. Studying his BA in Film and Television Studies, at the University of Northumbria he found his desire to become a producer when he developed and packaged his first short film.</p>
<p>Now finalising his Producing Film and Television Masters at Royal Holloway, University of London, and having worked on a spectrum of genres and productions, Elliot continues to pursue projects that offer subject matter of either focal topics or laughter to an audience, Snowflakes does both.</p>

<p>Michael Beddoes is an award-winning director who has a number of festival selected shorts and commercial projects under his belt. Fascinated by the medium of story telling, he is always looking for exciting tales to tell, which is what drew him to Snowflakes.</p>
<p>Critically known for his short Forget Me Not, his other films have played all over the world at festivals and events such as Palm Springs ShortsFest, Aesthetica International Film Festival, Cannes Short Film Corner and more.</p>
<p><strong>DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY – Donna Wade</strong></p>

<p>Hannah Robinson is a British writer, based in Berlin. Previously working in development and film production both in the UK and Canada, she is halfway through her screenwriting Masters at Royal Holloway, University of London with several projects in development. She has a particular love for character-based comedy.</p>
<p>Hannah was inspired to write Snowflakes “as a response to our increasingly divided nation and world, where it sometimes seems that people on different sides can no longer understand each other at all. I wanted to play with these differences and imagine a microcosm of it all. In the world of Snowflakes, we’ve created the space to poke fun at a number of frustrations and idiosyncrasies of modern Britain, but also explore political engagement from the point of view of characters who are no way near mainstream politics.” </p>

<p>Shwan felt breaking into the composition of film and television is another platform he should utilise his creative talents and because Snowflakes offers realism in a satirical way, he believed this to be a great place to start. </p>

<p>Kamil's roots lie within the classical genre of music, however, he is a lover of all genres.

Since then, he has continued to build a rapport within the music industry and his talents naturally led to his interest in establishing himself as a composer in the film and television industry. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi I am Hayden Livesay, actor and creator of The Pool. Inspired, by my tenure as a pool lifeguard and shows like the Office, I wanted to create a group of characters that almost live in their own fantasy world and act in unpredictable absurd ways while having another group of characters that juxtapose this absurdness and represent the audience. At the end of the day I just hope the audience can laugh at these characters and the absurd day to day adventures they embark upon while working at an apartment complex pool. It is said that children laugh up to 300 times a day where as adults only laugh up to 20 times a day. My goal is to make that number of laughs for adults higher. Laughing and smiling is one of the greatest parts of being human and I truly believe the more we can laugh the happier and more enjoyable life can be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We were able to create a successful season one on a micro budget. However, we see the next chapter in the Pool on a much grander scale. We want to take our story telling and production value to the next level for season 2. We need funding for bigger and better locations most importantly. In addition funding would go to renting higher quality filming equipment from lens, to cameras, to mics, ect. It would also go to set design and costumes for some exciting new characters for season 2. The funding would also go towards meals for cast and crew as well as to pay the crew. As cast members we do it out of love! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will allow us to continue telling the story of these lovable dimwitted lifeguards on a much grander scale. Which simultaneously will help get this series more viewership and there by spread the laughter, which is our ultimate goal as filmmakers and story tellers. After all they do say laughter is the best medicine. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The main challenge we faced in season one was not having large enough budget to have control over the locations we used. That means we constantly were dealing with excess noise, rowdy neighbors, and time constraints for filming. Although we are proud of season one, these challenges prevented us from taking the time we need to execute our true vision. In addition it is difficult to get a crew of talented people behind the camera to work on your project for free. Funding would allow us to bring more people in behind the camera and get the locations we need in order to achieve our goal, which is telling the best story possible. This would also improve our sound quality which hindered our production value on season 1. </p>
</div><div>

<p>We truly love these characters and we think you will as well. Please share the Pool season 1 if you want to see these characters come back for season 2. Below is a link to season 1: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOd2rYd25Kd1rEPOqMS5eg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOd2rYd25Kd1r...</a> </p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi I am Hayden Livesay, actor and creator of The Pool. Inspired, by my tenure as a pool lifeguard and shows like the Office, I wanted to create a group of characters that almost live in their own fantasy world and act in unpredictable absurd ways while having another group of characters that juxtapose this absurdness and represent the audience. At the end of the day I just hope the audience can laugh at these characters and the absurd day to day adventures they embark upon while working at an apartment complex pool. It is said that children laugh up to 300 times a day where as adults only laugh up to 20 times a day. My goal is to make that number of laughs for adults higher. Laughing and smiling is one of the greatest parts of being human and I truly believe the more we can laugh the happier and more enjoyable life can be.

What We Need & What You Get
We were able to create a successful season one on a micro budget. However, we see the next chapter in the Pool on a much grander scale. We want to take our story telling and production value to the next level for season 2. We need funding for bigger and better locations most importantly. In addition funding would go to renting higher quality filming equipment from lens, to cameras, to mics, ect. It would also go to set design and costumes for some exciting new characters for season 2. The funding would also go towards meals for cast and crew as well as to pay the crew. As cast members we do it out of love! 

The Impact
Your contribution will allow us to continue telling the story of these lovable dimwitted lifeguards on a much grander scale. Which simultaneously will help get this series more viewership and there by spread the laughter, which is our ultimate goal as filmmakers and story tellers. After all they do say laughter is the best medicine. 

Risks & Challenges
The main challenge we faced in season one was not having large enough budget to have control over the locations we used. That means we constantly were dealing with excess noise, rowdy neighbors, and time constraints for filming. Although we are proud of season one, these challenges prevented us from taking the time we need to execute our true vision. In addition it is difficult to get a crew of talented people behind the camera to work on your project for free. Funding would allow us to bring more people in behind the camera and get the locations we need in order to achieve our goal, which is telling the best story possible. This would also improve our sound quality which hindered our production value on season 1. 

Other Ways You Can Help
We truly love these characters and we think you will as well. Please share the Pool season 1 if you want to see these characters come back for season 2. Below is a link to season 1: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoOd2rYd25Kd1r...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We’d love to continue making the show with full creative agency and are looking to raise money for all necessary production needs for Episode 2 and 3, filming this August 2021 for 10 days.  YOUR MONEY WOULD GO TOWARDS THE FOLLOWING: -Equipment Costs -Location Costs-Meals for Cast & Crew-Transportation-Wardrobe & Props-Editing -Color Correction-Sound Mixing Funding Stretch Goals:$17,000 - This will allow us to cover all of our production AND post-production costs and ensures that production can go smoothly. $18,000 - Level up. This will allow us an added layer of financial comfort on-set in case anything in production goes awry (as it inevitably does!) It also means that we can rent some additional equipment that will make our episodes look even better.$22,000 - The Dream. This will allow us to go above and beyond on all of our production and post needs, therefore elevating our episodes across the board. This will also allow us to explore our marketing options. Any contribution is greatly appreciated and thank you for the support!   MEET THE TEAM:Our team is comprised of some of the best peeps ever - a lot of our friendships dating back to college (ah, the good ol’ days). This team is a surefire recipe for filmmaking goodness: Sophia Conger (Writer, Director & Producer) is a New York City creator who puts women and their stories at the forefront. Sophia also produces and directs branded content with clients such as: Lymphoma and Leukemia Society, BNP Paribas and Weber Shandwick. In the past, Sophia was a team member of Tane, a creative video agency, Hello Sunshine, Reese Witherspoon's production company, and Smuggler, a commercial production house based out of Los Angles, New York, and London. Rebecca Dearden (Writer, Director & Producer) is an artist who works in many mediums including photography, painting, writing, and directing.  Through all of her creative interests, storytelling remains her biggest passion. Rebecca received her B.S. from Ithaca College in Cinema and Photography with a minor in Fine Art.

<h3>Shorter, Faster, Louder</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is John Yingling.  Long story short, I am taking my project, <i><strong>The World Underground</strong></i>, moving it to <strong>Indonesia</strong>, and taking it full-time.  Expanding the scope into <strong>monthly short films</strong> <i>alongside</i> feature films.  <strong>More</strong> writing. <strong>More</strong> audio recordings. <strong>More</strong> photos, and stories.  The goal is <strong>continuous output</strong> on a monthly basis.  I deeply miss doing short pieces, and I think it's a great new supplement.  I believe it will morph this project to what I've always dreamed it could be.  After a few years somewhat dormant <i>(for me)</i> in frigid Heilongjiang province, I'm swapping climates and cultures to once again entrench myself in noise on a full-time basis. </p>
<h3>What is The World Underground?</h3>
<p><strong>The World Underground </strong>is many things.  A feature-length documentary series.  An audio archive.  Storytelling.  Photos.  A connection page archiving different arts and culture scenes around the world.  It's been my life for give or take, the last decade.  It's constantly growing, and it's time to take it to a new level.  You can have a look here:  </p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.theworldunderground.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.theworldunderground.com</a></strong></p>
<p>Essentially, it began 10 years ago in the basements and warehouses of Chicago, Illinois.  I began documenting underground culture on a mediocre point and shoot camera.  Chicago changed my life.  After 7 years, I moved to Missoula, Montana, where I continued this, and tested an idea.  Could I roll up to a random small town's music scene, stick my camera in people's faces, and have it be accepted?  The answer was yes.  In the back of my mind, an idea lingered.  Go to a foreign country, do what I do, and see what came of it.  That country was Mainland China.  I had no idea if it would be a terrible failure, or a stroke of genius.  In my opinion, it fell somewhere in the middle. </p>
<p>After China, I went on to film a tour in Korea and Japan, with the China-based GUIGUISUISUI and Noise Arcade.  That was 2015, and will be Episode 2 of this project.  It was then I accepted a job offer in Northeast China, and landed in <strong>Indonesia </strong>for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>It's a long story</strong>, and is best summarized in an interview here : <a href=""https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/world-underground-series-john-yingling/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/world-underground-series-john-yingling/</a></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522627530/vub1ccgojrtwu6qq6gyb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What are you going to do with my money?</h3>
<p>A return to tireless documentation, story-telling, and output.  That's my goal. </p>
<p>The goal will be to release <strong>short films</strong> <i>at least </i> <strong>once per month</strong>, while I work on the feature length documentaries.  Write more.  Expand the scope from music, onward to arts and culture issues.  Indonesia is a vast and ultra-compelling area.  </p>
<p>In <strong>June</strong>, I will move to Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and use it as an editing and launching pad.  Their art and music scene is an absolute gem itself, and I've wanted to move there since my first visit 4 years ago.</p>
<p>Essentially, the new leg of this project will begin the second I leave Northeast China, when I will follow a short tour with a Chengdu, Sichuan based band <strong>Hiperson</strong>, pictured above.  After I get settled in Yogyakarta, I will go back to America for the first time in 3 years, mail the perks for this fundraiser, kiss my parents, and then begin editing the first short film.  Bringing this project into the full-time realm, and visiting places like <strong>Borneo, Sabah, Taiwan</strong>, and fringe scenes along the way is going to expand the way I run this project, and should be endlessly exciting.</p>
<p>Your money will spread across everything touched, paying for translators, gig covers, supporting local scenes through fundraiser perks and beyond.</p>
<h3><b>A rough schedule, so far : </b></h3>
<p><b>June : </b>Follow Chengdu, China based <strong>HIPERSON </strong>on tour, starting in Chongqing.  Then head to Beijing and once again document the P.R.C.'s capital, while I await Hiperson to then head east to Shanghai and Hangzhou, and eventually, south to Shenzhen.  This is a perfect opportunity to revisit the <strong>Guangzhou</strong> arts scene, which I'm very fond of.</p>
<p><strong>July : </strong>Re-align myself with Jakarta, Indonesia's ever-blooming art and culture scene.  I've been quietly making plans for some time.  After this, I will settle in <strong>Yogyakarta</strong>, which has a very broad, spectacular, and constantly shifting world of noise, art, and creativity.  Jogja will then become my editing base of operations.</p>
<p><strong>August : </strong>Malaysia, Taiwan, and other parts of Southeast Asia I've always wanted to go document, but could never spend enough time in due to being tethered for one reason or another.</p>
<p><strong>September - October : SECRETS!  </strong>Things are happening.  It's going to be exciting.</p>
<p>Final Cut of <strong>Episode 2 </strong>of <i>The World Underground</i>, which focuses on a tour through Korea and Japan with <i><strong>GUIGUISUISUI</strong> </i>and <strong><i>Noise Arcade</i></strong>, is <strong>finished</strong>, and awaiting sound mastering.  I hope to release it in early summer.  It's been a long road, but we're at the finish line.</p>
<p><strong>Episode 3 </strong>of <i>The World Underground,</i> will be called ""<strong>南方</strong>"" (South), and it will be about Beijing, China based <strong>P.K.14. </strong>Editing will begin shortly, and I'm very excited about this one.  It's my hope to have it finished much, much more quickly than previous releases, and I think if this fundraiser succeeds, I'll have all the means to do it.</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522636010/dsbskvyrhs6txsi9y1co.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact of this project is well documented.  The website itself is a living, breathing, constantly morphing catalogue of everything I've done with my life in the last 10 years.  Backlogged in the blog, the audio archive, and the films.</p>
<p>I write short pieces on each place I go.  The majority have been published on <strong>Impose Magazine</strong> and can be read here : <a href=""http://www.imposemagazine.com/profile/john-yingling"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.imposemagazine.com/profile/john-yingling</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'll be realistic. This is a big ask.  For the first time in 10 years, I've scraped my way out of a hole of high-interest debt, and am now ready to tackle this project on a full-time basis.  My workhorse editing computer is making dreadful noises.  My main camera (Canon C100) has begun glitching out when in high temperatures.  I believe it's only a matter of time until something finally cracks, and I fear it will be sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The website itself is somewhat expensive to run and maintain, costing around $75 monthly for all upkeep and services to make it work.  This adds up over the years.</p>
<p>Overall, the decision to take a leap as large as this is, in itself, a very big risk for me.  However, years ago, when I moved to China, I had a plan to do exactly this after I achieved some goals.  Those goals were achieved, and that time is now, so I must jump.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Budget breakdown</h3>
<p>$3,000 : Production starting costs for the <strong>Hiperson</strong> tour, and beginnings in Indonesia beyond.  After settling in <strong>Yogyakarta</strong> and making the rounds in Java island, I hope for my next stops to be <strong>Borneo</strong>, <strong>Sabah</strong>, and <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong>, Malaysia.  Supposedly, <strong>Bali</strong> is a <i>haven</i> for noise music right now, so that will definitely be explored.</p>
<p>$2,000 : Maintenance and ongoing costs.  Paying translators.  Everything from batteries to the scarily inevitable editing system and camera maintenance.  The other shoe will drop on both of these soon, but I don't know when.</p>
<p>$2,000 : Fundraiser and perk fees.  I take the ""perks"" on these fundraisers very seriously, packing them with as much art, noise, and beauty picked up from the places I have been.  The average costs in the past has been about 20%, and I assume this one will be no different.  Platform fees are around 9% when said and done.  I have quietly been stock-piling things over the last 2 years for this fundraiser, and much of it resides in Indonesia at this very moment.</p>
<p>$1,000 : Ongoing scene support, gig covers, broken memory cards, ghetto-rigging equipment.  It all adds up very quickly.  I also hope to off-setting t-shirt printing costs from a local high quality printing company called <strong>Orchard Street Apparel </strong>in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, U.S.A.</p>
<h2>Okay!  I'm in.  What do I get in return?</h2>
<p><strong>This is my favorite part!</strong>  Having done 4 fundraisers in the past, I've quietly been accumulating some great stuff for this one.  </p>
<h3>$5 : Thank You!</h3>
<p>A sincere Thank You, social media gushing, a mention in the upcoming film's credits, as well as on a revamped website.</p>
<h3>$15 : Postcard pack</h3>

<h3>$25 : Sensitive Word Art Postcards </h3>
<p>A stack of 8 postcards of Tony Cheung's wickedly twisted designs.  Mail them to your friends mom and freak the norms.  Keep them for when he is on the cover of some huge magazine, and gloat about how you knew about him before it was cool.</p>

<h3>$1,500 : Tour documentary (open invitation)</h3>
<p>If any bands wish to collectively throw down, I will create a 20 minute tour documentary of your trek.  Editing costs are included, international flights prices outside of South and East Asia are not. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! I'm Lyralen Kaye, and part of what I do as a storyteller involves listening to members of underrepresented communities and then weaving their stories into a narrative.</p>
<p>More than ever, this includes my own community. Not just LGBTQ, but specifically ENBY people. That's where most people start...but it wasn't until recently that non-binary people HAD a community. It wasn't until recently that I got to more accurately name myself by listening to people much younger than me.</p>
<p>Here's how it happened: I met Clare Solly, who wanted to do something on body image. So in late March, after the pandemic started, I began interviewing women of color, trans people, non-binary people, lesbians, bi-sexuals, pansexuals, mother and daughters about body image. I thought I would write a play about size, but almost immediately the project mushroomed into a multi-dimensional story about what it means to be in the estrogen milieu and have a body. Nothing in my life has meant as much to me as listening to the 32 stories of my interviewees and reading the letters of the artists who want to be involved. Race, aging, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, birth, death…to have a body is to be a human animal who loves, suffers, rejoices and dies in a world that didn't ask for you in the first place. The burning desire to tell the stories of what this is like is inside every person involved in this project...the interviewees, the actors, the crew...really everyone.</p>
<p>I’m asking you to support this project because what I’ve learned in listening to my people is that we have to stop hating our bodies. We have to stop believing the cultural conditioning about what is of value and trying to be...thin, white, young, pretty, able. Only then can we make peace with ourselves...and with each other.</p>
<p>This is a change the world project. It's also a change yourself project. Meaning--it has profoundly changed me. I believe it will help and change  all of us. So I'm asking you to support AFAB financially, now, while we're still in filming, 3 days after we went union and offered every one of the 23 actors a union contract. I'm so proud we've done this! Even though it doubles what we need to raise to film the entire first season. Union is a good.</p>
<p>Of course the norm is that these kinds of indie projects, with content so rarely touched in the mainstream, made and staffed by minorities, are almost always underfunded. And I am a gender fluid pansexual living with a disability myself—I’m one of the people on the lower end of the financial spectrum. All of us really want to make the full 12 episodes, with each episode costing at least $1500 to make.</p>
<p>So I come to you. I promise you that this project will be worth it. It will add meaning to your life, and pride in being part of underrepresented stories being told. So please support Assigned Female at Birth, a web series about some bodies, at the highest level that you can.</p>
<p>Because I’m one of the bodies. As are you. As are we all.</p>
<p>We all appreciate whatever you can do, and spreading the word is great support as well!</p>
<p>Be well, stay safe. We wish you peace.</p>

Hello! I'm Lyralen Kaye, and part of what I do as a storyteller involves listening to members of underrepresented communities and then weaving their stories into a narrative.
More than ever, this includes my own community. Not just LGBTQ, but specifically ENBY people. That's where most people start...but it wasn't until recently that non-binary people HAD a community. It wasn't until recently that I got to more accurately name myself by listening to people much younger than me.
Here's how it happened: I met Clare Solly, who wanted to do something on body image. So in late March, after the pandemic started, I began interviewing women of color, trans people, non-binary people, lesbians, bi-sexuals, pansexuals, mother and daughters about body image. I thought I would write a play about size, but almost immediately the project mushroomed into a multi-dimensional story about what it means to be in the estrogen milieu and have a body. Nothing in my life has meant as much to me as listening to the 32 stories of my interviewees and reading the letters of the artists who want to be involved. Race, aging, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, birth, death…to have a body is to be a human animal who loves, suffers, rejoices and dies in a world that didn't ask for you in the first place. The burning desire to tell the stories of what this is like is inside every person involved in this project...the interviewees, the actors, the crew...really everyone.
I’m asking you to support this project because what I’ve learned in listening to my people is that we have to stop hating our bodies. We have to stop believing the cultural conditioning about what is of value and trying to be...thin, white, young, pretty, able. Only then can we make peace with ourselves...and with each other.
This is a change the world project. It's also a change yourself project. Meaning--it has profoundly changed me. I believe it will help and change  all of us. So I'm asking you to support AFAB financially, now, while we're still in filming, 3 days after we went union and offered every one of the 23 actors a union contract. I'm so proud we've done this! Even though it doubles what we need to raise to film the entire first season. Union is a good.
Of course the norm is that these kinds of indie projects, with content so rarely touched in the mainstream, made and staffed by minorities, are almost always underfunded.

</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The Gotham Awards is considered the first official show of award season, and a strong, early predictor for the Oscars. This has placed us in the company of some of the top filmmakers in the English speaking world but, as we have relied exclusively on outside funding for the realization of this project, we are not in a position to afford the massive expense of attending the awards show without assistance. The cost of attending the awards show in person is a major hurdle for us and we have less than three weeks.</p>
<p>Last year’s winners of this coveted award were unable to attend the event due to the high costs involved. We don’t want this to be the case for our team. We are extremely proud of the work we have done and firmly believe that being able to represent our show on such an auspicious stage would make an enormous impact on the future of the project. This is a huge opportunity for our team and our show, but also for the Canadian independent film community as a whole.</p>
<p>Our series isn’t just Canadian made. Inconceivable is set in East Vancouver, proudly showcasing the eclectic culture and community of the people who live here. Our show represents real people living and working in Vancouver and deals with heavy, relevant, universal themes of sexuality, identity, the meaning of family, and community, that extend far beyond the physical borders of geography.</p>
<p>We are acutely aware of the tremendous opportunity, and responsibility, we have before us to represent Canadian independent film, in particular the Canadian LGBTQ+ independent film community, on a global stage. We would be remiss if we did not do everything in our power to seize this moment. Our physical presence at this prestigious, televised event would provide a voice and face for a community that is so often underrepresented.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal for this series is to have it picked up as a half hour episodic by a network. The visibility this would give us in pursuit of this goal is incredible.</p>

<h3>STRETCH GOAL: $20,000 </h3>
<p>This will allow us to film our complete first season. All costs will go directly toward production of season 1- cast, crew, locations, production insurance,  post production expenses. </p>
<h3>WOOT! WE HIT OUR FIRST GOAL! </h3>
<p>Thanks to your generous, amazing contributions we hit our first goal of $15k! A HUGE thank you to everyone who donated, shared, liked, and showed us love. We can't tell you how much we appreciate it. Our campaign is still live and in effect with IN DEMAND, so for those still looking to make an impact we would like to announce a STRETCH GOAL. This will allow us to complete our entire first season of DISGRACED! </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Grace Greene thought her career was made when she got cast as the lead in the third installment of a huge movie franchise. She thought wrong. Five years after the movie was an enormous flop, she's still attempting to claw her way up in Hollywood.  </p>
<p>We created this series to shed light on the (sometimes comical, sometimes horrific, sometimes both) way women are treated in Hollywood. This is a series about a young woman coming into her power. Frustrated, angry, and disappointed by her experiences, she will learn to stop asking permission and start taking the reigns. It's a series about perseverance and the lessons you learn while relentlessly pursuing your dreams. </p>
<p>This series is for everyone who ever felt like hard work just wasn't paying off, anyone who refuses to give up on their dreams, and everyone who has ever struggled with how to take control of their own destiny. </p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $15,000 to help fund the first 6 episodes of season 1. All funds raised will go directly to production and post production expenses. </p>
<ul>
<li>Expenses:<ul>
<li>Cast and Crew (Director of Photography, Assistant Camera, Grip, Sound, Assistant Director, Production Assistant, Hair &amp; Make Up, Actors)</li>
<li>Production: Locations, Permits, Meals, Equipment, Wardrobe, Props.</li>
<li>Post Production: Sound Design, Music Licensing, Score </li>
<li>We believe in supporting talented artists. Eric and Victoria will not be paid for their work, but we want to make sure everyone else most definitely is. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If we don't meet our $15,000 goal, all funds we do raise will go toward the production of season 1. </li>
<li>Anything we raise over $15,000 will be put towards completion of season 1 including post production expenses such as sound design &amp; music, as well as festival submissions. </li>
<li>If the gods of crowdfunding truly bless us and we have a serious surplus, that will go toward production of season 2. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We created this series to shed light on the (sometimes comical, sometimes horrific, sometimes both) way women are treated in Hollywood. By supporting this show you are supporting a diverse writing team that believes in representation and the importance of story telling as a means of change.</p>
<p>This is not just another show about a young woman looking for love, but about a young woman looking for self esteem, her self worth, and simply herself. After all, The Sopranos wasn't a show about Tony Soprano looking for love. Mad Men wasn't a show about Don Draper looking for love. Breaking Bad wasn't a show about Walter White looking for love. Why should men get to have all the fun?  Ultimately, this is a show about the importance of pursuing your dreams and controlling your destiny. </p>
<p>On our previous projects ""Tithes"" and ""We Accept Cash"" we had some of the most diverse and talented casts and crews around. We plan to continue the trend. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making a series requires blood, sweat, tears, (and money, also money.) We want to create an amazing series with high production value that looks like it was made with quadruple the budget, which is no easy feat. </p>

<li>Fortunately, Victoria &amp; Eric have self produced a half hour dramedy pilot as well as multiple short films, so they know all about the hustle required and are ready to rise to the challenge of DisGraced. </li>
<li>We have called in many favors from our talented cast &amp; crew as well as family and friends allowing us to hire amazing people for much less than their usual day rates, &amp; gain access to locations. </li>
<li>Victoria &amp; Eric are multi/multi/multi/multi tasking as not only writers, directors, and producers but also location scouts, set designers, casting directors, etc. </li>

This will allow us to film our complete first season. All costs will go directly toward production of season 1- cast, crew, locations, production insurance,  post production expenses. 
WOOT! WE HIT OUR FIRST GOAL! 
Thanks to your generous, amazing contributions we hit our first goal of $15k! A HUGE thank you to everyone who donated, shared, liked, and showed us love. We can't tell you how much we appreciate it. Our campaign is still live and in effect with IN DEMAND, so for those still looking to make an impact we would like to announce a STRETCH GOAL. This will allow us to complete our entire first season of DISGRACED! 
Short Summary
Grace Greene thought her career was made when she got cast as the lead in the third installment of a huge movie franchise. She thought wrong. Five years after the movie was an enormous flop, she's still attempting to claw her way up in Hollywood.  
We created this series to shed light on the (sometimes comical, sometimes horrific, sometimes both) way women are treated in Hollywood. This is a series about a young woman coming into her power. Frustrated, angry, and disappointed by her experiences, she will learn to stop asking permission and start taking the reigns. It's a series about perseverance and the lessons you learn while relentlessly pursuing your dreams. 
This series is for everyone who ever felt like hard work just wasn't paying off, anyone who refuses to give up on their dreams, and everyone who has ever struggled with how to take control of their own destiny.

If we don't meet our $15,000 goal, all funds we do raise will go toward the production of season 1. 
Anything we raise over $15,000 will be put towards completion of season 1 including post production expenses such as sound design & music, as well as festival submissions. 
If the gods of crowdfunding truly bless us and we have a serious surplus, that will go toward production of season 2.

Fortunately, Victoria & Eric have self produced a half hour dramedy pilot as well as multiple short films, so they know all about the hustle required and are ready to rise to the challenge of DisGraced. 
We have called in many favors from our talented cast & crew as well as family and friends allowing us to hire amazing people for much less than their usual day rates, & gain access to locations. 
Victoria & Eric are multi/multi/multi/multi tasking as not only writers, directors, and producers but also location scouts, set designers, casting directors, etc.

<h3><u>Backstory</u></h3>
<p>A poet and a filmmaker walked into a coffee shop one day, and at the end of that visit, they decided to collaborate on a web series.  Now they're working to make their dream a reality.</p>
<p>Spoken word artist/lyricist/actor/author <strong>SAELAH</strong> and writer/photographer/filmmaker <strong>KRISTI J. WOODARD </strong>are both natives of Shreveport, LA with creative gifts. </p>
<p>They first collaborated when Saelah was cast in one of Kristi's films, <i>Siren Song</i>, then again when Kristi directed one of SaeLah's poetic short films (aka music video) for his piece <a href=""https://vimeo.com/232676697"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Regrettably Yours""</a> ... but this collab is truly a labor of love. </p>
<p>Inspired by SaeLah's book <i>#Situationships </i>(2018), this web series will take his poetry and prose and match it with amazing visuals, to tell the story of a hopeless romantic who finds himself in a difficult situation when a longtime friend turns into complication lover. </p>
<p><strong><u>#Situationships: The Series</u></strong> is a romantic drama told from the man's point of view and it would mean everything for us to be able to fund this project so we can create this series for you! </p>

<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>This series was written by Black Creatives, will star a mostly-Black cast, and will be directed by a Black woman. The first impact would be showcasing the talent of minority creatives, while putting out great content for all to enjoy.  </p>
<p>Next ... it's rare to see a romantic drama told from a man's point-of-view, or that delivers a love story in the way we plan to do it -- through visual prose. We believe this story will inspire those who are in love, those who seek love and those who want to tell love stories. </p>

<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>Asking for financial assistance is hard for both of us, but we believe in this project and want to do it the RIGHT way, not just the cheap way. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Mollie Binkley and I am a freelance screenwriter currently based in LA. In the last few years, I have been developing several tv projects, historical and contemporary, around social justice issues including mental illness, civil rights, and illegal wildlife trade. In each story, I endeavor to depict strong women who play prominent roles in their respective society or ""world"". My latest tv project, LET US PREY, looks at gun culture and its institutions through the lens of a woman survivor suffering from PTSD and several characters working in particular institutions.</p>
<p>After the countless mass shootings over the last few years and recent presidential election, I had to write about this issue and immerse myself in the world to better understand the ideology of gun owners and many of the institutions involved in the issue. In my research so far, I have attended gun shows in Portland, met with individuals from gun violence prevention groups, and spoken with several gun owners from both sides of the conversation. I have also spoken with a psychiatrist about the symptoms of PTSD and read at length about the condition.</p>
<p>As I move into developing the series and fleshing out the characters, I have a unique opportunity to attend the NRA Convention and Gun Violence Prevention Summit back to back. This upcoming trip to Atlanta and DC will enable me to speak to more people on both sides of the conversation face to face so that I can better understand the varied perspectives of this polarizing issue.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is Required </h3>
<p>After self-funding two research trips to DC and NY, I need to raise $1200 for this trip. This will cover my flights, additional travel expenses, transportation on the ground, as well as entry tickets to events and meals throughout the week. Some dear friends have graciously offered their homes so I will not incur lodging expenses, making this trip feasible. In order to attend the NRA Convention, I was required to join and now have a year membership. Additionally, I intend to make a small donation to both gun violence prevention groups hosting the summit in DC.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I think LET US PREY has a capacity to help shed some light on this issue and possibly break down some of the barriers within our polarized society, while also examining more deep-seeded issues our country has been plagued with for decades. I hope this show helps people get out of their echo chamber, igniting their curiosity and maybe instilling them to change. People are blasted with disinformation everyday and I believe exposing some of the harsh truths and hard facts might help educate people and create more of a common ground where we can exercise more common sense.</p>
<p>In making this trip possible, you are enabling me to better understand both sides of the conversation so that I can tell a more honest story. A story that might inspire people to make changes in their lives and take action.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I hope to bring LET US PREY to life but am very aware of the risks and obstacles in taking on such a hot topic. But I believe it is absolutely necessary in today's climate. As I have learned more about the institutions and politics involved, I realize how powerful certain entities are and what they are capable of. In preparing for this upcoming trip, many people have cautioned me, telling me to be safe and careful. I do realize the risks and take them seriously, but do not intend to stop researching and delving into this world.  </p>

My name is Mollie Binkley and I am a freelance screenwriter currently based in LA. In the last few years, I have been developing several tv projects, historical and contemporary, around social justice issues including mental illness, civil rights, and illegal wildlife trade.

<p><strong>Jason Baskin</strong> is a student film maker who has had the distinct... pleasure to work as a production support phone agent for the past three years. While the call center he works at is a lot more tolerable than the average, it has taken the crazy antics of an awesome team for him to hold on to what is left of his sanity.</p>
<p>Thank You for Calling is the project that will allow Jason to graduate from Savannah College of Art and Design with a M.A. in Film.  During his time there, Jason has created a large number of films, music videos, and commercials, some nominated for awards. This is the largest project he has ever taken on to direct and is looking forward to making people laugh.</p>
<p><strong>Niki Zaldivar</strong> is an actress, comedienne, filmmaker, and Jason's partner in crime in the creation of Thank You for Calling. She has acted, co-directed, and has generally been a help on many of Jason's films.</p>
<p>Niki has spent five years working in the Atlanta film world and has recently started performing stand-up comedy acts in the city. Her experience as an actress has made her invaluable as a casting director and really just an overall guide into getting the best out of the talent in front of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Molly Davis</strong> is one of Jason's SCAD cohorts and the Assistant Director of Thank You For Calling. Her ability to keep everything on track when a director tries to conveniently forget the importance of things such as budget and schedules, is what ensures the success of any project she's a part of. Her knowledge and experience gained from her own projects as well as others makes her the perfect partner on set.</p>

<p>The total cost of making all five episodes of <i>Thank You for Calling </i>falls at $20,000.00. We've worked very hard to keep the budget as low as possible, but productions cost a great deal of money to make well.</p>
<p><strong>Cast: </strong>Cast makes up over 1/5 of our budget. Performance is the driving factor to any good production. You can have all the production value in the world, and if the acting isn't on point then why watch! This is a decent size ensemble cast, so to pay them all will come out to $7,500.</p>
<p><strong>Crew: </strong>Camera! Lighting! Sound! This is the production trifecta. Something wrong in any of these areas and forget it. The distractions will pile up. That's why $3,500 is needed to make sure we get the talent needed to make sure we have something great to watch... and listen to.</p>
<p><strong>Colorist:</strong> Have you ever seen a poorly colored film. It's weird. Like really, it can single-handedly mess up a good film. $2,000 is being allocated to make sure that doesn't happen.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment: </strong>Woohoo! Most of the equipment is going to be free! Unfortunately not everything can be. That is $2,000 is needed.</p>
<p><strong>Location &amp; Props:</strong> Soooo people are awesome! Hire Dynamics out of Gwinnett, GA has donated an office space for the show. Still to make it look like it is a proper small call center takes money. $1,000 to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>Makeup: </strong>Nothing too complex here, but it still takes some money. $750 to make sure our cast looks top-notch.</p>
<p><strong>Food: </strong>Let's be honest, no one likes to work on an empty stomach. The exact same thing is true for cast and crew on films. Although, sometimes directors tend to have too much on their minds to realize they're hungry (that's why there are AD's). Cost of food=$1750</p>
<p><strong>Contingency: </strong>Things go wrong. Equipment breaks. Plans fall through. Humans do human-like things. That's why there is $1,500 in the budget to protect against it.</p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><i>Screwed </i>is an LGBT-themed story that follows Luke, a single gay man who twists and shrouds his recent heartbreak into an anonymous blog about dating culture in the digital age. Luke finds himself bombarded by the world of dating. His life begins to take a turn as he grows closer to his party animal friends, who seem to provoke in him a more reckless approach to dating. It is only a matter of time before Luke's armor cracks and it becomes impossible to hide his vulnerability. The journey he undergoes to confront his mistakes and insecurities is mirrored by the romantic trajectories of the people in his life, all of whom represent a myriad of experiences and sexual orientations.</p>
<p>Too often we see characters move on from relationships when another love interest is thrown into the picture. Instead, Screwed attempts to explore the process of coming to terms with oneself and finding self-empowerment after heartbreak to its full complexity, with lots of self-deprecating humor along the way. </p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p><strong>Ben Weiss </strong>(Creator) is a New York-based writer and performer. He studied screenwriting under the mentorship of Bill Bleich and Jay Bonansiga. Ben was a former Acting Apprentice at the Williamstown Theatre Festival. Recently, he has been working for Intrinsic Value Films with Joseph Lagana.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Chang</strong> (Producer)<strong> </strong>is an actress, writer, and producer. She recently graduated from Northwestern University and has appeared in films such as “The Bling Ring” (dir. Sofia Coppola) and “The Outcasts” (dir. Peter Hutchings). At Northwestern, she produced multiple student theatre projects.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Sánchez </strong>(Director) is an actor and filmmaker from Portland, Oregon now based in New York City. As a performer he has starred in several short films, sketches, and features including Princess Cyd and the upcoming film When Icarus Fell. Eddie has also performed in several stage productions for the Virginia Wadsworth Wirtz Center for the Performing Arts at Northwestern University. He has produced, written, directed, and edited several shorts and an upcoming music video.</p>
<p>Starring: Ben Weiss, Chris Paul, Julie Busch, Avril Dominguez, Tess Musky-Goldwyn, Katie Chang, Harry Wood, Justin Tepper. </p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In order to make this show happen, we need your help to fill our budget of $6,000 to account for camera equipment, a small crew, and certain locations. This is a New York story and we need your assistance to make our show reflect the city and do it justice.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please feel free to reach out to us if you would like to join the team in any capacity. We are aiming for a summer shoot and would be more than happy to expand our crew!</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Valerie is an uptight woman who moves to Iceland with her Fiancé, Jared. The two have trouble finding their footing in this new country, and stick out like a sore thumb. However, Jared has a slightly easier time acclimating to their new environment as he begins to let his guard down. Things don't as easily for Valerie and she is constantly thrown into the most outrageous situations daily.  But when Jared discover's that he's been harbouring some feelings for the opposite sex, Valerie realises it's about time she follows in his footsteps because maybe she has been suppressing some parts of herself as well. </p>
<h3><strong>Why are we making it?</strong></h3>
<p>Comedy is a genre that brings people together and to be able to do that is an amazing opportunity. This story can connect with people on a very basic level of what it's like to fit in to a new place. We are only shooting the first ten minutes of the pilot episode, but plan on finishing the episode and continuing on to shoot the rest of the series. We are all very passionate about this project as it gives us the opportunity enter the world of comedy. Something that I myself is very keen on doing. This project will kickstart our careers in the world of television and in the genre of comedy. </p>
<h3><strong>Why should you back us?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The goal of the campaign is to raise $3,000. This will cover the cost of the flights to Iceland, as most of the team is from England. It will also cover equipment rentals, accommodation for cast and catering for cast and crew. We are beyond lucky to have a very dedicated and talented crew who are very invested in the project. However we do need a few more people on board. Every dollar donated will help push us forward to making this film come to life. </li>
<li>We are filming on the 1st-3rd of August and our aim in to submit the finished short film to festivals across the globe.</li>
<li>And of course in backing this campaign you would be contributing to our future and the future of this project, which we believe will go very far as it's purpose is simple. To make us laugh.</li>
<li>Please share this project as many ways as you know how, to get this project out there! That in it self is a huge contribution.  </li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>STORY:</strong> Andy and Bo are two egocentric millennials who like to say they are actors so it sounds like they have something going on. In reality though, all they really do is watch Netflix, drink, and get fired from job after job. They find themselves continually getting into cringeworthy and awkward situations due to their self-interest and lack of life experience. Each episode will run 3-6 minutes – because low attention spans are a thing - revolve around a specific topic/theme (such as dating and failing, trying to get into shape but failing, going out to a restaurant...and failing?) and will have stand alone titles, making it easier for the average news feed scrolling person to engage without fear of commitment. The only constants are the main location and characters.</p>
<p>Examples of Episode Titles:</p>
<p>“WHEN YOUR BEST FRIEND TURNS OUT TO BE IMAGINARY”</p>
<p>“WHEN YOU GET ROPED INTO A PYRAMID SCHEME”</p>
<p>""HOW TO GET FIT WITH YOUR BROS""</p>
<p><strong>THE DUDES BEHIND THE SERIES:</strong></p>
<p>Shea Norman (who plays Bo) is a budding young actor who's had a bad case of the acting bug his whole life ever since he first watched <i>The Mask</i> with Jim Carrey at age 3. Shea pretty much spent all of high school in the theatre room, acting in plays before joining the big boys at Vancouver Film School and graduating from the Acting for Film &amp; Television Program. Since then he has been living the good ol' actor life by going out for auditions in the day and serving tables at night. Now he is really ready to sink his teeth into his career by producing, writing, editing and acting in his own web series along side his partner-in-crime actor buddy Tyler Mitchell.</p>
<p>Tyler Mitchell (who plays Andy) has been a working performer for the last five years, having appeared in several commercials and making his acting debut in the short film <i>W</i><i>OODMAN </i>as Young Woodman. He enjoys eating, sitting and sleeping. He would like to thank his parents for their never ending support no matter how bleak his acting career looks. </p>
<p><strong>WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT TO US:</strong></p>
<p>We've both been performers and storytellers our whole lives and wish to bring our wacky minds to life with this web series. This means a lot to us and we need your help to make it all happen. With your support, we will deliver the best quality content you deserve.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is $10,000 and everything we raise will be going towards funding the first season. The money raised will go to paying the crew members on set, paying the actors, buying all the required equipment (camera, sound, lighting), filming on location, post-production editing and catering on set.

</h3><p><i>Man Friday</i> started as a hasty idea thrown together by us (Nemo and Bertha) in a TV-idea-generating session during our MA, the lesson taught by Channel 4’s script editor, Philip Shelley. Given 8 minutes and a local newspaper to create a TV series plot, we found an advert for Andy, the real <i>Man Friday</i>, and wondered ‘wouldn’t it be funny if...’</p><p>Wouldn’t it be funny if Andy (our initial protagonist, now named Matt,) was completely useless at the handyman job he was advertising. If Matt had to have someone, his boss (Friday) whisper instructions into his ear like James Bond’s Q. If Man Friday, the business, was called that because its owner, Friday, was transgender, and that was their chosen name. If Evelyn (originally based on a musician also advertising her skills on the previous page of the newspaper) was a crazy-rich philanthropist, sinking all of her money into the business because she was sick of plumbers’ bums not being attractive.</p><p>Our initial plan took inspiration from our respective favourites (Nemo’s love of the cozy mystery, a la <i>Rosemary &amp; Thyme</i>, and Bertha’s love of feelgood sitcom <i>New Girl</i>,) it became a case-of-the-week style show, with elements of a larger relationship growing between the protagonists.</p><p>Getting too excited to limit ourselves to the time we had in class, we decided that we loved the characters too much to simply let it die. We started thinking about how we could progress, how we could make this show a reality. With few productions credits to our name, we decided we’d use the project to bolster our portfolios, and kicked ourselves into production.</p><h3>How we got here… <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494809196/thhnsgfwkd1hpohqslwi.png"" src="""" style=""""/>

We will take what you can give and make use of all we can.</p><p>But with our ideal goal of £800 we can feed our cast and crew and buy the things every spy webseries needs: guns, CCTV and corpses... The money you donate helps to build on top of our base fund, meaning we can take the quality of our work that much higher. Our base fund is the out-of-pocket funds poor students Bertha and Nemo have managed to raise. We’ve contributed because we believe Man Friday is going to be special and has the potential to rise above it all!</p><p>And we're planning for it all. Your donations will also contribute towards a Rainy Day Fund (the contingency plan). Thankfully, our university allows us to loan film equipment we otherwise don’t have (lights, microphones, etc.) but our last day of filming coincides with our last day of term, and the store isn’t open during summer. So, if global warming does its job, and we manage to shoot all the days we’ve planned, we should be A-Ok. The problem comes if it rains (or similar unexpected problems,) and we’re forced to rent our £3500’s worth of equipment from an outside company. </p><p>At the end of the day, we want our webseries to look and sound industry standard, so that we can prove that it’s possible to tell our stories.

We’re going to be honest with you: we don’t plan to profit here. What we need, however, is a way to make sure our cast and crew are set up! Your donation will support this team of emerging talent create a great piece of work!The money raised on Indiegogo will support the bellies of our team, props and costumes pieces. We will take what you can give and make use of all we can.But with our ideal goal of £800 we can feed our cast and crew and buy the things every spy webseries needs: guns, CCTV and corpses... The money you donate helps to build on top of our base fund, meaning we can take the quality of our work that much higher. Our base fund is the out-of-pocket funds poor students Bertha and Nemo have managed to raise. We’ve contributed because we believe Man Friday is going to be special and has the potential to rise above it all!And we're planning for it all. Your donations will also contribute towards a Rainy Day Fund (the contingency plan). Thankfully, our university allows us to loan film equipment we otherwise don’t have (lights, microphones, etc.) but our last day of filming coincides with our last day of term, and the store isn’t open during summer. So, if global warming does its job, and we manage to shoot all the days we’ve planned, we should be A-Ok. The problem comes if it rains (or similar unexpected problems,) and we’re forced to rent our £3500’s worth of equipment from an outside company. At the end of the day, we want our webseries to look and sound industry standard, so that we can prove that it’s possible to tell our stories. The money you donate helps us create this vision without breaking us. No money, no problem! 
If you can’t contribute, don’t worry about it! By getting the word out and making some noise about our campaign, you’ll make a massive difference.Share this campaign, follow @greypapercrane and @zeus_japonicus on Twitter, Like 'Man Friday' on Facebook, and check out our website for regular updates.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Of the 13,800 positive rape kits processed in ten years in Los Angeles city; less than 700 women, men, and children have seen charges pressed and a day in court. We unravel the main facets that have created this huge disparity between reporting and charging.

We also explore the unique situation that challenges the conventional lack of rape kit processing.</p>
<p>Nationwide, we have an estimated 40,000 unprocessed rape kits. Los Angeles claims to process all rape kits collected within a 30 to 60 day period, so why is LA running at half the nationwide average for incarcerating sex offenders? Why have so many been given such little investigation effort? Why are victims not being told the truth about the processing of their own rape kit? Along the journey, we explore the finances of the justice industry that determine what type of crimes are given priority that largely affect our society. </p>
<p>Ultimately we will answer ""What happened to 13,000 positive rape kits?""</p>

<h3>Chapter 4: Feminism and Rape Culture</h3>
<p>We usually think of rape/sexual assault as a woman's issue, but it affects men and children too. Men and children can be victims which means they can also lie about being assaulted. We also look at aspects of rape that only apply to women like having to hand your child over to the person who raped you -- as is allowed in 31 states. </p>
<h3>Chapter 5: Rape Facilitating Drugs</h3>
<p>When we talk about RFDs, we immediately think of Ruffies. It's time to look at all the different types of RFDs including over the counter. Why isn't law enforcement looking for them in drug tests?</p>

<p>Rape is viewed as a sexual assault issue, but is it really? In this chapter, we review all the different mental health issues of rape, sexual assault, and child sex abuse.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Re:Generation Project is a grassroots environmental media organisation that will create informative and entertaining short films, which aim to demystify and popularise issues regarding climate change. These films will be made to be free-to-watch via YouTube and The Re:Generation Project website.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3>
<p>To mobilise and inspire positive solutions to combat climate change, and to the protection and regeneration of our environment. We will achieve this by offering practical and engaging information, that empowers individuals to take action to create a sustainable and equitable future for us and future generations.</p>
<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<ul>
<li>To investigate and report on pathways to a zero carbon and sustainable future.</li>
<li>To educate on climate issues and solutions, empowering individuals and communities to take action.</li>
<li>To act as a body of research to inform and influence public opinion and governmental policy towards action on climate change.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>How will we do this?</strong></h3>
<p>The Re:Generation Project will accomplish this by producing regular media output which is free to access via the website or YouTube. The content of these documentary-style short films will be a combination of interviews with experts, investigative reporting, and talking to people and organisations who are making change happen now. Being a solutions-focused intitiative, each film will conclude with practical actionable steps that viewers can use to enact change with their own communities. The Re:Generation Project website will host further resources and support material for each film, for those wishing to learn more about specific topics and actions.</p>
<p>The first films will cover the current state of climate change and some hot topic issues. Eventually we plan to address the main sectors of our society, and the challenges and opputunities of moving to a zero-carbon future, exploring each sector over 4-8 films. Topics will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Energy</li>
<li>Transport</li>
<li>Agriculture</li>
<li>Housing</li>
<li>Waste</li>
<li>Industry</li>
<li>Economics</li>
<li>Adaptation</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<p>The Re:Generation Project will methodically examine each contributing sector to investigate the current issues of creating a zero carbon and sustainable society, and present potential opportunities and solutions. We will bridge the gap between contemporary academic/scientific research and mainstream thought with films designed to entertain and inspire.</p>
<p>Intially, we will focus on UK based issues and initiaitives, but as we grow we will be open to covering and co-ordinating with the international fight for climate justice.</p>
<h3>
<br/><strong>Why Now?</strong>
</h3>
<p>The IPCC Sixth Assessment report has reinvigorated a sense of urgency within the environmental movement. Its message was stark and powerful; we are running out of time to avert the coming climate catastrophe. The report states that humanity must reach net zero- emissions by 2050 at the latest, although there is a growing sense even that is not ambitious enough and calls are growing for goals to be met earlier and with greater urgency. This will be a seismic change of a scale not yet replicated in human history, but it is the only option we have if we are to avoid dangerous climatic events in the future.</p>
<p>One of the main challenges of making such bold and transformational policies happen is convincing the general public of the importance of instigating such change. We live within democratic processes which rely on public participation, pressure and knowledge to drive the political agenda. Evidence suggest that one of the biggest hurdles is to overcome general apathy and powerlessness within individuals who understand climate change is happening. The  immensity of the issue and the vast scale of change needed can easily become too overwhelming to comprehend. </p>
<p>The goal is to channel the extensive academic and scientific work which has already been produced and relay that information into media which is engaging and understandable for as broad a range of audience as possible, but particularly aimed at engaging younger people (16-35), with the intention to develop a body of evidence to inspire and motivate individuals and communities to make positive change. We feel that the mainstream media does not prioritise the environmental agenda to the extent it needs to be broadcasted at this vital tipping point in human history, so we have created the Re:Generation Project to fill that void.</p>
<p>Coming from a lower-income background, I know that concern for the environment and climate change is not only a preoccupation of those who can afford to care. People from all walks of life have a close affinity towards nature and worry deeply about the future of themselves and their children, but frequently are unable to see how they can make an impact without adding to the daily struggle they may already be facing. These films aim to engage and empower people from all walks of life. The intention is to be solution-focused, to combat the overwhelming nature of the issue and the sense of apathy it can imbue upon people. Each film will provide avenues people can pursue to take immediate action. There is a huge amount of brilliant academic and scientific research that has already been done that can guide us to a zero carbon future and prepare us for adapting to a changing world. This project will be a vehicle for that research to reach a wider audience who may feel out of their depth in the academic and scientific fields of literature.</p>
<p>We believe that the Re:Generation Project is urgently needed and has an important role to play in the fight against global warming. We see it as a democratisation of information, an opportunity for people from a different backgrounds to harness the wealth of information available, starting progressive changes and movements to a zero carbon future.</p>
<h3>Upcoming Films</h3>
<p>We aim to have the first film released by mid-April 2019:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Climate Change: Where Are We Now?</strong></p>
<p>The first video of the series will serve as a short introduction and recap of the issue of climate change. Briefly reviewing the science and history, addressing the Paris Agreement outcomes and targets, but chiefly where we are now in relation to the forecast predictions provided by the most recent IPPC report (IPCC, 2018) and the reaction that it has initiated, or not, from grassroots levels, e.g. Extinction Rebellion, to the corporate and government arena.</p>
<p>Includes interviews with: Kevin Anderson, Sir Brian Hoskins, Gail Bradbrook, Jem Bendell, Colin Nolden, Paul Allen and others</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Is a Zero Carbon Britain Possible?: Councils That Are Making It Happen</strong></p>
<p>The second film will explore potential zero carbon targets feasibility with Paul Allen of 'Zero Carbon Britain' (the flagship research project from the Centre of Alternative Technology) and hopefully academics from the Committee on Climate Change. It will also explore how local authorities have taken intiatives and declared 'climate emergency' proposals. Councillors from both Stroud District Council and Bristol City Council will explain what this mean practically. These two districts, one a city and the other a small town with a large rural area, provide unique and differing opportunities and challenges to each other.</p>
<p>Includes interviews with: Paul Allen, Councillor Simon Pickering, Councillor Carla Denyer, Councillor Martin Whiteside, Colin Nolden and others</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Single-Use Plastics: What A Waste?</strong></p>
<p>The third film of the series will be looking at the current focus on single-use plastics. We will be exploring of the rise of single-use plastic items over the past 50 years and how they have become ubiquitous in daily life. We will be talking to waste management experts about the effects of the volume of single use plastic waste that goes through our waste streams, and how much of it actually gets recycled in the manner that many people assume it does when they put their plastic waste in the recycling. We will be looking out how the industry of single-use plastics exerts environmental stresses in terms of ocean pollution, effect on wildlife, food-chain toxification, increased carbon emissions etc.</p>
<p>There are two main culprits we will be examining as case studies for the film. Firstly, we will be looking at single-use packaging, particularly the type that is mostly found on fresh foods in supermarkets and we will take the chance to satirise some of the most bizarre uses of this type of plastic packaging, eg. Banana’s in bags and pieces of ginger in separate packets?! Secondly, we will be exploring the effects of the disposable coffee cups on the environment, the vast quantities which are used, and the scandal of their recycling rate. We will also pose a philosophical question on how we look at consumption and waste; why is it we as a society feel entitled to use a disposable coffee cup (which essentially cannot currently be recycled at any useful rate) at the expense of the environment? Why can we not just sit down and drink a coffee in a café, or bring our own cups? What would have to change in order to bring back a connection to what happens once we throw something away, to take more responsibility?</p>
<p>Includes interviews with: Claudi Williams and others TBC</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Waste Incinerator or Insanerator?</strong></p>
<p>This film will be introduced by asking the question 'How is it best to deal with our waste?' This will be followed by an introduction to the 'Urbaser Balfour Beatty' waste incinerator at Javelin Park. We will explain the basic concepts behind how waste incineration works and discuss why it is considered within the lexicon of renewable energy/sustainable development. We will then discuss the controversy behind the waste incinerator within the local community. An interview with Sid Saunders, a local environmental activist will explore his bold protest to go on hunger strike for 15 days and what concerns brought him to such extreme actions. This will cover the secrecy that has surround the accepted bid for the site of the incinerator, and the local concerns about the environmental impacts.</p>
<p>Includes interviews with: Sid Saunders, Tom Jarman (Community R4C) and others TBC</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Just Frack Off Already!</strong></p>
<p>This film will look at the continued support of the fracking industry from UK government and opposition to it. Interviews TBC.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Should The World Go Vegan?</strong></p>
<p>This film will be exploring the effects of meat and dairy consumption on the environment and emissions and asking: Does the world needs to go vegan? Interviews TBC.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise £3000. This money will act as a seed fund to help grow the project and pay for associated costs of creating the films. These costs include travel, equipment, running costs (website, editing software), etc.</p>
<p>In return, we will offer our films out for free, via our website and YouTube, as well as providing a wealth of extra resources for each film on our Take Action page of our website, for those who want to delve deeper into the films topic. You can also become credited a a contributor and your name will added to the credits at the end of a particular film. You can also become a Key Contributor and get access to full interviews with the many experts we will be talking to and have a say on which films should be made next. If you become a Partner of the Re:Generation Project, you will be credited in all films we make, and celebarated as a Partner on our website, as well as having full access to interviews, a say on the direction the films will take and close communication with the creative team.</p>
<p>In order to create a sustainable business model and provide regular, high-quality content, we will need a steady income stream. We see our future income model as a combination of supporter subscription and donation, sponsorship with organisations which fit the ethic framework and partnerships with educational bodies.</p>
<p>We hold our ethics to the highest standard to whether we accept sponsorship from a business or organisation. We will not allow companies that further the issues of climate change or environmental degradation to work with us. Obviously, that limits our choices under the current economic model we are presented with. However, there are plenty of positive forward-thinking, eco-minded organisations whom are breaking new ground.</p>
<p>Once The Re:Generation Project is creating enough revenue to support itself we envisage it becoming a community interest company (CIC) or similar non-profit organisation, to feed any excess profits back into environmental interest groups and community initiatives. Our ultimate goal is to promote and enact a zero carbon and sustainable future for us all.</p>

<p>ANOTHER SCHOOL SHOOTING!<br/>Stats now show us that there are 9 (nine) school shootings in the US every week. It's happening in every country throughout the world. We are teaching young Children to be violent in the Animation they are watching. Stats show us that there are approx 4,000,000 violent acts watched by young Children by the time they reach 10 years of age. Do we still wonder why. When a 15 sec TV commercial can make you buy what is shown. Violence 'AS SEEN ON TV' AND IT WILL GET WORSE . We must bring up our Children in a none violent arena.</p>
<p>19 school shootings in the US in 2018 already and February has just started.</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","Summary Hello, My real name is Richard Kontos.I write Children's books /stories under the pen name Mr. Authorpeadick. (As I am the Author and the stories are about Peas and Dick is English short for Richard). I live in Daisy Hill, Queensland, Australia.I have written Children's Books now in 10 different themes. In the Peasville Theme, I have written 429 books /stories about all the things that happen around and in the Tiny Town of Peasville. We have 18 main stars in this series with over 100 co-stars and as many walk-ins, as we need out of the 1300 Characters that we have developed to create crowd scenes Depending on which book or story we are animating. 15 of the episodes are about building things in the Tiny Town of Peasville 30 episodes have no trains or building at all, just none violent fun for young Children and 5 special Animations with little ladies in mind. All 53 episodes are aimed directly at the 2 - 6 yo demographic.I have always wanted to be involved in making none violent entertainment for very young children. Now I am, ever since I found that dried up pea on top of a Peazza (Pizza) in 1990, My Life has evolved around Peas and the Tiny Town of Peasville.

 
Our campaign is to raise enough contributions to build a studio to produce a continuous stream of none violent entertainment for our little ones. Starting with episode 1. The one that we are asking funding for. This is the episode that we are looking for proactive Parents, Grand Parents, Carers, Guardians and those concerned with the level of violent action and adult connotation that we see every time we let our young ones watch certain media outlets. So by you helping us, we will make our first suitable Animation for little-loved hearts and send you a copy as soon as it is completed plus all the goodies in our rewards as long as you have your ticket. I feel it is so important that we train up a child the way we would like them to be as adults.We are seeking $88,000 to animate episode 1 of 53 episodes in the first season. Not a lot, as we have been modeling for approximately 3 years getting all the Characters, Trains, Cars, Trucks and other strange colorful things that are needed to entertain very young Children ready to go. All the getting ready things are done, now we animate. The first episode is the hardest but most exciting.The money we hope to raise will be used to hire the crew to Animate the beginning of the series. Any over funding will be used to purchase extra computers and equipment to ingress our production capabilities. Our Perks are quite unique and start with eBooks, Video eBooks, Recognition in our series credits that last forever, Swap cards of the Stars in the series and many more great ideas from our crew. We will open our studio to Animators that would like to come on a working Holiday or local. (CONDITIONS APPLY)On the off chance, we do not reach our goal we will financial offer a lesser group of Animation crew to still finish the 1st episode and appeal to our volunteers to continue on to reach the project goal. I do know that some really want to be part of this journey into 'None Violent Animation' as they have young Children of their own and will work after hours to finish the project. We will offer that crew shares and higher positions if they wish to help completion.We are the only Propriety Animation Studio in Queensland (as far as we know from our existing animators) so we are breaking new ground and have a myriad of Merchandise to sell to keep the Studio going. With your help, funding our studio will give a number of Animators full-time work through the series as well as establishing a Propriety Animation Studio In Queensland Australia. That is not reason enough but supplying none violent none adult connotation entertainment for young is. People I cannot stress the importance enough. We must have more animation like ours. I have made a video on this reasoning with these statistics and the amount of violent content from people that disasters and recoverance are important to young Children's Minds that maybe but not Preschoolers.Our team has made a special HD test animation without sound to check all the movements and characteristics of each of the Peafolk. We could see that the Characters needed individual movements when walking and talking although we did get the color and look right. So we re-rigged each and every individual in the whole 53 episodes ready for final animation. Our enthusiastic volunteers and paid staff worked long and hard to show our style especially made for our very young audience.Our music is on show at www.peasville.fm and once again all the content is original and there is a new song for every book that will be animated. If we reach 53 episodes and we need more seasons we have 429 books ready to go and after that 10 new and exciting themes to add to our content load so we can build a studio with continuous output.

<p>Hello. My name is Kayden and I am 9 years old. My Mom and I have a YouTube Channel called Vlogs With Kayden. It is my favorite thing for my Mom and I to do together. We have so much fun. But we currently do not have a camera and won't be able to afford to get a new one for a while. If you could help us achieve our goal of raising money for our channel it would make me the happiest boy in the world. We would not have to use Moms phone to record, we would be able to purchase a high quality camera and lighting. We would also be able to buy some materials for new videos, I have so many things I could do it would be amazing! My dream is to become a huge YouTuber one day and then become an actor. So this is only the begining...so help me make my dream come true!! Thank you so much!! Have a great day!!</p>

<h3>How We Do</h3>
<p>""They could never get away with that now,"" you've probably heard or said recently. Again, the words ""caution"" and ""comedy"" are on a perilous collision course. Sid Caesar, Mel Brooks, George Carlin, Monty Python, SCTV, MAD-TV and even The Chappelle Show would today likely be ""canceled"" by thin-skinned social justice warriors before even hitting the airwaves. But the pendulum is swinging back folks, and we're providing some of its weight.</p>
<p>Comedy is all around us; not only in precocious children, kittens and frogs-in-a-blender, but also in those daily human exhibitions of hypocrisy, mendacity, obliviousness, incompetence, stereotyping, racism, and zealotry - the grotesque behaviors that drive us all absolutely friggin' nuts. Our outrage is reflexive and primal; coarse and ugly. So lampooning all those vivid colors - <i><u>in the grand tradition of farcical sketch comedy</u></i> - requires the same ribald palette of contorted behavior and emphatic language. ""Caution"" rings false. ""Clever"" is our workaround. Oh, there will be bleeps, ladies and gentlemen, but if we have our way...far too few. The children, the children, hide the children.</p>
<p>A café buzzing with crass assumption &amp; indignance; an influential but predatory casting office; the future of bigotry in diversity-staffing...all are made LAUGHABLE through our lens. You know you shouldn't. Laugh, that is. It's okay! We'll help you over that hump...by whatever means necessary. To us, a giggle is a fail. We want you on the floor, or at least your jaw.</p>
<p>Aunt Mildred would say some of those means are ""appalling"" and ""completely uncalled-for."" So we apologize in advance, with fingers crossed behind our backs. But mostly we hope you'll abandon all propriety and simply marvel at the craft, the insight, and the balls.</p>
<p>Of course, we hope the right programming executives will too.<br/> </p>

<p>As is the way in the digital age, Jody and Dave met via an Instagram connection and came together to shoot her first narrative drama as writer-director.

<p>The first episode cost approximately 5000 pounds to make and was shot over three days on a very tight budget. With episode two and three the cost will be slightly lower as the shoots will take place over three days for both episodes.

But when Sean is knocked out on a night out, his Conscience decides to take control and take Sean on a twisted, yet hilarious journey of self-discovery.Who we are :We are a group of Third year students from Falmouth University.

Taking inspiration directly from the dictionary definition of a conscience, he has created a story that he hopes will appeal to the humour of past, present and future students. His main inspirations come from his passion for video games, and TV shows like The IT Crowd, Peep Show, Fresh Meat and The Inbetweeners. He was inspired to write and direct because of his love for TV and the industry, and his sheer passion for his idea.Chloe Bickmore | ProducerChloe here is our Producer. She has found a passion for producing in her three years at Falmouth University and claims she can write a mean risk assessment. Chloe's inspirations are Rick and Morty and South Park.

<p><i>It’s time for the hardcore fans of the Steve Nation to have all the ownership and authority over the future of the Whiskey. Weed. Women. show!!</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A lot of people have a mis-conception that people are “making bank” on YouTube views but YouTube only pays fractions of <strong>pennies</strong> for views, which hardly cover any of the Sober Team expenses of making a weekly show.</p>
<p>Until now, we have been able to keep the show going and cover the cost with fans support buying hats, tees, and koozies. Steve barely makes drinking money from the show, which is why he still has his ""day"" job.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say after over 125 free shows seen by many millions of people that Steve is not in it for the money. That being said, this year’s large scale giveaway builds, traveling, and TV show style production quality don’t come free or even cheap for that matter!</p>
<p>Sponsors are not reliable and have even stiffed us the money they owed us in the past!  If we got sponsors to give us real money, they’d want a say in how the show is made.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">F**K THAT!</h2>
<p>Since Steve only gives a shit about what you think. It’s perfectly fitting for you, the fans, to fund this show. No one will have any say but the fans! And with your direct support it removes the restraints of censorship and Steve is able to give you exactly what you want.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485865153/geyrnyannzeuko53vk14.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Sober Team worked long hours to develop a tight budget to cover all the new expenses associated with doing this larger scale show. We have arrived at a very reasonable price of $3 a show. Wait, did you read that right?  Yeah, you did…  <strong>$3 A SHOW!</strong> With a plan to make 12 shows, that makes for a total of $36 bucks for the whole season.  That’s cheaper than getting a shirt and a hat in the Steve Store and with your support you can be one of the people on the show and/or win one of the builds from this year (over $45,000 worth of shit!)</p>
<p>We've set up an ""<strong>all or nothing</strong>"" style campaign which makes our goal a fixed amount. We will only be able to continue to make Whiskey Weed Women and do these large scale builds if we reach our goal.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">HOW WILL MY MONEY BE SPENT?</h3>
<p>Right off the top the IndieGOGO fee's of 8% gobble up $12k; really making our budget start $138k.</p>
<p>Most notably a great portion of the budget will be spent creating the large scale builds that we will giveaway to the fans including shipping cost (only in the continental US). We also have salaries for the Sober Team staff of 5 that put the show together. We've also budgeted travel fees for Steve to get closer to the fans on these shows. And lastly we should give Steve some beer money for his time making us laugh. This is truly the minimal amount of money we can do the show with. Half hour network shows that offer what we are promising can cost $75K-$100K <i>per episode</i>. We are keeping the staff small and budget super tight by delivering it direct to you and creating 12 episodes for under $150k.</p>

</div></div>","Who's Steve Jessup? A southern legend... Watch the video!



After 3 years making 128 shows, accumulating 100 million views, and rallying over ONE MILLION social media followers; it’s time for Steve Jessup to go full-scale, get closer to the fans, and give back to Steve Nation!

 


12 professionally produced 25 minute episodes (like you see on TV) of Whiskey. Weed. Women. - FULLY LOADED - delivered to you twice a month from June 1st all the way to November!
Each episode will feature lifestyle segments, where Steve will travel to the fans and dive deeper into all things Whiskey, Weed, and Women.




Episodes will be output in 1080 HD resolution that will be a digital download to most any devices. If the funding takes off, we’re delivering this bitch in 4K!

This year’s episodes will include all the usual favorite Steve Jessup elements just BIGGER and CRAZIER. These episodes will be paid for by fans and therefore aren't subject to ANY censorships currently found on YouTube and Facebook. You'll get Steve just as he is with no restraints!

Whiskey Weed Women YR4 FULLY LOADED is gonna be the loudest, rowdiest year yet - including two EPIC builds that Steve is giving away to the fans who have the greatest amount of referrals during the Indiegogo Campaign (over $45,000 in prizes).
 

 
After carefully reviewing your emails and comments, we’ve narrowed our focus on two unique, exciting Steve Jessup styled original builds to giveaway to 2 lucky supporters of this campaign.
Our requirements for choosing the builds for YR4 FULLY LOADED were the following:

 



 
The Limo Freedom Buggy takes an already popular and fun pastime and pushes all the boundaries. We start with a basic limo golf cart and  make it the extreme party ride!


As with both of our projects, the buggy is scalable from a four-person bar buggy to the full size 10-person buggy converted to hold a full size bar, TV’s, sound system, and dancer pole on the back deck. We can dream big so if the supporters turn out, we can make the largest craziest limo buggy ever built! 
If the funding goes beyond expected, we can even add the “Tag Along” trailer to the buggy. The tag along adds 2 more rows of seats to make the mobile party grow!

Fully decked out this prize could be valued at $30,000!


 
The Jessup Tailgator is a custom towable bar that follows you any where you go. It comes complete with minimum of 6 covered barstools, yeti coolers, and a gas grill cook out kitchen.
It will also be decked out in all the classic Jessup features seen on the show like a premium Whiskey Wipers beverage dispenser, kegerator, stash spot, etc. The Stereo will crank loud and LED lights will go crazy. It’s a towable party ground zero!
You can take this rugged setup into the woods for hunting, camping or fishing, hell, take it to the beach or even slopes if you want to serve up some hot toddy’s!
Our trailer might look similar to this one below, but with a LOT of specialized Steve Jessup features you've come to know and love.

The retail value of this giveaway is approximately $15,000!  Extra funding will supply a TV, or a stripper pole, more seats, or all of the above AND more!
 

It’s time for the hardcore fans of the Steve Nation to have all the ownership and authority over the future of the Whiskey. Weed. Women. show!!
 
A lot of people have a mis-conception that people are “making bank” on YouTube views but YouTube only pays fractions of pennies for views, which hardly cover any of the Sober Team expenses of making a weekly show.
Until now, we have been able to keep the show going and cover the cost with fans support buying hats, tees, and koozies. Steve barely makes drinking money from the show, which is why he still has his ""day"" job.
It’s fair to say after over 125 free shows seen by many millions of people that Steve is not in it for the money. That being said, this year’s large scale giveaway builds, traveling, and TV show style production quality don’t come free or even cheap for that matter!
Sponsors are not reliable and have even stiffed us the money they owed us in the past!  If we got sponsors to give us real money, they’d want a say in how the show is made.
F**K THAT!
Since Steve only gives a shit about what you think. It’s perfectly fitting for you, the fans, to fund this show. No one will have any say but the fans! And with your direct support it removes the restraints of censorship and Steve is able to give you exactly what you want.

The Sober Team worked long hours to develop a tight budget to cover all the new expenses associated with doing this larger scale show. We have arrived at a very reasonable price of $3 a show. Wait, did you read that right?  Yeah, you did…  $3 A SHOW! With a plan to make 12 shows, that makes for a total of $36 bucks for the whole season.  That’s cheaper than getting a shirt and a hat in the Steve Store and with your support you can be one of the people on the show and/or win one of the builds from this year (over $45,000 worth of shit!)
We've set up an ""all or nothing"" style campaign which makes our goal a fixed amount. We will only be able to continue to make Whiskey Weed Women and do these large scale builds if we reach our goal.
HOW WILL MY MONEY BE SPENT?
Right off the top the IndieGOGO fee's of 8% gobble up $12k; really making our budget start $138k.
Most notably a great portion of the budget will be spent creating the large scale builds that we will giveaway to the fans including shipping cost (only in the continental US). We also have salaries for the Sober Team staff of 5 that put the show together. We've also budgeted travel fees for Steve to get closer to the fans on these shows. And lastly we should give Steve some beer money for his time making us laugh. This is truly the minimal amount of money we can do the show with. Half hour network shows that offer what we are promising can cost $75K-$100K per episode. We are keeping the staff small and budget super tight by delivering it direct to you and creating 12 episodes for under $150k.

<h3><u>SHORT SUMMARY</u></h3>
<p><strong><i>Our television pilot will bring diverse characters and story arc's that will captivate your attention. Gnarly Fields has the ingredients that rival the shows Greenleaf and Power. You be the judge of that. We assure you that this show will catch your attention from the opening scene. </i></strong></p>
<p>We at Ambient Path Entertainment in association with Team Ramsey Entertainment are bringing you a dramatic story dealing within the fields of Home Health Care, Loss Prevention, Law Enforcement, Ministry, Auto mechanics, and the drug underworld. All fields that will tie into a compelling story that follows a family in a rural city of Eufaula, Alabama, where a non-traditional pastor is murdered, shocking the inner town, as his grieving wife and 4 children seeking answers while going through their own tribulations. The pastor has a dark secret that someone wants to keep quiet. The police investigation takes a twist and turns while the mystery slowly unravels, opening door to skeletons in the pastor's closet. Everyone close to the pastor is a suspect. The pastor betrayed his wife, children, congregation, and friends. <strong>Who killed the Pastor? The ending of the season will shock you.   </strong></p>
<p>We are running this campaign to raise money for our production this late fall. It is important for us to reach or exceed our goal to get things in motion, in place for production to have great filming with the actors and crew to deliver an awesome story to you. We strongly feel that this story will touch on many subjects advancing the main story arc and will have an impact for more episodes to come.</p>

We the writers at Ambient Path Entertainment LLC are developing the characters from some of our life experiences. Of course, the plot within this pilot will set the pace for you to want to see more. We feel confident about that. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>WHAT WE NEED &amp; WHAT YOU GET</u></h3>
<p><strong>The total budget for our production is in the hundred thousand, somewhere around two thousand dollars, but since we as a start-up company and new at crowd funding, we don't want to overstep our boundaries, we are asking for twelve thousand dollars. It's going towards the pre-production cost via crew, equipment, and locations, moving us into prodution.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, if we exceed our goal we can pay for the main talent and other key production needs to have a successful shoot. Each cent is solely for the purpose of filming this great Pilot to present to film festivals and hopefully attain distribution or gain a show runner to get a shot on a network. We not only have the pilot written, we have more episodes  written in the can, planning on finishing out season one with twelve episodes. </p>
<p>The perks? Eufaula, Alabama is a beautiful city and should be a perk itself. We have wonderful perks that you may feel necessary to help us reach our goal.  Get excited! You will have access to set photos, online interviews, our private group with the stars and director, and first-hand access to everything before the buzz hits the mainstream. If you are in Eufaula or the wiregrass area, we have wonderful perks for you as well. </p>
<ul><li><p><i>We really want to reach this goal so we can start the Pre-Production process, If we don't reach our goal, your funds will be returned to you soon after. BUT, we don't want to speak failure and failure isn't an option</i>. </p></li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3><u>OUR IMPACT</u></h3>
<p><strong>Words can't explain how we feel that once we are actually filming this masterpiece, we will get picked up for the season, to film the other episodes. Giving other shows on prime time and online platforms a run for its money. We have a great director in Gary A. Sturgis, a wonderful crew, and the actors will give the best to their ability performances to the character. We feel if you don't get mad or feel some type of way about a character or scene, then the story isn't strong enough. Gnarly Fields will have a powerful impact on you connecting to the essence of the story.</strong></p>
<p>I say this much When the Bell Rings is a 4-time award winning documentary. I'm proud to have been a part of it. It was directed and produced by our Consulting Producer Brad Bores. It is destiny we link back up again and continue our award-winning ways.</p>
<p>We are grateful for your time and efforts in sharing and pledging what you can to our production. We assure you that this pilot will keep you wanting more every step of the way. The characters are complex and diverse with real life issues, and the suspense will have you on the edge of your seat wondering who killed the pastor?

<h3><strong><u>RISK &amp; CHALLENGES</u></strong></h3>
<p>To be honest, we heard from various of people that we won't be able to get this pilot on air, It is hard to make a T.V. show to keep people complete attention, and we will have a hard time selling this story with such little experience in television.

We like to prove the naysayers wrong.</p>
<p>This will be a show that people will talk about at their job, on social media, and at the dinner table. Now there is the substantial amount of risk in filming this project,</p>
<ol>
<li>This will be filmed on location in Eufaula, Alabama. The city hasn't had a production of this magnitude in a long time. So getting the city to adapt to film production life will be the most challenging part.</li>
<li>Security,</li>
<li>Food allergies,</li>
<li>Talent schedule,</li>
<li>Unforeseen financial discrepancies. </li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Logistics will be taken care of by a location manager that can lock down locations and make sure we are up to standard by location, state, and OSHA compliance.</li>
<li>Security will make sure that the set, equipment, and talent personal effects are safely secure. </li>
<li>Food Allergies, we will assure that our catering team will have signs of allergic reaction-causing foods.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>I am a contributor to The Times newspaper of London.  I am hoping to raise £5,000.00 to fund an 'arthouse' documentary that will follow the lives of two drug users. It will have no narrator, and will simply be them talking to the audience. Without divulging the idea, as it is incredibly unique, I can assure you that whoever should watch this will go through an emotional rollercoaster -- visually, the film will be striking and will overwhelm your senses. If the lives of these people are not immortalized, their struggle can never be addressed -- this will prompt change. The funding will go toward film equipment, and paying those involved. I will receive no profit, nor my team.</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Your contribution will aid changing the way we view hard drugs, such as heroin and crack cocaine. It seems as years go by, people look at them romantically, ignoring their devastating effect on our community; the death, the pain, and the misery. Your contribution will bring this to light on a larger scale.</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The documentary will be filmed alongside heavy drug users in dangerous areas, seldom frequented by ordinary members of the public.</p>

</div></div>","Short SummaryI am a contributor to The Times newspaper of London.  I am hoping to raise £5,000.00 to fund an 'arthouse' documentary that will follow the lives of two drug users. It will have no narrator, and will simply be them talking to the audience. Without divulging the idea, as it is incredibly unique, I can assure you that whoever should watch this will go through an emotional rollercoaster -- visually, the film will be striking and will overwhelm your senses. If the lives of these people are not immortalized, their struggle can never be addressed -- this will prompt change. The funding will go toward film equipment, and paying those involved. I will receive no profit, nor my team.
The ImpactYour contribution will aid changing the way we view hard drugs, such as heroin and crack cocaine. It seems as years go by, people look at them romantically, ignoring their devastating effect on our community; the death, the pain, and the misery. Your contribution will bring this to light on a larger scale.
 
Risks & Challenges
The documentary will be filmed alongside heavy drug users in dangerous areas, seldom frequented by ordinary members of the public.
 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot donate to our cause, then please share this!  If you have any film equipment [unwanted, don't empty your cupboard for us ha ha!] then please also contact me on my email listed above.
 
I thank you kindly for reading, and wish you glad tidings.

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Meet Kuukaari!</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Kuukaari is a video streaming service that focuses primarily on giving the public access to films, shows, documentaries and animation created by up and coming producers of color. In a world full of diverse people, cultures and stories, it’s important to promote and present opportunities for people of color throughout the entertainment industry to be able to showcase the colorful world we live in today.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">A Platform for Change</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You may have heard about the need to increase representation in entertainment. That is what Kuukaari plans to do. We will curate films, animations, documentaries and music videos from a diverse group of creators and create a streaming service that allows the audience to enjoy content that elevates creators of color. We all come from different backgrounds and traditions, but we all have a story to tell and I want to bring those points of view to life.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">With your support, Kuukaari will become the destination platform for celebrating our world’s rich diversity. We want future generations to see people who resemble them on screens – it shouldn’t be a novelty anymore. We want to hear stories from people who are often overlooked, but have so much to share. Every contribution takes Kuukaari one step closer to fulfilling our commitment to you: <i>to create space for culturally diverse creators – a content platform for new views and new voices.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560197499/qfycx3bowl9kzehjumuo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">How We Differ</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Kuukaari provides a massive range of entertainment media, similar to what you might expect from another streaming service. But unlike other streaming services, we offer the entertainment that the industry overlooks all too often. With a standard subscription, we provide the best and bright new talent from all variety of people of color. You can find your next favorite series, a movie, or a life-changing documentary.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">But it’s not just a subscription streaming service. We offer something that no one else in the industry has dreamed was possible. Many actors have hoped through the years for a strong voice for people who are black, brown and the many colors in between. We are making that possible. The common problem cited within the entertainment industry is that the roles available, and job positions available don’t offer an accurate representation of the POC community. We are offering the only chance in entertainment to make impactful change.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Making It Happen</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">You may be wondering, “So what do you need?” My ask is for contributions towards my goal of $200,000. Here is where that money goes:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">* Building the streaming platform for desktop, mobile, and tablet consumption (Tech &amp; Design)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">* Marketing/Advertising</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">* Business &amp; Legal Expenses</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">* Crowdfunding Expenses &amp; Fees</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">* Content Acquisition</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559873763/ifdo64aepfjqvb5ki55r.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">In exchange, we have an array of cool perks you can choose from, depending on your level of contribution. We have shirts you can rock, and experiences like access to a discussion forum, discounted subscriptions for when we launch, and artwork created by some black and brown artists, amongst many other things.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Each contribution we receive helps us move towards creating more diversity in the visual arts. We seek creators that you may never have discovered and bring them to the forefront, so the world can appreciate their creations. We want it to be the standard for diversified content and holistic representation of society.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Each contribution also validates the importance of our vision. It shows that people do care about representation in the entertainment we consume and want to see more of it. People want to see new narratives from new points of view and your contribution validates that desire.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Rising Stars</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Every day Hollywood and film see new talent emerging. Many people will see success and failure through various careers in the entertainment industry. Up and comers from diverse backgrounds can find another avenue of opportunity here.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">After #OscarsSoWhite and the slew of actors of color speaking about the struggle they faced for years, people began to question what the actual representation was in Hollywood. Personal opinions aside, well-known names cited the underrepresentation as the reason for fewer and fewer actors from minority backgrounds.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The approximate representation for film leads is 3 to 1. It is a struggle enough being an up and coming actor looking for work. Only 6.9% of film directors are people of color. We're striving to show the demand for skilled directors and more.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Here are some examples of people doing great work, but you may never have heard of them:</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Raymond Malinga</strong>, director &amp; CEO of Creature Animation. He is from Uganda and directed “A Kalabanda Ate My Homework”. This short animation has been selected for many festivals including Festival Du Film D’Animation D’Abidjan, Granadian Film Festival, and Seattle International Film Festival. He is currently working on an animated series called “Superstar Suubi”.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hi there! My name is Cecilia and I am happy to see you stop by today. I am a film enthusiast, traveler, soon to be entrepreneur, and founder of Kuukaari. Born in Nigeria and raised in metro Atlanta, cultural and ethnic diversity play an important role in my upbringing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I have traveled and lived in countries such as South Korea, Chile, Jamaica, and China, and the one thing that I have come to love no matter where I am in the world, is that stories connect us. I love learning about the past, present, future, and its traditions through the narratives told by those I connect with wherever I go. I founded Kuukaari because I want to see more of these perspectives, and I know that many of you want to see it too!</p>

</div></div>","Meet Kuukaari!
Kuukaari is a video streaming service that focuses primarily on giving the public access to films, shows, documentaries and animation created by up and coming producers of color. In a world full of diverse people, cultures and stories, it’s important to promote and present opportunities for people of color throughout the entertainment industry to be able to showcase the colorful world we live in today.
 
A Platform for Change
You may have heard about the need to increase representation in entertainment. That is what Kuukaari plans to do. We will curate films, animations, documentaries and music videos from a diverse group of creators and create a streaming service that allows the audience to enjoy content that elevates creators of color. We all come from different backgrounds and traditions, but we all have a story to tell and I want to bring those points of view to life.
With your support, Kuukaari will become the destination platform for celebrating our world’s rich diversity. We want future generations to see people who resemble them on screens – it shouldn’t be a novelty anymore. We want to hear stories from people who are often overlooked, but have so much to share. Every contribution takes Kuukaari one step closer to fulfilling our commitment to you: to create space for culturally diverse creators – a content platform for new views and new voices.

How We Differ
Kuukaari provides a massive range of entertainment media, similar to what you might expect from another streaming service. But unlike other streaming services, we offer the entertainment that the industry overlooks all too often. With a standard subscription, we provide the best and bright new talent from all variety of people of color. You can find your next favorite series, a movie, or a life-changing documentary.
 
But it’s not just a subscription streaming service. We offer something that no one else in the industry has dreamed was possible. Many actors have hoped through the years for a strong voice for people who are black, brown and the many colors in between. We are making that possible. The common problem cited within the entertainment industry is that the roles available, and job positions available don’t offer an accurate representation of the POC community. We are offering the only chance in entertainment to make impactful change.
 

Making It Happen
You may be wondering, “So what do you need?” My ask is for contributions towards my goal of $200,000. Here is where that money goes:
* Building the streaming platform for desktop, mobile, and tablet consumption (Tech & Design)
* Marketing/Advertising
* Business & Legal Expenses
* Crowdfunding Expenses & Fees
* Content Acquisition

In exchange, we have an array of cool perks you can choose from, depending on your level of contribution. We have shirts you can rock, and experiences like access to a discussion forum, discounted subscriptions for when we launch, and artwork created by some black and brown artists, amongst many other things.

Each contribution we receive helps us move towards creating more diversity in the visual arts. We seek creators that you may never have discovered and bring them to the forefront, so the world can appreciate their creations. We want it to be the standard for diversified content and holistic representation of society.
Each contribution also validates the importance of our vision. It shows that people do care about representation in the entertainment we consume and want to see more of it. People want to see new narratives from new points of view and your contribution validates that desire.
 
Rising Stars
Every day Hollywood and film see new talent emerging. Many people will see success and failure through various careers in the entertainment industry. Up and comers from diverse backgrounds can find another avenue of opportunity here.
After #OscarsSoWhite and the slew of actors of color speaking about the struggle they faced for years, people began to question what the actual representation was in Hollywood. Personal opinions aside, well-known names cited the underrepresentation as the reason for fewer and fewer actors from minority backgrounds.
The approximate representation for film leads is 3 to 1. It is a struggle enough being an up and coming actor looking for work. Only 6.9% of film directors are people of color. We're striving to show the demand for skilled directors and more.
Here are some examples of people doing great work, but you may never have heard of them:
Raymond Malinga, director & CEO of Creature Animation. He is from Uganda and directed “A Kalabanda Ate My Homework”. This short animation has been selected for many festivals including Festival Du Film D’Animation D’Abidjan, Granadian Film Festival, and Seattle International Film Festival. He is currently working on an animated series called “Superstar Suubi”.

 
 
Shaq Saddler, an art student at SCAD. He created a short animation for his character Ella-mental in a retro style. His goal is to create his own cartoon for Adult Swim.

 
 
Joshua Sowemimo, a photographer and music video director/videographer in Atlanta. He as an eye for talent and really takes the time to elevate each person in his projects.

 
About the Founders

Hi there! My name is Cecilia and I am happy to see you stop by today. I am a film enthusiast, traveler, soon to be entrepreneur, and founder of Kuukaari. Born in Nigeria and raised in metro Atlanta, cultural and ethnic diversity play an important role in my upbringing.
I have traveled and lived in countries such as South Korea, Chile, Jamaica, and China, and the one thing that I have come to love no matter where I am in the world, is that stories connect us. I love learning about the past, present, future, and its traditions through the narratives told by those I connect with wherever I go. I founded Kuukaari because I want to see more of these perspectives, and I know that many of you want to see it too!

<p>Super-Unnatural is a web series running 23-30 minutes per episode.  The genre is Horror/Comedy.  Billy and Chad buy a house for an unbelievably low price that seems (and is) too good to be true.  When they find an ancient book and haphazardly read from it, hilarity ensues, but not without that nice splash of horror.  If you like Evil Dead, you'll LOVE Super-Unnatural.</p>

<p>The first episode took well over 100 hours (we stopped counting after that) of research, writing, collaboration, and editing to complete because we wanted <strong>engaging work that would inspire an intelligent audience</strong>.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>THE PLAN, THE GOAL AND STRETCH GOALS</strong></p>
<p><strong>Four episodes have been researched and written</strong> and three of the four have been recorded. We have decided to take it <strong>one episode at a time </strong>to ensure that at least some of that work reaches fruition. Therefore, we are operating on the following scale:</p>
<p><strong>$3500 (total) = </strong><strong>Completion of Episode 2:</strong> <strong>The Heiress and the Sea Monster</strong> (Jan. 2, 2020 backer release; Jan. 16, 2020 public release)</p>

<p><strong>A Pilot Season: </strong>If we can reach the stretch goal of $10,000 we would consider that a ""Pilot Season"" and be pretty darn happy. We'd also be able to put together a DVD and digital download package that would include a <strong>few extras for backers</strong> who choose to support at the correlative levels.</p>
<p><strong>Extending the Season: </strong> After the first $10,000, we can reduce the cost per episode so that with each $2500, a new episode can be crafted and released. In other words, $12,500 enables five episodes; $15,000 enables six. We are prepared to go up to 12 episodes with a new one coming out each month through 2020 if we can get to $30,000 or more!</p>

<h3>What is Abductees Anonymous and who are we?</h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/324276708?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>With our beginnings in the indie film scene, funding was not always an option. We could not rely heavily on VFX, or expensive costumes and props. What we could rely on was content. Content, content, content. We could rely on quality writing, characters, and plot development. And so, we did.</p>
<p>Abductees Anonymous is where quality writing meets quality funding.</p>
<p>With your help, the timeless format of “The Office” will meet with the always interesting topics of UFO’s, Aliens, and more.</p>
<p>We want the new spot of being the Netflix superstar.</p>
<p>We believe our Proof of Concept speaks for itself, and we want to show the world more.</p>
<p>Invest now in what will be seen by millions soon.</p>
<p>Be there for the beginning of the revolution.</p>
</div><div><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3></div><div>
<p>Let's keep it simple. We are raising $10,000 for Episode 2 (a 20 minute mockumentary style short).</p>
<p><strong>100% of money raised will be going towards our cast, crew and production</strong>. From camera op, sound recordist, makeup, extras, camera gear rentals, sound equipment rentals, crafty (food for the day for cast and crew), post production editing, a colorist, composer, all the way to props and location fees. Here at Happenstance FIlm Co we honor ourselves on paying our worker the fair price they deserve in order to deliver the ultimate quality product.</p>
<p>But you can be a part of our crew too! Well, not physically, but <strong>any donation of $100 will get YOUR name in the credits</strong>! Investors and having funding are just as important as having the people to make it happen. Simply email happenstancefilmco@gmail.com with proof of your receipt and your name is in lights!</p>
<p>In the situation where we don't reach our goal, nothing changes with our mindset. Any possible cuts will be made to the budget, but 100% of our funds will go towards our team and the production. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>So why do we care so much about this project? Simple. All we hear and talk about with people is how they miss content in film and tv. How they'd prefer rich character development, witty dialogue, comedic banter, love interests, and not CGI and sex scenes. </p>
<p>So we will be the ones to do it.</p>
<p>We will bring back the rich age of cinema and tv that we all miss so much. Quality television that gathers people and makes us smile, laugh, scream and cry. </p>
<p>With the outstanding reception the show has gotten so far at premiere's and showings, we want to bring that to the world, and make more of it.  We want to make a timeless show that we will be re-watching on netflix, hulu, amazon, and everywhere for years to come.</p>
<p>We want to rock the film and television world.</p>

</div></div>","What is Abductees Anonymous and who are we?

With our beginnings in the indie film scene, funding was not always an option. We could not rely heavily on VFX, or expensive costumes and props. What we could rely on was content. Content, content, content. We could rely on quality writing, characters, and plot development. And so, we did.
Abductees Anonymous is where quality writing meets quality funding.
With your help, the timeless format of “The Office” will meet with the always interesting topics of UFO’s, Aliens, and more.
We want the new spot of being the Netflix superstar.
We believe our Proof of Concept speaks for itself, and we want to show the world more.
Invest now in what will be seen by millions soon.
Be there for the beginning of the revolution.
What We Need & What You Get
Let's keep it simple. We are raising $10,000 for Episode 2 (a 20 minute mockumentary style short).
100% of money raised will be going towards our cast, crew and production. From camera op, sound recordist, makeup, extras, camera gear rentals, sound equipment rentals, crafty (food for the day for cast and crew), post production editing, a colorist, composer, all the way to props and location fees. Here at Happenstance FIlm Co we honor ourselves on paying our worker the fair price they deserve in order to deliver the ultimate quality product.
But you can be a part of our crew too! Well, not physically, but any donation of $100 will get YOUR name in the credits! Investors and having funding are just as important as having the people to make it happen. Simply email happenstancefilmco@gmail.com with proof of your receipt and your name is in lights!
In the situation where we don't reach our goal, nothing changes with our mindset. Any possible cuts will be made to the budget, but 100% of our funds will go towards our team and the production. 
The Impact

So why do we care so much about this project? Simple. All we hear and talk about with people is how they miss content in film and tv. How they'd prefer rich character development, witty dialogue, comedic banter, love interests, and not CGI and sex scenes. 
So we will be the ones to do it.
We will bring back the rich age of cinema and tv that we all miss so much. Quality television that gathers people and makes us smile, laugh, scream and cry. 
With the outstanding reception the show has gotten so far at premiere's and showings, we want to bring that to the world, and make more of it.  We want to make a timeless show that we will be re-watching on netflix, hulu, amazon, and everywhere for years to come.
We want to rock the film and television world.

<p>Here is a little paragraph from our writer/director Victor to tell you more about the show: 'I am the writer and director of this film. Apologies for that. I’ve been writing surreal comedies for many years, and this seemed the perfect time to once again write another surreal comedy. This one’s about a glove puppet, which is a character I can personally relate to because I too am dry-clean only. I’m feeling very enthusiastic about this project because it’s a satire about something that’s important to me. Often, in the industry, a writer’s original idea can be totally ruined by a production team who don’t understand it, or by executives who want to turn it into something it’s not. And this film is about how this issue can put off a lot of writers, and the effect it has on the industry overall. Admittedly when phrased like that it doesn’t sound particularly funny, but it is. It’s very funny. We’ll all have a good laugh. ROFLOL etc! Over and out.’ - Writer, Victor Hampson</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Johnathan Rozanski, better known as The Mysterious Mr. Enter on YouTube. I'm known for reviewing animations, which I've been doing for years now, learning what works in the medium and what doesn't I'm ready to make my own series now, or at least the pilot. I have been planning this series for years, building onto the world, and writing dozens of scripts. I feel that Growing Around can truly be an amazing cartoon, entirely creator driven, and free from network control; a show that tackles harsh themes with good humor. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Here's a pie chart as to our budget allocation:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529693320/u1e4gtnrsttnh4dcfsrw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>This is a fixed funding campaign. If we either meet our goal or we don't get a cent</p>
<h2><strong>Example Plotlines</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>The pilot episode is about Sally's brother Max, turning twelve. He knows that next year he's going to be a teenager and starts becoming more and more worried that he's getting older and won't be in charge anymore. Meanwhile, Sally's attempt to give him the best birthday ever no matter how many tries it takes isn't helping.</li>
<li>When Sally and Max both grab a cereal box toy at the same time, the only way that they can solve the issue is by going to a court, run by kids.</li>
<li>Sally comes across a town that's been driven into a post-apocalyptic state because the kids in charge don't want to stop a never-ending game of tag.</li>
<li>Sally starts a pet-sitting service and bites off more than she can chew when she's forced to pet sit for everything from komodo dragons to kangaroos.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Growing Around is a series that can resonate with all ages - it has something for everyone, where it be teaching you a lesson, making you feel, or just making you laugh - all through its immersive storytelling. Each episode will focus on a story, sometimes complex and sometimes wonderfully simple. Each episode can introduce something - make a major change to the dynamic of the series - or even completely change how you view a character. Topics such as death will be interwoven into the story, as to not just bring them up, but to handle them respectively and guide you through them. Complex issues are handled with nuance, and often the answers given don't turn out as black and white as you'd expect. Each episode is an immersive experience with a story for everyone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Provided the pilot gets funded, every single episode is going to be its own little miracle. I don't know how well Patreon and ad revenue from existing episodes will continue the show after its pilot. In turn that means there will be no filler episodes. While not every single one will move the overarching plot in some significant way, every episode will have some kind of importance.</li>
<li>This episode will most likely take longer than the typical nine months that it takes to make a cartoon episode as we try on different animation styles.</li>
<li>This is my first cartoon. There is no way around this. I've never done this before. However, I am placing my future on this. I need this to be the best show that it could possibly be, or else this first cartoon will be my last.</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Do perks come with previous rewards?</strong> Yes, except for limited rewards, all previous rewards come with all lower-tiered rewards.</li>
<li>
<strong>How long will each episode be?</strong> Every single episode is around the 22-26 minute range, including the pilot.</li>
<li>
<strong>What style will the animation be? </strong>The show is going to be 2D Animated, like the model sheets and the poster.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do people age backwards?</strong> No. People are born babies, grow to kids, grow to teenagers, and then to adults.</li>
<li>
<strong>What do you mean by continuity-driven? </strong>Everything in every episode continues to the next episode. People keep and retain their experiences, lessons, adventures, and consequences.</li>
<li>
<strong>Do the adults act like kids, or vice-versa?</strong> The adults act like adults, and the kids act like kids.</li>
<li>
<strong>If you get more than you ask for, where will the extra money go?</strong> It will go into additional episodes. If there's not enough, it will go into other GA media, like comics/graphic novels, pieces of art, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Why is the animation budget so big?</strong> Because ""animator"" is one of the most tedious jobs in the world, drawing the same characters (usually not even your own) over and over, for hours on end. And for a project this big you would require a studio or team. </li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>What's up peeps? <strong>Creator Thomas Fraser</strong> and lead actor <strong>Tony Baker </strong>would love to produce a season of a show called Baker's Boys on Youtube, streaming or network television. Baker's Boys would be a show about a recently divorced comedian, Tony, who makes the very hard decision of slowing down his career to stay in town to be closer to his teenage boys before they go to college.</p>
<p>Not only will we follow Tony and a cast of characters through life, but we will also understand why a two parent household and sticking around to be a father is one of the most important basis for a healthy and balanced life.</p>
<p>Thomas and Tony will mix their lives together (a la Phil Rosenthal and Ray Ramano, Everybody Hates Raymond) to bring you the kind of humor you are used to enjoying from Tony Baker --Everyman, natural, down home, thoughtful, insightful, wacky and honest humor.</p>
<p>Take a look at the first episode above and contribute if you'd like to see more. Creator Thomas Fraser started this journey by using his own money to produce this pilot. We are not waiting for a handout. We are creating our own destiny. But you can't do everything yourself and now we need your help. <strong>EVERY DOLLAR COUNTS.</strong></p>
<p>""God Bless the child that's got his own.""</p>
<p><strong>Tony Baker (Comedian, Actor)</strong> who currently has 1.1 MILLION FOLLOWERS on Instagram was born Anthony C. Baker in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Tony and his family quickly moved back to the city of Chicago where he was raised on the south side. His passion for film started at a very early age and stayed with him throughout his life. While attending New Mexico State University his creative ideas were brought to the forefront while writing and directing films with his colleagues just for the love of it.  His love for theater developed when he made his stage debut in the University production of ""Of Mice &amp; Men"" in which he received his first acting award. After bringing his acting talents to the stage he knew that it was time to make the dream a reality and uprooted his family to California to pursue a career in acting and stand up comedy. Since then he's appeared in many tv shows and movies including Whiplash, A Black Lady Sketch Show, The Carmicheal Show and Last Comic Standing.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Fraser (Creator, Writer, Actor)</strong> attended The Baltimore School for the Arts and graduated with a major in Theater. He moved to Los Angeles and worked with the sketch comedy stage show Cleos Apartment which spawned an 8 year stand up comedy run. That show was picked up by HBO/AOL and called The Message. Thomas has also trained with The Groundlings for Improv and UCLA for screenwriting. Mr. Fraser has had several short self produced films showcase on national television including the NBC Short Film Fest finalist film, Voicemail. Thomas' talents have been displayed on Insecure, Played By Fame, Women Behind Bars, The Road to Sundance and Buddy Solitaire just to name a few.</p>

We'll have post production, crew, sound, insurance, cameras, permits, editing, craft sevices and many more costs. This will help us create an original show with a specific look that pleases the pallet of Netflix and other network company execs.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're looking to affect lives in the way that The Cosby Show, A Different World and Family Matters affected ours. Those shows showed us what's possible if you put your heart and soul into your project and deal with real issues. </p>
<p>The tone of the show will be Insecure mixed with Atlanta. Real stories and real issues with natural humor constantly at play. Our creator has spent the past few years making short films, preparing for this moment.</p>

<p>Your contribution would mean that our idea is solid and you'd like to invest in good quality humor. Watching the video above and making a pledge will give us the numbers we need both financially and visually to present to networks and make a good case for why our show should be on the air.</p>
<p>People have a hunger for Tony Baker's brand of comedy. Currently, millions of people follow Tony everyday just to find out about his national comedy tours, movie reviews, podcasts and sketches. Even Tony's pet cat has followers now and he's 1.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>‘The Card Room Chronicles’ is a developing web series consisting of six different stories, each with four unique characters in one location, centered around a single game of poker. Inspired by classic British crime fiction and high stakes storytelling, the series is set to unite new blood filmmakers with expert talent.</p>
<p>Episode two ‘Car Pool Poker’ finds 4 old friends and colleagues on the way to work whilst lamenting life, the monotony of routine and retirement plans. Nostalgia for past big risk poker games leads them to having one last high-stakes bet with their earnings on the line.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need is for our backers to come to the table and buy-in to be a part of the pot. Those with bigger stacks could double-down and…okay, enough with the poker lingo!</p>
<p>We need the backers, you guys and gals, to donate some money to see this project continue and come to light. Making high-quality episodes is not a cheap process, especially for an independent project. That is why we have looked over out budget with a fine-tooth comb to ensure that every penny is being used efficiently.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491477543/wnhzieik5s3v8ppgyluk.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Most of the budget areas are easy enough to understand such as Cast/Crew costs and equipment hire but why the Police Hire? Well, the location we ideally plan to use is a public highway, which means a whole film crew will be around the area and on the road. Not only that but actors will also have access to prop firearms (that’s all we are saying without giving too much away!) in public, meaning the police will have to be involved regardless of the location used.</p>
<p>We have some exciting perks for you to choose from, where they are named and inspired from the game of poker. Why not go in for a ‘Raise’ to watch the finished episode in HD? Feel like you have ‘The Nuts’ to become an Executive Producer? Check out the perks on the right and see what tickles your fancy.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal of £5,800 but come close, we will endeavour to ensure that the shoot goes ahead in May 2017. If not enough funds are reached then the project will be delayed until further funds are sought – the sooner the better and any backers will have their chosen perks honoured at a later date.</p>
<p>The impact from this crowdfunding will help further contribute to the growing online TV community within the UK and help employ local content creator, ensuring they can work creatively whilst paying the bills.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Like any filming project, there will be inherent risks. These risks will be minimalized and planned for thoroughly by the senior level crewmembers, all of who are professional and experienced industry members.</p>
<p>The highest risk we face is not raising enough funds in time for a May 2017 shoot: crew and cast are already set for the proposed dates and if for any reason this was postponed there would be a period of waiting until all involved were available at the same time. The episode would still be filmed at the earliest convenience for those involved but certain perks would therefore be delayed.</p>
<p>Other risk factors include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with bad weather during the weekend of the shoot. Alternate locations are already being planned in case this occurs.</li>
<li>Cast and/or crew being unable to make a shoot date for unforeseen reasons. Alternate crewmembers would be sought in their stead and if actors weren’t available, then the project insurance would be used in case of an abandoned shoot.</li>
<li>Perks that include the completion of all six episodes (such as the DVD’s) are subject to when all episodes are fully complete. Although those involved will strive to make this happen as soon as possible there is no guarantee on when this would be complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the few risks we could find after reviewing every nook and cranny: they are few and far between. Not only that, the majority of them are risks any film and TV project would face. We aim to be as transparent as possible and our backers would be the first to know of any developments.</p>

<p>If you can't donate then you can still help by spreading the word about the campaign. Share and repost the campaign links across social media and hopefully a friend, family member or colleague of yours can help us out. The further the campaign spreads, the more likely we will be funded.</p>
<p>If you like different aspects from different perks then please feel free to contact us to create a bespoke pledge just for you.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
‘The Card Room Chronicles’ is a developing web series consisting of six different stories, each with four unique characters in one location, centered around a single game of poker. Inspired by classic British crime fiction and high stakes storytelling, the series is set to unite new blood filmmakers with expert talent.
Episode two ‘Car Pool Poker’ finds 4 old friends and colleagues on the way to work whilst lamenting life, the monotony of routine and retirement plans. Nostalgia for past big risk poker games leads them to having one last high-stakes bet with their earnings on the line.
‘Car Pool Poker’ is scheduled for filming by mid-May 2017 and will feature four fantastic veteran actors, including:
Paul Barber (Only Fools & Horses, The Full Monty, 51st State)

Joe McGann (The Upper Hand, Terry Pratchett’s Truckers, Day & Night, Elf: The Musical)

Alan Rothwell (Coronation Street, Brookside, Heartbeat)

Derek Lawson (A Royal Night Out, Day Zero, Shameless).

The series is the creation of Producer and Writer Denis Crampton. Denis has now gathered a team of up and coming filmmakers from around the U.K. to work together in making the series a reality. This has already begun with Episode 1 ‘The Last Hand’ being completely filmed and in the final stages of post-production.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Andrew and I am a Youtuber, content creator, and owner of upcoming production company, Court Jester Productions! This campaign is for Colors of the Rainbow, an animated series that I've had in the works since August of 2020. It's set in a world of personified colors and centers on eight best friends, who are the eight colors of the rainbow, living their lives in the city of Dathanna. By donating to this project, you will be helping me create my very first animated series, a medium that I've been passionate about for the longest time now, and with your help, I'll be making one of my own.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Realistically speaking, we'll be needing roughly about 20,000$ USD to make this happen.  Every penny of this will be going to our voice actors, animators, artists, writers, etc. Your contributions can get you rewards such as glimpses into our storyboards, character design sheets, animation tests, and more! Now, even if we don't reach our goal, I will still be using the earnings we've received towards the VAs and art/animation team.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're all aware of the nightmare last year was and even some of this year. We were ostracized from our friends, our family, jobs were lost, the world changed as we knew it and we had to adapt quickly. But something I've learned in my life is that laughter truly is the best medicine, be it the biggest laugh or the tiniest chuckle, your spirits raise after having a good laugh. And even though we're on the steps to putting this virus behind us, I wanna give people something they can watch and just forget about the troubles of their day for a little while by watching these wonderful characters.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The only risk we face is not hitting our goal by the deadline, and even then, I have backup plans set up. If we don't reach our goal, I have a Patreon, a Ko-Fi, and a RedBubble set up so we'll still be making money either way.</p>
</div><div>

Hi! My name is Andrew and I am a Youtuber, content creator, and owner of upcoming production company, Court Jester Productions! This campaign is for Colors of the Rainbow, an animated series that I've had in the works since August of 2020. It's set in a world of personified colors and centers on eight best friends, who are the eight colors of the rainbow, living their lives in the city of Dathanna. By donating to this project, you will be helping me create my very first animated series, a medium that I've been passionate about for the longest time now, and with your help, I'll be making one of my own.

What We Need & What You Get
Realistically speaking, we'll be needing roughly about 20,000$ USD to make this happen.  Every penny of this will be going to our voice actors, animators, artists, writers, etc. Your contributions can get you rewards such as glimpses into our storyboards, character design sheets, animation tests, and more! Now, even if we don't reach our goal, I will still be using the earnings we've received towards the VAs and art/animation team.

The Impact
We're all aware of the nightmare last year was and even some of this year. We were ostracized from our friends, our family, jobs were lost, the world changed as we knew it and we had to adapt quickly. But something I've learned in my life is that laughter truly is the best medicine, be it the biggest laugh or the tiniest chuckle, your spirits raise after having a good laugh. And even though we're on the steps to putting this virus behind us, I wanna give people something they can watch and just forget about the troubles of their day for a little while by watching these wonderful characters.

Risks & Challenges
The only risk we face is not hitting our goal by the deadline, and even then, I have backup plans set up. If we don't reach our goal, I have a Patreon, a Ko-Fi, and a RedBubble set up so we'll still be making money either way.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate at all, that's totally fine! You can still help out the project by sharing the link to the project around, be it on Twitter, Discord, Facebook, just try to get the word out there!
Thank you all so much for reading and hopefully, we'll see you on Youtube with our very first show. Have a wonderful day and stay creative!",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""Jason And Matthew"" is a 22-24 minute sitcom that follows two childhood best friends on their journey through adulthood when they decide to move to New York City together in hopes of pursuing their dreams of acting (Jason) and modeling (Matthew). To make matters hilarious, both of the boys' divorced mothers move in across the hall from them. If that wasn't enough, both Jason and Matthew has unexpressed feelings for each other as the series goes along. You'll get to see how this affects their friendship going forward and the relationships with the people around them as well. More importantly, there will be lots of laughter and comedic moments to enjoy.</p>
<p>The series is created by, directed by, written by, produced by, and starring Jason Whatley. He created the sitcom due to his love for this genre style of television shows. Some of the many sitcoms he enjoyed growing up were I Love Lucy, The Carol Burnett Show, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Good Times, A Different World, The Cosby Show, The Parkers, Baby Daddy, Moesha, Sister Sister, Martin, Everybody Hates Chris, George Lopez, Friends, Full House, Fuller House, and That's So Raven. Jason plans to incorporate some of his favorite elements of most of these shows as a way to honor them and the impact they've had on him as and actor and writer.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Jason has to raise for the production budget of a pilot episode provided by Pixel Productions. The amount goal to be met is $250,000. Anything raised passed that goal will go toward producing more episodes. Jason plans to have a full 13-episode season to start.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production cost from Pre-production to Post-production</li>
<li>Payment of entire cast and any additional hair/makeup they want </li>
<li>Fulfilling backers rewards</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>REWARDS</p>
<p>Jason has created some amazing rewards for the backers of this campaign. This includes fan packs with signed logo t-shirts, red carpet premiere experience, private screening experience, producer credits, and even the chance to appear in the season finale as an extra. Check out these rewards and what they offer, then start donating!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As stated, this campaign will open the door for the first season of ""Jason And Matthew"" to see the light of day. More campaigns will follow once this one proves successful. And with your contribute, which becomes your impact, we can achieve it together. This sitcom impacts the world by saving this dying style form of the sitcom genre and open doors for black gay leads on tv. We want to bring representation to the black gay community that shies away from the stereotype and tells us we can and are more than what society thinks or conditions us to think we are all about. Our promise to you all is to keep our word about these rewards and provide great content that we all can enjoy. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Lots of risks and challenges to definitely take into consideration when producing a series with this starter budget. </p>
<p>One of the challenges we'll most likely face with the backers will be verifying you payment with your bank so the donations will go through. This really applies for the higher level rewards. </p>
<p>Jason doesn't have a studio behind this project. The challenges here will range from production halts due to natural disasters to actors dropping out due to availability or other obligations.</p>
<p>A note about the rewards: Delivery dates are only estimates and could be subject to change at anytime. We plan to keep you all in formed going forward. Some rewards include digital delivery and physical delivery so please do not be alarmed if you receive one before the other and note that we're trying to get everything to everyone as soon as we can.</p>
<p>The VIP, Producer Credit, and Cameos will take place in San Diego, California on a date determined by production. We cannot provide transportation or accommodations. There will be additional paperwork required to fulfill some of these rewards for your protection and ours.</p>
<p>The BIGGEST CHALLENGE is getting this campaign in front of as many people as possible in the timeframe that Kickstarter allows us. Please, share with your friends, family, and colleges. We want to meet our goal.</p>

<p>From a very young age I have been passionate about acting, singing, music and writing.

<p>One night in October 1996, Isabel (25) understood that her husband Alberto (34) would be waiting for her at the bus stop as usual, with the intention of accompanying her on the dangerous journey from the bus stop to the house where she was they found.

<p>While Isabel waits, she is frightened by the darkness of the environment. The streets are desolate, so Isabel decides to start walking the same route as every night, to make her wait less and meet her husband Alberto (34), who was already in the habit of picking her up at the bus stop when he left. his night job, which the financial situation had forced him to accept. Her when she was faced with the dilemma of staying or starting to walk home to meet Alberto, and although they were walking the same path and at the same time, they could not see each other, and while he was waiting at the bus stop, she came home . This triggers a series of confusing events, resulting in the violent event that presents the climax of this short film.</p>
<p>""Fourth"" is based on a real life story, which shows how situations of verbal, physical and emotional violence end up undermining the self-esteem of people, and in this particular case, of women. Isabel expresses, from an omnipresent voice in the short film, in a quasi-poetic style, how this situation with her partner Alberto de ella has kept her in a state of extreme melancholy and emotional uncertainty for some time. Alberto, a man with a history of abandonment and alcoholism, presents traits of a passive-aggressive man.</p>
<p>""Fourth"" deals with an evil that affects so many countries in the world, especially in Latin America: violence against women, and most of the time in the place where she should feel safest and happiest: her own home.</p>

Children learn best by DOING, not just WATCHING. Play is such an important aspect of a child's development - the more a child is ENGAGED in an experience, the more they will absorb and recall the important aspects of it. That's why we have created Explore, Discover & Grow.

Explore, Discover and Grow is a curriculum-based educational program that utilizes the key philosophies of Early Childhood education (such as play, interactive and immersive experiences and the whole child) and applies them to an entertaining format whereby your child can benefit from this ten minute, twice-weekly video series.  The program comes with teaching notes that outline key outcomes for children, as well as  teaching notes and suggested activities that can extend learning into other areas.

Less than 1 in 8 TV programs today are considered to be educational - certainly not in the sense of appealing to and educating the WHOLE CHILD.  This concept is at the very CORE of children's education - but alas, in today's world, TV programs and video content that embrace this philosophy, are few and far between!
To do this, your child needs to be ACTIVELY engaged in what they are involved with, not just passively observing a story.  We use techniques that are HARDLY SEEN ON TV these days - we use questioning to promote thought, imagination and creativity, direct communication with the viewer to promote self-esteem, modelling of actions and pro-social interactions to get your child moving and understanding social skills, verbal praise and inclusive language to make your child feel that they are the star of the show!

Growth occurs through change. Change occurs as a result of discovering things - either about the world, or yourself.  Discovery happens when there is exploration.
When you look at what's available on TV and YouTube today for children to watch, take note of how much opportunity there is for the child to be prompted to:

<h3>What is <i>A Fairytale Undressed in Three Acts</i> ?</h3>
<p><i>A Fairytale Undressed in Three Acts</i> is a short anthology series that reveals the misconceptions that people create about college years. Have you heard about finding the job of your dreams right after college? Finding the love of your life, the best friends and the best experiences during those 4 years, AKA, ""best years of your life""? <i>A Fairytale Undressed in Three Acts</i> touches those topics in three short-films called <i>acts</i>; every act representing a different misconception.  The mission of this project is to display the life of a college student, showing the true conflicts and enjoyable experiences they come to face during the most important years of their lives. Each act being a different story with different characters.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have shot the first act called <i>Canvas</i>, which is showed in this page. The base budget of $2,250 will be for the production of the remaining two acts and to have a screening of the entire show at one of our local theatres in Carbondale, IL in this upcoming May.</p>
<p>These funds will be distributed to make the short-films as captivating as possible, assigned to pay our cast and crew, camera and lighting department, equipment rental, catering for cast and crew on shoot dates, wardrobe and props, post production, paying for film festival fees and submissions, as well for paying the screening venue. </p>
<p>Any amount under or over $2,250 will go towards the short-films in order to create an exciting  experience and be able to share these stories with you. And to thank you for your generosity, on the right of this page we have cool perks to give away!</p>

</div><div>
<p>The primary goal for <i>A Fairytale Undressed in Three Acts</i> is just like its name says it, to reveal and share the stories that individuals face as they enter adulthood. We want to create a relationship with the audience, as many individuals can relate with the themes presented in this series. We want to broadcast the college environment in a new and intimate way, letting people submerge into this world as it changes and transforms every single day, not only by showing the 'party' side of a person, but by also showing the side when they're alone and true personalities come to afloat.</p>
<p>We believe that this topic is important to this day. As the world changes and new labels like 'Millennials' begin to appear. It is important to understand the new generations, and with the power of the media we can begin to undress a fairytale that society and past generations have been told in a wrong way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for <i>A Fairytale Undressed in Three Acts</i> is timing. Three short-films in three months with the quality we aspire for is visionary and promising. In order to make the series as realistic as possible, we need to have different locations to shoot, as well as a big team to help in the production, all this makes time very valuable. Every act (episode) will have to be shot within a three-day period due to the tight schedule that we have. However, our funds would be a able to pay a bigger crew and make the production have a smoother flow in order to make a better series for you.</p>

<li><p>HI, my name is Daniel White, I am an upcoming film maker and this is my first short film. I'm also from Winter Haven, Florida. </p></li>
<li>
<p>This campaign is to help me get a fan film to the many fans of Spider-Man. This is project is very important to me because I've been a fan of Spider-Man since as long as I can remember and ever since Miles made his comic book debut in 2011 I've wanted to play him in the MCU and this is as close as I can come to that dream right now. I've trying to do this since the age of 15. </p>
<p>By contributing to this fan film you will be fulfilling a life time dream of mine, and through your support I can afford the equipment to make it a reality.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, keep it concise, yet personal. Ask yourself: if someone stopped reading here would they be ready to make a contribution?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>- For this project I need around $5,000-$10,000 this will be going towards filming equipment, props, locations, and accurate costume designs.</p>
<p>This will be a web series, sort of like a Marvel Netflix series and this story is based in the MCU.</p>
<p>Even if we don't reach our goal, we will still use it to the best of our abilities and get the short film out but, it will take longer to get out.</p>

<h3>Who are you funding?</h3>
<p>Reject-Men is a web series created by Boise filmmaker, Matt Mudd. He co-founded Clear as Mudd Films with his brother, Dylan Mudd in 2009. The company aims to extend opportunities to make films in their local community to anyone regardless of background. The Reject-Men almost mirror that goal in the series as a place where all mutants can have a home. That is why this project and its success is so important, because it will allow us to continue to do that in the future.</p>

<p>Well, it’s finally happened. After two years of planning, countless hours of meetings, research and brainstorm sessions, we at Ottawa Paranormal Research &amp; Investigations are excited to announce the launch of the first season of our show, <i>Into the Haunting</i>.</p>
<p>We have partnered with Ottawa based <i>Trinity Productions</i> to create the show for public release, and we can’t wait to get started. Season one will include 10 episodes focusing on haunted locations in Ottawa and the surrounding area. To bring this dream to life, the last hurdle we must overcome is funding. We need to raise $1500.00 to shoot the pilot episode, and we are asking for your help.</p>
<p>We aren’t asking you to blindly donate money to our project, there is something in it for you. Every person who donates even $5 to this pilot episode, will be entered in to a draw to join us during an investigation for an episode later in season one. For every $5 up $25, you will receive one entry into the draw. Anyone who donates $30 or more will receive six entries into the draw, and will also receive a ticket to <i>Paracon 2018</i>, which we will be announcing dates for in a few months. Spoiler alert… it’s going to be amazing this year. For ever $5 over 30 (up to $45) you will receive an additional entry into the draw.</p>
<p>Anyone who donates $50 or more will receive 15 entries into the draw, a ticket to <i>Paracon 2018</i>, and will receive a Thank You in the pilot episode credits. For ever $5 after $50, you will receive an additional two entries into the draw.</p>
<p>We appreciate all your support and are wildly excited to get <i>Into the Haunting</i> underway.</p>

<h3>Make Horror Host History with . . .</h3>
<h3><i>Mark of the Ghoul:  A Bowman Body Tale</i></h3>
<p>Hi there horror movie fans!  We want to produce something we believe to be unique in the history of television horror hosts . . . a Halloween Cartoon special featuring The Bowman Body.</p>
<p>Since 2009, Horse Archer Productions has been bringing Bowman Body fans what they want--more Bowman!  We've produced two documentaries (<i>Virginia Creepers</i> and <i>Hi There Horror Movie Fans</i>),  two Shock Theatre revival episodes (<i>House on Haunted Hill</i> and <i>City of the Dead</i>), and several live events with the Bowman body.  Now we want to do something completely new--a BOWMAN BODY CARTOON with Bill Bowman voicing his famous character!</p>
<p>The final product will air on WCVE during the 2017 Halloween season . . . but only if we make it happen with this campaign.  We are ready to roll--but only if we make our goal.</p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>For the Bowman Body's legion of kid fans he was as source of mystery.  Where was the castle?  Why the tennis shoes?  Did he really sleep in the casket?  But the biggest one of all . . . how did he get the bandage on his forehead?</p>
<p>It's the big question for our animated heroes, Karl, Peter and Lorrie who swap origin tales of the cryptic bandage with the little red X.  Was it Frankenstein?  Dracula?  The Mummy?  Maybe a shaggy shape-shifter?  Before the night is out, our trio will have their answer from the Body himself!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>The Goal:  $10,000</strong></p>
<p><strong>Where is it going:</strong>  The money will go directly to production and talent including to Bill Bowman, the Bowman Body himself.  Our costs include studio rentals, animation, perk production, mailing, advertising, travel costs and a lot more, but our group wants to see this get done so we are making sacrifices to do it efficiently and effectively!</p>
<p><strong>What you get:</strong>  We have lots of perks, including DVD copies of some of our existing products available right now, but the BIG thing is the EXCLUSIVE materials . . . posters, exclusive stills, specialty items and <strong>special DVDs only available through this campaign</strong>.  In fact, you can get your image in the final product and even IMDB movie credits!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As far as we can tell, there has NEVER been a horror host special like this one, so you are making history.   You are also helping preserve the legacy of the character for future generations, kids who will see this cartoon for the first time and dig up the dirt on the ol' Bowman Body.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>All or Nothing . . .</h3>
<p>Horse Archer has a track record of getting big projects done with minimal funding, so we know we can do it . . . but we have to hit our goal of $10,000.  We've already got the green light for this project from WCVE:  now we need to make it happen.</p>
<p>We have some ""stretch"" perks in mind if we go over, including a whole episode of Shock Theater hosted by the cartoon Bowman Body as well, so that is something to get excited about too!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div><p>In addition to financial support, we need folks to spread the word.  Please post this project to your social media outlets (Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, etc.) and let's make this happen!</p></div></div>","Make Horror Host History with . . .

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My name is Eileen. I created Misfits &amp; Margaritas as part of a project with some film friends to get us more familiar and comfortable with various aspects of the film industry. Before long the project grew to involve so many people and the story took off. Season 1 was a learning experience for us all. In Season 2 we look to create a bigger and better series for you all. </p>
<p>This story is a story for those who don't quite feel they belong. For those who still feel young, but know they are getting older everyday. For those who are dedicated to their career, but also want more for themselves outside of work.</p>
<p>The contributions we gathered last year allowed us to complete the first season of this web series. We were also accepted into our first web fest! With this year's contributions we are looking to improve on our equipment, expand our crew, and have more to work with in post production (editing, marketing, film festivals, etc).  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our ultimate fundraising goal is $13,000. This will cover 2 weeks of filming and various aspects of post-production including editing, marketing, and entering film festivals. This will give us $1,000 per episode (12 episodes total), which will be used on equipment costs (camera, sound, lighting), food costs for entire cast and crew, props, make-up, and editing costs. The additional $1,000 will be for the platform fees, and the remainder going towards taxes on the campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the funds raised in the first campaign, we were able to donate money to a spay/neuter clinic, promote local businesses and gather a group of filmmakers together to create a fun and educational experience. We hope to be able to support the local community even more with production of season 2. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of our biggest hurdles we'll face is raising the money needed. We are hopeful that we can raise enough to get us to production. Any amount raised will help get us closer to our goal! What ever amount remains after the campaign ends, we will host other fundraising events to get us to our goal. We are determined to create a season 2!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone can donate money. And that is completely fine! Other ways you can help is to share the word about Misfits &amp; Margaritas Season 1 on YouTube, as well as sharing this page to others that may be able to help us raise the funds for Season 2! Help us get the word out!</p>

With this year's contributions we are looking to improve on our equipment, expand our crew, and have more to work with in post production (editing, marketing, film festivals, etc).  

What We Need
Our ultimate fundraising goal is $13,000. This will cover 2 weeks of filming and various aspects of post-production including editing, marketing, and entering film festivals. This will give us $1,000 per episode (12 episodes total), which will be used on equipment costs (camera, sound, lighting), food costs for entire cast and crew, props, make-up, and editing costs. The additional $1,000 will be for the platform fees, and the remainder going towards taxes on the campaign.

The Impact
With the funds raised in the first campaign, we were able to donate money to a spay/neuter clinic, promote local businesses and gather a group of filmmakers together to create a fun and educational experience. We hope to be able to support the local community even more with production of season 2. 

Risks & Challenges
One of our biggest hurdles we'll face is raising the money needed. We are hopeful that we can raise enough to get us to production. Any amount raised will help get us closer to our goal! What ever amount remains after the campaign ends, we will host other fundraising events to get us to our goal. We are determined to create a season 2!

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not everyone can donate money. And that is completely fine! Other ways you can help is to share the word about Misfits & Margaritas Season 1 on YouTube, as well as sharing this page to others that may be able to help us raise the funds for Season 2! Help us get the word out!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3><strong>Skin Cleaners? What is it?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Skin Cleaners</strong> is a comedy mockumentary, that follows the day to day activities of a specialist cleaning company, in the aftermath of a devastating zombie outbreak. </p>
<p>The world is a mess, infrastructure and society are in ruins. Five billion people are dead. That’s a lot of bodies to clear up, somebody’s got to do it. Enter the <strong>Skin Cleaners.</strong></p>
<p>Run by former Halford's Manager BARN ELLINGS, this unique group of individuals are highly skilled in the removal of the deceased and the regeneration of populated areas. An eclectic ensemble of apocalypse survivors, each with their own special traits and hidden pasts. </p>
<p>During the pilot episode, a camera crew follows the Skin Cleaners as they clean a school building over a period of 3 days. Not only do they encounter some unwanted guests, but there is a mystery a foot, as an important “piece” of property goes missing and accusations are made.  </p>
<p>The pilot episode is now <strong>LIVE</strong> on <strong>Youtube</strong> and you can watch by clicking the link below!</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sud0-AGCg_4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sud0-AGCg_4</a></p>
<h3><strong>How did it come about?</strong></h3>
<p>The amazing episode (Link Above) was filmed in June 2019. From an idea by Creator, Writer and Director Chris Welch, the Pilot episode was self funded. Filmed over a period of 2 days on location at Carmel College, in Wallingford, Oxford. The college is a regular feature of HBO and NETFLIX productions. </p>
<p>The cast and crew were a combination of experienced professionals who have been in a number of productions, to first timers. The post production completed by experienced professionals, who have been involved in many features and short films. </p>
<p>The TV show has 5 more scripts and a film treatment. These scripts and the pilot episode you have just watched make up the Skin Cleaners project. This is more that just a pilot. There is longevity in the idea.</p>
<p>A number of experienced actors and writers have also called the scripts <strong>""Very Funny""</strong> and <strong>""Expertly Written with a never done before concept""</strong>.</p>
<p>This project has a fantastic future, but where? How can we get this project ""out there"". We need your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What are the goals?</strong></h3>
<p>Right now, you may be thinking, ""You've already shot the pilot, what do you want with us?"". Good question. </p>
<p>There is a strong belief that Skin Cleaners has a lot of potential to be developed into a fully commissioned TV Series. To give Skin Cleaners the best chance to be commissioned by an established TV production company, we need to do the following things. </p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure that other episodes of the TV show are suitable to the screen rather than just script </li>
<li>Promote the pilot episode by submitting to festivals, organising private and public screenings and utilise online methods for maximum exposure</li>
<li>Create and promote the project within the TV and Film industry</li>
</ul>
<p>These three goals will be the concrete that holds the project together and will ensure that all efforts are used to drive the project forward. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What do we want to do with the funds raised?</span></strong></h3>
<p>Firstly, we are eternally grateful for any funds that are donated by you. It is very much appreciated. </p>
<p>With any funds raised we would look to do the following, in priority order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ensure the pilot episode costs have been fully covered and that cast &amp; crew are reimbursed for any time and efforts sacrificed during the 2 days of filming in June 2019. </li>
<li>Raise funds to potentially start pre-production on a second episode and other visual material, that would look to film at some point in 2020. Depending on the level of interest from viewers for another episode. </li>
<li>Use any funds to assist with the submission of the Skin Cleaners Pilot Episode into any appropriate festivals and/or competitions that may help with the exposure of the project</li>
<li>Ensure that the project has necessary funding to be able to organise or attend any meetings, screenings and opportunities that may arise during the promotion of the TV Show, in an attempt to gain a commission from a production company. </li>
</ul>
<p>Getting a TV show commissioned is hard, especially starting from the ground up! The above goals will go a long way to help get the project into the hands of the right people!</p>
<p>This is a project created passionately by very creative people and we are all keen to create more Skin Cleaners material and get as many people as possible to see the pilot.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>What challenges do we have?</strong></h3>
<p>This is a marathon for the Skin Cleaners Project, as Writer &amp; Director, Chris Welch, said in the video above, ""We are starting from the ground up"". There is no production company backing this, the people involved are not ""famous"" or have the resources to instantly make an impact. </p>
<p>This project will take time, to grow and flourish, but once the right eyes are fixed and locked on. The project will quickly become very special. </p>
<p>Here are a number of challenges we may face</p>
<ul>
<li>The project doesn't have the backing of an establish production company</li>
<li>The social reach is limited currently</li>
<li>Most associated with the project are not dedicated to the growth of the project</li>
<li>This is a grass roots movement (With Zombies)</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are challenges, there is still positivity and encouragement. With the increasing number of On-Demand services, there will be a place for Skin Cleaners. This project will find that place. </p>
