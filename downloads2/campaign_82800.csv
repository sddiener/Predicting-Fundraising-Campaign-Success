What is Pay Per Click? Pay per click (PPC), also called cost per click, is an internet advertising model used to direct traffic to websites, in which advertisers pay the publisher (mysearchgirl.com) when the ad is clicked. It is defined simply as “the amount spent to get an advertisement clicked.” So every time a web surfer clicks on an ad listed on this website, Mysearchgirl.com will not only send the advertiser the targeted customer that he needs, but will also at the same time generate funds earmarked  for cancer victims to offset the cost of medical bills, prescriptions, and transportation for doctor appointments.


We want to form a non profit organization and use this website as a platform to generate funds for  Breast, Ovarian, And Pancreatic Cancer victims. We believe that with the requested funds, the right team, and two years work, we will gain a market share of 2%, this translates to fifty-eight million in a market that generates over twenty-nine billion a year. If we reach our contribution goal, mysearchgirl.com will leverage enough momentum in pay-per click sales to support our cause without having to seek further public or private contributions.  See the chart below of search engine dominance. 
  

What We Need And Why



We need your help! We need as much support as you can afford!  We are starting off with nothing except MySearchGirl, a plan to start a non profit organization, and a desire to make the world a better place by providing financial assistance and relevant information about breast,ovarian, and pancreatic  cancer to those who need it most. 

How Will My Contribution Be Used? 
1. for Administrative Start-Up Fees, which includes: 

Secure Office Space: Electricity, Heating, Office Supplies, Computers, A Computer  Server, and rent for the first year,  etc. We currently do not have an office,  but We are looking to secure a space that will serve as an official location to meet with cancer victims,  assess their financial needs, and assist them in their struggle. 


2. We will Hire Business Managers : MySearchGirl.com  will hire upper management employees who are capable of taking this search engine to the next level.  In addition, We will hire  a Sales & Marketing Manager,  as well as an accountant and a code junkie, a skilled developer who knows coding to maintain the security of the website..

3.we will start assisting area cancer victims who are in a financial emergency and need immediate assistance paying for prescriptions and/or medical bills transportation and rent. 
WHAT DO I GET FOR HELPING?
 Being a pay per click search engine puts us in a unique position to offer you some really cool incentives when it comes to advertising. See all of our exciting perks listed on the right side of this page!


THIS IS PERSONAL, I MEAN VERY PERSONAL.

And there was no one there to lighten the financial burden this disease caused.... No friends, not even the government.....no medicaid or medicare.
 I vowed that one day I would make a difference in someone's life. Knowing that no one should have to suffer and die the way mom did, I vowed that one day somehow I would discover a way to lighten the financial burden that some women experience when they get diagnosed with cancer...and finally, I have found a way....The way is through MySearchGirl.com. 
I know that We can do this,
 But to succeed, we need your help.


No one is an island, entire of itself; everyone is a piece of the continent, a part of the whole, therefore never send to know  for whom the bell tolls.

Hi, I'm Steve Knots.  Welcome to my fundraiser, and thank you to everyone who has helped so far!I'm raising money for a trip to Goulash Disko Festival in Croatia next month, the best music festival in the world. I'm booked to play my new music there and also help as a volunteer in the Goulash crew.Little do they know I bring with me the solution to run sound systems on solar powered free electricity, which I am already doing as my job in Pittsburgh.  We are putting all these things together to make a new way of life on our dear little planet -- temporary music festivals will soon become permanent living communities; we have all the parts and we have many people who are interested.  That's the big picture. But first, I need to get there.  My goal is to raise $3000 to pay for travel expenses and the costs of this campaign.We only have three weeks to do it so please jump in and help!   Every donation makes a big difference.Check out the music and art that you can enjoy when you donate, and keep reading to see what bigger things this project fits into.
THE BIG PICTUREThis is a multi-purpose trip with several layers.  One, play my new music with wonderful people from all over the world.  Two, talk with them about how to run the festival on solar power next year.  (!!!)  Three, to share this message with you -- we have everything we need to solve the problems on Earth, right now.We are not ""partying to escape from life"".   We are making the kind of life from which you do not need to escape.  Five years from now I would like to see music festivals like Goulash Disko running on their own free electricity from solar power, parked next to organic farms to grow food, and slowly turning from temporary events into permanent villages.  We can completely transform life on earth using music, art, culture and a few bits of technology -- not just in one place, but all over the world -- without giving up our laptops & internet.  It's a win-win situation!  That's my motivation for working on the individual level, the community level and the global level to put the pieces together towards one unbreakable Peace.And you can be a part of it by donating to my campaign.JUICY DETAILSGoulash Disko 2015 is taking place in Pula, Croatia, on the site of an old fort.  Musicians, bands, DJ's, jugglers, acrobats, and artists of all sorts come from all over the world to perform here and enjoy music, food and swimming together.  It's a totally incredible vibe created by crowdfunding!  See if you can find me in this video from last year (hint: 2min 30sec).Then donate to help me get there and bring my piece of the puzzle.  Thank you!WHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF IT?When you donate to my fundraiser, you get the same stuff you've already been getting in the email newsletters  -- Music, Art and Inspiration -- but this time they come to your physical mailbox, not only to your email inbox.  First, music.  The full album will be finished at the end of the summer after we do vocals and mastering.  When you make a donation, you get yourself a copy of the new album on USB flash drive with some extra surprises -- printed comic book with the lyrics and pictures! wow!Check out the preview:Second, ART!When you make your donation (what a good idea) you get some fun black & white prints to share a positive message in the world around you.  These are available as stickers, posters and Tshirts.  Click HERE to see them all in detail and pick the ones you like.Third perk, and this is the biggie Finally, my kitchen of secrets is open and you can get your hands on a few of my private recipes, and I mean cooking recipes, that I developed during the ""Sunday Soup"" series of parties.For serious donors only, not to be attempted by amateurs.  I'm talking about the infamous garlic-bomb salad dressing, the tongue-twisting toasted spices lentil curry, the banana pudding chocolate cake... If you're gonna be a long-distance goulash emissary, you'll need to know how to keep people happy after a hard day's work transforming negativity into warm subwoofers.  Yes, life requires a sense of humor and we're all gonna get there in the end. See PERKS to click and smile.  Smell this flower to practice using your imagination for wonderful things.
  

WHERE THE MONEY GOES
It's pretty simple, I'm fundraising to pay for travel expenses, for the cost of the campaign itself, and to make the Art to share with you.My fundraising goal is $3000.  This pays for plane tickets, travel costs such as local bus tickets and food in Croatia, and the production costs for the campaign itself.  ""Production costs"" means that the indiegogo crowdfund website takes a small percentage of the money we raise, and I have to pay for shipping to send out all the envelopes, plus printing costs, etc.  Stuff like that.  Oh and also album mastering, which I do with friends in their studios so it is not terribly expensive.  (Comes in handy to be an audio engineer sometimes :) )By the way, this is a ""flexible funding"" campaign, which means that whatever you donate will definitely help me get there.  The campaign does not abort if we come up short of the goal (which we won't, because you're about to Donate... right?  Right.)As for payment types, we can accept Paypal and credit cards through the indiegogo secure payment system, so there's no reason to hesitate!  Donate now and grab your perks hot off the presses.


WHY AM I DOING THIS AT ALL?One of the things that makes me feel overflowingly happy is to see messages from the people on my mailing list, telling me they love the music, or that they like hearing about other people's art.One friend even asked if he could print my emails and give them out in his tea shop!  This is such a nice compliment I can only try my best to return it by doing things to help more and more people as we grow.Every little bit helps and I want you to know that you're all making a huge difference.Thank you again to all of you who are reading this, you are part of something bigger than you may realize.  

INTERVIEW WITH THE VOICE OF EXPERIENCEThese are some nuts-and-bolts things I suppose we should talk about.


Steve, how are you actually gonna make these prints and Tshirts?  ANSWER: I'm doing the printing at Tech Shop here in Pittsburgh, where you pay a monthly membership (like a gym) but instead of exercise machines, you use tools in the machine shop, wood-working shop, and print shop.  Cut digital vector-graphics onto vinyl with computerized machines!  Easy, fun and I get to learn something new.




Yeah but what do you actually know about solar power?ANSWER:  I'm working here in Pittsburgh with a company called Zero Fossil, an electric energy supplier, using solar-powered sound systems for outdoor events.  It can be done, we're already doing it, and I plan to put these pieces together ASAP.  Thanks for asking.

Steve man, how are you going to make a whole album in one month?   ANSWER: It's already done! I've got the instrumental beats all in place ready for the live set.  Just need to record the vocals, mix them and master the album, which is not hard to do.

ok Mr. Knots, how do we know you are organized enough to pull this off?  Well, I spent the last five years working as soundman, booking agent and program manager in a music club (Mosaic House).  During this time I also co-founded the BLEM festival, which was a series of events combining DJ's, live electronic music, raw concrete abandoned urban spaces, and video projection art.  While doing these things I held several DJ residencies and started two bands -- Stallion Grip and Uptik Harmonik Orkestra -- to play both acoustic and electronic music for people who love to get sweaty and dance.  So I'm comfortable managing this kind of thing.

My name is Pedro Crump, I am an independent musician, pianist and composer born in Bogota, Colombia. I have a diverse musical background because I lived many years in Boston (USA) first studying Fine Arts at Curry College and then attending music schools like Berklee and New England Conservatory. I also lived in Paris where I collaborated with Radio Latina, a radio station that plays Salsa, Brazilian music and other urban latin music. Thees experiences helped me learn and view the music world in an ample way. Also, being far away from Colombia, made me realize the great richness of its music. </p>
<p>I have many musical influences like contemporary Jazz, progressive Rock from the 70s, Ambient, Minimalism, Classical, Cinematic music and of course Colombian music.  I am also very interested in the transformative effect music has upon us. All this, and my love for Nature made me start the series THE ELEMENTS: a collection of CDs celebrating the four Elements: Water, Fire, Earth and Air. I am also the director of my group, a sextet called EL CIRCULO DORADO (THE GOLDEN CIRCLE). We have been working together for five years in which we have become very close musically and personally and this has prepared us for this recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Idea behind this campaign is that by inviting you to be a part of this project and pre selling our products, we will complete the funds to finance and finish the production of the album TIERRA (EARTH) the third in the serien THE ELEMENTS.</p>
<p>(The first album: EL SILENCIO DEL AGUA (THE SILENCE OF WATER) was published in 2006.  DORADO (GOLD - “The Color of Fire”), the second one was launched in 2010). </p>

<p>
</p><p><b>Why is the third one important?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>This third CD is an importan one of the Series because it celebrates EARTH, the ELEMENT and also THE PLANET. With this music we will promote consciousness towards the need for sustainable practices; we are part of Nature and what we do to It, we also do to ourselves. Also awareness of the fact that we must take good care of our Planet and start cleaning up as soon as posible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We believe that an excellent way to bring about awareness is though music because it reaches our emotions, and it helps us understand things from a more intimate perspective.</p>

</div></div>","Pistol Fist's Wrist Soup Emily, Pete and Ben are friends who play music together. One beautiful day near the end of last year, Mike Wheeler of Don Zeno Productions converted our drummer's home into a recording studio. We recorded the basic tracks of our fourteen songs. 
The album is in the mastering phase. We want to release it on vinyl. It rocks & rolls.


   Help. We are looking for 4500 dollars.
Firstly, 1000-1250$ will be covering our accrued recording and mastering expenses to Central Vermont's own Don Zeno Productions.
Secondly, 3250-3500$ will then be going to the production of the album into as many formats as affordable, listed here in the order of priority: digital download, vinyl, compact disc, then, fingers crossed, cassette tape.
We have many one-of-a-kind offerings as perks, from instant parties to forever treasurable knick knacks. Look to the right.

The production and physical distribution of the record of our musical efforts will be the propeller into our second chapter.

Logan's fan base is growing internationally at a steady pace of approximately 500-800 fans per week. Logan's sound has been said by many to not only be unique but innovating. Logan has the ability to sing, write and produce many genres which has made her stand out from the crowd. Logan is booking shows this year at a rapid pace and has added dancers to her performance regimen to add even more value to her show. We have been selected to go perform in front of labels.

To acquire a fan base with a vast following of ages alone is a major feat for any artist as you know. Logan is known for making music she loves and being relatable to a great majority of people from all walks of life. She and her team focus on quality, not quantity from which you will find by listening to her music. Logan's goal is to be a lifelong performing artist that is suitable and relatable to all age groups for life, not just hit what is appealing to some now. This feat, thus far, is being accomplished at remarkable speeds with great welcoming from the people on an international level. Logan's music is now being played on almost 250 radio stations internationally and she has been interviewed and featured by some of the industry leaders such as iHeart Radio, NowHipHop.com, EDMLive.com and many others. She is promoted by several; such as, HJENT, Exodus Indie Label, The Akademia, Shelton Management, Genesoul Productions and more. I encourage you to Google Logan Arceneaux and see the results of just a few of this up and coming International artist's accomplishments.</span><br/></p>

Logan Arceneaux has 4 singles out at this time with more scheduled to come out throughout this year. Logan's fan base is growing internationally at a steady pace of approximately 500-800 fans per week. Logan's sound has been said by many to not only be unique but innovating. Logan has the ability to sing, write and produce many genres which has made her stand out from the crowd. Logan is booking shows this year at a rapid pace and has added dancers to her performance regimen to add even more value to her show. We have been selected to go perform in front of labels. Please help us get there!! :) <3

With Logan's ability to perform many different genres, she has attained a fan base that continues to grow at every age range from 14-50+. To acquire a fan base with a vast following of ages alone is a major feat for any artist as you know. Logan is known for making music she loves and being relatable to a great majority of people from all walks of life. She and her team focus on quality, not quantity from which you will find by listening to her music. Logan's goal is to be a lifelong performing artist that is suitable and relatable to all age groups for life, not just hit what is appealing to some now. This feat, thus far, is being accomplished at remarkable speeds with great welcoming from the people on an international level. Logan's music is now being played on almost 250 radio stations internationally and she has been interviewed and featured by some of the industry leaders such as iHeart Radio, NowHipHop.com, EDMLive.com and many others. She is promoted by several; such as, HJENT, Exodus Indie Label, The Akademia, Shelton Management, Genesoul Productions and more. I encourage you to Google Logan Arceneaux and see the results of just a few of this up and coming International artist's accomplishments.

<p>I’ve been singing all my life and over the 22 year history
of The O-Tones, a New England Swing and Motown band, I’ve had the pleasure and
good fortune of singing with many talented vocalists. Now is the time to get
into the studio to have some fun with this! I will be collaborating with a
dozen singers plus a rockin' rhythm section on hidden gems by Etta James, Ray
Charles, Anita O'Day, Keb' Mo', Shelby Lynne, James Hunter, kd lang, Mayer
Hawthorne, Dinah Washington, Allen Toussaint, and Mutlu, Here's where we are
now: <a href=""http://www.theotones.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.theotones.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theotones.com</a>. And we are traveling to new heights with this endeavor!</p>
<p><b>The
fabulous singers include: </b></p>
<p>Samirah
Evans (think sultry New Orleans)</p>
<p>Tony
Lechner (jazz vocalist, director of Rock Voices)</p>
<p>Jim
Henry (sings like butter, tours with Mary Chapin Carpenter, among others)</p>
<p>Ellen
Cogen (jazzy director of Valley Jazz Voices)</p>
<p>Anand
Nayak (soulful singer of rani arbo and daisy mayhem)</p>
<p>Ann
Percival (swingin' bandmate in The O-Tones)</p>
<p>Tracy Grammer (renowned musician, singer and fiddler) </p>
<p>Annie
Patterson (creative songbird, creator of Rise Up Singing) </p>
<p>Tom
Mahnken (from the band Trailer Park) </p>
<p>Liza
Constable (bluesy diva)</p>
<p>Max
Cohen (rich and versatile vocalist)</p>
<p>John
Caban (world-touring musician)</p>
<p><b>And
the rhythm section is killer! </b></p>
<p>Jim
Henry on guitar (one of our favorite sidemen, Jim works with a number of
touring musicians including Paula Cole, Tracy Grammer, among others)</p>
<p>Chris
Haynes on piano, organ, and accordion, as well as producer and arranger<span>  for the project (world class musician,
composer, arranger, and producer)</span></p>
<p>Jeff
Dostal on bass (upright and electric, superb musicianship, has toured with
Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, teaches and performs liberally)</p><p>I will also
add my bass stylings on a few tunes, but will be kept busy singing with so
many vocalists!</p>
<p>Pieter
Struyk on drums (The O-Tones own drummer, incredibly versatile and talented, as
well as really fun!)</p>
<p><b>Soloists
will include</b> guitarists Jim Henry, Anand Nayak, John Caban, and John Mason as
well as sax players Charles Neville (of The Neville Brothers!) and Kerry Blount. Some songs will also have
horn sections covered by the above plus sax Rick Page, trumpet Don Anderson,
and trombone Joe Sabol. These soulful guys all have so much to contribute to
the sound!</p>

project is an ambitious one and we need help covering all the costs. That's
where you come in! If you can pre-buy the recording as well as consider some of
the other perks, and even kick in some extra to make it all happen smoothly, we
would so appreciate it! And please help spread the word too. It makes such a
difference to feel the support from our community. The O-Tones have gathered so
many friends over the years. We are so grateful for all the people who listen
and dance to and buy our music!</p>
<p>$15,000
might sound like a lot but that's what it costs these days for a project like
this! We need to cover recording costs, artwork, photography, packaging,
distribution, you name it. But we hope you like the perks selection we offer in
exchange for your generosity and support!</p>
<p>We
are excited about bringing this project to fruition because it feels like the
culmination of many years of collaboration with other musicians, a real
community effort. One of the joys of music is playing it with other people, a
stimulating conversation! It's fun to imagine the coming together of all these
great artists. Going into the studio is always so rewarding, to be able to
record moments that just fly by in a live performance. The O-Tones have
recorded several CDs over the years (<a href=""http://theotones.com/?p=songs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://theotones.com/?p=songs</a>) and each

OUR GOAL: to give kids the chance to  learn, play, and love music and musical instruments for as long as they want.What We Need & What You GetHere's why we are raising our goal of $5,000 through Indiegogo:    Ever see a group of kids just enjoying the day, making sounds and 
harmonies you had no idea they could create? Does this melt your heart 
as much as it does mine? My name is Dee Fretwell and I'm the founder of 
the Modern Roots Foundation. Here's what we do at the MRF: We raise money, we spend money. Monthly fee payments go DIRECTLY to instructors providing music lessons and instruction to kids who couldn't afford it otherwise! It's that simple!
A family who needs support applies to the Modern Roots Foundation.
Application is approved.
A kiddo and an instructor are matched together for upcoming lessons!
The instructor is vetted and listed within the MRF system.
The kiddo begins music lessons the very next available month!
THE FUN BEGINS!

<p><br/></p>Hello!! My name is Ana Barreiro, I'm a musician originally from Brazil now living in Los Angeles-CA where I am finishing my masters in Jazz Studies at the University of Southern California. I play the drums and have for over 14 years! Besides USC, I've also studied at the Conservatorio Souza Lima in São Paulo and went to Berklee College of Music for my undergrad. I've been studying music for a while and I love playing jazz and Brazilian music. I'm also passionate about people and one of my favorite characteristics of music is the strong connection that it can create with people. I love that music forces us to a deeper level of interaction and can translate a message from one individual to another.<br/>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Listen To The Story came to be after going to an
event at USC organized by the “Jewish World Watch” where they had Dr Denis
Mukwege speak about his work in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Dr Mukwege is the founder and medical director of Panzi Hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), known for its support for survivors of sexual violence. After
hearing his stories, he told us to keep telling these stories so other people
would become aware of their situation. I realized that this is what musicians
usually try to do; we try to tell stories. I've always heard from teachers how you should be telling a story when composing a piece of music, or when playing a drum solo. I decided then to combine our
artistic role of storytellers with this calling from Dr Mukwege to share these
much important stories.</p>
<br/>Listen To The Story is working towards creating music that tells the
stories of Congolese people and how the conflict over minerals have affected
their lives. Our purpose is to connect people through music, by sharing their stories to raise awareness and create a community that acknowledges things need to change.
<br/>Our goal is to tell four stories and have those recorded and made
available in any and every outlet possible. We will also record videos and
print booklets with artwork and information such as the lyrics, how to listen to these
stories and what to do to help. We aspire to create transformative and
informative music opening a door for people to think and act with what they
have and where they are.
<br/><br/>I believe that this project will open a door to reach people that otherwise wouldn't hear about these women, and also stimulate the artistic community to get more involved in diplomacy and world issues.  <br/><br/>

<p>From that amount $5500 will be donated to the Panzi Foundation and $5500 will be used for the production and post-production of the music including:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>$2500 for booklets (we will

We began our journey early 2011 and have come a long way. The two founders, Tom and Gary first came up with the idea of a mobile application that can stream video in real time rather than record it on the device. This idea went through several iterations and we finally settled on the Hootshare model. So what is it?</p>
<p>First, Hootshare is a mobile application that is tightly integrated with the website Hootshare.com. The idea is to stream live video to the website so friends and family can see what you are doing in real time. Then we archive the video for later playback for those that can not watch right now. </p>
<p>Second, we wanted it to be social. Social Media is a great force in today's society. People want to share what they are doing. Hootshare lets you do that without delay, in real time. You can post links to your Facebook and Twitter accounts right from the app, without interrupting the stream. Once the stream ends, those links remain active and will point to the archived version of the stream. </p>
<p>Additionally, we wanted to make it secure. Some people will share with everyone, and we love that! It drives interest in your activities and builds the Hootshare brand. But, we know there are times when you need a little privacy too. So we have built a follow system that lets you decide who can see your streams! </p>
<p>Hootshare is built to be fun and easy to use, as intuitive as possible and did we mention fun?</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Future of Hootshare</h3> <p>So far we have the website and the initial (iOS) mobile application completed. We are almost ready to start beta testing, and begin working on the Android version. We also need to grow our infrastructure by adding more servers to handle the load when we go live. We dont want any server crashes!  We are continuing our R&amp;D to enhance both the web site and applications with new and better functionally. That's why <b>we need your help! </b>With your generous support, Hootshare will be the phenomenal success we know it can be. And of course, we want to give you credit for all your support!

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>This Bard is Looking For a Little Love</h3>
<div>Hello!  I am Mama Gina, Fearless Bard and Folk Artist.  I travel with an acoustic 12 string guitar, djembe and frame drum, sharing my Muse and all original music at festivals, book stores and shops, and living rooms all over the US.  Last year, a friend commented, ""Oh, you don't really write love songs, do you?""  I took that as a challenge, and looked and listened for love stories that needed to be told.  My new CD project ""I Remember Love"" has 10 stripped down, raw, acoustic songs about love - and it's all love.  A song for handfasting, the story of my love affair with Kali, a tale of soul mates, a chant reminding us that we are worthy of love, and more.  Your donation will help me finish the mixing, mastering and production of the CD, so that this music can be shared.  </div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Keeping It Simple:  ""I Remember Love"" Happens With Your Donations and You Get Some Love Back</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 26px;"">Recording studio, mixing and mastering, and the actual CD production take time and money, and while I have invested my heart and soul, and personal time and finances crafting this music, I need just a bit more love to finish the project.  $2,000 will cover the remainder of the cost of mixing, mastering and the digital production of the actual CDs.  </span></h3>
<div>I know that you deserve great perks.  I am a traveling musician, and I want to be sure that I can deliver your rewards in a timely fashion.  So, I'm keeping it simple and straightforward, much like the CD. </div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Please know that I will not take your generosity for granted.  Should I not meet my $2,000 goal, I will do everything possible to finish the CD and provide your rewards timely.  I will keep you posted along the way.  And any money received over my $2,000 goal will go into my gas tank and travel expenses as I continue to tour.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Songs</h3> <p>You probably want to know a bit more about what your donation will support.  I'll be sharing more details about each song, including the stories behind the stories, over the next few weeks.  In the meantime, here is a bit about each song:</p>
<p>I wrote ""Binding Wood"" as a Handfasting song for a lovely couple handfasted this past Spring.  ""I Remember Love"", the title song on the CD, is about my son and me, and our soul contract.  ""Collapse"" is a sweet ballad about love that is bigger than time and space, and I still get rather choked up when I sing it.  ""The Empress Down Rattlesnake Road"" is the willful, bluesy tale of my becoming an orphan and my love affair with Kali and she guides me through the process.  ""The Eagle and The Owl"" is a percussion and voice piece that you will want to play and sing along with.  ""Between"" - ah, this is about loving yourself.  The chant ""Worthy"" is such an earworm that my studio engineer said, ""I went home singing it.  It stayed in my head.""  There is an incredibly amazing ficus tree in Bonita Springs in south Florida that my friends call Grandmother.  I tell the story that she told me in ""Grandmother Tree"".  ""BeBop Betty"" is a jazzy/bluesy little number about a sprite that ""do what she love, and love what she do.""  Finally, ""Mamaji's Travelin' Hugs Workshop Show"" is inspired by a few hug workshops I have attended at festivals, and I know you'll love this stripped down, funky groove.</p>

</div></div>","This Bard is Looking For a Little Love
Hello!  I am Mama Gina, Fearless Bard and Folk Artist.  I travel with an acoustic 12 string guitar, djembe and frame drum, sharing my Muse and all original music at festivals, book stores and shops, and living rooms all over the US.  Last year, a friend commented, ""Oh, you don't really write love songs, do you?""  I took that as a challenge, and looked and listened for love stories that needed to be told.  My new CD project ""I Remember Love"" has 10 stripped down, raw, acoustic songs about love - and it's all love.  A song for handfasting, the story of my love affair with Kali, a tale of soul mates, a chant reminding us that we are worthy of love, and more.  Your donation will help me finish the mixing, mastering and production of the CD, so that this music can be shared.  
   Keeping It Simple:  ""I Remember Love"" Happens With Your Donations and You Get Some Love Back
Recording studio, mixing and mastering, and the actual CD production take time and money, and while I have invested my heart and soul, and personal time and finances crafting this music, I need just a bit more love to finish the project.  $2,000 will cover the remainder of the cost of mixing, mastering and the digital production of the actual CDs.  
I know that you deserve great perks.  I am a traveling musician, and I want to be sure that I can deliver your rewards in a timely fashion.  So, I'm keeping it simple and straightforward, much like the CD. 

Please know that I will not take your generosity for granted.  Should I not meet my $2,000 goal, I will do everything possible to finish the CD and provide your rewards timely.  I will keep you posted along the way.  And any money received over my $2,000 goal will go into my gas tank and travel expenses as I continue to tour.

   The Songs You probably want to know a bit more about what your donation will support.  I'll be sharing more details about each song, including the stories behind the stories, over the next few weeks.  In the meantime, here is a bit about each song:
I wrote ""Binding Wood"" as a Handfasting song for a lovely couple handfasted this past Spring.  ""I Remember Love"", the title song on the CD, is about my son and me, and our soul contract.  ""Collapse"" is a sweet ballad about love that is bigger than time and space, and I still get rather choked up when I sing it.  ""The Empress Down Rattlesnake Road"" is the willful, bluesy tale of my becoming an orphan and my love affair with Kali and she guides me through the process.  ""The Eagle and The Owl"" is a percussion and voice piece that you will want to play and sing along with.  ""Between"" - ah, this is about loving yourself.  The chant ""Worthy"" is such an earworm that my studio engineer said, ""I went home singing it.  It stayed in my head.""  There is an incredibly amazing ficus tree in Bonita Springs in south Florida that my friends call Grandmother.  I tell the story that she told me in ""Grandmother Tree"".  ""BeBop Betty"" is a jazzy/bluesy little number about a sprite that ""do what she love, and love what she do.""  Finally, ""Mamaji's Travelin' Hugs Workshop Show"" is inspired by a few hug workshops I have attended at festivals, and I know you'll love this stripped down, funky groove.
   This Bardic Life  If you had asked me three years ago what this Bardic life would be, I would have told you that I would be traveling and singing my songs, telling my stories.  While that is part of it, I have learned so much in the last few years.  When I began traveling, I was reluctant to ask for help, to ask for donations, to ask for tips, to ask for money to play actual gigs.  I was afraid to ask to stay in people's homes, to ask if I could sleep on their couches and share meals.  This fearless Bard is not really fearless, but less afraid than I was about so many things.  I know now that this is a most vulnerable path - that asking for money to travel and play a gig is a fair exchange of energy, and that most folks really appreciate and value the intimacy of my music and performance.  I have learned that I am not here to simply share MY stories ...

I do what I love, and I love what I do.  Do what YOU love, and love what YOU do.  That is the message that I hope to convey with this new CD.  I don't do any of this alone.  Let's make this happen together.
   Don't Have $1?  You Can Still Help! Every single share, every time you reach out to a friend and let them know about my music and this campaign to get ""I Remember Love"" out to the world, it's all vital to me.  Please share this with everyone you know, and keep checking in.  I'll be posting stories about each of the songs - the stories behind the stories, lyrics, and perhaps some video from the studio sessions, over the next month.

<br/>
</div><p>Hey everyone, this is Johnathon (Golden Bowl). I am a 25 year old kid living in an apartment near downtown Winston-Salem, North Carolina.</p><p>I want to share my music with the world.</p><p>For the past two months, I’ve been working night and day creating music (I have written and produced 24 original electronic songs (various genres, including trap, dubstep, downtempo, and just general weird-step), all available to stream for free on my Soundcloud page), as well as 10 full length indie-hop-hop tracks I wrote and produced in collaboration with some other artists (7 of which comprise a brief album called x.x roads, detailing a poetic narrative of my mind in a dark place). I like to look at the 10 hip-hop tracks as an interesting way you can get to know me on a personal level. Electronic music has developed into such a discordant, cold, industrial place, which is cool, because that's the aesthetic of the times, but I like to put a twist on that by introducing myself as a person into my music. My goal is never to create something that doesn't contain my distinctive footprint: me. And I want to share that with you. The quirks and everything.</p><p>Since I’m interested in so many different kinds of art, I’m trying to build an internet-based network of electronic artists called Snailsnap. The goal is to bring together everyone out there like me, who’s working a 9-5 job and making music on the side trying to figure out how long we can take being in our current situation.</p><p>This would be an amazing way for me to dedicate more resources to developing and implementing the big ideas I have to build a collective from the ground up. </p><p>If you can’t spare anything but you still want to show love, it would mean the world to me if you’d share my music with your friends. Thank you so much. Reach out to me on twitter or email if you ever want to talk about art, philosophy, history, culture, science, or the way your butter melted just right into the texture of your toast. Art is meant to be a social activity. It's about sharing minds, feelings, lives, and love.</p><p>Since I have so many social media accounts, I would like to let everyone know that I'm most active on twitter and soundcloud. If you'd like to talk to me, send me a direct message on either twitter or soundcloud (or both) and I promise I'll respond. I'll be on most of the time over the weekend.</p><p></p><p>Again, thank you so much.</p><p>Johnathon (Golden Bowl)</p><p></p><h3>My personal commitment, my vision, and what I'll give you in return:</h3><ul>
<li>Let's connect and get to know each other. For everyone who makes a donation, I will (if you want!) add you to my personal Facebook page so we can keep in touch. I commit to you that I will use any money I receive from you to create, and expand the horizons of what I'm able to do creatively. I have a lot of big ideas for the integration of visuals and lightshows (as well as emerging 3d and hologram technology), which I would love to be able to explore and maybe someday create with to share with everyone. </li>
<li>But all that costs money, and it's not the type of thing that one person’s resources can generally accommodate. So here’s my idea. Let’s build it together.</li>
<li>I want to begin something that I think can revolutionize what it means to be an independent artist in the age of the web. I want to build a giant network of artistic collaborators - a grass roots label and brand: Snailsnap. But not just another label and brand. A democratic label.</li>
<li>I want to transform Snailsnap into an internet-based art label of the people. What that means is a label run by its members, all online, all seamlessly integrated with other large social media (and retailer) platforms. That means you pick which songs appear on the front page every day. You pick which songs make it onto regular Snailsnap mixtape releases. </li>
<li>The structure of the site would be that it would have a central hub - a circuit of pages that represented the group as a whole. This would be the community forum, a place to meet, share sounds, ideas, visuals, words, to inspire, or to promote. Branching off the central hub would be each person's artist page. It would be a blank Wordpress (other than being configured to be connected with the central hub). This would allow artists to have complete and modular control over their presence and identity, which is something that is extremely important. At the same time, however, artists would be seamlessly connected with the community in a way that would allow them to manage their entire social media presence pertaining to music/art all in one place. I feel that artists shouldn't have to have to conform to some of the rigid features of  some of the popular music social media sites, but should still be able to reap the rewards of being part of a tight-knit community..</li>
<li> I’ll leave this idea here for now. But this is the direction I’m headed with my ideas.</li>
<li>The primary core value of Snailsnap is this: <ul><li> “Wanna see some quick change in your life? Seek out others who are helping others, and help them.""</li></ul>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>If you make any donation whatsoever ($1 minimum), you will receive a free copy of my forthcoming electronic album, ""Peer Amid Mind//Tear the World Down"", which is going to be released by the end of Sept 2015 (it's mostly done, just putting final touches on mastering and such). You will receive an email with a direct download link for the album and a sizable collection of my visual digital remixes that are intended to complement my music.</li>
<li>I know this is a lot to read, but if you have made it this far, I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Let's talk.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Support me:</h3><p>As I mentioned above, I don't expect everyone to give, and I don't want money to ever stop someone from hearing my music and sharing the creative passion and determination of spirit I have found within myself in the last few months and have really started to see in everyone around me. So, I want to provide a really easy way you can do me a huge favor that would mean the world to me without having to spend anything. ^_^</p><ul>

<h3>My name is Johnny Davis and I am the producer and director of The 6, 7eventy, 8 Tribute Orchestra. I have been involved with music since I was seven years old and grew in up in a musical family. We all sang as children and were taught instruments in school and I learned the saxophone. I also loved listening to the total sounds of an orchestra or band and how they interacted and hence became a writer and arranger in my late teens. I have played professionally most of my adult life with my own bands and sometimes with other groups. Over the last 20 to 30 years, I have noticed much of the popular music that our youth are exposed to and directly targeted at, has become less and less musical and more negative. Much of pop music now is performed with recorded tracks with the performers speaking and not singing. </h3>
<h3>One of the goals of the orchestra production is to promote great pop songs with real singers and musicians playing the music. We are committed to only performing uplifting music and songs with positive and fun messages and at least half of the orchestra will be made up of younger musicians. Another goal is to expose our youth to the great sound of a string section in a pop setting, which you only normally get to hear in a symphony performance. There were many great arrangements using strings and horns beginning in the swing era and continuing on in the 60's and 70's. Then they slowly begin to decline with the use of synthesizers. Also, we are reintroducing the unique sound of vocal harmonies with our 6 vocalists, which has also been lost to a great degree.</h3>
<h3>I have worked on this project and goal for over 6 years and am now in the pre-production phase, which is to learn and put the show together with all of the singers and musicians. (31 people) This  is quite an undertaking and will take several months of rehearsals. Costs that are involved include rehearsal sound equipment rental, rehearsal room rental, music stands/lights, insurance, and special equipment for some of the orchestra positions. This includes a Yamaha CP300 for the piano position, a Nord Sateg 2 EX HP76 for the Synth 1 position, a Kurzweil PC3A7 for the Synth 2 position, and some additional percussion equipment. We use these special instruments to incorporate many of the new and contemporary sounds on top of the great traditional sounds of horns and strings to make the presentation more attractive to the younger generation. These costs have been researched and a cost and date will be listed on this site when they are purchased. This phase will cost approximately $30,000 to complete. Phase 2 will start at a later date and involve purchasing performance outfits and additional production assets. </h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>While all of the musical and artistic work is completed along with the pre-production work, this project cannot be completed without funding and your support is greatly needed and appreciated. Thank you for your support.</h3>

I have been involved with music since I was seven years old and grew in up in a musical family. We all sang as children and were taught instruments in school and I learned the saxophone. I also loved listening to the total sounds of an orchestra or band and how they interacted and hence became a writer and arranger in my late teens. I have played professionally most of my adult life with my own bands and sometimes with other groups. Over the last 20 to 30 years, I have noticed much of the popular music that our youth are exposed to and directly targeted at, has become less and less musical and more negative. Much of pop music now is performed with recorded tracks with the performers speaking and not singing. 
One of the goals of the orchestra production is to promote great pop songs with real singers and musicians playing the music. We are committed to only performing uplifting music and songs with positive and fun messages and at least half of the orchestra will be made up of younger musicians. Another goal is to expose our youth to the great sound of a string section in a pop setting, which you only normally get to hear in a symphony performance. There were many great arrangements using strings and horns beginning in the swing era and continuing on in the 60's and 70's. Then they slowly begin to decline with the use of synthesizers. Also, we are reintroducing the unique sound of vocal harmonies with our 6 vocalists, which has also been lost to a great degree.
I have worked on this project and goal for over 6 years and am now in the pre-production phase, which is to learn and put the show together with all of the singers and musicians. (31 people) This  is quite an undertaking and will take several months of rehearsals. Costs that are involved include rehearsal sound equipment rental, rehearsal room rental, music stands/lights, insurance, and special equipment for some of the orchestra positions. This includes a Yamaha CP300 for the piano position, a Nord Sateg 2 EX HP76 for the Synth 1 position, a Kurzweil PC3A7 for the Synth 2 position, and some additional percussion equipment. We use these special instruments to incorporate many of the new and contemporary sounds on top of the great traditional sounds of horns and strings to make the presentation more attractive to the younger generation. These costs have been researched and a cost and date will be listed on this site when they are purchased. This phase will cost approximately $30,000 to complete. Phase 2 will start at a later date and involve purchasing performance outfits and additional production assets. 

While all of the musical and artistic work is completed along with the pre-production work, this project cannot be completed without funding and your support is greatly needed and appreciated. Thank you for your support.

Budget Breakdown: 

1. Rehearsal Room/Rentals: (9 months)
    a. Room rental/energy = $150.00 (monthly)
    b. Bond for equipment and room insurance. 
     =  $175.00 (monthly) 
    c. Sound equipment rental = $650.00 (monthly)   
    d. 30 Manhassett music stands = $1,285.00 
                                                 Subtotal = $10,060.00

This ""Brenda Howard Album Project"" is planned to hit the recording studio on the first of the year of 2016.It is people like you, the supporters of the independent artist, that make all of this possible.  You are directly investing in the release of a great music CD and furthering an independent artist's career!  Just a simple financial gesture can leave a profound mark on an individual music career, the music industry, and will be played by countless numbers of people till the end of time!   Thank you so very much!!!     www.BrendaHowardMusic.com",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>ALONZO
IS LON STRICKLAND</b></p>
<p>Welcome to my first fundraiser
project! Back in 2009, I produced an album called ALONZO, an experimental music
project celebrating  1980s synth pop music styles while bringing in a
little prog rock, outer space, religion, aliens, and conspiracy theories.
Certain tracks on the album got featured  on  some popular videos in
the Machinima network on Youtube, and I was completely surprised and humbled to
see that a small cult audience emerged. Thank you so much for
your adoration and support. <br/>
<br/>
Since then, my professional and personal life has become much more complex in
new and exciting ways. I saw the birth of my son in 2012 and I became a
development executive for Machinima. All the while, I have wanted to get back
to work on creating a new album, but I want to do it right. <br/>
<br/>
I want to work with some very talented musicians, producers, and mixers here in
Hollywood, and I want to pay these people what they are worth. ALONZO: EQUINOX
will raise the bar significantly, containing all the aesthetic elements of the
first album while bringing in more prog rock and orchestral sounds as
well.  </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need studio time, mixers, and musicians. This takes lots
of time and money. I also plan to print physical copies of the album just for

We now have so many musical memories to share with you!  My festival creative team put their heads together and boy was it tough to select just a CD full of favorites from hundreds of fabulous performances.  But we did it and now we are asking for your support to produce the first Live From The Litchfield Jazz Festival –Celebrating 20 Years. <br/><br/><b>Who are we?</b><br/>Litchfield Performing Arts' mission is to educate and inspire young people to be confident, creative, expressive individuals through challenging programs in jazz music and the performing arts and to share the passion and magic of the arts with the wider community.<br/><br/>LPA is celebrating thirty-four seasons of service through the arts this year. The centerpiece of these efforts is Litchfield Jazz Camp which has been changing lives for 19 years by awarding $100,000 in need-based scholarships each year.<br/><br/><b>The Campaign </b><br/>Throughout the 20 years of the Jazz Festival, even from the early years, we had the best audio engineers and recording pros building our Jazz Fest archives with live takesd—from Dave Brubeck, to Eartha Kitt to Kenny Rankin and everyone in between. This benchmark anniversary seemed the perfect time to open our vault and get this music out to the public. Whether you’re hearing these performances for the first time or you have fond memories of having heard them live way back when—I think you’ll love this CD. <br/><br/>This campaign is designed to raise funds to cover the production of the CD.  Any profits we might make from the sale of the CD can then go straight to helping fund scholarships for students to attend Litchfield Jazz Camp<br/><br/><b>Supporting the Arts and future generations of musicians!</b><br/>What better way to support the arts then by supporting both live and recorded music! While supporting the album you will help ensure future generations of jazz performers. It really is that simple. By hitting our goal, we will be able to direct 100% of all sales of the album to the LJC Scholarship fund.  <br/><br/><b>Where will the funding go?</b><br/>The $6000 will help us achieve <br/>Editing, Mixing and Mastering of the music<br/>Graphic design and layout of the CD, Liner Notes<br/>Mass duplication of Album and shipping<br/>Online distribution and media outreach<br/><br/><b>Perk? Of course we got Perks!</b><br/>So what does one get by supporting this project? I’m happy you asked. We have various levels each of which has it’s own rewards. You could simply get a digital copy of the album, get either lawn or Tent tickets to the jazz festival, posters, T-shirts and even backstage Festival passes  for this 20th Anniversary Event – August 7-9. Want to be behind the scenes hanging with greats like Matt Wilson or Anat Cohen? Here’s your chance. Visit the perks section for more details.<br/><br/>Songs include<br/>1    “I Can’t Give You Anything But Love”  Eartha Kitt  (2005) <br/>2   “Big Bad Basie”  Dave Brubeck and The Count Basie Orchestra (2001)<br/>3.  “The Way You Look Tonight”  Kenny Rankin    (2002)<br/>4.  “One Note Samba”  Trio de Paz  (2009)<br/>5.  “Continuing”  Mario Pavone (2010)<br/>6.  “Raga”  Matt Wilson (2011)<br/>7.  “Crazy He Calls Me”  Helen Sung (2012)<br/>8.  “Tre Veglia e Sonno​”  Gary Smulyan (2013)<br/>9.  “Tormenta”  Jane Bunnett (2014)<br/>10.“Mad Bop”  Luis Munoz (2005)<br/>11.“Minor Swing”  Litchfield Jazz Orchestra (2014)<br/><br/><b>What if we don't real the full amount of our goal?</b><br/>If we don’t reach our goal, all funds we do receive will go to the project in a priority fashion. Obviously, mixing and mastering is first, then duplication and shipping. <b><br/></b></p><p><b>It's important to us, and it should be to you!</b><br/>For the entire two decades of the festival I have sat for hours on end in the weeks following  with Owen Muir, now a physician and a long time audio engineer and my son (he still does free sessions for musicians who need help here ) in my living room-turned-recording studio.

</div>","SummaryThis CD has been a long time coming! 20 years ago, I launched the first Litchfield Jazz Festival and built an archive of the fabulous performances that have happened there. We now have so many musical memories to share with you!  My festival creative team put their heads together and boy was it tough to select just a CD full of favorites from hundreds of fabulous performances.  But we did it and now we are asking for your support to produce the first Live From The Litchfield Jazz Festival –Celebrating 20 Years. Who are we?Litchfield Performing Arts' mission is to educate and inspire young people to be confident, creative, expressive individuals through challenging programs in jazz music and the performing arts and to share the passion and magic of the arts with the wider community.LPA is celebrating thirty-four seasons of service through the arts this year. The centerpiece of these efforts is Litchfield Jazz Camp which has been changing lives for 19 years by awarding $100,000 in need-based scholarships each year.The Campaign Throughout the 20 years of the Jazz Festival, even from the early years, we had the best audio engineers and recording pros building our Jazz Fest archives with live takesd—from Dave Brubeck, to Eartha Kitt to Kenny Rankin and everyone in between. This benchmark anniversary seemed the perfect time to open our vault and get this music out to the public. Whether you’re hearing these performances for the first time or you have fond memories of having heard them live way back when—I think you’ll love this CD. This campaign is designed to raise funds to cover the production of the CD.  Any profits we might make from the sale of the CD can then go straight to helping fund scholarships for students to attend Litchfield Jazz CampSupporting the Arts and future generations of musicians!What better way to support the arts then by supporting both live and recorded music! While supporting the album you will help ensure future generations of jazz performers. It really is that simple. By hitting our goal, we will be able to direct 100% of all sales of the album to the LJC Scholarship fund.  Where will the funding go?The $6000 will help us achieve Editing, Mixing and Mastering of the musicGraphic design and layout of the CD, Liner NotesMass duplication of Album and shippingOnline distribution and media outreachPerk? Of course we got Perks!So what does one get by supporting this project? I’m happy you asked. We have various levels each of which has it’s own rewards. You could simply get a digital copy of the album, get either lawn or Tent tickets to the jazz festival, posters, T-shirts and even backstage Festival passes  for this 20th Anniversary Event – August 7-9. Want to be behind the scenes hanging with greats like Matt Wilson or Anat Cohen? Here’s your chance. Visit the perks section for more details.Songs include1    “I Can’t Give You Anything But Love”  Eartha Kitt  (2005) 2   “Big Bad Basie”  Dave Brubeck and The Count Basie Orchestra (2001)3.  “The Way You Look Tonight”  Kenny Rankin    (2002)4.  “One Note Samba”  Trio de Paz  (2009)5.  “Continuing”  Mario Pavone (2010)6.  “Raga”  Matt Wilson (2011)7.  “Crazy He Calls Me”  Helen Sung (2012)8.  “Tre Veglia e Sonno​”  Gary Smulyan (2013)9.  “Tormenta”  Jane Bunnett (2014)10.“Mad Bop”  Luis Munoz (2005)11.“Minor Swing”  Litchfield Jazz Orchestra (2014)What if we don't real the full amount of our goal?If we don’t reach our goal, all funds we do receive will go to the project in a priority fashion. Obviously, mixing and mastering is first, then duplication and shipping. It's important to us, and it should be to you!For the entire two decades of the festival I have sat for hours on end in the weeks following  with Owen Muir, now a physician and a long time audio engineer and my son (he still does free sessions for musicians who need help here ) in my living room-turned-recording studio. Owen mixed and I played critic, year after year.  The music was marvelous and his work was terrific.  And then I began to be plagued by how ungenerous it was to have all this stashed away where no one but a few could hear it.

If you are reading this then you are considering donating to my Indiegogo Campaign! First of all, thank you so much for taking the time to visit my page. Let me start off with a backstory. Ever since I was little I wanted to be a singer. I received my first guitar around the age of 12 due to nagging for one. My Mother says she honestly didn’t think I’d pick it up, let alone learn how to play the thing! My Mother has been one of my biggest influences musically. I remember her singing all the time and it made me want to do the same as her. I was very interested in poetry and wrote poems before ever deciding to write a song. The first song I ever wrote was for a girl I had a HUGE, not so discreet, crush on. I never thought I could sing, but dog gone it, I was going to stand in the middle of that shabby gym basketball court on 8th grade day and sing these heartbroken tunes! I was SO nervous I just stared at the bottom row bleachers. I remember when I was finished there were girls CRYING!! The gym exploded into clapping and cheering and for the first time in my 13 years on this planet I knew, I had a purpose. Even so, my girl situation never changed with said person. BUT thankfully God had a purpose for her cold disposition and jerkish ways. She later became my best friend and the sweetest person ever. If not for this experience I would have most likely never written “songs”! Now that that is over let’s move on to the business!</span><br/></p><p> I would like to let you know where your money will be going! The 2,500 dollars that I am asking to be funded will go to the physical distribution, whether it be Indiecards (for online downloading) or CDs. My goal is to have a physical representation of the music I write to take to Labels or to distribute to you guys, THE FAAANS! I write, play and sing not only as an emotional outlet, but the music I write is meant to inspire and motivate people. Whether it kicks someone’s ego in the butt and helps them start THEIR career, or it speaks to the lonely child contemplating suicide, I have a calling and IT IS MUSIC!! I’m not where I need to be BUT I’m heading there and I won’t stop until I help other people overcome their fears and heartache with the melodies and lyrics I write. This 2,500 I am asking for is the literal start to my career. If I play a gig in Nashville, Dalton Georgia or Charlotte North Carolina, if I don’t have music to put in the hands of potential fans I will most likely be put out of mind and I will likely never see that person again. I could write a song that will one day change their world, but without your help I will be forgotten. Once my EP has been recorded and produced I will then Ship the listed packages based on the pledged amounts. Just to reiterate about my upcoming EP, it will consist of 5 original songs that I have hand selected based on the feedback of my existing fan support (the majority favorites). I can tell you if you do help fund my very first EP you will be proud that one day when I’m well known you helped the struggling artist of today one day become the positive influence of the future. Ya’ll are awesome! Thank you SO much and like always, Stay Beautiful!  </p><p>-	Aubrey RodrigueZ</p><br/></div>","HELLO!

I’m not where I need to be BUT I’m heading there and I won’t stop until I help other people overcome their fears and heartache with the melodies and lyrics I write. This 2,500 I am asking for is the literal start to my career. If I play a gig in Nashville, Dalton Georgia or Charlotte North Carolina, if I don’t have music to put in the hands of potential fans I will most likely be put out of mind and I will likely never see that person again. I could write a song that will one day change their world, but without your help I will be forgotten. Once my EP has been recorded and produced I will then Ship the listed packages based on the pledged amounts. Just to reiterate about my upcoming EP, it will consist of 5 original songs that I have hand selected based on the feedback of my existing fan support (the majority favorites). I can tell you if you do help fund my very first EP you will be proud that one day when I’m well known you helped the struggling artist of today one day become the positive influence of the future. Ya’ll are awesome! Thank you SO much and like always, Stay Beautiful!  -	Aubrey RodrigueZ",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Hi everyone, my name is Julia Aljaz. I'm a singer/songwriter. I was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia but ended up in the states where I graduated from high school and got accepted to Berklee college of music on a scholarship. I took a year ""off"" before starting at Berklee because I wanted to raise enough money to cover the whole cost of tuition even with a scholarship that I'm extremely grateful I've received. I'm living in London at the moment and I just finished writing and carefully choosing my first EP that we're going to top up with 4 music videos that connect to one another and then release a short film at the end. <br/>
</div>
<p>I'm very time limited. I got a lot of offers from labels and people interested but everyone wants to hear my EP first, I got the studio (EC1), got the right people and have my video team ready. We just need a little bit support from you guys.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">What do we need and how can you help?</span></h2>

<p>My EP costs are £2750. </p>
<p>That means the rest of £5000 would go for 4 music videos that would connect to one another. By that I mean connecting all of the 4 videos with a story or concept that would make it interesting for viewers to watch. </p>
<p>To me, this is not about the money it's just sadly the way it is, the people that are working on my projects all work for free, the costs will go towards the equipment and place.</p>
<p>From the £5000 for the video shoot we'll also do some live recordings of gospel with me as a lead singer and will try to combine soul with pop which is a major part of my music - we also take requests on songs!</p>
<p>There is a few different ways of you getting involved:</p>
<p>1. BE INSPIRATIONAL AND SEE YOURSELF IN A VIDEO</p>
<p>If you invest anything, even £5 and feel artistic, you can send me a picture of you with an inspirational quote that you believe in with all your heart. For example mine is ""You can't be what you can""t see."" Take a picture of it or a short video of you and we'll put you in a video with one of my songs that will be dedicated to you guys. </p>

<h1><b><i>Who am I and what is this music project? A bio and important information.</i></b></h1>
<h1><b><i><br/></i></b></h1>
<h1><b><i>First of all! I've decided to make this project about music, illness awareness, and community. Please watch the video. I need your help to tour and prove that you can do anything! <br/></i></b></h1>
<b><i><br/>My name is Parker Hatcher. I am a 25 Year old Transgender (Male), disabled (Lupus) musician who grew up in Winnipeg, MB. I have one studio album under my belt, but this time I decided to give my all to this new project. I'm doing this all myself. Every track, drums, guitar, bass, keys, vocals. I'm tracking all of it myself.</i><i><br/></i><i>Despite living with lupus, I fully intend to tour this record. I want everyone to hear it. I believe this will be one of the greatest things I've ever done. I have something to prove. Being transgender, and being sick. I AM going to prove it. I need all the help I can get. <br/>I became very sick after the release of my last record. I never had a chance to tour it. I laid down and decided to die. But after a trip to Toronto to play a show for a friends documentary, I got back up. And said I have to do this. I have so much to give, I will NOT give up.<br/>Life is short and It's even shorter if you give up, lay in bed, and do nothing. I've choses NOT to do that. I will FIGHT for the music. I will FIGHT my illness.<br/>And most importantly I will show others that they can achieve their dreams<br/></i><i><br/></i><i>I want every corner of the earth to hear this record. I want this album to be my legacy. I want this to be larger than life. And I want the listeners to interpret these tracks in such a way that they can relate to it on every level possible. I am looking for investors, supporters, and independent music enthusiasts. Face it. I am the little guy. And the little guy gets swept under the rug. But my passion is big, my sound is bigger, and my ambition is unstoppable. <br/><br/></i></b><h4><b><i>This is a 16 track music project I call ""Ward 3"". This is a journey into the human mind, madness, pain, anger, sadness, fear, love, and insanity. There are many extremes inside ones self. This is a concept album, and every single track will be an exploration into one or more of these extremes. I need help.

</div></div>","Who am I and what is this music project? A bio and important information.

First of all! I've decided to make this project about music, illness awareness, and community. Please watch the video. I need your help to tour and prove that you can do anything! 
My name is Parker Hatcher. I am a 25 Year old Transgender (Male), disabled (Lupus) musician who grew up in Winnipeg, MB. I have one studio album under my belt, but this time I decided to give my all to this new project. I'm doing this all myself. Every track, drums, guitar, bass, keys, vocals. I'm tracking all of it myself.Despite living with lupus, I fully intend to tour this record. I want everyone to hear it. I believe this will be one of the greatest things I've ever done. I have something to prove. Being transgender, and being sick. I AM going to prove it. I need all the help I can get. I became very sick after the release of my last record. I never had a chance to tour it. I laid down and decided to die. But after a trip to Toronto to play a show for a friends documentary, I got back up. And said I have to do this. I have so much to give, I will NOT give up.Life is short and It's even shorter if you give up, lay in bed, and do nothing. I've choses NOT to do that. I will FIGHT for the music. I will FIGHT my illness.And most importantly I will show others that they can achieve their dreamsI want every corner of the earth to hear this record. I want this album to be my legacy. I want this to be larger than life. And I want the listeners to interpret these tracks in such a way that they can relate to it on every level possible. I am looking for investors, supporters, and independent music enthusiasts. Face it. I am the little guy. And the little guy gets swept under the rug. But my passion is big, my sound is bigger, and my ambition is unstoppable. This is a 16 track music project I call ""Ward 3"". This is a journey into the human mind, madness, pain, anger, sadness, fear, love, and insanity. There are many extremes inside ones self. This is a concept album, and every single track will be an exploration into one or more of these extremes. I need help. I am barely getting by, and this album is going to make or break me.Either way, when this record is finished recording, I will need to send it to get mastered, and print it. My goal is to print cds, and vinyl (EXPENSIVE) as well as shirts, posters, and all the merch the listeners will have. As well as limited edition vinyl versions of my first record. Please remember what goes around comes around. Karma is real. The little guy can have the biggest sound. And music heals. What I need 

I want this album to get out there as much as it can.

In the past 6 months I have invested over $6000 in professional recording equipment to be able to record this album and future albums to the industry standard level. I have spent hundreds and hundreds of hours researching the most cost effective tools for recording and even more time writing and rewriting the songs. </p>
<p>The first $2000 raised in this campaign will go directly to CD duplication and merchandise. </p>
<p>The next $2000 will be spent on christian session musicians used to record the album. </p>
<p>The last $8000 will go towards a preamp used to record drums, microphones and paying off some of the gear I have already purchased to get a head start.</p>
<p>After the completion of this album and campaign, I will be able to use this equipment to work with other worship leaders and pastors releasing new music for their congregations. </p>

(without having to ever sell your music).</p>
<p>We've gotten off to a great start by being able to offer Android app development, publishing and data hosting for as low as $40 (one-time fee).  This means that you <i>(EVEN IF YOU HAVE AN iPHONE)</i> can engage and monetize all of your fans who have Android phones and tablets!  ...And we'll even help you do it!</p>
<p>Once you have your app, we can also facilitate upgrading to iOS for a publishing fee of $50 plus $39/month for maintenance and data hosting.  Eventually, what we would LIKE to be able to do is ALSO provide iOS publishing, maintenance and data hosting for a (very low) <i><b>one-time fee</b></i> as well!  <b>No company </b>has ever been able to pull this off, but we are committed to work toward doing just that.</p>
<p><b><i>In order to reach our goals we need:</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$$$ to pay for planners, developers and designers to create a new development and monetization process that allows us to build, host, publish and maintain apps on iOS, Android, Windows &amp; HTML5 for ONE low development fee and <b>$0 in monthly maintenance and hosting.</b>  There has been a $300k investment to build the business model (from scratch) to where it currently stands.  It has yielded S4TF a collective net worth of $3.6 million over the past 3 years.</li>
<li>$$$ to build a website that features <b>all </b>of the artists mobile apps and is actively promoted to venues, record labels, publishers, distributors, radio stations, TV and movie executives, advertisers, etc. to assist artists in getting exposure, gigs and sponsorships/endorsements for independent artists using the S4TF business model.</li>
<li>$$$ to create professional graphic templates for artists so they can just choose a design, customize to fit their image and upload to the platform.  All templates will be made available as completely unlocked PSD files with unrestricted customization rights at NO charge.  It is our intention that at least 30 brand new, unique templates will be made available each month. </li>

$$$ to pay for planners, developers and designers to create a new development and monetization process that allows us to build, host, publish and maintain apps on iOS, Android, Windows & HTML5 for ONE low development fee and $0 in monthly maintenance and hosting.  There has been a $300k investment to build the business model (from scratch) to where it currently stands.  It has yielded S4TF a collective net worth of $3.6 million over the past 3 years.
$$$ to build a website that features all of the artists mobile apps and is actively promoted to venues, record labels, publishers, distributors, radio stations, TV and movie executives, advertisers, etc. to assist artists in getting exposure, gigs and sponsorships/endorsements for independent artists using the S4TF business model.
$$$ to create professional graphic templates for artists so they can just choose a design, customize to fit their image and upload to the platform.  All templates will be made available as completely unlocked PSD files with unrestricted customization rights at NO charge.  It is our intention that at least 30 brand new, unique templates will be made available each month.",3.0,3,"2 Campaigns

</h1><p><b>Her story</b></p>
<p>We are a non-profit women's music festival
dedicated to the advancement of women and girls of all ages in Business, Education, Music
and the Fine Arts. </p>
<p>Inspired by Lilith Fair and the National Women's Music Festival, the Northern California Women’s Music Festival was established in May
of 2014 in Modesto, California by like-minded women with similar goals and an
interest in increasing women in leadership positions within the Fine Arts and Business. </p>
<p>Our goal is to have a lasting impact for women and girls of all
ages by actively supporting the pursuit of leadership in business and the arts
including music, film, poetry, visual arts, dance, and more. Our festival sets the foundation for the building of a
community of women who support, nurture and care about the health, and wealth of
one another. This festival will be an annually occurring event.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why do we need you?</b></p>
<p>Our campaign is designed to raise enough
to pay for the venue, performers, and to help women in the community. This includes the funding of three of our grant
opportunities available to women and girls of all ages in California. Our
funding is an integral part of bringing together high quality musicians,
artists, poets, comedians, and performers for this event. In addition to
being a major fundraiser, this event serves to raise awareness of women's challenges and achievements.</p>
<p>By bringing all of these women together we
create: </p>
<p>1) An opportunity for networking with like-minded
women, both in Business and the Fine Arts.<br/></p>
<p>2) A stage for women to share their gifts
and talents with a broader audience, both during the festival itself and in NCWMF events throughout the year.</p>
<p>3) An avenue to increase the
representation of women in live sound, sound engineering and music.</p>
<p>4) An increased awareness of women's issues to inspire activism.
</p>
<p>Through the festival, we are able to create workshops, donate
to organizations whose goal is to assist women, and provide grant opportunities
to women of all ages that can be offered throughout the year. 
These workshops promote the health, well-being and advancement of all women of all ages throughout California. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>As a non-profit, the costs of
creating a music festival are wide and varied. We have budgeted for and are in
need of $5,000 to sponsor the artists, performers, the venue fees, and
overhead of providing a high quality Women's Music Festival that will span one
night and one full day. </p>
<p>In addition to our festival, we host concerts, workshops and gatherings throughout the year, which showcase women musicians, visual artists and allow women owned businesses a venue to be introduced to a larger audience. </p><p>Any donations will go to fund the
festival, the grant opportunities for women of all ages, live sound workshops, and Haven Women's
Center, which provides services to women who have suffered from domestic
violence or sexual assault.</p>
<p>We offer many perks for donating to our
campaign. With a $25 donation, you get two tickets to any fundraising concert and prominent acknowledgement on our website. For a $50 donation you receive two tickets to any fundrasing concert and a limited edition t-shirt. The larger the donation, the more opportunities you will have to be a part of our festival. Bigger donors will have
mention in our program, their logo on our posters, live mention during the concert, Gold Tickets to this year's festival, entrance to workshops and more.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we will use any funding to
put on the festival, so your donation counts. The show will go on.</p>

I think the material world is so imperfect, no matter how much longer we as humans try to extend our life span, we are always so imperfect as a species.At the same time, I worked at Steinway & Sons, from my work experience, I learnt that the nouveau riche are buying the “status” of these western luxury products but they do not understand why these products are expensive.

<p>The team behind Honey Groove wanted to give DC's queer community a small taste of our plans for the inaugural festival in April 2015, so last October we had an artist showcase called Taste of Honey. Hosted by local comedian and chef, Curt Mariah, it featured live painting by Ginnie McKnight, poetry from Patience, and music from DH DaHitwryer, Christen B, and Danni Cassette. The event was well received, and the community let us know that they were excited for what Honey Groove would bring!</p>

HOW THE SHAMBHALA GLOBAL MUSIC PROJECT GOT CREATED...The Shambhala Global Music Project - named after a mystical, magical kingdom hidden somewhere in Inner Asia - is the brainchild of Rajesh Ranjan Singh and David Nathan, two Landmark graduates who worked together in 2014 when Rajesh created a successful fundraising event for Nordoff Robbins (a music therapy charity dedicated to transforming the lives of vulnerable children and adults) at which David sang.  
A number of excellent Western and South Asian musicians played and performed at the fundraising event and David saw the vision of what would be possible if all this musical energy was brought together to collaborate and create new music. He shared his vision with Rajesh who was having a similar vision at the same time...
WHO ARE THE PROJECT LEADERS?
Rajesh is a musician and a leader who pioneered the breakthrough of rock music in India from the underground to the mainstream through his record label - Throatlatch Records. An acknowledged music historian and author, David has recorded three CDs as a vocalist and song stylist with a number of special U.S. musical guests.
OUR MUSICAL TEAM...
Rajesh - leader, guitars, vocals, songwriter
David - campaign creator, vocals, songwriter
Ananda Gupta - vocals (Indian Classical)
Vidhya Sridhar - vocals (Indian Classical)
Roberta Diamond- vocals (Spanish folk, Baroque/Renaissance)
Ishtiaq - vocals, harmonium
Stanley Ohios - drums
James Macphail - bass guitar
Aritra - violin, vocals, songwriter
Soumyendu - keyboards, tabla
Juan Antonio Xas - saxophone
Vlatko Ivanov - saxophone
Ignacio Luscardi - flamenco guitar
Amar - keyboards, songwriter
Abdullah - rubaab
Mahenra Patel - hand percussion
Chris Clarke - sound engineer, arranger

WHAT WE WANT TO ACHIEVE...
Our great musical team is  inspired about creating a recording of eight songs and a performance. A portion of proceeds from the entire Shambhala Project will go towards two charity organisations:  Nordoff Robbins (transforming lives of vulnerable children and adults using music therapy) and the world-renowned Save The Children.
OUR VISION FOR THE PROJECT...The Shambhala Global Music Project is the start of this great vision of providing a platform for musicians from different genres to come together, explore, collaborate and produce music for the world that could never be produced in any other way. This will not only unite musicians in the creation of something unique but also plant the seeds for ONE WORLD, where the world lives as one!WHY WE ARE ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT.......so we can raise the funds to do the recording of six-eight songs within the next month followed by a live performance of the new music within the next two months; our budget includes studio fees for recording, mixing and mastering; rehearsal hall fees; and production of a limited number of CDs for sale online and at performances.ONCE REACH OUR GOAL......we can complete recording, The Shambhala Global Music Project will be 'live' and tracks available digitally for worldwide distribution (on iTunes and Amazon)......we can create a limited number of CDs to sell at our launch performance...WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION WILL CREATE.....it will ultimately lead to us having this fusion of music by musicians and singers from different cultures available everywhere, in the process raising funds for two very worthwhile causes...
WHAT TO DO NEXT... ...please contribute whatever amount you can - there are some great perks!  And most important for all of us, please spread the word!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h2><div> Hi!<br/> I am Steph Brown and I am Della Lupa - an independent Brighton based artist. The project launched in June 2013  when I released debut EP 'Of the She Wolf' produced by Jag Jago (Maccabees). However the ideas for Della Lupa began to develop well before the launch. 'Of the She Wolf' is Della Lupa translated from Italian to English and the work was meant to reference my own cultural heritage of Italian, Vietnamese and English. It was during my Philosophy degree at Sussex University that I became fascinated with the merging of multiple ideas and cultures, looking to find a personal balance between many influences and ways of seeing through a project that at the same time exemplified strong female leadership in music. This inspiration  became the backbone to Della Lupa's style, sound and direction!<br/>
<h2>                   Della Lupa's Debut</h2>

<p>'Of the She Wolf' was funded off my own blood sweat, tears and shift work.  After post production and printing there were no funds left for a PR campaign to push the EP into press. Regardless the debut had relative success! Off the back of the release DL was asked to tour, playing 13 shows over two weeks in some of Ireland's best underground venues. DL also enjoyed playing some of London's best alternative venues inc. Ronnie Scotts Jazz club! fast gaining a reputation for high quality performance Della Lupa recorded a clockwork Owl session that had over 3600 YT hits without any external promotion!</p>

<p>the performance focused year of 2014 I was approached by photographer Beth Steddon. Initially looking for a model for her own photographic work, the project spiraled into a collaboration whereby, so inspired, I wrote and stylized the upcoming single 'Storm Of Swallows' based on Steddon's own concept in the photographs. This launched a new level of Della Lupa's ambition to 'merge ideas and perspectives' whereby the most essential part of the musical work has a strong relationship to it's visual counterpart and collaborators and so does it's promotion. *Storm of Swallows Launches on March 5th @One Church, Brighton - all proceedings go towards our target.

<p>There's a real kick about creating projects were so many other artists are involved and I get to promote them through DL. It really strengthens my relationship and that of others in the creative community that I heavily rely on and I want to continue in this manner. I am able to make decisions; not just about where to  take the music, but what it will mean and what it will support; independence, difference and creative freedom.</p>

this year was ""have 
you guys been signed or are you planning/trying to get signed?"".  This road is tough. Initially, you have very 
limited access to exposure, you spend an incredible amount of time on your work to make it great, but you
 have no time because you need to earn money to live. In order to get that exposure; for the tools, and the employment of people -  you need a lot of money you don't 
have. In this climate where music is free or incredibly cheap you make hardly any money off of your tracks and venues don't readily pay new bands for 
shows so at first it is incredibly difficult to fund and promote yourselves.

<p><b>My name is Asa.</b> I'm a Bristol-based musician and have been producing and performing under my first name and alias for about 8
years now. I work tirelessly on my music and it means everything to me. While I’ve
worked alongside a host of great producers and musicians over the years, I am ready to take the next step to do what I've always dreamed of by assembling a band, recording an album, and building a studio so that I can continue to record and release music all the time!</p>
<p><b>This will be my debut album, the result of
all my work to date</b>. It will be a realisation of my ongoing growth into the realm of live instrumentation - an area I began to explore from early on. Live instrumentation has been most prominent in my music so far in collaborations with <b>KOAN Sound</b> on our <i>Sanctuary EP </i>and my recent <i>Heartbeats EP. </i></p>
<p><b>So, why support me?</b> The full-length album is a format towards which I’ve been striving (with plenty of encouragement from the fans!) for quite some time now. However, as an artist whose solo musical output mostly is forced to negotiate the tricky terrain of being just outside club DJ-set compatibility, I have often encountered difficulty finding a truly hospitable context for that aspect of my 'sound'. </p>
<p><b>Who's on my team?</b> My two talented bandmates (Chalky &amp; James) are part of the production, as well as quite a few other talented friends, both musically and otherwise. I’ve already started writing and recording music with live performance in mind, and Chalky, James, and I have already started to rehearse. The first batch of demos are already sounding really solid (as can be heard in the video above!) and I have a strong sense of direction for the album. I think the results will be truly unique – not to mention, long-lasting. I would like to take this opportunity to allow <b>Chalky &amp; James</b> to introduce themselves...</p>

<p>This is not an undertaking I have assumed lightly. Frankly, I am a bit camera shy, and don't like to make my music about me, because it isn't - it's about the music and how it makes people feel. However, with the continued and overwhelming amount of encouragement I’ve received from friends &amp; fans everywhere, it clearly is the right time to <b>offer a bit more insight into my music and get myself out there to tour with a band</b>. </p>
<p>The work with the band has progressed my music at an astonishing rate, and I'm truly grateful to everyone who has taken the time to offer words of encouragement and support over the years, which has brought me to the point I am now where I can properly build this project. I’m confident that the album material is <b>the best music I’ve worked on to date</b>, and am so excited to share it with you all!</p>
<p>For me, moving forward out from the studio and onto the live stage, there are certain technical limitations that I can no longer overcome with software engineering. <b>Equipment for recording and performance</b> is the majority of what funds from the campaign will be used for.</p>
<p>This means that all money I
raise from this campaign carries serious longevity and all contributions go towards ensuring
an infrastructure and sustainable future for my music... <b>That's where you come in!</b></p>

We sat down &amp; worked out every single cost &amp; expenditure needed to enable us to realise my vision. To tell you a bit more about where the money is going, we expect:<br/></p>

<b>CDs/Vinyl Manufacturing:</b> £3,000</li>

<b>Mastering &amp; Distribution: </b>Undisclosed<br/>

<b>Everything else:</b> Whatever's left!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>If you're interested, stay tuned for campaign updates about the gear we'll be purchasing and more reward opportunities. If we exceed our target the surplus funds will be used to press and distribute higher quantities of the physical-copies of the album and ultimately, raise the bar of the whole project and it's promotional campaign. I will also do my best to run competitions during the campaign &amp; introduce extra perks if the demand calls for it.</div>

<p>Crucially, this new live platform will broaden the reach of my music … and through this album I hope to <b>allow my listeners to be a part of an intimate, real-life audience</b>. This album, and the live shows, mark the beginning of a transformation of my life’s work into an experience at last reconciled with the music I have been making. Over the years I have consistently challenged myself without ever compromising quality. And not only is this a landmark undertaking in my musical career, but it also marks a huge shift in the way I might go on to <b>establish a sustainable way of writing and performing my music</b> from here on out… but I can't do it without your help.</p>

I'm even more excited and motivated by your support, which allows me to do what I love AND continue to create music. Please donate if you can, but even a share goes a long way - I really think you'll love the new tunes (and other rewards!), and so much more if they're done right!

</div></div>","My name is Asa. I'm a Bristol-based musician and have been producing and performing under my first name and alias for about 8
years now. I work tirelessly on my music and it means everything to me. While I’ve
worked alongside a host of great producers and musicians over the years, I am ready to take the next step to do what I've always dreamed of by assembling a band, recording an album, and building a studio so that I can continue to record and release music all the time!
This will be my debut album, the result of
all my work to date. It will be a realisation of my ongoing growth into the realm of live instrumentation - an area I began to explore from early on. Live instrumentation has been most prominent in my music so far in collaborations with KOAN Sound on our Sanctuary EP and my recent Heartbeats EP. 
So, why support me? The full-length album is a format towards which I’ve been striving (with plenty of encouragement from the fans!) for quite some time now. However, as an artist whose solo musical output mostly is forced to negotiate the tricky terrain of being just outside club DJ-set compatibility, I have often encountered difficulty finding a truly hospitable context for that aspect of my 'sound'. 
Who's on my team? My two talented bandmates (Chalky & James) are part of the production, as well as quite a few other talented friends, both musically and otherwise. I’ve already started writing and recording music with live performance in mind, and Chalky, James, and I have already started to rehearse. The first batch of demos are already sounding really solid (as can be heard in the video above!) and I have a strong sense of direction for the album. I think the results will be truly unique – not to mention, long-lasting. I would like to take this opportunity to allow Chalky & James to introduce themselves...



 

 

This is not an undertaking I have assumed lightly. Frankly, I am a bit camera shy, and don't like to make my music about me, because it isn't - it's about the music and how it makes people feel. However, with the continued and overwhelming amount of encouragement I’ve received from friends & fans everywhere, it clearly is the right time to offer a bit more insight into my music and get myself out there to tour with a band. 
The work with the band has progressed my music at an astonishing rate, and I'm truly grateful to everyone who has taken the time to offer words of encouragement and support over the years, which has brought me to the point I am now where I can properly build this project. I’m confident that the album material is the best music I’ve worked on to date, and am so excited to share it with you all!
For me, moving forward out from the studio and onto the live stage, there are certain technical limitations that I can no longer overcome with software engineering. Equipment for recording and performance is the majority of what funds from the campaign will be used for.
This means that all money I
raise from this campaign carries serious longevity and all contributions go towards ensuring
an infrastructure and sustainable future for my music... That's where you come in!

 To be able to create the album I've been composing and to fund a live band tour, we need to buy a bit more gear - and I want to give the people who help me do it first access to the fruits of our labour. We sat down & worked out every single cost & expenditure needed to enable us to realise my vision. To tell you a bit more about where the money is going, we expect:


CDs/Vinyl Manufacturing: £3,000

Mastering & Distribution: Undisclosed


Music equipment: £12,000


Living & Touring expenses: £4,000

Everything else: Whatever's left!


If you're interested, stay tuned for campaign updates about the gear we'll be purchasing and more reward opportunities. If we exceed our target the surplus funds will be used to press and distribute higher quantities of the physical-copies of the album and ultimately, raise the bar of the whole project and it's promotional campaign. I will also do my best to run competitions during the campaign & introduce extra perks if the demand calls for it.





Crucially, this new live platform will broaden the reach of my music … and through this album I hope to allow my listeners to be a part of an intimate, real-life audience. This album, and the live shows, mark the beginning of a transformation of my life’s work into an experience at last reconciled with the music I have been making. Over the years I have consistently challenged myself without ever compromising quality. And not only is this a landmark undertaking in my musical career, but it also marks a huge shift in the way I might go on to establish a sustainable way of writing and performing my music from here on out… but I can't do it without your help.

 I'm so excited to be able to develop this album into what it should be with the proper equipment. I'm even more excited and motivated by your support, which allows me to do what I love AND continue to create music. Please donate if you can, but even a share goes a long way - I really think you'll love the new tunes (and other rewards!), and so much more if they're done right! Our goal is to have the album completed and on it's way to you by the end of Summer/start of Autumn 2015.


Perks range from as little as a £1 donation, to as much as visiting Bristol to spend studio time with me as I know my knowledge and insight of music production
techniques could be incredibly valuable to other producers. There are a few
different tiers for the vinyl & digital copies of the album itself. The

tiers include things like test presses, signed copies, artwork prints, and
much more.
Also, anyone who contributes to the campaign will be  able to download a bunch of new music that I think you will all be very interested in at the end of the campaign as a thank you... (*cough* Burial remixes + some other unreleased stuff *cough cough*).
Any contribution and support, whether a donation or just a share, is greatly appreciated. I can't wait to share what we're creating with you all, and couldn't even dream of doing it without you!",6.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Helloooo! </h3>
<p>From a young age I was always writing. Filling journals and diaries with so many thoughts. Forever an internal processor. I can remember as early as 2nd grade wanting to be an author when I grew up.  I’d spend my youth-filled days writing poetry and short-stories. I’m sure growing up in the Alaska bush helped by lending itself to a wilderness of imagination and adventure! Music was always an outlet for me. Having parents who both sang, a dad who played guitar and a mom who played piano, definitely worked in my favor! I was always so fond of storytelling but never thought in a million years I'd use music to tell my OWN story! At 16, I was given my first guitar for Christmas. That's where my love for songwriting began. And where I found my voice. Who would’ve thought this natural outlet as a kid would become my life’s passion?! </p>
<p>In 2013, I released my debut album, Fairer Days. Honestly, I had no idea what I was doing but golly, I went after it! All I knew was I wanted to <strong>give back. </strong>I didn't just want my music to pay the bills but help<strong> </strong>others and make a difference. So we partnered with <i>The Ameena Project, </i>a volunteer-run, non-profit in Kenya, and over the last several years, we've been able to provide 1,000 meals for children in need... AMAZING!!!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509004514/bmmziahri3ndsqn9dyoh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>WOW - did the response and feedback take me by surprise!!! I was so new to recording and producing that it ended up being a pretty long, drawn out process... as I didn’t have all my songs written beforehand and had never played my songs with a band before.  Being my very first project, I am still SO PROUD of how it turned out! As I’ve traveled throughout the Pacific Northwest sharing my songs,  it continues to amaze me the people who take to my music! </p>
<p>Over the last 4 years I’ve been writing new songs and am FINALLY at a place where I’m ready to share them with the world! The masses have spoken and it’s time to give the people what they want! Y'all have been so patient and gracious with me!!! I have no idea how some of you still show up after all these years to hear the same old songs...BLESS YOU DEAR SOULS!!!  I've fought the inner critic more times than I'd like to admit in this whole process and THANKFULLY, I've come out on top! I've had the Triple Threat at my heels....Discouragement, Doubt and Disappointment, yet STILL, I persisted. IT'S TRULY A TESTAMENT!!! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>SO HERE'S THE DEAL...</h3>
<p>For this new album, I'm doing things completely different! We're paying one flat price, for one night, for one finished project! THAT'S RIGHT!!! We are going through a recording company called Resurgent Sound, based out of Redding, CA, who will come to us here in Vancouver and do the whole album recording LIVE!!!! That's mixing &amp; mastering included. SAY WHAT?!?!? YEPPPPP. I love the idea of not spending an arm and a leg on recording cost and still keeping ownership of all my music! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509004571/fubumy4yl70afzloawv2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

</div><div>
<h3>THE IMPACT...</h3>
<p>When I look back at what <i>Fairer Days </i>did, not only for me but for so many people, I can't help but have the same hope with this new album!!! With so many parts of our world suffering from lack and injustice, my prayer is that this project will spread an even wider net of provision and help make a difference. </p>
<p>Songwriting has been so therapeutic for me. It's helped put language to both the woes and the joys of my heart. In every season. I don't know any other way to process. Music is so powerful. And if I'm so deeply impacted by other artist's song-stories, I have to believe there are people out there who will resonate with mine. The goal with my music is that the listener would experience hope. That they wouldn't feel alone. And that it would give permission to those whose creativity has laid dormant or untapped. If I can do it, YOU CAN DO IT!!!! </p>

<h3>RISKY BUSINESS...</h3>
<p>I've never done crowdfunding before so it's definitely a risk! BUT you never know until you try, eh? What I love about this opportunity is that each contributor has a part in making this project come to life! I'm a firm believer that we're always BETTER TOGETHER, so why not reach out to those who believe in you to help you see a dream realized?! I didn't get here on my own and definitely wouldn't want to be here, alone, without people to sing to :) I have faith in what I'm doing and where I'm heading and am simply trusting the process - scary and all!!!! </p>
<p>My band and I have already spent months throughout the year in rehearsal, getting all my songs fleshed out and perfected, layering each instrument. Pre-production is the hardest part, in my opinion, so we're working our tails off to have this album in SHIP SHOP SHAPE come time to record! Which speaking of... we are planning to record in <strong>JANUARY 2018!!!!!!! </strong>EEEKKK!! That's crazy sooooon, SOOOOO I'm really livin' on a prayer right now! Half the amount of recording cost is due upon signing of the contract...so automatically up front we need<strong> $2,500.</strong> Meh....that's nothin' right?!?  WE CAN DO THIS! </p>

and the limited local music industry, we were not able to finish the album by

us raise funds in order to record, mix and master the album in a professional
recording studio with high-quality equipment. Then, we need to promote it and release it. But even

<h2><b>Λίγα λόγια για εμάς...</b></h2>
<p>Γεια σας! Είμαστε η <b>Αλcmene</b> και η <b>Marie-Anne K</b>. Καταρχάς, θα θέλαμε να σας ευχαριστήσουμε που παρακολουθείτε τη μουσική μας καμπάνια και που υποστηρίζετε την προσπάθεία μας να υλοποιήσουμε το πρώτο σολο άλμπουμ της Αλcmene. O δίσκος μας εμπεριέχει κομμάτια διαφορετικού είδους όπως ποπ, ροκ και ηλεκτρονικά, τα οποία έχει συνθέσει η Marie-Anne K.</p>
<p>Λόγω της ελληνικής δημοσιονομικής κρίσης και της περιορισμένης τοπικής μουσικής αγοράς, δε μπορέσαμε να ολοκληρώσουμε το άλμπουμ με δικούς μας πόρους. Παρόλο που δεν έχουμε ενταχθεί ακόμα σε καμία δισκογραφική εταιρεία, γνωρίζουμε εξ αρχής πως καμία εταιρεία δε δύναται να καλύψει όλα τα έξοδα μας. Είμαστε απόλυτα επικεντρωμένες και δοσμένες στο σκοπό μας και παρά τις αμέτρητες δυσκολίες που μπορεί να αντιμετωπίζουμε, δε θα σταματήσουμε ποτέ να δημιουργούμε και να ζούμε γι' αυτό που αγαπάμε: τη <b>ΜΟΥΣΙΚΗ</b>. </p>
<h2>Λίγα λόγια για το άλμπουμ...</h2>
<div>Αν και φαντάζει αδύνατο για εκείνη να ενταχθεί σε ένα είδος μουσικής λόγω των πολλών της επιρροών, η <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Marie-Anne K καταφέρνει να συνδυάσει το Ηλεκτρονικό, </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Post/Alternative Rock και Trip Hop ύφος με στοιχεία της Gospel και της Blues μουσικής. Στο σύνολό της παρουσιάζεται ως μία ποπ καλλιτέχνης, η οποία αγαπά να παντρεύει την αντήχηση με τους σκοτεινούς, ""βρώμικους"" ήχους που παράγει το συνθεσάιζερ. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Η μεγαλύτερη της εμμονή δεν είναι άλλη από τους 80s ηλεκτρονικούς ήχους. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Ως αποτέλεσμα, το άλμπουμ θα αποτελέσει ένα πολυσυλλεκτικό κράμα πηγών και ήχων. Τα κομμάτια στοχεύουν στη δημιουργία ενός ξεχωριστού, προσωπικού είδους, το οποίο θα αποτελείται από φωνητικές αρμονίες και σκοτεινά ηχοτοπία.     </span>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Η συμπαραγωγή του άλμπουμ της Aλcmene θα πραγματοποιηθεί από τον <b>Chris Mike</b>, ο οποίος θα επιμεληθεί και τα κιθαριστικά μέρη του δίσκου.

</div></div>","A little something about us...
Hi guys! We are Aλcmene and
Marie-Anne K. Firstly, we would like to thank you for checking out our campaign
and for supporting our attempt to make Aλcmene’s debut solo album come true.
Our project contains several pop, rock, electronic songs, written and produced
by Marie-Anne K.

A little something about the Album….

In order to listen to some of the pre-productions of our album please follow the link below:
 Aλcmene's Debut Album Pre- Productions Samples

Marie-Anne K, in spite of being influenced by many genres, she cannot really restrict herself into one musical style. She combines Electronic, Post/Alternative Rock, Trip Hop with Gospel and Blues elements. She is considered to be a pop artist that loves to create dark atmospheres with distorted and synths sounds along with reverb effects. Her biggest obsession is ...the 80s electronic sounds. Therefore, the album will be a versatile mix of tracks that combine all of the above elements. The songs will create a unique genre, full of vocal harmonies and dark soundscapes. 
The co-production of Aλcmene's album will be held by Chris Mike, who will also perform the guitar parts for this upcoming album. Chris Mike (https://www.facebook.com/chrismikepage) is a Candyrat Records and JamTrackCentral artist. 
Check out his latest cover instrumental song through Candyrat Records:

http://www.chrismike.net 




WHY CROWDFUNDING
Due to the Greek financial crisis
and the limited local music industry, we were not able to finish the album by
ourselves. Even though we haven't collaborated with any music label yet, we know for a
fact that it would be rather difficult to cover all of our expenses that way. We
are utterly passionate for what we do and despite the numerous difficulties, we
will never stop creating what we love: MUSIC.

As a result, a crowdfunding campaign
seems to be the ideal choice for us, as we are thrilled to consider you as co-producers of our music. Therefore, if you like our music, you can help
us raise funds in order to record, mix and master the album in a professional
recording studio with high-quality equipment. Then, we need to promote it and release it. But even
if you are not able to contribute, you can still help us by sharing our
campaign on your social media accounts.
We promise to keep you posted
with regular updates and new perks!
Thank you again for your help and
your kind gestures! 
We appreciate everything you do
for us from the bottom of our hearts!
What We Need & What You Get
 
Our goal is to raise €6.400 to complete our project.

The breakdown:



Recording, musician fees, mixing = €2.500


Mastering = €500


CD printing = €500


Artwork & packaging design = €400


Music Video = €700


Marketing & Promotion = €1.000


Indiegogo & Paypal fees, shipping = €800


What You Get 
Some of the perks for donations will include private
acoustic concerts, personalized signed copies of the album, shout outs in the
printed record, original songs and cover videos just for you!
If we don't reach our goal, the funds will be divided
accordingly, cutting out certain areas such as marketing perks.
Other Ways You Can
Help
If you can't afford any of the perks, don't worry.
You can still help us out by spreading the word about the campaign. There's
definitely a way for everybody to help, if they are so inclined! For instance,
you can use the share tools that Indiegogo provides to spread the word across
all social media platforms! 
We are really glad that you took the time to check out our
campaign. 
The campaign will run until 12.12.2015.

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><br/>The story of <strong><i>Monk Restrung</i></strong> starts in 2004 when I began playing in Ben Riley's Monk Legacy Septet. It was a dream come true to play the music of Thelonious Monk with one of his greatest drummers! Trumpeter and musical director, Don Sickler arranged the classic tunes Ben played with Monk for four horns with guitar, bass and drums and painstakingly reproduced the distinctive harmonies, comping and solos of the master pianist without piano. This was documented on <strong><i>Memories of T</i></strong> (Concord Records 2006). Later I recorded <strong><i>Grown Folks Music</i></strong> (Sunnyside Records 2012) with Ben and Wayne Escoffery, the tenor player in the Legacy Septet. <br/><br/>The heavily orchestrated and specific arrangements were challenging. Playing with Ben was always inspiring but I was scripted more than not and craved the freedom of the trio. As Will Friedwald wrote in the New York Sun, <i>“Even though guitarist Freddie Bryant is also a prominent part of the band, Mr. Sickler resisted the temptation to let the guitar take the place of the piano. Mr. Bryant plays with an appropriately Monkish percussiveness, but he supplies horn-like, single-note-lines, rather than comping chords like a pianist.”</i><br/><br/>I found I was increasingly intrigued by the possibilities of Monk on the guitar and began to experiment with my working trio of Greg Ryan (bass) and Willard Dyson (drums) who had been the core of my Kaleidoscope group. Our style went from straight-ahead/swing to Brazilian, Latin and African influenced jazz as documented on <strong><i>Live at Smoke</i></strong> (Fresh Sound/World Jazz  2000).  <br/><br/>Stu Deutsch, a devoted guitar fan turned producer, bartered with an engineer for studio time and I came armed with my rhythm section and my trio of guitars: electric/jazz, nylon/classical and a 12-string!!! With the success of that session came more guitar-centered musings and Romero, Pete and Howard came in to record duos with me. This added Pete's swinging arch-top, Romero's Brazilian nylon and Howard's deep jazz 7-string guitars...Thus, <strong><i>Monk Restrung </i></strong>was conceived and recorded in 2005...<br/><br/>Money was then spent to edit, mix and master but the result was not where I wanted it at the time and the project fell by the wayside with no funds for completion. Fast forward 11 years and with the help of generous donations of a new mix and mastering we're on the way. But even with the music completed, the costs of production (including artist agreements from our original hand-shake contracts) threaten to create ongoing debt for years to come. <br/><br/>I've decided to release it now because many factors are lining up: as we approach Monk's 100th anniversary many familiar with the project have said it is an important and unique addition to the huge body of Monk-inspired repertory. Whether this is the case or not, I do know it represents a critical and undocumented aspect of my career which, in some circles, has been viewed as geared towards Brazilian/Latin styles rather than rooted in the traditional American jazz that molded me as a jazz player. <br/><br/>More importantly I have the opportunity of a CD release gig at one of the premier jazz clubs in New York City with ALL of the amazing players who graced this project! On Monday, November 28th we will gather at Dizzy's/Jazz at Lincoln Center, celebrating the new CD but also dedicating the evening to Ben Riley whom we hope will be in attendance!<br/><br/>Here's the dedication of the CD: <br/><i>THIS CD IS DEDICATED TO BEN RILEY WHO HAS BEEN AN INSPIRATION FOR ME IN LEARNING MONK’S MUSIC. HIS SENSE OF SWING IS INGRAINED IN MY SOUL AND I WILL ALWAYS DEEPLY APPRECIATE HIS MENTORSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP.</i><br/><br/>Your support is an important and valued part of this project.  We can't do it without you! I hope you'll read further for more details and PERKS for your donation.<br/><br/>THANK YOU!<br/>Freddie B. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Last Stage</h3>
<p><br/>All the music is recorded, edited, mixed and mastered. Check out the video above for some sound excerpts and studio pics of us 'back in the day!' But now we have the last hill to climb.<br/><br/>Here it is in plain terms:<br/><br/>EXPENSES:<br/>$3500 – musician fees <br/>$3581 – CD production 2000 units (4 side color digipack, 8 page booklet, Pro-distribution)<br/>$2451.88 – Publishing (12 Thelonious Monk songs) <br/>$1800 – CD graphic design (already discounted from $2500-3000)<br/><br/>$11, 332.88 – TOTAL<br/><br/>We're asking for $10,000 and we have already spent a lot over the years in production. This will not recover the full budget but we guarantee that all proceeds will go directly to the costs that have to be paid in this short 33 days until the release and celebration at Dizzy's.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p><br/>The benefits of your donation will range from a simple digital transfer of the music or signed CDs to private music lessons, tai chi classes, house/benefit concerts, admission to the CD release at Dizzy's and Executive Producer credit with listing on the CD! <br/><br/>Please check out the detailed list on this page and continue to come back as we will be adding perks periodically. <br/><br/>To all my fans and friends who contributed to my 2012 CD <strong><i>Live Grooves...Epic Tales</i></strong> (HipNotic Records) I hope you realize that your effort was critical in my only previous crowd funding success. Your help enabled my first CD in a 12 year period and I hope you are still enjoying the music that will live on forever thanks to you! This Monk project would have come in the middle of that 12 year recording drought. My last CD was <strong><i>Dreamscape: Solo, Duo, Trio</i></strong> (GJKSounds 2014). I hope this new/vintage project will fill in the gaps and propel my creative efforts for the future.<br/> </p>

Later I recorded Grown Folks Music (Sunnyside Records 2012) with Ben and Wayne Escoffery, the tenor player in the Legacy Septet. The heavily orchestrated and specific arrangements were challenging. Playing with Ben was always inspiring but I was scripted more than not and craved the freedom of the trio. As Will Friedwald wrote in the New York Sun, “Even though guitarist Freddie Bryant is also a prominent part of the band, Mr. Sickler resisted the temptation to let the guitar take the place of the piano. Mr. Bryant plays with an appropriately Monkish percussiveness, but he supplies horn-like, single-note-lines, rather than comping chords like a pianist.”I found I was increasingly intrigued by the possibilities of Monk on the guitar and began to experiment with my working trio of Greg Ryan (bass) and Willard Dyson (drums) who had been the core of my Kaleidoscope group. Our style went from straight-ahead/swing to Brazilian, Latin and African influenced jazz as documented on Live at Smoke (Fresh Sound/World Jazz  2000).  Stu Deutsch, a devoted guitar fan turned producer, bartered with an engineer for studio time and I came armed with my rhythm section and my trio of guitars: electric/jazz, nylon/classical and a 12-string!!! With the success of that session came more guitar-centered musings and Romero, Pete and Howard came in to record duos with me. This added Pete's swinging arch-top, Romero's Brazilian nylon and Howard's deep jazz 7-string guitars...Thus, Monk Restrung was conceived and recorded in 2005...Money was then spent to edit, mix and master but the result was not where I wanted it at the time and the project fell by the wayside with no funds for completion. Fast forward 11 years and with the help of generous donations of a new mix and mastering we're on the way. But even with the music completed, the costs of production (including artist agreements from our original hand-shake contracts) threaten to create ongoing debt for years to come. I've decided to release it now because many factors are lining up: as we approach Monk's 100th anniversary many familiar with the project have said it is an important and unique addition to the huge body of Monk-inspired repertory. Whether this is the case or not, I do know it represents a critical and undocumented aspect of my career which, in some circles, has been viewed as geared towards Brazilian/Latin styles rather than rooted in the traditional American jazz that molded me as a jazz player. More importantly I have the opportunity of a CD release gig at one of the premier jazz clubs in New York City with ALL of the amazing players who graced this project! On Monday, November 28th we will gather at Dizzy's/Jazz at Lincoln Center, celebrating the new CD but also dedicating the evening to Ben Riley whom we hope will be in attendance!Here's the dedication of the CD: THIS CD IS DEDICATED TO BEN RILEY WHO HAS BEEN AN INSPIRATION FOR ME IN LEARNING MONK’S MUSIC. HIS SENSE OF SWING IS INGRAINED IN MY SOUL AND I WILL ALWAYS DEEPLY APPRECIATE HIS MENTORSHIP AND FRIENDSHIP.Your support is an important and valued part of this project.  We can't do it without you! I hope you'll read further for more details and PERKS for your donation.THANK YOU!Freddie B.  

The Last Stage
All the music is recorded, edited, mixed and mastered. Check out the video above for some sound excerpts and studio pics of us 'back in the day!' But now we have the last hill to climb.Here it is in plain terms:EXPENSES:$3500 – musician fees $3581 – CD production 2000 units (4 side color digipack, 8 page booklet, Pro-distribution)$2451.88 – Publishing (12 Thelonious Monk songs) $1800 – CD graphic design (already discounted from $2500-3000)$11, 332.88 – TOTALWe're asking for $10,000 and we have already spent a lot over the years in production. This will not recover the full budget but we guarantee that all proceeds will go directly to the costs that have to be paid in this short 33 days until the release and celebration at Dizzy's. 

The Perks
The benefits of your donation will range from a simple digital transfer of the music or signed CDs to private music lessons, tai chi classes, house/benefit concerts, admission to the CD release at Dizzy's and Executive Producer credit with listing on the CD! Please check out the detailed list on this page and continue to come back as we will be adding perks periodically. To all my fans and friends who contributed to my 2012 CD Live Grooves...Epic Tales (HipNotic Records) I hope you realize that your effort was critical in my only previous crowd funding success. Your help enabled my first CD in a 12 year period and I hope you are still enjoying the music that will live on forever thanks to you! This Monk project would have come in the middle of that 12 year recording drought. My last CD was Dreamscape: Solo, Duo, Trio (GJKSounds 2014). I hope this new/vintage project will fill in the gaps and propel my creative efforts for the future.

<p>Peace!</p>
<p>I am an artist, entrepreneur and father that goes by the MC moniker of <strong>Zion I</strong>.  I have been independently creating albums for the last 16 years in the underground Hip Hop and indie scenes.  Early on in my career, I found it easier to be signed to a label.  But, as I grew with my art, it became apparent that an indie label was the way to  go, and so I started <strong>Mind Over Matter Records</strong>, as a way to continue releasing music with full freedom and creative control.</p>
<p>I am starting with Indiegogo as a way to fund my new album <i><strong>“The Labyrinth”</strong></i>.  This is my first crowdsourcing campaign, and I am excited about the ability to connect more intimately with listeners who have been with me since the beginning of my musical journey. In the past, I have depended on label or distributor advances to fund my projects.  Yet, this time around, my distributor would not advance me enough capital to actually get the album off the ground.  I felt stressed about the idea of coming straight out of my pocket for the investment with no safety net.  As you can imagine a campaign to create, manufacture, market and promote an album can skyrocket quickly.  Then, I began having conversations with my friends who had done crowd funded projects successfully, and the clouds started to part in my mind.  This was not a hurdle but actually a blessing in disguise.<br/>By coming directly to you, those who truly feel the music, I would be strengthening my bond with those who allowed me to achieve my success in the first place.  Times have definitely changed in the space of Hip Hop, but I will not stop my mission to bring you feel good music that takes into account our spiritual and emotional well being as listeners.  Thank you for support over all these years, and for helping me to live my dream!<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474610264/vfdi0otjw44grfduotod.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Those who support will help me to mix and master this album, using the incredible talents of <strong>Jason Moss</strong> (who has worked on every Zion I album by the way).  It will also create merchandise: tees, hats, jackets, vinyl, and cd’s.<br/>One of my main goals is to really bring you great video content to match the music.  Your support will allow me to tap the innovative film talent that lurks in the Bay Area, and present my sonic ideas on a higher level visually.  Finally, you will enable me to hire my trusted publicist (<strong>Ballin PR</strong>), my radio promoter (<strong>Co-Sign</strong>) and make sure that this album has a chance to cut across the wide expanse of white noise that constantly radiates from the music industry.</p>
<p>Even if I don’t reach my full goal, any support that you give me will still go towards these goals!</p>
<p><strong>The Labyrinth</strong> is my vision of the healing energy that music in general, and Hip Hop specifically can have in the world.  I know that most people don’t think of our culture that way, but I do. </p>

I am an artist, entrepreneur and father that goes by the MC moniker of Zion I.  I have been independently creating albums for the last 16 years in the underground Hip Hop and indie scenes.  Early on in my career, I found it easier to be signed to a label.  But, as I grew with my art, it became apparent that an indie label was the way to  go, and so I started Mind Over Matter Records, as a way to continue releasing music with full freedom and creative control.
I am starting with Indiegogo as a way to fund my new album “The Labyrinth”.  This is my first crowdsourcing campaign, and I am excited about the ability to connect more intimately with listeners who have been with me since the beginning of my musical journey. In the past, I have depended on label or distributor advances to fund my projects.  Yet, this time around, my distributor would not advance me enough capital to actually get the album off the ground.  I felt stressed about the idea of coming straight out of my pocket for the investment with no safety net.  As you can imagine a campaign to create, manufacture, market and promote an album can skyrocket quickly.  Then, I began having conversations with my friends who had done crowd funded projects successfully, and the clouds started to part in my mind.  This was not a hurdle but actually a blessing in disguise.By coming directly to you, those who truly feel the music, I would be strengthening my bond with those who allowed me to achieve my success in the first place.  Times have definitely changed in the space of Hip Hop, but I will not stop my mission to bring you feel good music that takes into account our spiritual and emotional well being as listeners.  Thank you for support over all these years, and for helping me to live my dream!
Those who support will help me to mix and master this album, using the incredible talents of Jason Moss (who has worked on every Zion I album by the way).  It will also create merchandise: tees, hats, jackets, vinyl, and cd’s.One of my main goals is to really bring you great video content to match the music.  Your support will allow me to tap the innovative film talent that lurks in the Bay Area, and present my sonic ideas on a higher level visually.  Finally, you will enable me to hire my trusted publicist (Ballin PR), my radio promoter (Co-Sign) and make sure that this album has a chance to cut across the wide expanse of white noise that constantly radiates from the music industry.
Even if I don’t reach my full goal, any support that you give me will still go towards these goals!
The Labyrinth is my vision of the healing energy that music in general, and Hip Hop specifically can have in the world.  I know that most people don’t think of our culture that way, but I do. 
Creating this album helped me to deal with the loss of my father late last year.  Without the ability to write out my feelings and channel them, I’m not sure where I would be right now.  This music can truly transform lives for the better.  I am the perfect example of it.

<p>This album is part of a dream come true, now manifesting with a LOT of amazing help. It’s the culmination of a process that began in late 2014, when I got very clear in my intention of taking songwriting and performing, my greatest joy, from the periphery to the center of my life. Very shortly thereafter, things you might call “miracles” began to occur, opening a way forward. Earlier this year, through a mutual friend, I met Bil Vorndick, an uber-talented, Grammy-winning producer who has been guiding and mentoring me, and who heard enough in my songs to continue that process.</p>
<p>Now we are moving forward with this, my third album – and a truly unique opportunity to give these songs the kind of quality production and exposure they deserve, and which I could not provide on my own. In today’s dramatically changing market, however, that still generally means a self-funded project. My partner and I are working hard and pulling together what we can, but a sizeable margin remains between what we HAVE and what we NEED to see this through to completion, and we need your help to close that gap. Every last dime contributed will be applied toward paying these fabulous musicians, the studio, the mixing and mastering, graphics, CD duplication and so on.</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, at whatever level feels comfortable, there are assorted “goodies” – from pictures to signed CD’s and other cool stuff. The timelines for delivery dates on these offerings are approximate, based on an estimated date of completion. But each and every pledge will be honored as close to the dates given as is humanly possible.</p>
<p>Those of you who know me also know I’m a passionate advocate for social and environmental causes. One of my goals has always been to integrate the ideas that I care deeply about into my music in a way that can inspire positive change - not by preaching or judging but by celebrating the things we value and creating a world that works for everyone. If you believe, as I do, that music can be a vehicle not only for cool stories, good times and hip grooves but for inspiration and real social change, please help me in creating and manifesting that vision in a bigger way, in a way that can serve more people and the greater good.</p>

<b>When:</b> SUNDAY APRIL 3rd 2016<br/><b>Location:</b> Hovea Falls, John Forrest National Park<br/><b>Dress Code:</b> Viking/Warrior<br/><b>Weapons:</b> Essential. Larp and Authentic (Armourer on site!)<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455719122/vbek5fnx4kbhidicgw5f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/><h3>Background - Why We Are Doing This/Why Now</h3>
<p>We have always had a killer stage show - (not to say the best sound as we are often quite drunk when we play) but we like to put on a viking war feast. We know we are in Australia and we give zero fucks about that fact - we love Norse Mythology and we love the sounds that conjures up in our imagination. We like our shows to look and feel like a battle, or a triumph or a passage to Valhalla - and we'd like our video clips to feel the same.</p>
<p>Our 'Thunder' guitarist -Simon works in the film/TV industry and has been experimenting with new technology - 360 Video.  It is quite new however YouTube and Facebook have implemented the ability to play it and we want to give it a go.</p>
<p>We've looked around and haven't really seen anything like this in this space so we'd like strike hard and fast and make something new and interesting. <br/></p>
<p>We'd like our viking horde to be a part of the show so we've cooked up this idea. The following is a summary of our idea and if you like what you hear, or would like any of our 'Perk Rewards' even if you cannot be here in person please engage with the campaign - or if not - just give it a share!  Every little bit will help.</p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>We are currently working on a new album and would like to create a brand new type of music video with your help.  We are a viking metal band so we like big battles and fancy dress! Oh, and weapons.. we love weapons so naturally we would like to have a grand scale battle and film it all to our new track entitled <i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaT5AkyLkCc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'Gleipnir'   </a></i><br/></p> <ul> <li>We are Wrath of Fenrir - a viking metal band from Perth, Western Australia.<br/>
</li> <li>We are fully aware of how ridiculous that is.<br/>
</li> <li>WE WANT YOU. To grow a beard where possible and gather your weapons to charge into battle on our 360 battlefield to the tune of some sweet sweet war tunes.</li>
<li>Campaign rewards are available to all fans - if you can't make it we can send the Perk to you - please select the international version of your desired Perk!<br/>
</li> </ul> <p>We feel like this video will be first of it's kind so make sure you get involved and donate/claim rewards at any tier - it all helps!<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Why we are launching a funding campaign:</p> <ul> <li>When we were kids Iron Maiden always had the best goddamn shit - best shirts, best stages, best merch... tea cups to computer games and all in between. In addition to the Viking music we like to play we want to bring all that cool shit in as part of the Wrath of Fenrir experience. </li> <li>As a reward for helping us fund this rather ambitious plan we have a bunch of cool stuff at multiple financial levels - for the fan that wants to give a little something, right up to the fan that want's to give (and in turn, receive) a lot.<br/>
</li> <li>We're working on making the packages real bang for your buck! So have a look at our one offs.  <br/>

Background - Why We Are Doing This/Why Now
We have always had a killer stage show - (not to say the best sound as we are often quite drunk when we play) but we like to put on a viking war feast. We know we are in Australia and we give zero fucks about that fact - we love Norse Mythology and we love the sounds that conjures up in our imagination. We like our shows to look and feel like a battle, or a triumph or a passage to Valhalla - and we'd like our video clips to feel the same.
Our 'Thunder' guitarist -Simon works in the film/TV industry and has been experimenting with new technology - 360 Video.  It is quite new however YouTube and Facebook have implemented the ability to play it and we want to give it a go.
We've looked around and haven't really seen anything like this in this space so we'd like strike hard and fast and make something new and interesting. 
We'd like our viking horde to be a part of the show so we've cooked up this idea. The following is a summary of our idea and if you like what you hear, or would like any of our 'Perk Rewards' even if you cannot be here in person please engage with the campaign - or if not - just give it a share!  Every little bit will help.

Short Summary We are currently working on a new album and would like to create a brand new type of music video with your help.  We are a viking metal band so we like big battles and fancy dress! Oh, and weapons.. we love weapons so naturally we would like to have a grand scale battle and film it all to our new track entitled 'Gleipnir'     We are Wrath of Fenrir - a viking metal band from Perth, Western Australia.
 We are fully aware of how ridiculous that is.
 WE WANT YOU. To grow a beard where possible and gather your weapons to charge into battle on our 360 battlefield to the tune of some sweet sweet war tunes.
Campaign rewards are available to all fans - if you can't make it we can send the Perk to you - please select the international version of your desired Perk!
  We feel like this video will be first of it's kind so make sure you get involved and donate/claim rewards at any tier - it all helps!   What We Need & What You Get Why we are launching a funding campaign:  When we were kids Iron Maiden always had the best goddamn shit - best shirts, best stages, best merch... tea cups to computer games and all in between. In addition to the Viking music we like to play we want to bring all that cool shit in as part of the Wrath of Fenrir experience.  As a reward for helping us fund this rather ambitious plan we have a bunch of cool stuff at multiple financial levels - for the fan that wants to give a little something, right up to the fan that want's to give (and in turn, receive) a lot.
 We're working on making the packages real bang for your buck! So have a look at our one offs.  
    The Budget We are using the budget purely on the equipment needed to film the clip such as the 360 Camera, essential bits like a generator, smoke machines etc. and to feed and water the horde on the day:  Your contribution will help us fund the track, but also help reward everyone involved in this project with a better final product.
 We vikings have a saying 'A rising tide lifts all ships'  - we have the skills necessary  to make this dream a reality and have a blast with our fans in the process.
 We want to make cool shit to give to our fans - these funds and pre-orders help make that possible!
    We Are Working On Something New
  We are a solid team and by working together we are sure we can achieve this goal. With all cutting edge technologies we are sure there will be hurdles. By working together in a solution oriented way we would like to foresee and adjust the ship to overcome this.  We have never done this before.
 Neither has anyone else.
Let's give it a damn good go.
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Get the word out and like and share this campaign - hopefully it lands in front of as many people that would love this as possible!
 Share via Indiegogo, Facebook etc. and encourage people to get in touch!!

Zonnis is Victoria's hottest and hardest-working musical duo, and they're bringing you a new album. ""Rise of the Sheep"" is an eleven-song collection of original music that will tickle your ears and stimulate your soul. Inspired by their travels and musical exploits over the past few years, ""Rise of the Sheep"" is a healthy mix of Canadian folk, roots and rock, sprinkled with a light dusting of musical theater and off-beat humor, and bound together with a message of peace, love and good times. Produced by award-winning producer and musician Barry Mathers and featuring a great line-up of guest musicians, ""Rise of the Sheep"" is set to launch Zonnis into the next phase of their exciting and ever-expanding musical careers. Let that party start!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Recording and album is expensive! From studio time to mixing to session musicians, the costs can add up quickly. While the entire cost of the album will total around $7000, as well as a publicity budget of $3500, we are setting a realistic goal of $3000 to help supplement the cost. This will include recording, mixing, mastering and physical production. <br/></p>
<p>Folks who choose to support our cause will know that they are helping us to follow our dreams and bring our music to the world. Some of the perks that we are offering include autographed advance copies of our album, private performances at a venue of your choosing, as well as our one and only touring van!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>For the last couple years, Zonnis has been steadily breaking into the Western Canadian music scene, including various festival appearances and live performances on community radio stations. It has become obvious to us that we are getting the attention we need, and it's time to give the fans a fantastic record that they can take home with them.</p>As manager and publicist of his previous musical projects, Adam Zonnis has successfully charted his music on many college and community stations, as well as receiving regular rotation on Victoria's The Zone 91.3. With his experience combined with Andrea's flair for branding and design, this album is sure the bring Zonnis to the forefront of the Canadian roots music scene.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Throw a house concert! We tour regularly, and have found that house concerts are one of our preferred venues in which to perform. Nothing beats the relaxed, intimate environment of a good friend's living room, and we have found that it's a way to bring our music to small towns that may not have access to a suitable venue.<br/>

<p>When I moved to Brighton in 2007, I settled on 'Laish', this strange exotic word, pronounced ""lie-shh"", that means 'The tribe of Dan', a name that would signify my music from now on.</p>
<p>As Laish I have released two albums which were very kindly received by reviewers and my supporters. I love to travel and share my songs and connect with rooms of people.

<p>I feel very lucky to have got this far. I have done it off my own steam with no management or label backing. But in order to finish this new batch of recordings and get them released, there are many costs to consider. </p>
<p><b>Studio Costs.</b> I have written my best songs so far and I want them to be presented as high quality and exciting recordings that you will love. I am recording at Watchtower Studios in North London with an excellent producer, Dave Gerard, who I love working with.</p>

</div></div>","Laish - New album in the making

Hi my name is Danny Green, my musical project is called Laish. I have loved writing songs and recording them since I first picked up a guitar at the age of 13. 
When I moved to Brighton in 2007, I settled on 'Laish', this strange exotic word, pronounced ""lie-shh"", that means 'The tribe of Dan', a name that would signify my music from now on.
As Laish I have released two albums which were very kindly received by reviewers and my supporters. I love to travel and share my songs and connect with rooms of people. I have played shows in places like Germany, Italy, Switzerland, India and Israel.  In the UK I have toured endlessly both solo and with a full band and performed in some of the most prestigious venues, including The Roundhouse, Barbican, Union Chapel and Kings Place and at some incredible festivals like End of The Road and Cambridge Folk. 
I feel very lucky to have got this far. I have done it off my own steam with no management or label backing. But in order to finish this new batch of recordings and get them released, there are many costs to consider. 
Studio Costs. I have written my best songs so far and I want them to be presented as high quality and exciting recordings that you will love. I am recording at Watchtower Studios in North London with an excellent producer, Dave Gerard, who I love working with.
Promotion. To release the music properly and to grow my existing fan base, I will need the support of a press and radio campaign. 
Music Videos. I have made some awesome music videos which you're going to see very soon.
Manufacture. I plan to press gorgeous-looking cds and for the first time, vinyl.
A lot of this work has already been done, but at this point I could do with some assistance to get it completed.
I have finished four new tracks which you can receive before anyone else by supporting, and you will get the album once it is ready. 
Here is the first song:

By supporting you will get straightaway:

Song for Everything EP featuring four new songs as a download 

An album of 14 cover songs recorded by Laish since 2008.

<p>My name is Benjamin Cressall. I've been playing music for over 10 years. And in the more recent years I've been working on writing songs. Not just for the sake or writing songs, but to write songs that are personal and have meaning to me. And also that really love to play. So thats why I've decided to make this small album.</p>
<p><b>What's the Album About?</b> </p>
<p>Love is something everyone experiences. Whether its between a man and women, between a family and also friends. But it's also something that has caused pain, bitterness, hurt and even hate. </p>
<p>So this is a collection of songs that are exactly that, stories of hurt, longing, redemption, hope, and of course love. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If you asked me a couple months or even years ago if I wanted to record some of my music my answer would've been yes. The reason I've decided to actually take the leap and record my songs now is for a couple reasons. </span><br/></p>
<p><b>1. I Love Music</b></p>
<p>It's a pretty simple answer. I've been playing music for over 10 years now. Studied with Berklee College of Music. I love what music does, how it moves people and inspires people. I don't know what my life would be like without music. </p>
<p><b>2. It's A Challenge </b></p>
<p>I love a good challenge. It stretches me and is a place where I can grow. I have to open and vulnerable, which isn't always easy. But you get to see some pretty amazing things come from those challenges and nobody wants to regret never taking the chance.</p>
<p><b>3. Why Not?</b></p>
<p>Really, why not? What difference does it make. Recording and EP is and will most likely never be a cheap thing to do. Especially if you are like me and are really picky about how you like things to sound and will never be satisfied if you trying doing it by yourself. So I am doing it now, because why not?</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Below is the budget I made to see how much I would need to raise to make this EP become a reality. I've also decided to include the prices for the CD Release Show. Because I would love for all my supporters to be able to come out and hear/see what they helped create. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451580575/kmfn9yty6y6wot8jsyub.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>If my goal isn't reached my funds first and foremost will be to pay for the recording and for the musicians because without them I won't have anything to give people. After that it will go to indiegogo fees, getting everyone their rewards and the shipping costs of different items. </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I'll be honest I'm not a rich man. I'm a missionary/non-profit worker. So I don't get paid. I live off the support of people like you. Friends and Family. <span>This album isn't going to be something I'll be able to live off of for sure. But my hope is that it will help me enjoy the smaller things in life. Also that who ever listens to the album will be able to enjoy the moments they have while listening to it. </span></p>
<p><span>I also hope that the stories and messages of the songs are ones that people can relate to. Ones that can help them through hard times, or, enjoy the good times. So if my songs can have an impact. I want people to be able to hear them. <span><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span><br/></span></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There will probably be some challenges I can see running into in the making of this album would be time. The fact that the studio is located in a really big house, with lots of people in it, with students in classes during the day and babies sleeping in the evening. Being loud isn't always allowed/appropriate. </p>
<p>As I've been talking with my friend who is helping produce the EP. We are talking about doing some of the recording else where. Allowing us to record some of the loud instruments when we want and for however long we need to. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help<br/>
</h3>
<div>If you aren't able to help out financially. I understand. If you still want  to contribute in another way. Sharing via social media is always a huge help. Just let your friends know about it.</div>
<div>If you have ideas or questions about how you can help out feel free to contact me via e-mail or through social media. </div>

</div><div>
<div>Ladyfest Atlanta intends to precipitate critical dialogue around gender-centered oppression especially as it relates to the arts and other cultural institutions. Additionally, it facilitates access to larger local platforms, helps sustain relationships between the artists and the
community, and encourages introductions and relationships between artists. For example, last year we noticed that
many of the folks who played at Ladyfest who had never even been to Mammal, Eyedrum or the Big House on
Ponce worked with those venues again and played with other folks they’d never played with before in the
following months.<br/>

been full of challenges for our team, and we remain focused and have faith in
the future with your support. With this initial support campaign, we are
planning the following throughout next year (2016):
Intensify our
presence on the continent and elsewhere in the world, increasing the number of
our correspondents;
Improve our audiovisual
content with the upcoming launch of a video platform, and a better reflection
with social media tools.


Over the past years,
many of you have requested to find out how to contribute to keep the flame of
this project burning. The time has come for action, with a minimum contribution
of $ 10.
Should you have
questions or need further details, please feel free to reach us at info@cameroonvoice.com
Thank you in
advance for your nice burst of generosity. May we use this opportunity to wish
you and yours a wonderful holiday season, despite the difficult security
situation we are experiencing, as well as a beautiful and happy 2016.
Best as ever,

<h3>My Journey &amp; My Dream</h3> <p>A couple of years ago, I graduated from College and ran full force into a brick wall of quarter life crisis. </p>
<p>I could spend hours telling this story, but I won't dig into all of it here. My plans for myself weren't coming together as I had thought, and I began a season of being lost and confused. Trying to find myself while wondering aimlessly proved to be exhausting. This was my journey west. I recorded a low budget EP at home (Thanks to some dear friends who believed in me more than I believed in myself), and flew out to Los Angeles with two suitcases and a dream. Caught somewhere between courage and insanity, I spent the next couple of years barely surviving. I was healing a fresh batch of scars from being hurt and fighting to survive, as well as unpacking the copious amounts of new and fun emotional baggage that a bold move to a big city alone will give you. </p>
<p>I found healing in my music. Every song that I wrote helped me to unpack my burdens and tend to my wounds. The songs that I wrote brought me life, and I now I want to share them with you. </p>
<p>You guys, I'm so excited sitting here typing this that I'm grinning from ear to ear. This is it. This is my chance to really do something. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This will be my Debut full length album. More importantly, this album is me choosing to face my fears. It's time to stop hiding and run full force, with everything that I have, away from my comfort zone, opening my heart to whatever comes of it. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Your contribution will mean the difference between me putting out mediocre demos for the next few years until I can afford to fund a decent album myself, and creating an album right now that is fresh with the raw energy and emotion of moving out to Los Angeles.

<p>I'm not doing this lightly. I've been meticulously planning this project for over a year, doing the best that I can with my own funds. I'm functioning as my own record label. I've got a plan in motion; I just need the resources to grease the wheels. </p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p>My greatest challenge is that I am not a great producer. I've been trying to produce myself for over a year now, and I feel that I would be doing you a disservice by sharing a mediocre version of my songs with you. </p>I want to give you the best possible music that I can create, and that takes resources.
