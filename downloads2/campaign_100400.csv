<h2>A memory foam mattress for your skull.</h2>
<p>We are not like other travel pillows. Firstly, we don't look like those life preservers or balloons around your head. Our patented design is 80% smaller making it the world's smallest. And unlike most travel pillows that rely on beads or foam for support, our medical engineers developed a patented suspension frame, that works by supporting your occiput against your trapezius. Furthermore, it's designed and endorsed by chiropractors to keep you in correct alignment as you sleep.</p>

<h2>Select your flying position with our quick-flip system.</h2>
<p>One of the biggest learnings we garnered was that people like to manipulate their sleeping position during flight. Simple, right. So we engineered a system that allows the user to select a more upright or a more reclined position. Simply place the + sign up for an upright position (less recline) or the - sign up for more recline.</p>

<h2>Integrated strap-system.</h2>
<p>Wait, you didn't want your fancy travel pillow you put up near your face, to mingle on the floor with the shoes of the passenger sitting directly behind you? Fair enough. We heard you. So we designed an integrated adjustable strap system that allows you to easily clip the strap to the system hooks on the outer collar of the product.</p>

<h2>Use anywhere, anytime.</h2>
<p>First and foremost, we engineer our equipment to function bio-mechanically. That means that whether on the road, or at home, the bullbird travel pillow is perfect for any activity where you would like to rest seated.

<h2>Lifetime guarantee.</h2>
<p>Tired of all the BS you have to navigate when you travel? From ever-shrinking seats, to inflated bag fees, let alone the joys of TSA, we were tired with having to suffer through another cross-country red-eye.

Unlike most travel accessories that offer only short term relief, our equipment is purposefully engineered to address the pain-points and BS we endure with modern day travel. It's also why everything we make comes with a lifetime guarantee.</p>

<p>It costs us, but we know the last thing you want to pay for is shipping. It's like those excess bag fees for being a 1lb over at check in.

<p>Making new stuff can be like traveling on stand-by. It often isn't easy. We have left no stone un-turned in developing our new product, and thus we need your help getting to production.

We help you by providing the first access to the new + improved bullbird, for an incredible discount. And you help us by getting to production.</p>
<p>The skinny, is that we need to cover new molds, new high-performance materials, new patents and the like, but even just $5000 will help cover some costs to get us to the next stage of production. Every little bit helps.</p>

</p><p><b>Fit
to Recover is about building a support system around exercise and outdoor
activities for people who both struggle and celebrate during the process of recovery. And, WE DID IT! The FTR sober gym found a place in Salt Lake City and will open late in 2014. Follow us at <a href=""http:..fit2recover.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://fit2recover.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://fit2recover.com</a>, believe in us, and join us. AND ALL WHO DONATED TO OUR CAMPAIGN, THANK YOU!<br/></b></p>
<p>My name is Ian Acker, and I’ve had this dream to build a place
where people in recovery can go to find active, healing activities in a not-for-profit sober
gym in Salt Lake City. This dream has kept me awake, and kept me going, for
more than two years. I wake up every morning to a five-mile run. It hurts, but
it is key to maintaining my recovery, now in its third year. My friend, Charlie Seifert, manages and plays on our sober softball and
volleyball teams. Lacey Garcia is the head of our expanding women’s program and Robert Shaffer is our Lead Fitness Coordinator. Our
community works together, and as a community just earned 501(c)3 status. We ARE Fit to Recover, and here is how we could use your help.</p>
<p>Salt Lake gets cold in the winter and sometimes in the
summer it rains. Our Indiegogo campaign will put a permanent “roof over our
heads,” a leased building to serve as a meeting place, indoor gym, and creative
music studio to serve those in recovery. The video tells Fit to Recover’s story
and that of several of our community members. You’ll see a snapshot of the
hills our community has climbed and the more than 2,000 hours we’ve shared
keeping our spirits and endorphins high together.</p>
<p><b>Does
it Work?</b><span>  You bet, but
you have to stick with your exercise program and maintain a journal that
celebrates another day in recovery. The National Institutes of Health has
funded research that shows the positive effects of exercise on maintaining
recovery.</span></p>
<p><b>Does
it Matter to you?</b> If you’ve read this far, you may be
one of 23 million Americans who is maintaining recovery and knows the
importance of a community of support. Maintaining recovery is a mental and
physical state you, and your friends and family, should be very proud of. We
believe your personal experiences substantiate the empirical evidence of the
benefits of Exercising Recovery.</p>
<p><b>Does
it matter to others?</b> The social cost of substance misuse is
estimated to be over $300 billion dollars per year. Maintaining recovery
reduces these social costs and increases employment, reduces crime, engages
more community involvement, and adds to health and happiness.</p>
<p><b>It
matters to Fit To Recover</b>. Please help us help our Salt Lake

to Recover is about building a support system around exercise and outdoor
activities for people who both struggle and celebrate during the process of recovery. And, WE DID IT! The FTR sober gym found a place in Salt Lake City and will open late in 2014. Follow us at http://fit2recover.com, believe in us, and join us. AND ALL WHO DONATED TO OUR CAMPAIGN, THANK YOU!
My name is Ian Acker, and I’ve had this dream to build a place
where people in recovery can go to find active, healing activities in a not-for-profit sober
gym in Salt Lake City. This dream has kept me awake, and kept me going, for
more than two years. I wake up every morning to a five-mile run. It hurts, but
it is key to maintaining my recovery, now in its third year. My friend, Charlie Seifert, manages and plays on our sober softball and
volleyball teams. Lacey Garcia is the head of our expanding women’s program and Robert Shaffer is our Lead Fitness Coordinator. Our
community works together, and as a community just earned 501(c)3 status. We ARE Fit to Recover, and here is how we could use your help.
Salt Lake gets cold in the winter and sometimes in the
summer it rains. Our Indiegogo campaign will put a permanent “roof over our
heads,” a leased building to serve as a meeting place, indoor gym, and creative
music studio to serve those in recovery. The video tells Fit to Recover’s story
and that of several of our community members. You’ll see a snapshot of the
hills our community has climbed and the more than 2,000 hours we’ve shared
keeping our spirits and endorphins high together.
Does
it Work?  You bet, but
you have to stick with your exercise program and maintain a journal that
celebrates another day in recovery. The National Institutes of Health has
funded research that shows the positive effects of exercise on maintaining
recovery.
Does
it Matter to you? If you’ve read this far, you may be
one of 23 million Americans who is maintaining recovery and knows the
importance of a community of support. Maintaining recovery is a mental and
physical state you, and your friends and family, should be very proud of. We
believe your personal experiences substantiate the empirical evidence of the
benefits of Exercising Recovery.
Does
it matter to others? The social cost of substance misuse is
estimated to be over $300 billion dollars per year. Maintaining recovery
reduces these social costs and increases employment, reduces crime, engages
more community involvement, and adds to health and happiness.
It
matters to Fit To Recover. Please help us help our Salt Lake
City community build a year-round, not-for-profit sober gym. $50,000 will put a roof over our heads and let us build and
share a model of exercise, creative expression and community support that can
be replicated within the state and across the nation.Meet some of the FTR Community (click this link)",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong><u>T<u>h</u>e Story so Far</u></strong></p>
<p>In 2017 the Sea took our partner ship, the sailing boat Bojangles, in a huge storm. Unfortunately, Bojangles was equipped with all the navigation equipment: Sonar, Radar, GPS, Auxiliar boat, satellite telephone, autopilot, EPIRB,... and irreparably damaged by sea water. </p>
<p><br/>The surviving boat (Corb Mari II) is now missing the advanced electrical equipment that was on the Bojangles. We are asking for contributions to replace equipment lost on the Bojangles and equip the Corb Mari II with the full nautical equipment, ready for 2018. This technology will improved navigation and provide audiovisual support to explore our coastal regions and the seabed.</p>
<p>Contributions will go towards: depth probe, GPS, Radar, EPIRB, upgrade H &amp; S in the boat, subaquatic drone, Gel Battery and Columbretes Island documentary. </p>
<p>In exchange, we offer you the opportunity to join the association, the Odisea, and travel aboard the Corb Mari II, discovering the local marine life. You have the chance to see the difference your donation would make first hand. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>The Association</u></strong></p>
<p>ODISEA VELA TRADICIONAL (the association) has been created to promote marine biology studies, cooperating with universities and organisations, in scientific research and studies.</p>
<p>Vela Tradicional is a badge of non-polluting navigation. It provides a media platform dedicated to the production and dissemination of presentations and videos. These then are used for educational purposes, providing information on the changes within our seas.</p>
<p>Our aim is to cultivate a lifelong interest in navigation and respect for the marine environment. ODISEA is a place for restlessness, and discovery. A place to learn and perfect navigation skills, while respecting our oceans. We want to reach as many people as possible interested in sustainable navigation and conservation of the marine environment. We hope that you will join us. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>What we offer in return</u></strong></p>
<p>We have created a series of activities around the Balearic Islands, East of the Iberian Peninsula and the Canary Islands, starting from the Island of Ibiza. Your contributions will allow you the chance to take part in one of these journeys, for a length of time that suits you; </p>
<p><i><strong>Route of Posidonia - 1 x days (Cabin Boy)</strong></i><br/>This route crosses from Salinas to Formentera and back in which you will be able to enjoy the beautiful marine life within the great prairies of Posidonia.</p>
<p><i><strong>Route of the Lighthouses - 2 x days or 5 x days (Cabin Boy)</strong></i><br/><u>2 x Days:</u> a round trip, starting from the south of Ibiza journeying up to the breathtaking Formentera. The trip includes visiting the caves of the west of Formentera and spending a night sleeping on board the boat, underneath the Mediterranian stars.</p>
<p><u>5 x Days</u>: Circular to the Pitusas (Ibiza and Formentera), a full trip journeying around the coasts of the islands, visiting the historic lighthouses. This trip includes an overnight navigation by starlight.</p>
<p><i><strong>Route Columbretes - 4 x days (Cabin Boy)</strong></i></p>
<p>Between the north of Ibiza and Valencia you find these small uninhabited islands. For millennia these were the haunts of pirates and outcasts, lands ignored by one and all. In the 19th century snakes infested the uninhabited islands, until later in the same century a lighthouse was built. Overtime, this then attracted a community of fishermen who hunted all the snakes until extinction. The islands no longer have permanent residents, but their stories remain in the land. The main island is ""C"" shaped, striated with dark zigzag lines, on bright yellow earth.</p>
<p>On this route we will sleep on board the Corb Mari II, anchored in the beautiful cove of L'ilia Grossa.</p>
<p><br/><i><strong>Route of Salt - 7 x days (Sea Wolf)</strong></i></p>
<p>This is a circular route where we travel around the Balearic Islands; Ibiza, Formentera, Mallorca, Cabrera and Menorca. On this route you can enjoy the beauty of the panoramic views of all five of the islands.</p>
<p><i><strong>Route of the Alisios - 14 x days (Sea Wolf / Pirate - expert)</strong></i></p>
<p>Leaving the Balearic Islands, on this journey we travel across the mediterranian sea to the Canary Islands. On this route, we will cross the Strait of Gibraltar, passing from the Mediterranean Sea to the Alboran Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, sailing along the South East coast of the peninsula and the North West coast of Africa.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>Contribution Breakdown</u></strong></p>
<p>To sail aboard the historic and artisanal sailing vessel 'Corb Mari II', your minimal contribution of €20 will buy you a yearly membership to the association. Being a member, you will receive emails with news of the latest experiences, adventures and departures for each month. As well as news, we will also publicise the availability of other members to fill the boat with at least 4 association members on all departures. </p>
<p><br/>With this membership you will then be able to choose the amount of days to spend aboard the Corb Mari, in correlation with your contribution. </p>
<p>Our recommendation is to sign up for complete routes, since the experience of living on board is part of the experience of the Corb Mari life. Day trips offer the experience of sailing, driven by the Mediterrainian wind in picturesque surroundings. Trips covering two days or more offer the soft rocking of sleeping overnight on board, either in the open sea or in one of the many calas or beaches en route.</p>
<p>As part of the trips you will be able to discover some of the species that inhabit the seabed of the Mediterranean, in which more than 17000 are registered. These include; microorganisms, crustaceans, molluscs, annelids, vertebrates, tunicates, echinoderms, invertebrates and plants, to name a few. Among them, the fields of Posidonia, known as Neptune Grass, constitute an ecosystem by themselves.</p>
<p>Mammals that live in the Mediterrainian include the bottlenose dolphin, Cuvier's whale, Common whale (whale), Common calderon, Gray calderon, Common dolphin, Sperm whale, listed dolphin, and Orca (Gibraltar area). Some of the other sea life in the Mediterranean Sea include: Mullet, Sardina, Tintorera, Sea Fox, Bullfish, Bishopfish, Hammerfish, Swordfish, Brown, Grouper, Manta and Esturió.</p>
<p>Any help towards our association would be hugely appreciated. We hope that what we are offering gives contributors a real chance to assist, while in return experiencing a unique opportunity to learn about our seas. Please feel free to spread the word, to those who may be interested in becoming part of the story of the Corb Mari. </p>

Overtime, this then attracted a community of fishermen who hunted all the snakes until extinction. The islands no longer have permanent residents, but their stories remain in the land. The main island is ""C"" shaped, striated with dark zigzag lines, on bright yellow earth.
On this route we will sleep on board the Corb Mari II, anchored in the beautiful cove of L'ilia Grossa.
Route of Salt - 7 x days (Sea Wolf)
This is a circular route where we travel around the Balearic Islands; Ibiza, Formentera, Mallorca, Cabrera and Menorca. On this route you can enjoy the beauty of the panoramic views of all five of the islands.
Route of the Alisios - 14 x days (Sea Wolf / Pirate - expert)
Leaving the Balearic Islands, on this journey we travel across the mediterranian sea to the Canary Islands. On this route, we will cross the Strait of Gibraltar, passing from the Mediterranean Sea to the Alboran Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, sailing along the South East coast of the peninsula and the North West coast of Africa.
 
Contribution Breakdown
To sail aboard the historic and artisanal sailing vessel 'Corb Mari II', your minimal contribution of €20 will buy you a yearly membership to the association. Being a member, you will receive emails with news of the latest experiences, adventures and departures for each month. As well as news, we will also publicise the availability of other members to fill the boat with at least 4 association members on all departures. 
With this membership you will then be able to choose the amount of days to spend aboard the Corb Mari, in correlation with your contribution. 
Our recommendation is to sign up for complete routes, since the experience of living on board is part of the experience of the Corb Mari life. Day trips offer the experience of sailing, driven by the Mediterrainian wind in picturesque surroundings. Trips covering two days or more offer the soft rocking of sleeping overnight on board, either in the open sea or in one of the many calas or beaches en route.
As part of the trips you will be able to discover some of the species that inhabit the seabed of the Mediterranean, in which more than 17000 are registered. These include; microorganisms, crustaceans, molluscs, annelids, vertebrates, tunicates, echinoderms, invertebrates and plants, to name a few. Among them, the fields of Posidonia, known as Neptune Grass, constitute an ecosystem by themselves.
Mammals that live in the Mediterrainian include the bottlenose dolphin, Cuvier's whale, Common whale (whale), Common calderon, Gray calderon, Common dolphin, Sperm whale, listed dolphin, and Orca (Gibraltar area). Some of the other sea life in the Mediterranean Sea include: Mullet, Sardina, Tintorera, Sea Fox, Bullfish, Bishopfish, Hammerfish, Swordfish, Brown, Grouper, Manta and Esturió.
Any help towards our association would be hugely appreciated. We hope that what we are offering gives contributors a real chance to assist, while in return experiencing a unique opportunity to learn about our seas. Please feel free to spread the word, to those who may be interested in becoming part of the story of the Corb Mari.

An immersive experience of the tropical environment from the comfort of architecturally designed, biophilic living spaces, evoking a deep sense of well-being in the natural world. POSITIVE CHANGESToday 11% of global CO2 emissions are a result of the manufacturing of building materials; cement, steel, glass, and the transportation of those materials. By choosing to design our eco-hotel with low carbon, locally sourced materials like bamboo, clay and grass, we have the power to generate positive changes in our built environment, and in tourism trends. We are looking well into the future at the full lifecycle of the material choices we make today, making responsible decisions from the ground up.   SRI LANKAN BAMBOODespite Sri Lanka having the perfect climate to grow bamboo UNA will be the first time a construction project of this scale will be carried out in the country using native bamboo.There is a lot of excitement for bamboo as a construction material, from seasoned architects and contractors, to young hoteliers and graduate engineers, and we have been building our Sri Lankan bamboo community at every step.This forward-thinking community know and have seen the possibilities and the beauty of bamboo as a renewable building material, and they are ready to explore Sri Lanka’s bamboo potential. Together, we want to showcase the possibilities.  SHOWCASING THE POTENTIAL OF BAMBOO IN SRI LANKANot only will all of our buildings be built entirely from bamboo by a Sri Lankan team of carpenters, the bamboo will also be sourced, treated and processed locally. This creates jobs all along the supply chain, from cultivation, harvesting and transporting to treating the bamboo. Job creation in an industry that is environmentally friendly. Win, win!We hope UNA will inspire others to make more sustainable building choices, looking to materials that are available locally to make beautiful structures, so we can grow and develop in a more responsible way.   COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITYBesides using low carbon materials to build our eco-hotel we have a few more plans for how we can minimize our impact on the natural environment, as well as the local community. Below is a list of the simple solutions we plan to implement to further reduce the carbon footprint of UNA and fulfill our sustainability goals:  Asanga from Permaculture Network Sri Lanka on site at UNA TIMELINEOUR VISIONMore than simply crossing items off a bucket list, the vision for UNA has always been an inclusive place of safe haven where guests can feel at home, part of a community, welcomed, and inspired.We also wanted the space to influence more meaningful connections to the natural world in a very tangible and tactile way, through the material quality of the living space, as well as the openness of that space to the natural surroundings, without compromising on comfort. Overall we believe that these types of dynamic living environments contribute intrinsically to better health and well-being. Living Organisms  ""Making the micro cosmos accessible to humans where the buildings are composed from giant cells clustered functionally together."" THE MASTERPLANWe intend to move purposefully through the masterplan, which has been broken into three phases with the first phase due to commence in early 2021.Upon completion the fruit-filled site will include: 6 naturally ventilated, en-suite bamboo villas, a large bamboo hall with a central courtyard housing a restaurant and lounge, a studio pavilion where resident artists can create, or long term guests can work from home, and a small, secluded yoga shala nested amongst the rice paddies. A pool will be planted within the curves of the land to complete the experience.The surrounding grounds will be cultivated as a permaculture homegarden to provide food for the garden to table restaurant. Architectural drawings of en-suite bamboo villa with fishnet balcony Naturally ventilated, biophilic living space with views over the rice paddies Architectural drawings of the main bamboo pavilion with internal courtyard and adjoining kitchen The main bamboo pavilion housing a restaurant and lounge, with views to the garden and rice paddiesArchitectural drawings of the bamboo studio pavilion with adobe clay screens A biophilic work space in the bamboo studio pavilion, an adaptable space that can change with the seasonsArchitectural drawings of the bamboo yoga/meditation shala The yoga/meditation shala accessible by bridge and nestled amongst the rice paddy THE ARCHITECTSNomadic Resorts hardly need any introduction. They are an international design firm known for organic structures that seamlessly integrate with their surrounding environment, and a holistic approach to design, specializing in “sustainable architecture, contemporary bamboo construction, treetop living concepts and tensile membrane design”.They are the recipients of a long list of architectural and design awards, including in most recent years IFI Design Distinction Award for Sustainability in 2020, Architecture Masterprize for Hospitality Architecture in 2019 and UNESCO’s Prix Versailles for best restaurant design in 2018, as well as their designs being named among the top hotels in the world on such shortlists as the Conde Nast’s Hotlist and Tatler’s Most Glamorous Eco-Hotels in the World, to name just a few.Given the firms expertise in bamboo construction, as well as their strong connection to Sri Lanka (they spent two years here working on the incredible Wild Coast Tented Lodge in Yala National Park during which time they trained a whole village of fishermen to work with bamboo) we approached the firm in late 2019 with our biophilic, bamboo eco-hotel concept. We can’t thank them enough for believing in our vision, and helping us bring it to life and beyond our wildest imagination; A geometric, paraboloid dream! THE LOCATIONThe site of our project is a lush, fruit-filled plot of land at approximately 5km inland from the village of Ahangama, a hop and a skip from the main road and through the emerald green rice paddies. Strategically positioned at close proximity to the highway we are just a little over 2 hours from Colombo International Airport, and a short 20km from the famous UNESCO Heritage Site of Galle Fort.  Ahangama, located between the better-known beach destinations of Weligama and Unuwatuna, is an ""up-and-coming"" tourist destination on the south coast, known for its pristine beaches, wide choice of surf spots, laid back vibe and of course its famous stick fishermen. Over the last few years Ahangama has become the go-to destination for the more discerning traveler, with a growing number of boutique villa and café and restaurant offerings appearing every year. Less full moon beach party vibe, more an eclectic, mellow gathering kinda spot. OUR CLIENTELEOnce we are up and running and filled with life, we hope to attract people from diverse cultures, backgrounds and generations to experience and explore sustainable, biophilic, bamboo living in the tropics. UNA will be home to those seeking meaningful travel experiences immersed in nature, whether you're flying solo or with family.HOW IT WORKSWe've been working hard over the last 15 months to get everything in place to begin construction, launching our company, ""Una Bambu"", and securing the land. Of course this involved lengthy legal and planning procedures.We’re delighted to confirm that we've been given the green light from the tourism, environmental, urban development and local authorities to build our bamboo eco-hotel!Now, we want you to join the fun and help us bring UNA to life in 2021!  READY TO GOWe have broken the masterplan into three phases as follows:Phase 1: all ground work, 2 bamboo villas, a large bamboo pavilion housing a lounge, restaurant and adjoining kitchen, and a back of house facility.Phase 2: 2 bamboo villas, a bamboo studio, and a swimming pool.Phase 3: 2 bamboo villas and a yoga/meditation shala.Your support will help us realise Phase 1 of construction ahead of our opening in November 2021. We will also begin to plant our permaculture homegarden during this phase.Should we reach our stretch targets, we will expand Phase 1 to include the swimming pool (a priority in the tropical heat!) and one more guest villa. Of course the more support we receive the more we can expand on Phase 1, to offer even more to our first ever guests in what is sure to be a most memorable post-pandemic holiday in the eco-hotel you helped to build.  THE PERKSContribute to building one of our luxury bamboo villas by becoming a ""Friend of UNA"", or make your mark on the land forever by planting a tree. Even better, why not book a fully flexible stay with us at a discounted rate and be one of the first guests of UNA when the time is right for travel again? Whether it’s for two nights, or you want to move in with us for one month, we will be ready and waiting to welcome you any time over the next 3-5 years* as our most VIP guests.*from date of openingDon't forget you can also back the project for any amount without purchasing a perk. Simply click ""Back It"" (desktop) or ""Make a contribution"" (mobile) at the top of the page!If you have any questions that aren't covered in the FAQs section please reach out to us at indiegogo@unabambu.com.  OTHER WAYS TO HELPWe're painfully aware that we're looking for support in difficult and uncertain times for many, and we know that booking a holiday for the future is just not realistic for everyone. If you would like to contribute in other ways to help us reach our goal simply follow us on Instagram, Facebook or LinkedIn, share and like our posts or sign up to our mailing list. Every little helps!THE CHALLENGESThere are no dedicated bamboo plantations in Sri Lanka, so bamboo is being harvested “wild”, from back garden plots to larger estates. This makes sourcing and harvesting bamboo more difficult.   Another challenge will be the training of our local construction team to work with bamboo. Sri Lanka has many skilled carpenters and craftspeople throughout the country, however bamboo requires a particular set of skills, and a level of flexibility and patience in working with it as a building material. For this reason we have sought out only the most passionate people to train with us.We have been so determined to make this project a reality in Sri Lanka without the need to import bamboo (or bamboo carpenters) that we have persevered in overcoming these challenges, armed with the knowledge and support we have received from our global bamboo network.Finally, even the best laid construction plans can hit unexpected road blocks, so how we handle and overcome any potential delays will be crucial in ensuring that we reach our goal of an opening date in November 2021. THE TEAMTired of seeing busy tourist coastlines being destroyed by concrete high-rises, UNA founders Julien Bailly & Aoife O’Sullivan set out in search of an alternative. They set up their company Una Bambu in 2019. Aoife & Julien on Pulau Perhentian Kecil, Malaysia, 2015A bamboo intensive training course in Indonesia followed, where they soaked up everything there was to learn about cultivating and building with this ancient grass. They bring to UNA a diverse set of skills from their professional backgrounds. Photo © Soben Giordan -Training at Bamboo U, Bali, Indonesia, 2019 Julien has worked internationally in business management and digital marketing across Australia, APAC, Ireland and Europe. During that time he lead a multitude of international promotional campaigns, developed marketing strategies and lead teams in a project management capacity. Julien is also a passionate photographer and keen surfer.Aoife has worked in the creative industries across Australia, the UK and Ireland, including roles in client relations, account management and intellectual property rights. Since graduating with a BA in Design for Film & Theater in 2013 Aoife has continued to develop her personal design language through sculpture, photography and digital formats. UNAVivre ​ResponsableUn nouveau genre d'éco-hôtel sur la côte sud du Sri Lanka; ​ conçu avec la nature et la communauté au cœur du projet. Une expérience immersive dans un environnement tropical, dans le confort d'espaces de vie biophiliques. Une destination qui évoque un profond sentiment de bien-être dans le monde naturel. CHANGEMENTS POSITIFSAujourd'hui, 11% des émissions mondiales de CO2 sont le résultat de la fabrication des ​ matériaux de construction comme ​le ciment, l'acier, le verre ​ainsi que du transport de ces matériaux. En choisissant de concevoir notre éco-hôtel avec des matériaux à faible émission de carbone et d'origine locale comme le bambou, l'argile et l'herbe, nous avons le pouvoir de générer des changements positifs dans notre environnement et dans les tendances touristiques.   LE BAMBOU SRI LANKAISBien que le Sri Lanka ait le climat idéal pour la culture du bambou, UNA est le premier projet du genre dans le pays, utilisant uniquement du bambou traité de source locale.Il n'y a pas de ​marque ​d'intérêt ou d'enthousiasme pour ​ce ​matériau. Nous construisons ​ donc ​ notre communauté autour du bambou au Sri Lanka à chaque étape.Cette communauté avant-gardiste est prête à en explorer tout son potentiel.  Ensemble, nous voulons en ​ démontrer ​ les possibilités quasi infinies.  METTRE EN VALEUR LE POTENTIAL DU BAMBOU SRI-LANKAISNon seulement tous nos bâtiments seront entièrement construits en bambou par une équipe de charpentiers sri-lankais, dont beaucoup seront formés pour travailler le bambou pour la première fois. Le bambou sera également approvisionné, traité et transformé localement. Cela crée des emplois tout au long de la chaîne d'approvisionnement, de la culture ​au traitement ​. Nous aidons à la création d'emplois dans une industrie respectueuse de l'environnement. C’est ce qu’on appelle du gagnant gagnant!C'est la première fois qu'un projet de construction en bambou de cette envergure  sera réalisé dans le pays en utilisant du bambou provenant de l'île. Nous espérons  qu’UNA continuera à inspirer les autres à faire des choix de construction plus durables, et qu'à son tour, plus de Sri Lankais apprendront à travailler avec du bambou et développeront ​ cette ​ industrie.Nous sommes convaincus que le bambou nous permettra de grandir et de nous  développer de manière responsible.   NOTRE ENGAGEMENT POUR LE DEVELOPPEMENT DURABLEEn plus d'utiliser des matériaux à faible teneur en carbone pour construire notre  éco-hôtel, nous avons quelques idées supplémentaires dans notre manche sur la façon dont nous pouvons minimiser notre impact sur l'environnement naturel, ainsi que sur la communauté locale. Vous trouverez ci-dessous une liste des mesures simples et low-tech que nous prendrons pour réduire davantage l'empreinte carbone d’UNA:   Asanga du Permaculture Network Sri Lanka sur place à l'UNA LE CALENDRIERNOTRE VISIONNotre vision pour UNA a toujours été un lieu de havre de paix où nos clients peuvent se sentir chez eux, faire partie d'une communauté, accueillis et inspirés. Un endroit à part pour se sentir bien. Nous voulions également créer un lieu qui inspire des connexions plus significatives avec le monde naturel d'une manière très tangible et tactile, à travers la qualité matérielle du cadre de vie et à travers la nature environnante.Lorsque nous avons conçu les bâtiments, nous savions que nous devions donner vie à cet espace de manière responsable, sans compromettre le style ou le confort. Les Organismes Vivants  ""Rendre le micro cosmos accessible aux humains où les bâtiments sont composés  de cellules géantes regroupées fonctionnellement.""  NOTRE PLAN DE DÉVELOPPEMENTNous avons l'intention de progresser lentement dans la construction qui a été divisé en trois phases, la première phase devant commencer au début de 2021.Une fois terminée, notre parcelle  de jungle comprendra 6 villas en bambou avec salle de bains, ventilées  naturellement, un grand bâtiment en bambou avec une cour centrale abritant un  restaurant et un salon, un pavillon où les artistes résidents peuvent créer, ou les  clients à long terme peuvent ​ travailler ​ à domicile, et un petit yoga shala isolé, niché  au milieu des ​ rizières.Le terrain sera cultivé comme jardin potager en permaculture  pour fournir notre restaurant. Avec une piscine ​ logée ​ dans les courbes de la terre  pour compléter l'expérience, UNA est notre rêve de vivre en communauté. Dessins d'architecture d'une villa en bambou avec salle de bains privative ​et ​balcon ​Espace de vie biophilique, aéré naturellement avec vue sur les rizièresDessins architecturaux du pavillon principal en bambou avec cour intérieure et  cuisine attenante Le pavillon principal en bambou abritant un restaurant et un salon, avec vue sur le  jardin et les rizières Dessins d'architecture du pavillon studio en bambou avec murs en argile Un espace de travail biophilique dans le pavillon studio en bambou, un espace  adaptable qui peut évoluer au gré des saisons Dessins d'architecture du Yoga Shala Le yoga shala accessible par pont et niché au milieu des rizières LES ARCHITECTESNomadic Resorts ​n'a guère besoin d'être présenté. Il s'agit d'une entreprise de design internationale connue pour ses structures organiques qui s'intègrent  parfaitement à leur environnement, et une approche holistique du design, spécialisée dans «l'architecture durable et la construction contemporaine en bambou.Ils ont reçu une longue liste de prix d'architecture et de design, y compris ces dernières années le Prix de distinction IFI Design pour la durabilité en 2020, le Masterprize d'architecture pour l'architecture hôtelière en 2019 et le Prix Versailles de l'UNESCO pour le meilleur design de restaurant en 2018. Ainsi leur designs sont nommés parmi les meilleurs hôtels du monde sur des listes restreintes telles que la  Hotlist de Conde Nast et les éco-hôtels les plus glamour du monde de Tatler, pour n'en nommer que quelques-uns.Compte tenu de l'expérience de cette entreprise en matière de conception utilisant le bambou, ainsi que de leur lien étroit avec le Sri Lanka (ils ont passé deux ans ici à  travailler sur l'incroyable Wild Coast Tented Lodge dans le parc national de Yala, période pendant laquelle ils ont formé tout un village de pêcheurs à travailler avec le  bambou), nous avons contacté l'entreprise fin 2019 avec notre concept d'éco-hôtel en bambou biophilique. Nous ne pouvons pas assez les remercier d’avoir cru en notre vision, et de nous aider à la concrétiser au-delà de notre imagination la plus folle. Un rêve géométrique, inspiré par la nature!   OU NOUS TROUVERLe site de notre projet est une parcelle de terrain luxuriante à environ 5 km à  l'intérieur des terres du village d'Ahangama, à travers les rizières vert émeraude. Positionné stratégiquement à proximité de l'autoroute, nous sommes à un peu plus de 2 heures de l'aéroport international de Colombo et à 20 km du célèbre site de Galle Fort, inscrit sur la liste ​au patrimoine de l'UNESCO.   Le village d’Ahangama est situé entre les destinations balnéaires plus connues de  Weligama, Mirissa et Unawatuna. C’est une zone touristique en plein essor sur la côte sud, connue pour ses plages de sable blanc, son large choix de spots de surf, son ambiance décontractée et bien sûr ​ses ​célèbres pêcheurs perchés sur leurs bâtons. Au cours des dernières années, Ahangama est devenue la destination de choix pour les voyageurs les plus exigeants, avec un nombre croissant d'offres de villas, de cafés et de restaurants qui ​apparaissent ​chaque année.  QUEL EST LE CŒUR DE NOTRE ​ CLIENTÈLENous voulons offrir un havre de paix où se ressourcer, régénérer le cœur et le corps.Nous visons à offrir une expérience unique, une immersion dans la culture sri lankaise et des échanges relationnels harmonieux pour les voyageurs soucieux de respecter la nature.Nous sommes impatients d'accueillir les explorateurs cherchant à se reconnecter avec la nature et la communauté locale. UNA accueillera ceux qui recherchent une expérience nature, dans un environnement luxuriant, que vous soyez seul ou en famille. COMMENT  PARTICIPER A L’AVENTURENous avons travaillé d’arrache-pied au cours de ces 15 derniers mois pour tout  mettre en place prévoir la construction, lancer notre société ""Una Bambu"", et sécuriser le terrain. Bien sûr, cela a impliqué de longues procédures légales, de la  planification..Nous sommes ravis d’annoncer que nous avons ​enfin ​reçu le feu vert de l’autorité  du tourisme, de l’autorité de protection de l’environnement, du développement urbain et des autorités locales pour construire notre éco-hôtel en bambou!Maintenant, nous voulons que vous vous joigniez à la fête et que vous nous aidiez à donner vie à UNA!  NOTRE PLAN, PHASE PAR PHASENous avons divisé le plan directeur en trois phases comme suit:Phase 1: tous les travaux de terrassement, 2 villas en bambou, le grand pavillon en  bambou abritant un salon, un restaurant et une cuisine attenante.Phase 2: 2 villas en bambou, un studio en bambou et la piscine d’eau ​ salée ​.Phase 3: 2 villas en bambou et un shala pour le yoga et la méditation.Votre soutien nous aidera à réaliser la phase 1 de la construction avant notre  ouverture en novembre 2021. Nous commencerons également à planter notre jardin  potager en permaculture au cours de cette phase.Si nous atteignons nos objectifs, nous élargirons la phase 1 pour inclure la piscine (une priorité dans la chaleur tropicale!) et une autre villa d'hôtes. Bien sûr, plus nous recevons de soutien, plus nous pouvons étendre la phase 1, pour offrir encore plus à nos tous premiers clients dans ce qui sera certainement les vacances post-pandémique les plus mémorables dans l'éco-hôtel que vous avez aidé à  construire.Une fois que nous serons opérationnels, nous espérons attirer des personnes de tous ​horizons pour leur faire découvrir le bambou en tant que matériel durable ainsi que l’architecture biophilique, inspirée par la nature elle-même.LES AVANTAGESContribuez à la construction de l'une de nos villa en bambou de luxe en devenant un ""ami d'UNA"", ou faites votre marque sur le terrain pour toujours en plantant un arbre. Mieux encore, pourquoi ne pas réserver un séjour entièrement flexible avec nous à un tarif réduit et être l'un des premiers clients d’UNA lorsque le moment sera venu de voyager à nouveau?

</h3> <p>Hi there, benevolent patrons of the internet. My name's Graham and I'm a full time student working two jobs (one retail, one bartending)  to keep the lights on because that's what students do. When I came to Denver to continue my schooling, I told myself I wasn't looking for a relationship but this charming little hippie nymph convinced me otherwise. Over the past 5 months or so our relationship continued to get more and more serious. I started to wonder what our relationship would look like a year from now as I fell head over heels in love. I began to toss around the idea of moving in together, considered asking her to come with me when I moved out of Denver upon finishing school, and met her parents (who loved me!). She was broke as a joke so me picking up the tab, routinely lending her my car (since she totaled hers and didn't have insurance), and even just giving her money when she needed it became the norm but I was more than happy to do so because I was in love and had also been raised to be a gentleman. Last week she just woke up one morning and decided we ""were never really going to work out anyways"" which was news to me, but that was her decision of the day. My heart was utterly broken and my bank accounts were too. In retrospect, I would've been better off sitting on my couch alone and lighting money on fire<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Where You Come In<br/>

I'm humbly asking you internet denizens help me in this time of need, this dark low in my dating history. I'm not asking for a handout, I'm asking for backing in me restoring balance to a small part of Denver.

</p><h3><b>Short
Summary</b></h3>
<p>
My
name is Hannah Klarner and I just graduated from Boston University in
May with two degrees, one in international relations and the other in
photojournalism.  I'm currently a freelance photographer in Baltimore
Maryland.  This project is my first step towards my dream career
working as a foreign correspondent doing long term immersive projects
abroad.  
</p>
<p>
I've
always loved traveling, and recently I realized just how much my past
travels with my family have impacted my view of the world.  Most
people have heard the saying “Be a traveler not a tourist” and
while I was studying abroad in college I saw just how much tourists
can change a country while travelers go to experience a country as it
is.  While studying abroad I spent four days in Cambodia, which was
long enough for me to see that tourism has a deep impact, but was not
long enough for me to pursue a project about the industry, every day
Cambodians, and how the two groups interact.  
</p>
<p>
That
being said, I'm raising funds to go back to Cambodia for two and a
half weeks.  I plan to fly to Phnom Penh, where I will take a short
language intensive.  Then I hope to go to Siem Reap where the temples
are located and spend time in and around the temples to see not only
the extent of how tourism impacts people but the temples themselves. 
These structures are UNESCO World Heritage Sites but unlike other
sites there are no limits on the number of visitors and restoration
projects seem to be few and far between.  
</p>
<p>
With
the assistance of experienced photographers, I will edit and compile
a photo essay at the end of my two and half weeks to show the
culture, religion, people and tourism of Cambodia.  
</p>
<p>
<br/></p><h3>
<b>What
I Need &amp; What You Get</b>
</h3>
<p>
I'm
hoping to raise $5000 dollars that will be used entirely on this
project.  The money will go to plane tickets, hotel reservations, the
language intensive, and in-country transportation.  Day to day
expenses like food I will cover out of pocket.  Every penny of what I
raise will go to paying for this project, and if I don't meet my
quota then I am going to cover the remaining budget out of pocket.</p><p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">As
	a thank you for donations I receive I am making pocket size picture

<b>The
Impact</b>
</h3>
<p>
The
goal of my project is to concretely demonstrate life in Cambodia and
how tourism affects everyone, from those people living next door to
the temples, to the entrepreneurs who rely on tourists for their
business to survive, to the monks who make their pilgrimage to these
temples.  Cambodia is a country recovering from civil and political
unrest after the Khmer Rouge waged a war using child soldiers and
land mines.  Part of this recovery is economic and hinges upon
tourism.  Through this project I would like to demonstrate the multi
faceted nature of the tourism industry and the people of Cambodia.

Summary

My
name is Hannah Klarner and I just graduated from Boston University in
May with two degrees, one in international relations and the other in
photojournalism.  I'm currently a freelance photographer in Baltimore
Maryland.  This project is my first step towards my dream career
working as a foreign correspondent doing long term immersive projects
abroad.  


I've
always loved traveling, and recently I realized just how much my past
travels with my family have impacted my view of the world.  Most
people have heard the saying “Be a traveler not a tourist” and
while I was studying abroad in college I saw just how much tourists
can change a country while travelers go to experience a country as it
is.  While studying abroad I spent four days in Cambodia, which was
long enough for me to see that tourism has a deep impact, but was not
long enough for me to pursue a project about the industry, every day
Cambodians, and how the two groups interact.  


That
being said, I'm raising funds to go back to Cambodia for two and a
half weeks.  I plan to fly to Phnom Penh, where I will take a short
language intensive.  Then I hope to go to Siem Reap where the temples
are located and spend time in and around the temples to see not only
the extent of how tourism impacts people but the temples themselves. 
These structures are UNESCO World Heritage Sites but unlike other
sites there are no limits on the number of visitors and restoration
projects seem to be few and far between.  


With
the assistance of experienced photographers, I will edit and compile
a photo essay at the end of my two and half weeks to show the
culture, religion, people and tourism of Cambodia.  



What
I Need & What You Get


I'm
hoping to raise $5000 dollars that will be used entirely on this
project.  The money will go to plane tickets, hotel reservations, the
language intensive, and in-country transportation.  Day to day
expenses like food I will cover out of pocket.  Every penny of what I
raise will go to paying for this project, and if I don't meet my
quota then I am going to cover the remaining budget out of pocket.As
	a thank you for donations I receive I am making pocket size picture
	boxes using an origami box and tiny prints of some of my favorite
	travel pictures.

<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I was fortunate to hear about a project called, ""The Memory Project"" through a friend of mine. The organization takes photos of orphans and gives them to US art students to create portraits for the orphans.
(Fast fact: Most orphans have no idea what they look like. They usually don't have any mirrors or pictures of themselves. That is why they are SO fascinated to see themselves in our digital cameras when we go see them!!)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<p>I decided to contact the president of the organization....in hopes that I could get an Art teacher from the US to partner with me to create paintings of some of the Back2Back India children. He responded to me within a day and told me that normally it is at least a 2 year wait to be a part of the program, but he had a teacher from Idaho that just contacted him and he thought it would be a perfect match.... And it was!!!
So, long story short.....When I was in India in August, I took pictures of every Back2Back orphan in 4 of our Children's homes, and this sweet teacher in Idaho committed her students to painting ALL of my children's photos that I took (72 kids total!)!!!!   
 
I've included a sample of some of the pictures below.....  Check them out!</p>
<p>Amazing, right!?!?! I was so impressed!!! And I am SOOOO excited to see the faces of the orphans when they receive these portraits of themselves!</p>

Many of these students are girls: through education they can break the cycle of early marriage, high birth-rates and elevated infant mortality.

Along the way she hopes to  raise awareness and much-needed funds for a great cause – the Big Cats Initiative. However the falling exchange rate has blown out costs and she needs your help. Five years ago, Bronwyn met Jessica Watson, the youngest person to sail solo, single-handed and non-stop around the world. This inspired Bron and she decided that she’d set out to become the youngest woman to ride a motorcycle around the world. Bron  has made steady progress towards that dream ever since. Now the time has come: Bron's final school exams will be finished in a few weeks, preparations are almost complete, but money is running short and so we are asking  you to help. Her record attempt will be run according to stringent Guinness World Record rules: these mean starting and finishing at the same point, travelling in the same direction (Eastwards), riding at least 29,800km by motorcycle and covering 40,000km in total and passing through two antipodean points: places on exactly the opposite side of the planet to each other. This isn’t as easy as it sounds and she has to keep rigorous records the whole way. While simply riding a motorcycle a long way doesn’t sound too hard, Bron has just 90 days to make the trip, between the end of high school and the beginning of First Year at University. So she will have to ride almost 400km  every day, most of it in foreign countries,often on the ""other"" side of the road and on very substandard roads – or even no roads at all. She will cross four deserts, three significant mountain ranges and 21 countries as she circumnavigates our planet. It’s a sadly ironic fact that crossing the ocean with a motorcycle is much more expensive than the land. So, we’re inviting you to join Bron on this epic ride.  THE RIDERBronwyn Kealy is an Aussie-born teenager who has been riding motorcycles since she was four years old in the dirt, on road-race circuits, on dry salt lakes and now the road. In March 2015 she set an Australian Land Speed Record during Speed Week on the salt at Lake Gairdner in Outback South Australia – it’s our version of Bonneville. She’s a qualified volunteer fire-fighter with the Country Fire Authority in Victoria, Australia - the most bushfire-prone place on earth. She’s an open-water scuba-diver, Wilderness Camp Captain at her school,  a Scout  and an Australian Scout Medallion recipient, and she’s also a member of Mensa.  She organised her first charitable event at the age of 7 when she collected more than 500 toys from school children to give to children in refugee camps. She did the same for young victims of the 2009 Victorian Bush Fires who had lost everything.Two years ago she travelled to Guatemala and worked as a volunteer, building a High school in the northern village of Prima Vera.Earlier this year she was a State Finalist in the Lions Club Youth of the Year Quest, winning the State Public Speaking Award.

Indescribably comfortable. Impressively stylish. And best of all, our 100% blackout sleep mask and its industrial grade sound-reduction earmuffs will let you enjoy a moment of stillness, wherever you may be.  Enjoy the many functions of Soulitude.  Have you ever been in the mood for a nice little nap, but have sadly been found yourself in the wrong place at the wrong time? We have. And we (literally!) got tired of it. So we decided to create a solution. From now on, nothing should stand between you and your right to rest in peace! Enjoy some rare quiet time no matter where you are or what time it is.    Perfect for any situation!On a train with the sun shining bright through the window and an annoying neighbor talking on their phone. On a noisy airplane where the person next to you doesn't seem to plan on turning off the reading light any time soon? At home next to your partner who's not at all tired and intends to Netflix for many hours to come?Rest assured that Soulitude has got you covered.  Your ideal traveling companion. And more. Welcome on board. Find your seat. Please fasten your Soulitude. Relax. Have a well-needed, undisturbed nap. Feel like jamming out to your music in peace? Need a quick meditation session? Soulitude turns your normal earbuds into noise-canceling headphones in a second. In the mood for reading, watching a movie, or getting some work done? Simply fold up the sleep mask and keep on enjoying Soulitude's premium sound-reduction capabilities.Arrive well rested. ""Why choose Soulitude over existing solutions?"" Well no one has actually asked us that yet. But just in case someone does in the future, we've conducted a significant amount of research and discovered that the answer is quite obvious...Because it's better. ""Why did we not order two?"" Will Soulitude increase your well-being?This chapter could have been very, very long. Perhaps we could have hired some type of doctor or researcher talking about the many benefits of a power nap specifically or the benefits of relaxation in general. Perhaps we should have quoted recent research showing that light pollution may be disrupting how your body functions or how sound impacts your sleep cycle. We could have gone through numerous arguments why using the Soulitude could help you to cure headaches, increase your energy levels and lower your stress levels.We choose to instead keep it short. If activities such as a comfortable nap or enjoying a sweet moment of relaxation is something that you like to do then:YES, Soulitude will indeed increase your well-being**=Research shows that doing things that you like increases your well-being.Work hard. Nap harder. We created the Soulitude with you in mind. We chose materials with the highest comfort and durability and designed it to be as slim and portable as possible, without sacrificing either comfort, style or function.Block out disturbing light? Annoying sounds?...Or both?Soulitude is carefully designed to be suitable for any situation at any time, anywhere. Time for a nap? Put on your Soulitude and shut out both annoying sounds and disturbing light. Watching a movie on the plane? Fold up the sleep mask and enjoy Soulitude's sound-reduction capabilities. A full night beauty sleep in a quiet place? Simply detach the earmuffs and enjoy 100% blackout. On-the-go? Fold your lightweight Soulitude and put it in its stylish carrying bag.Bring it on-the-go. With style.  zZzZo comfortable! Only the best is good enough for Soulitude. The Sleep maskLight can be a pretty cool thing. But when you intend to rest your eyes, it tends to be really annoying. What’s even more annoying is buying a sleep mask in order to block out that annoying light only to find out that the sleep mask does not in fact block out all of the light. Unfortunately, most of the sleep masks on the market today don’t.After extensive research and testing we’re confident to say that we’ve managed to develop a sleep mask that will completely accomplish its job - 100% blackout - no light leakage. Just as sleep masks once were intended to be - but ours is amazingly comfortable thanks to its premium Memory foam and soft, breathable cotton. Because of the innovative Memory foam walls, there’s no pressure on your eyelids while wearing your Soulitude. This not only ensures your comfort, but allows your eyes the freedom to move ensuring that REM sleep cycle can occur.Goodbye light leakage.The EarmuffThe actual functionality of ordinary hearing protection earmuffs is great. While they’re the ultimate choice for activities such as working at a construction site, going hunting or mowing the lawn, they’re not as great when it’s time for a nap or a relaxing moment.Based on the same sound reduction technology as you’ll find in industrial grade hearing protection- we’ve re-designed and improved the earmuff. Super comfortable, less bulky and way more stylish. Without taking away its main functionality: reducing disturbing noises.What's that? I can't hear you.You can read more about NRR here. Most industrial grade earmuffs are in the NRR range 20-30dB. Please note that Soulitude's 26dB is based on a prototype estimation. What's not an estimation is that using your Soulitude when home, on a plane, on a train or in a car will be absolutely amazing.Specially designed to give your earbuds noise canceling capabilities.   Team Soulitude (Sofia, Sebastian and Linda) is a part of the ODD Inventions network- an innovation agency from Sweden consisting of a group of skillful creators (and friends).

<h1>Just what is Founders?</h1>
<p>One day in July three entrepreneurs decided that Fort Wayne was in need of a free-to-use coworking and collaborative workspace with a true community philosophy. Five days later, keys in hand, Founders launched on Harrison and Pearl Street in Fort Wayne with a vision to empower independent workers in our city and beyond.</p>
<h1>Why are you running an Indiegogo?</h1>
<p>In our eighty days of operation our community grew, with over one hundred independent workers becoming a part of our network. We actually track individual time spent at Founders, and know that nearly nine months of collective time was spent in the building. Yes, we're a bit crazy.</p>
<p>Then, after all the exciting growth, there was a fire.</p>
<p>On the evening of October 16th a fire ignited on the second floor of the Randall building, filling our space on the first floor with smoke and water, damaging our furniture, floors, and computers. That night we closed, and we've yet to reopen.</p>

<p>The list is a bit long, but the majority of the renovation funds will be spent on:</p>

<li>Replacement tables, chairs, and couches</li>

<h1>Why is Founders free?</h1>
<p>Founders believes that coworking should be free.</p>
<p>We know that some independents (the ones already making tons of money, sitting on a huge personal bankroll, or working on heavily funded ventures) can afford to pay the $100 to $400 monthly seat rental that is common among our peers.</p>
<p>However, we also know that a great many independents simply cannot afford it.</p>

<li>Side project entrepreneurs with no or little revenue.</li>
<li>A project team that just needs a few hours together. </li>

<p>For them, being stopped at the door and asked for money is a show stopper.</p>
<p>When they don’t come in, the community as a whole suffers. It becomes a sterile replica of the Office Space environment (sans TPS reports).</p>
<p>The people who can’t afford a traditional coworking fee are exactly those who add the flavor and spark to a startup community. They are the pool from which your community’s successes are born. They are the ones who will be your community’s wise old mentors ten and twenty years from now.</p>

 How do you measure lumens? I see all of your products range quite high 
but most companies measure at the light source (1mm away)...so how to 
compare with working distance?<br/><br/><b>A:</b> Lumens are a measure of 
total light output, not the light intensity at a specific distance. We 
are reporting the total amount of light output from the LEDs themselves,
 inside the light chamber, prior to the diffusion technology.<br/><br/>If 
you buy an LED light bulb in any regular store you will see a Lumens 
rating (not lux). We think this is the best rating method to use for our
 lights because it is the most common, and is the best understood by the
 average consumer. If you know how bright a ""60 watt"" 800 Lumen LED bulb
 you bought at Wal-Mart is, you can probably make a reasonable inference
 about a higher Lumen rating. <br/><br/>You are probably seeing some other
 LED manufacturers use a Lux measurement which needs to include a 
specific distance. Lux more or less tells you how intense a light beam 
is at a specific point, at a specific distance. I'm not sure why some 
manufacturers use this measurement, but it doesn't really tell you a 
lot. A very narrow beam of light (e.g., a flashlight could have a very 
high lux, but low lumens). I highly doubt you would want to use a 
flashlight to light your subject though. <br/><br/>One of the reasons our 
LEDNatural technology is so special is precisely because our technology 
has a 120 degree coverage area, whereas, most traditional LED panels 
only have a 60 degree coverage area. In this scenario, a 60 degree LED 
light panel could conceivably measure higher on a Lux reading than a 
panel with a 120 degree area of coverage, but actually put out less 
light (Lumens). Hope some of this makes sense.<br/><br/>In short, its apples to oranges. We choose to report the more common measure of LED brightness.</p><br/>

<p>In January of 2012, I (Ronnie Pritchett, inventor) was in my backyard 
walking down some dark stairs using a standard Mag flashlight.  I then 
saw something to the left of the stairs and moved my flashlight to see 
what it was.  As I took the next step, I lost my balance and almost fell
 down the stairs.  </p>
<p>A week later while  jogging at night,  I 
noticed a  flashlight coming toward me being waved back and forth.  As I
 got closer, I saw an elderly couple walking with a flashlight. I 
started thinking, ""Why isn't there a flashlight that can show enough 
light so it doesn't have to be waved back and forth, where you can see 
left, right, and forward all at once?""  That really bothered me so when I
 got back home I started drawing up plans for a flashlight that would 
shine left, right and straight ahead.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/16732/files/20130816195156-TL_Picture-1st_Drawings?1376707916"" src="""" style=""""/>CONCEPT DRAWING<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The next morning, I emailed my drawings with a design of a 180º 
flashlight to my patent attorney in Florida.  After John, the attorney, 
did a patent search, he found out that never before has a flashlight 
been developed that provided 180º of light!  So John applied for a 
patent with the United States Patent office and I received my patent 
pending registration. So now, the 180º flashlight utility and design patent 
applications are filed with the United States Patent and Trademark 
Office as well as 27 countries around the world.  The utility patent application includes ALL180º view lighting 
whether handheld, fixed or mobile.</p>
<p>At that point I, along with my 
wife Nancy, formed a company and named it 'TripleLite' LLC, a limited 
liability company in California.  Later, we were introduced to Jason 
Maddox, a mechanical engineer and CEO of Maddox Defense in San Diego, 
California. We really liked Jason and Jason was thrilled when he saw the
 180º flashlight because he felt that I had designed something that 
would change the flashlight industry forever and he wanted to be part of
 it.  So the three of us then became a team.</p>
<p> We  knew that
with the forced change in the flashlight industry, we would have to find a manufacturer 
to partner with to develop innovative tech solutions that other manufacturers did not
yet posses. </p>
<p>After extensive research, many phone calls, meetings and negotiations, we
were able to find a partner with a similar vision for exploring the future of the modern
flashlight. We found what we were looking for with Jenny Truong, the founder and CEO of Apollo manufacturing in San Diego. </p>
<p>In
 the early stages we focused on finding a functional yet attractive look
 for the flashlight. Due to the need for 180º of light, we needed to 
find a shape that would
provide intense light across a 180º degree field of view.</p>
<p>Along 
with Jenny, we started working with an engineering company to design a 
circuit board, heat
sync, power management and control system.  We knew that to make a 
quality product that could be produced in high quantity, the design 
needed to reduce the amount of
man hours in wiring and soldering.</p>

could be a viable technology. The 1st circuit board was fragile and bulky. It also
contained many soldering points of areas of potential breakage. The battery

<br/><p>Although we were pleased, it
wasn’t yet perfect. So, we created a new custom case that would require a complete
over hall of the circuit board to fit within the new form factor.</p>
<p>After
 months of discussions and further refinement, we were able to change 
the internal
circuitry and build a rugged case that was both water resistant and 
easier to produce. A design team added a sleek finish and elegant case 
that now defines our looks.
It has now been more that 5 months that we embarked on this journey and 
we are
finally satisfied that the product we have been developing is a truly

Since 2009, I've been shooting portraits of unique, stylish women I find on the streets and subways of New York. My plan is to print them in my first ever photography book, called Birds of Paradise. This is a 64 page, softcover book, with 30 of my favorite portraits that I've taken since I began the series. This project is very close to my heart, and I'm really excited to share these images with the world. With all of your help, I can make it happen!About Me
My name is Lee O'Connor. I am a fashion, portrait, and lifestyle 
photographer based in Brooklyn, NY. I have been taking pictures for well
 over 10 years, and have assisted some of the world's most celebrated
 photographers. My work has appeared in publications such as Harper's Bazaar, Paper, and Oyster,
 and I've photographed for a variety of clients, including Interscope 
Records, Sundance Film Festival, and CBS. What I Need & What You Get
My goal is to print a limited edition book. To do this, I need $6,000 to cover printing costs, proofing, and shipping for 300 softcover books, which will be printed and bound by a reputable printing company.

By contributing, you have the opportunity to receive a number of things: prints, a copy of the book itself, or even your very own portrait shoot, photographed by me!

<p>My name is Aldo Castaneda and I started JyARz about a year ago, when a friend of mine saw me using a portable Advil container. He said, ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if that were made entirely out of glass?"" I was instantly captivated by that idea.</p>
<h2>A Unique, Patent Pending Eco-Friendly Design</h2>
<p>After thinking through a variety of designs in my head, I applied for a US Patent for my final design, which based on recent communications with the US PTO, appears will be granted.</p>
<p>The prototype (see video above) is complete and the final design is a perfect working model of my design. I am currently working with Kennerly-Spratling, an injecting molding and production firm in San Leandro, California. KS is overseeing production of a steel injection mold used to produce the shell that seals and protects the glass core of a JyAR. The first shipment of 5,500 glass ""cores"" with the JyARz logo emblazened on them has arrived, at the warehouse (more ""house"" than ""ware""). And we expect to start shipping JyARz to supporters and customers this Fall (2012). </p>
<h2>Why Crowd Funding?</h2>
<p>I launched this IndieGoGO campaign to help pay for the first run production and other bills that have accumulated since I got started with JyARz. Most of the costs are related to design/production related to the injection molding process.</p>
<h2>JyARZ - Environmental Mission</h2>
<p>The name JyARz (the ""why"" is silent) is a play on Gyres. Gyres are swirling ocean currents in which a growing volume of plastic is disintegrating and being incorporated into the marine foodchain. Part of our mission at JyARz is to promote awareness of this growing environmental problem. So when people ask about the our name, we talk about Gyres and plastic waste.</p>
<p>JyARz are also inherently environmentally friendly. JyARz are made from recycled milk jugs, like the ones you buy at your local super market. The gaskets in a JyAR are made from natural latex rubber. The glass ""core"" in a JyAR can be easily removed for cleaning and reuse and it can be recycled and replaced which means you can keep on using your JyAR again and again and again.</p>
<p>Last, 1% of JyARz sales (once JyARz are in full production) will be donated to 1% for the Planet. Those funds will be directed to organizations researching the impact of the growing volume of plastic that is swirling around and disintegrating in swirling oceans currents called Gyres.</p></div>","The JyARz Story

<p><strong>WHAT?</strong><br/>HYPAR is a patented personal Smart Boat. When folded, it can be carried anywhere as a light-weight backpack - making it incredibly easy to handle, transport and amazingly convenient to store.  </p>
<p>Thanks to its modular design and the exceptional proportions of the hull shape, HYPAR sustains an easy and fast reconfiguration setup from a backpack in to kayak, dinghy, sailing boat, solar boat and many more to come!<br/>HYPAR greatly performs in any environment: from placid metropolitan waterways to braking sea waves and gale wind.<br/>Any corners of the planet are open to HYPAR. Performance and reliability of HYPAR design will suit beginners as well as experts.</p>

<p><strong>HOW?</strong><br/>The gorgeously streamlined HYPAR bow slices into the water vertically while its wide flattened stern meets the surface horizontally. This gives the boat a shape consisting of two counterpoised hyperbolic paraboloids, hence the name HYPAR.<br/>HYPAR's innovative hull shape ensures exceptional speed and stability whilst the ground-breaking 'folding' design enables instant transformation from a boat into a backpack - all in less than 3 minutes. This ensures you can quickly and conveniently fit a performance watercraft inside your car, or any other transportation or storage space.</p>

<p><strong>WHY HYPAR IS SMART BOAT?</strong><br/>The unique shape of the HYPAR hull provides an exceptional combination of performance and versatility. The hull versatility is enhanced by a modular design, an advanced folding caracteristic, a snap connectivity and high tech materials. These determine the basis of the smart boat concept. The smart boat concept in its nature is an adaptive platform capable of evolving to meet any unseen challenges in the future. HYPAR standards and our Open Design policy let everyone contribute to HYPAR evolution with personal ideas and refinements.<br/>As a result, HYPAR can be transformed into many configurations - from backpack to kayak, rowing, sailing or even solar powered boat and much more. All what is needed for a new HYPAR configuration, is to obtain the required equipment and ensure it is designed to HYPAR standards. In most cases, you won't even need tools to refit your HYPAR and most reconfiguration take just moments to accomplish. <br/><br/>Currently we are testing the following configurations:<br/>    Sailing mod: Sailing ability is one of many advantages of HYPAR concept. For sailing HYPAR is equipped with sails and rigging. The fin &amp; rudder are controlled by foot pedals.<br/>    Solar mod: Solar unit designed as unified block of light Solar panel, MPPT controller and DC engine. Direct sunlight provides energy for propulsion, and on shore, the Solar panel can be used to power camping equipment or personal electronic gadgets.<br/>    Surfing mod and Fishing mod and more in progress....<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492553358/besy1fjxojxm8tgqujxk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>About Me (Jess) and Love and London</h3>
<p>Just over a year ago, I started the <a href=""http://youtube.com/loveandlondon"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Love and London Youtube channel</a>, creating videos that help first-time visitors to my city to be as prepared as possible for the trip of a lifetime. It's turned into so much more, and our inspiring community of over 20,000 people motivate me to create  helpful London content every day.</p>
<p>Having moved here 3.5 years ago, and being in love with this city, I want to help visitors to have the best time while they're here, and part of that includes recommending the best accommodation options that London has to offer.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484158068/auat7wti0eylukilpuyi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Why we're raising money for this</h3>
<p>First off, I want to keep this guide free. I think everyone should have the option to find a great place to stay in London, regardless of budget. I think you'll agree...</p>
<p>I also want this to be someone that we keep as our own. I could have brought on sponsors for the book, but that would have jeopardised what I could recommend and include in the guide. Let's just keep this in the family so I can recommend what I think you'll like best.</p>
<p>Finally, the big one-- I make very little money from my efforts, which include producing weekly Youtube videos, sending weekly newsletters to my 4500 email subscribers, updating social media with tips daily, and more. If we wanna get honest here, my average monthly take home after expenses is about £150-- yikes.  Which is where my freelance business comes in-- it pays the bills.</p>
<p>To be able to create this guide and everything that goes with it, I'll need about two weeks solid -- it's much more time intensive than my London 101 Guide.  So I'll need to take time off from my freelance work, which I of course need to pay my bills and keep food on the table. I've been trying to get this guide created for months but freelance work is just taking up too much of my time.</p>
<p>If we reach the fundraising goal, the guide will be live and ready for download within 30 days.</p>
<p><u>So the money raised will:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Pay for expenses incurred to create the guide, like paying someone to design the cover</li>
<li>Help me keep the lights on while I take time off working</li>
</ul>

<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>By getting involved in this project, besides getting a nice perk or two, you'll also be helping thousands of people who will visit London in the next few years to <i>not be overwhelmed  </i>by the accommodation booking process. We've all been there-- maybe you went through this for your first visit to London? </p>
<p>Imagine if that stress, panic, and confusion could have been eliminated for you. What would you have given for easy planning for you and your family?</p>
<h3>What's in the guide</h3>
<p>What's this guide going to include? Glad you asked.</p>
<p><u><i>Area Guides</i></u></p>
<p>The first 9 chapters will each be dedicated to one GREAT London area/neighborhood to stay in. It will be a mini-guide to the area, with local recommendations for things to do nearby as well as where to eat and drink. I'll also be honest about what type of person will enjoy staying in each area, because they're all different and cater to different types of people.</p>
<p>You can bet your butt that each area will be the ones I'd recommend to my own family and friends, and that I feel are safe enough for solo travelers and/or families.</p>
<p><u><i>""Best of"" lists</i></u></p>
<p>The final 5 chapters will each be dedicated to one type of accommodation-- hostels, budget hotels, mid-range hotels, luxe hotels, and Airbnbs apartments. The lists are the result of hours of research and asking family and friends for their input... I've started doing this already but I'm nowhere near done! But essentially, I'll be vetting each recommendation as much as possible so I will only recommend the best to you.</p>

<h3>What you get!</h3>
<p>Here's the fun part--- you actually GET STUFF when you contribute to the project! I really want you to benefit as much as possible for your involvement, not just throw money at it (that's the savvy spender in me speaking.) </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Other ways you can help</h3>
<p>I totally understand if you can't help this project financially right now. The last thing I'd want you to do was contribute when it's not the right time for you to do so. You CAN still help though.</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of the people who you know are thinking about going to London soon, or already have their flights booked. Surely, they'll want to help contribute (and they'll get the guide earlier than everyone else).</li>
<li>Pretty much everyone is connected to someone who will be going to London in the future, whether you know it or not. Share the link to this page on Facebook or any other social media to get the word out! Use the buttons next to the BACK IT box at the top of the page to do this easily.</li>

<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>We are Floyd &amp; Patti Hunter of Irving, TX. In the next year, we will both retire from our jobs and move to Corozal, Belize. We enjoy relaxing and playing in the sun. We want to provide a comfortable place for nudist/naturist enthusiasts to stay and relax.  </p>

There are several tour companies in the area who will provide relaxing or adventurous treks to the surrounding area including cave tubing, zip lining, snorkeling and fishing.  <br/>Guests will have use of the large kitchen to prepare meals or they may want to drive into Corozal and dine in the many local restaurants.

<h3>Why should you give us your money?  What’s in it for you? </h3>
<p>I hate asking people for money. That said, I am asking for your help. A lot of people would like to help broaden the Naturist movement but can’t think of a way. They would invest in a membership in a retreat but don’t have much money and don’t want that much of a commitment.  </p>
<p>At this time, there are no nude/naturist retreats or resorts in Belize and several people have asked us if we plan on opening a place where they can relax and go clothing optional.  2 Texans Inn Corozal is our answer.  We will be opening by March 1, 2015 if we get funding.

<h3>Welcome To The PetBath Experience!</h3>
<p><br/></p>

</span>
<h3></h3>
<h3>
</h3><table><tbody><tr><td>
<p>PetBath is proud to announce a whole new and improved way
  to wash your pet without the fuss and the mess usually involved. <br/></p>
<p>PetBath offers a solution to an ""age old""
  problem of how to bathe your pet without the clean up, muss and fuss, the
  discomfort and back pain and of course the convenience to bathe where you
  want and when you want, regardless of the weather conditions, where you live
  or the type of home in which you live.</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table><b><h3>What Is It?</h3></b><table><tbody><tr><td>
<p></p>
<p>PetBath is the first ever product introduced to the world, which is a self-contained bathing device for the pet. All but the pet’s head is in the unit that has water jets that apply water/shampoo/conditioner while the owner washes from wide access doors. This PATENTED product, allows for all the muss &amp; fuss associated with pet bathing to take place inside the unit. PetBath allows the owner to wash their pet and not themselves! We will manufacture five sizes and will be Made in the USA.</p>
<p></p>
</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>How Does it Work?</h3>
<h3>
</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/293200/files/20140105211112-A-CF_Image2.png?1388985072"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>
</h3><p>There are multiple water jets on the inside that gently spray water on your pet. You can
apply shampoo and/or conditioner via the control valve or manually. Then simply
open the wide doors and scrub your pet. </p>
<p>Once clean, rinse
off, close the doors and let them shake...all the water stays in the unit. </p>
<p><b>Wash time 10 minutes
or less!</b></p>

<p>No
one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially one that affects the
millions of ""pet parents"" that are waiting and anticipating the
greatest problem solving device ever introduced to the pet bathing world. We
want you to feel confident that we have worked hard and have done all of our
homework to be ready for this day and we have no intention of messing that
up...from design and functionality to manufacturing and fulfillment we are
prepared to bring the PetBath to market, however as with anything there are
risks involved and here are some as we see them:</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>MANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling
to manufacture a product of this size is very expensive and requires expert
knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 60-90 day lead time to create
the molds for a product of this size and this is where delays could occur. To
minimize that possibility we're working with tool &amp; die manufacturer
partners that have a track record of on time and high quality delivery.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As the PetBath
gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to
improve the final product. Pre-production prototype tweaking is done to test
and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those
suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the
benefit of you the VIPP (Very Important PetBath Parent) and we will keep you in
the loop when and why any are made.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>FULFILLMENT: You know Murphy's Law...what can go wrong will go wrong...and sometimes things go awry that can’t
be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a
shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the
possibility of logistical fulfillment we will have contingency/backup plans and
product commercialization experts in place that will help insure smooth
transition from us to you! </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will be working with
manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in
tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road,
but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge and external
expertise, with an overall goal of making the best possible PetBath product for
you, our VIPP (Very Important PetBath Parent).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Any pledge amount brings us one step
closer to delivering the PetBath. However, we must exceed our goal by quite a lot, to make that
happen. But, the more we receive, the faster we'll be able to produce PetBaths
for you. Be a part of making the World's Most Advanced Pet Bathing Device a

<p></p><br/><h3></h3></div>","Welcome To The PetBath Experience!






PetBath is proud to announce a whole new and improved way
  to wash your pet without the fuss and the mess usually involved. 
PetBath offers a solution to an ""age old""
  problem of how to bathe your pet without the clean up, muss and fuss, the
  discomfort and back pain and of course the convenience to bathe where you
  want and when you want, regardless of the weather conditions, where you live
  or the type of home in which you live.
What Is It?

PetBath is the first ever product introduced to the world, which is a self-contained bathing device for the pet. All but the pet’s head is in the unit that has water jets that apply water/shampoo/conditioner while the owner washes from wide access doors. This PATENTED product, allows for all the muss & fuss associated with pet bathing to take place inside the unit. PetBath allows the owner to wash their pet and not themselves! We will manufacture five sizes and will be Made in the USA.

How Does it Work?



There are multiple water jets on the inside that gently spray water on your pet. You can
apply shampoo and/or conditioner via the control valve or manually. Then simply
open the wide doors and scrub your pet. 
Once clean, rinse
off, close the doors and let them shake...all the water stays in the unit. 
Wash time 10 minutes
or less!

Hear feedback from a professional mountain bikerWhile most E-Bikes claim they regenerate energy, they only recharge 10% of their battery while braking. Rattan’s patented I-PAS regeneration recharges over 60% of the battery power anytime the bike is braking, gliding, or riding downhill. The I-PAS technology was created and patented by Rattan, so while other E-Bikes can promise regeneration, Rattan is the only company that delivers.  The innovative I-PAS technology transfers the energy generated by the motor back to the generator when riding downhill, braking, or gliding. While the bike doesn’t require throttle during these moments, the motor uses the kinetic energy to power the battery.  With 20-inch rear tires and enough throttle to take you through the toughest terrain, Rattan X is easy to use off-road. Front Suspension Fork and Shock Absorption Seat Tube make for a smooth ride no matter where you go. Rattan X’s throttle will easily get you to the top of any hill. Reach 28 MPH on full throttle without pedaling, making it easier to reach the summit. Never worry about your battery losing power from your commute to work and back. The 100+ mile charge will get you where you need to go. Plus, a smooth ride will make you excited to head to work! Studies show E-Bike users are 80% more likely to ride to work vs regular bike users. A single charge on Rattan X can take you over 100 miles! That means from New York to Philadelphia or Austin to San Antonio in a single charge. It means from Venice Beach to Long Beach 3 times before needing to recharge.

After a Bachelor's degree in Réunion Island, I moved to Europe to complete my studies in business.

We love discovering new trails and following our last travels, we noticed how difficult it is to organize mountain bike trips. We struggled with finding riding buddies and checking bike friendly accommodation. Isn’t it the same for you? Luckily, we met the locals and they made our journeys awesome. We understood that staying with them is the best way to get in-depth with the cultures and explore the best trails.Having fun with like-minded people, that’s MTBNB’s spirit!  The first version of our web application will be released in July, but we are already thinking further— that is why we need you.By buying our perks, you will help us to reach our funding goal. 50% will be used to improve the web application with new features. The rest will help us get in a business accelerator program and communicate more about our project.If you’re not able to make a financial contribution, you can support us by spreading the word and telling your friends, family, colleagues, classmates, neighbours, etc. about our project!  Wherever you want to ride, MTBNB will help you to connect with locals who will show you their favorite trails. You can decide to hang out with riding buddies or get professional guiding with the certified mountain bike instructors.  Either way, you will have fun! Find a Riding BuddyFind a riding buddy or a mountain bike instructor wherever you want to ride using the geolocation, discipline (XC, AM, EN, DH) and level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) filters.  Plan Your Stay When it’s offered, stay at your riding buddy's and enjoy that time together! You could also check the bike-friendly accommodation recommended by your buddy.  Organize Your Riding Experience Organize riding dates and all details together with your buddy through the booking process and chat. The next step is to get ready for your amazing mountain bike experience. How to Pay for the Trip Riding with your buddy is free. You just have to contribute amicably to trip expenses such as transport, accommodation and food costs. However, with the certified mountain bike instructors, there is a professional guiding cost added.  Synchronize your Instagram accountShare your riding memories by synchronizing your Instagram account to your MTBNB profile. We have worked on amazing perks and we are sure you will like them. MTBNB One Year MembershipBy getting your membership, you will receive a badge that will offer you complete access to our platform for one year. You will be able to send unlimited messages to locals and organize as many experiences as you want. MTBNB membership will also allow you synchronize your Instagram account to your MTBNB profile to share your last ride memories. MTBNB Ride with Cofounders (events)We are so excited about the idea to meet our backers. That's why we will organize two meeting events in August. Get ready to have a good time with us. Just get your invitation card and bring your bikes, we'll do the rest (BBQ, pasta, drinks and more)Events location:  Annecy, FRANCENorth Vancouver, BC, CANADA MTBNB Jersey                            We have proudly designed our own MTBNB jersey in collaboration with Origines Clothing! 100% recycled polyester soft breathable fabric (170g/m²),  targeted ventilation and stretch panels. MTBNB T-ShirtGet a sweet MTBNB team tee, identical to those worn by the MTBNB team at events (or at the pub)MTBNB MudguardAre you looking for a new mudguard?

Beginning in Arkansas my route would take me through Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Texas, and then return me to Arkansas. The route I have mapped out is a total of 7,180.52 miles which would include many stops at sites such as Yellow Stone National Park, Mount Rushmore, the Painted Dessert, The Bad Lands, The Red Wood Forest, The Grand Canyon,  Mt.

Estimating for side trips to see sights I am thinking the first $1,000 dollars would go to the gas budget. The remaining $4,000 would go into many different avenues.

I will be travelling with camping equipment to hopefully keep down cost. I will also be using these funds to buy equipment needed to make the trip such as luggage bags to strap to my bike, camera memory cards, rain gear, and things of that nature. Another route for the funds would be to covering entry fees to State and National Parks I will be stopping at along the way. I hope to stop at over 75 of the most scenic sites in the West and many of these sites are in these parks. Also some of the funds used will be reinvested into the perks I have offered.

We’ve spent hundreds if not thousands of hours in them. Slept in dozens of them. That’s ultimately what led us to have a this-can-be-much-better moment.So we rethought the concept of sleeping in nature, and combined the best and most durable elements of our camping gear into one high quality, heavy-duty, light-weight (under 5.5 lbs) sleeping system. Better TogetherSolo, Duo & Group CampingReconnect with nature and each other with RhinoWolf’s innovative modular design. It’s amazing on its own and even better when zipped together. 
RhinoWolf Has Been Featured In   
The RhinoWolfRhinoWolf's been made to last and last well. It's been crafted with the toughest and most durable of climate protective materials. That means you can use it on whatever part of the planet you find yourself in.What makes it a full spectrum SuperTent?  The RhinoWolf ShellIs what we call the outer part of the RhinoWolf, what others might call a 'tent', and it's the tough-and-durable yet super-light outer layer of this remarkable outdoor sleep system.The Shell is made from 15 denier thick 2000mm Nylon ripstop material with Silicon on both sides. And of course, it's wind proof and rain proof.   The RhinoWolf Air MattressThe air mattress is lightweight, comfortable and inflates in just 10-15 breaths. It's designed in an ergonomic body-mapped V chamber shape which limits air movement and provides full body support. The RhinoWolf Sleeping BagThe RhinoWolf sleeping bag isn't really a bag at all. It's more of comfy blanket that zips right in, putting you in snug town. They're standard sized, but you can scroll down to check out measurements in the Specs section.Warmth / Thickness-wise, the sleeping bags come in 3 different variations:Light: 150g duck down, cold temperature limit of 40F / 10C (a.k.a 2 seasons).Standard: 375g duck down, cold temperature limit of 25F / -4C (a.k.a 3 seasons).Heavy: 560g duck down, cold temperature limit of 14F / -10C (a.k.a 4 seasons).  Innovative 1-Pole Spine MechanismWe re-engineered the shell itself for maximum efficiency. Our super-strong single pole spine design means a lighter load, an easy and quick set-up, and also a much wider, comfier, living zone. The double wide door design allows for maximum airflow. I Fast & Easy Set-UpRhinoWolf set's up quickly and easily thanks to it's innovative one-pole design. This one-of-it's-kind  design not only allows for easy set up, but also ergonomic flow and natural air flow.

It is made of lightweight nylon with a zipper, and 2 hardened steel hooks with adjustable straps.  The anti-theft cover keeps water and thieves out of the back zipper. Internal padded pocket protects both a laptop (up to 17"") AND a tablet.There is a hidden compartment with more pockets.- just unzip the 5 Pocket liner to access it.External zippered pockets provide handy access without opening the main compartment.USB power port - store your favorite power bank inside and connect to charge without taking it out.Nearly one inch thick cushions lighten the load, with cool fabrics and air channels. What makes Ninja Backpack better:  
No other backpack has 3 layers: foam padding between the waterproof shell and inner nylon liner. 


Waterproof Oxford Canvas has a more refined look and feel than common nylon. 
The thick back and shoulder straps and padding, heavy duty zippers, and metal pulls.

Quality craftsmanship reflect the distinction from other backpacks .
Safety and convenience of strapping onto your luggage handle. Ninja Backpack Team - we are a group of college students and young professionals with family businesses involved in the design and manufacturing of bags, and accessories.  Therefore, it was a natural for us to draw up what we wanted and get the prototype handmade in a couple months.  We hail out of New York where we get our inspiration, and field tested the prototype for a month in December.  This campaign will help us launch a line of high quality backpacks with the hidden expansion bag design theme.  Our results here will help us prove the market acceptance needed to get into retail outlets.  That is why we are giving such heavy discounts and FREE Shipping to you guys.Drawings, materials swatches, and hooks - part of the design process. Working with our partner - our subcontractor is an OEM factory for Swiss Gear, and several quality international brands.  PerksLeatherman 10 in 1 Pocket Tool $40 Retail (FREE S & H) Ninja Backpack $130 Retail (FREE S & H)All Rewards will be shipped with tracking to your door starting in July.Risks and challengesNinja Backpack Team - we are a group of college students and young professionals with family businesses involved in the design and manufacturing of bags, and accessories.

<h3>What's the story?</h3>
<p>Hi, we are a team of archaeologists (Dr Ladislav Nejman, Dr Duncan Wright and PhD student Nicholas Skopal) from the University of Sydney, the Australian National University and Masaryk University. We want to complete an archaeological dig in Švédův Stůl Cave in the Czech Republic, a site occupied by both Neanderthals and modern humans (Homo sapiens). We need your help to do it!</p>
<p>The site is situated (49°14'43.4""N 16°44'51.9""E) in the picturesque natural environment of the southern part of the Moravian Karst approximately 10 km from the city of Brno (second largest city in Czech Republic). Our primary research focus is the period approx. 50,000 - 30,000 years ago characterized by relatively frequent &amp; significant climatic changes and the coexistence of two distinct hominid groups, the Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans. This excavation will focus primarily on backfill sediments deposited during old excavations, but we may also target intact sediments. None of the sediments were sieved at the time and accidental finds made later on the discard pile outside the cave include Neanderthal teeth, Palaeolithic and Neolithic artefacts, bones and teeth of Pleistocene megafauna.</p>
<p>In our 2019 excavation we will wet-sieve the sediments, employ innovative geoarchaeological techniques and modern analyses such as detecting traces of ancient organic residues on artefacts and the potential use of a scanning AA machine and/or a portable XRF device to conduct trace element analyses of sediments remaining from previous excavations and as residues on the bones and stone artefacts.</p>
<p>In 2011, 2012 and 2016 we excavated another cave called Pod Hradem Cave using EU and SoMoPro funding. Radiocarbon dates showed us people were visiting this cave between 50,000 - 30,000 years ago. During fieldwork we excavated portable art objects, stone blades, the remains of cave bears, mammoths and woolly rhinos (<a href=""http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/nejman337/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/nejman337/</a>; <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC6uXebJMNo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sC6uXebJMNo</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle rental</strong> - Cost of hire of a van for seventeen days. The vehicle will be used to transport personnel (including volunteers) and equipment between the nearest city (Brno) and the site and movement of excavated material from site to a wet-sieving station. Hiring a van is the most cost effective option for these tasks as we can transport people as well as equipment and excavated sediment. Details at: <a href=""https://www.mobilityrent.cz/en/van-rental-brno/pricelist/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.mobilityrent.cz/en/van-rental-brno/...</a>  <strong>Fuel</strong> - Calculated on the basis of local fuel prices and distance to site (i.e. assumes an average of 600 km/week and includes travel between Brno, the site and the wet-sieving station). <strong>Food for excavation volunteers: </strong>one main meal per day will be provided for each volunteer at the excavation. The meals will be ordered at a local restaurant and the prices are based on previous experience. <strong>Other: Perishables –</strong> Some field equipment will need to be purchased and we will need to restock perishable items including gloves for excavation/ wet-sieving; large plastic bags for storing and transporting excavated samples; small sample bags for sediment/ artefacts etc. The price is based on previous experience (inexpensive in Czech Republic).</p>
<p><strong>Costs to be paid from other funds: </strong>Additional costs (e.g. flights, specialist analysis, per diem costs) will be covered by Dr Nejman. </p>
<p><strong>Perks for you! </strong>This campaign provides a unique opportunity for you to get involved in a very exciting archaeology project. You will be part of a team - quite literally rewriting the history of human evolution in Central Europe.</p>
<p>As part of this team you will have access and be cited in our blog. This blog will provide you with information about the excavation, with regular contributions by archaeologists. You will be the first to hear about exciting new discoveries, well before this information gets reported within the international literature/ media. Your opinion pieces/ comments will later be included (where appropriate and where permissions have been obtained) in the final report.</p>
<p>For bronze members you will be able to access a regularly updated blog (reporting new discoveries, photographs, diary entries from excavators and scientific papers/ media releases) about Švédův Stůl Cave. As project contributors, your names will be included in this blog (unless you wish to be anonymous), with electronic copies sent to you if you desire this.</p>
<p>For silver members (which includes the bronze membership perk) you will be given a 3D, ceramic model of a 40,000 year old ""leaf point"" excavated from Pod Hradem cave during our previous excavation. All silver and gold members will be referenced individually in this report.</p>
<p>For gold members (which includes the bronze and silver membership perks) you will be offered the experience of a lifetime - the opportunity to join in excavations at a site once occupied by ancient hominids (travel costs not included). Should you wish to visit us, we will provide a tour of Švédův Stůl Cave and surrounding sites you may even be able to dig up a few cave bear/ mammoth bones! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When archaeologists dig a hole in the ground, each sweep of the trowel uncovers pieces of a long forgotten story. When that story involves the emergence (or disappearance) of two human species, we think you will agree that it becomes very exciting! </p>
<p>We can't stress how important this project is. Švédův Stůl Cave is one of only three sites in the Moravian Karst with evidence for human visitation during this critical transition period (50,000- 35,000 years ago).</p>
<p>The project will involve the general public, not just academics. Fieldwork in 2011, 2012 and 2016 had a strong research training component, with students from Masaryk University and a number of Australian universities working as volunteers in the excavation and sorting of archaeological materials. This will be continued in 2019. We also want to involve other interested people (YOU) in the 2019 field season. You will be able to see the excavation unfolding either by visiting the site or by following our interactive blog.</p>
<p>A close relationship has been established with Masaryk University in Brno, who are keen for further research to take place in 2019. Results from previous excavations have been published in major scientific journals (e.g. <a href=""http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/nejman337/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://antiquity.ac.uk/projgall/nejman337/</a>) and publicised in local, Czech Republic media (<a href=""http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/regiony/131589-v-moravskem-krasu-se-nasly-praveke-nastroje/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/regiony/131589-v-moravskem-krasu-se-nasly-praveke-nastroje/</a>).

<p>Short Summary</p>
<p>Joe,  Armand, Bob, and I have over 100 years of experience in this product category - we created the first tracking device ever designed to be used on airlines for checked-in luggage - and the BSAF device, once again, will be the only tracking device fully compliant with the new airline mandates on the use of these type devices.</p>
<p>We are most passionate about the design of a tracking device capable of creating peace of mind when traveling or being aware of the location of special needs family members.</p>
<p>We have invested significant financial resources and time in bringing the BSAF product to this stage and now need your help to complete the work and bring it to life. We are ready to produce 100 prototype BSAF devices to be used by airline travelers and those who have family members with special needs such as Alzheimer's and Autism. </p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>We need approximately $25,000 to complete the manufacturing of the 50 prototype samples that will be provided to the airline industry and 20 of our early Contributors.</p>
<p>We are sincerely grateful to our initial 500 Contributors / Supporters for enabling us to get to this second and final stage before full manufacturing production.</p>
<p>We created the Perks for your support by providing meaningful discounts on the overall price value when the BSAF product goes to market. From what we learned with the first of our successful products, at least two devices are needed to cover most ""checked baggage"" travel experiences.  Therefore, we believe our 2 pack Device Perk makes a lot of sense for sharing a device within the family.</p>
<p>If our funding goal is not entirely met, we will continue to work with our engineering team and get to market, however, that will delay the ultimate product delivery to the market. So, again, if our funding goal is not reached, we will look to find equity incentive programs with our suppliers to enable us to complete this final stage.  And, of course, we can go back to our own families for more support.  But, we will achieve this next critical stage prior to the first full manufacturing run.</p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>Four billion units of luggage are checked-in annually on airline flights worldwide; 80 million arrive late, 17 million never arrive.   Though widely attributed to airline negligence, this usually occurs because, according to travel load, the 2-D bar code system literally runs out of numbers and the system is subsequently reset.  If your bag was in transit and the system reset occurred, it is impossible for the airline to track your bag, period. That's where BSAF steps in.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are 44 million Alzheimer’s patients worldwide, 47.5 million living with dementia, and 76 million people living with autism.</p>
<p>Whether you are a frequent airline traveler, parent or caretaker of a special needs family member, the BSAF device is designed for you.</p>
<p>Our first product, Trakdot Luggage Tracker, was voted #1 new product introduction at the 2014 CES Trade Show and went on to sell over 50,000 units worldwide. Ultimately, its lifespan was cut short due to the anticipated rise in Internet of Things technology. As result, we learned a valuable lesson in overcoming obsolescence in the wireless world in which we live.</p>
<p>While we know and understand the anxiety that goes with lost luggage, the four of us felt that the next generation of tracking devices - BSAF - needed to do more.   Which is why we chose to address special needs family members.  Knowing where a loved one is at all times when needed can bring no greater peace of mind.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>Challenges and risks come from many directions, be it changes in technology, regulations and competitors.  Our experience with Trakdot faced all of these right up through its successful launch.</p>
<p>We are collaborating with one of the world's largest contract manufacturers for the software engineering of BSAF - that should address the technology challenge. We have personal relationships with a number of the largest airlines in the world as well as with the regulatory agency of the FAA - that should address the regulations challenge and risk.  Our BSAF has been priced to be as much as 30 - 80% lower cost than competitive devices on the market. We believe this will be a long term competitive advantage for us.</p>
<p>Other Ways You Can Help</p>
<p>Now that you understand a little more about what BSAF is all about and our mission to provide an affordable tracking device for awareness and peace of mind, we would love for you to share with us your ideas for what other uses you would see for the BSAF that we could consider in this final stage of development before we begin producing the prototype devices.</p>

And CYCLEAGLE’s easy and intuitive controls make sure every ride is a smooth ride.The CYCLEAGLE features a 4-wheel braking system, providing the stability and control you’ll need around the campsite or on the trail, and allowing you to retain perfect control. Even at maximum speed, the CYCLEAGLE makes sure every stop is smooth, easy, and safe.A 2.4 GHz wireless controller gives you easy, reliable control with no fuss. And four different speed modes and a cruise control setting mean you can focus on the ride, not micromanagement.Drop something important on a tight trail? Find yourself at a dead end? Not a problem, just put your CYCLEAGLE into reverse and head right back the way you came. No awkward turns, no muss, no fuss, just perfect, intuitive control anywhere you need it. The curve of the deck is also engineered to ergonomically suit the rotation angle of the board and the radian of the feet, providing excellent control.The CYCLEAGLE is for anybody- and you can tweak it any time to suit your tastes. Different riders bring different things to the table and have different needs, but the CYCLEAGLE adjusts to you.Adjustable cushioning springs can be altered to suit your height and weight to get more flexibility or stability as you prefer. Two reset springs on either side of the deck ensure you can easily return to a balanced position if you lose your center of gravity, similar to a car's steering booster.Adjustable steering configurations allow you to optimize the turning for flexibility or stability, depending on where you’re going and how you’re feeling. Set your turning radius as low as 1.3 m for maximum agility at low speeds, then use the multiple steering configuration holes to switch it to 2.3 m for high-speed stability when you need it. Compatible with commercially available screws make the CYCLEAGLE not just personalizable, but customizable as well.*Note that the standard battery pack is included in the 2WD/4WD perks, and this accessory is an extra battery pack. CYCLEAGLE has a high ground clearance of 155mm/6.1’’, surpassing that of its competitor by 2.6 inches, which ensures a way better pass-through. With its patented independent suspension system, CYCLEAGLE allows for maximal tilting. The adjustable springs allow for enhanced flexibility and agile steering, thus much larger turning radii of 130cm-230cm. Our detachable battery system brings extra mileage. It’s portable as well. The E-board is ultimately offered with great affordability.Disclaimer: Although the Coronavirus outbreak is not over in China yet, it has gotten much better here, great thanks to all the doctors and medical staff, as well as citizens who stayed in quarantine to keep the virus from spreading. There are about 80,000 people infected but more than 61,000 recovered. Prayerfully, they will get well as soon as possible in this fight, and please take care of yourselves as well! Check out the WHO website for updates with regard to this virus.Being verified by Indiegogo officially, we have entered the production stage. Starting in July, the units will be discharged from the factories to the local warehouse in your country. Don’t worry about the shipping, we will make sure that the product is delivered to you through couriers and note that the delivery is guaranteed.

Initially inspired by the concept of remote-controlled RC models, all sorts of sports appliances, and snowboarding, we finished the first-generation prototype in 2013, a cross-country e-board with independent suspension shock absorption. This prototype won us the national invention patent, along with 7 other patents of original designs. From 2014 to 2019, we completed four generations of prototype production, upgraded the structure and dimensions, added more comprehensive functionalities, lowered energy consumption, enhanced stability, and added remote control. This was an arduous journey of repeated sketch overturns, design revisions, production plans, and road testing…until in 2020, we are one step closer to our ultimate mission: To build the Best Electric Off-Road Skateboard of the World. And yet, we are still on the road...",58.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h1>Club Introduction</h1>
<p>Sydney Mountain Bike Club aka Sydney MTB
Riders is a not for profit association formed to provide a social riding
experience for mountain bike riders in the Sydney metropolitan area after a
niche was identified. It caters for all levels and styles of Mountain Bike
riding for those in the Sydney Metro area, something that has never existed
until now. Clubs have been formed for outer Sydney such as Western, Southern
and Northern areas but never for the Sydney metro area.</p>
<p>Sydney MTB Riders was formed in December
of 2012 and has enjoyed great growth via its Facebook group (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/sydneymtb"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>https://www.facebook.com/groups/sydneymtb</u></a> ) with over 900 members of that group. We have been
very casual up until now and this year we are pushing into a more formal
arrangement with a paid membership scheme and organised rides and/or events. </p>
<p>2014/2015 is going to be huge for us! We
are currently in the process of designing jerseys for the club members to
purchase, organising formal club ride events around Sydney and beyond, assignment
of officials to serve as the club board and so much more.</p>
<p>We have several platforms for members to
communicate with the club and each other. These include, Facebook Group,
Facebook Page and Club Webpage (<a href=""http://sydneymtb.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://sydneymtb.org</u></a> or <a href=""http://sydneymtb.asn.au/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>http://sydneymtb.asn.au</u></a> ).</p>
<p>We have worked hard to build a member
base that includes enthusiastic and active people and the Facebook group
is a testament to the quality of conversation and enthusiasm of members with
multiple new topics posted each day with each drawing many comments in
discussion. </p>
<p>The club was formed by Nathan Organ. His
background includes mountain bike riding since the mid 1990’s and carries right
through to today, still being a very active rider.</p>
<p>Nathan thus far has been the sole driver
for the formation of this club with all funding provided by him personally.
This has included the formation of the association and tax registration,
merchandise such as stickers and initial jerseys, design of logo and website
and more. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
</div>
<h2>Use of funds</h2>
<p>Money will go towards developing the club profile by participating in events and organising rides on trails around Sydney. </p>
<p>Sydney MTB riders is also planning an event like no other. It will bring the off road mountain biking experience to the city and allow those who may not ordinarily be able to experience this kind of riding. Think Cockatoo Island or Hyde Park bush riding experience!</p>

We provide an online marketing platform for micro-entrepreneurs that have interest and motivation in sharing local knowledge, activities, experience, and skills to connect directly with curious travelers visiting their areas. Travelers get a secure and immersive experience while local entrepreneurs gain opportunity to build their own small business. </p><h3 style=""text-align: left;""><b>WE PUT MICRO-ENTREPRENEURS ON THE TOURISM MAP</b></h3><p style=""text-align: justify;"">According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), over 383 million travelers visit low and middle income countries each year. This number is expected to hit 1 billion by 2030, and account for nearly 60% of the tourism market. Vayando is an innovative new model for travel and works to bring these tourism dollars directly to the local level.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Currently, many skilled
micro-entrepreneurs are excluded from the tourism sector and are looking for
opportunity to sustain and grow their small business. Two major obstacles to
growth include 1) a lack of access to financing and working capital, and 2)
insufficient access to markets. Vayando addresses both. </span></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Vayando coordinates with reputable in-country field-partner organizations - such as Peace Corps, Oxfam, and Care International - to identify motivated and reputable entrepreneurs and work with them in creating an online profile (Eg. see ""Tailoring with Claudine"" below). The vast majority of micro-entrepreneurs have never been online, but have a marketable skill and also own a basic cell phone.

All of the pieces are in place. We just need a bit of financing to take this project to scale. Please take a minute to read about what we are doing. THE PROBLEMIf you've traveled in developing countries, you know that it can be difficult to confidently step off the plane or bus and connect directly with local people not in the traditional travel guide, and trust that your tourism dollars have a positive impact on the communities you visit. Local people often have a valuable trade, skill, or knowledge base to offer - and are looking for opportunity - but lack ways of marketing themselves to travelers online.VAYANDO IS A TOOL TO CHANGE THAT Vayando is a startup social enterprise that connects curious travelers with micro-entrepreneurs in emerging economies around the world. We provide an online marketing platform for micro-entrepreneurs that have interest and motivation in sharing local knowledge, activities, experience, and skills to connect directly with curious travelers visiting their areas. Travelers get a secure and immersive experience while local entrepreneurs gain opportunity to build their own small business. WE PUT MICRO-ENTREPRENEURS ON THE TOURISM MAPAccording to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), over 383 million travelers visit low and middle income countries each year. This number is expected to hit 1 billion by 2030, and account for nearly 60% of the tourism market. Vayando is an innovative new model for travel and works to bring these tourism dollars directly to the local level.Currently, many skilled
micro-entrepreneurs are excluded from the tourism sector and are looking for
opportunity to sustain and grow their small business. Two major obstacles to
growth include 1) a lack of access to financing and working capital, and 2)
insufficient access to markets. Vayando addresses both. Vayando coordinates with reputable in-country field-partner organizations - such as Peace Corps, Oxfam, and Care International - to identify motivated and reputable entrepreneurs and work with them in creating an online profile (Eg. see ""Tailoring with Claudine"" below). The vast majority of micro-entrepreneurs have never been online, but have a marketable skill and also own a basic cell phone. Travelers browse through online profiles in the country they are traveling and book experiences with these individuals, or the cooperatives they are members of. Bookings are easily confirmed and managed through Vayando's integrated online and SMS based platform. Payment is made securely via mobile money. Entrepreneurs only need to be able to receive and send text messages.Activities marketed include local farming, animal husbandry, agroforestry, beekeeping, fishing, shopkeeping, local food preparation, the arts, cottage industries, handicraft production, coffee harvesting, guiding services, public health outreach opportunities, environmental conservation initiatives, community development efforts, and cooperative level production. The possibilities are endless. Managing a Vayando profile is free for entrepreneurs. Vayando is not aid, it is not a handout, and it is not a loan. Vayando is a market-based transaction between a traveler and a local with a valuable skill. REDESIGNING TRAVEL We envision a travel landscape where millions of curious travelers connect directly with tens of thousands of off-the-grid entrepreneurs to learn about their livelihoods. Many entrepreneurs can double their monthly income with just two or three bookings per month, and by sharing what they are already doing as part of their livelihood strategy. Knowledge transfer typically follows a first world to developing world trajectory. Vayando reverses that by promoting the value of local skills and expertise. Utilizing locally appropriate technology, Vayando directly connects curious travelers with micro-entrepreneurs, and creates a positive impact. Our goal is to be operational in upwards of 100 countries.THE SOCIAL IMPACTVayando's objective is to utilize growth in the travel

The growth of small business has a ripple effect creating jobs and reducing poverty in the communities where they are operating.By tapping into just 1% of tourist visits in Vayando’s 100 country goal we estimate a combined annual income of over $35 million USD for Vayando's micro-entrepreneurial partners. With current and projected growth in travel to Vayando's target countries, however, the potential benefit is much greater. To have a sustainable impact - and be a viable business model - Vayando captures an industry standard booking fee for each transaction, added on at the time of booking and not deducted from the entrepreneur's earning. Being for-profit means that we are responsive to our customer and client needs and not dependent on financial support from donors. To

OUR STORY The idea of linking travelers with micro-entrepreneurs originated a number of years ago when Vayando co-founders Jason Seagle and Scott Wilhelm worked together in Peace Corps El Salvador.Based in rural northern Morazán, El Salvador, near the border with Honduras, Jason met a lot of local entrepreneurs with unique skills and great work ethic, but few marketing opportunities. Jason turned to many of these community members to lead technical workshops when new Peace Corps agroforestry trainee groups would visit his host community. Trainings addressed hillside farming techniques, fruit tree production, beekeeping, etc. The quality of their trainings was always high and these entrepreneurial folks took pride in sharing their knowledge. Seeing entrepreneur's children watch their parents share their local expertise to groups of foreigners made a big impression on Jason. Since Peace Corps, Jason has continued working in the humanitarian sector specializing in agricultural and small business development. Scott’s take was a bit different, and started with a bang. After a volcanic eruption displaced Scott and his host community, he was forced to reside in a hostel a few miles from the village. During his time in the hostel, Scott met countless travelers from all over the world and oftentimes provided valuable insight into local things to do. When travelers found out that Scott spent his days back in his village their eyes lit up and they would ask if they could go spend a day in the community, many said it was an experience they would pay for. Since Peace Corps, Scott has worked with the U.S. Migrant Education Program in Illinois. Combined, the founders and
key management team of Vayando have nearly three decades of experience working

already received positive feedback and support from a wide range of travel and
international development experts, including the Deputy Director of Micro-Finance at the United Nations and the Minister of Tourism in Rwanda,
our pilot country. We were recently accepted into the United Nations World Tourism Knowledge Network. In order to get Vayando fully off the ground, however, we need your support! THE ASK!We need $15,000 to launch in Rwanda and begin taking this project to scale. We have established a network of in-country field partners in Rwanda that are working to identify and support entrepreneurs in creating online profiles. We've already begun reaching out to potential field partners in neighboring East African countries and have a 100 country goal in mind. Vayando is all about community. While a financial contribution has the greatest direct impact, we also need your support in helping us build community and promote our campaign. Please share the following link throughout your networks to help us in getting out the word: http://igg.me/at/vayando-curious-travel.Your contribution will help us create a new form of immersive travel and put micro-entrepreneurs on the tourism map. Even small contributions go a long way. Once the campaign is complete, Vayando co-founder and field coordinator, Scott Wilhelm will be based in Kigali, Rwanda to oversee operations and ensure quality control. BUDGET BREAKDOWNSpecifically, our funding goal will cover IT development, early marketing, and travel and operating costs needed to go live. We've set our funding amount relatively low to better ensure that we reach our goal and hit our first milestone, launching our pilot in Rwanda. Surpassing our goal will go towards continued expansion in East Africa and beyond. The breakdown below provides an overview of how meeting and exceeding our funding goal will be utilized. 

 
OUR PERKSIn exchange for your contribution, we have some great perks, many sourced from the types of local entrepreneurs that we'll be working with. This is a great opportunity to pick up something unique, while supporting entrepreneurs and helping get Vayando off the ground. We're offering handmade cards and baskets from Rwanda, organic and fair trade chai tea from Firepot Chai, wood block prints by William Etheridge, custom fine art photo prints from Vayando co-founder and humanitarian photographer Jason Seagle, and beautiful Kenyan-made jewelry imported by Amsha Studio. Click here to see an image gallery of perks. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about Vayando. We're extremely excited for this project and grateful for your contribution to our campaign! ENTREPRENEUR PROFILE, AN EXAMPLE Mama Claudine is one
of the first entrepreneurs that Vayando will be marketing. Mama Claudine is the head of a local seamstress association in rural northwestern Rwanda, and would love for travelers to come spend the day learning her trade. She'll take you to the market to buy local fabric and help you negotiate a fair price with traders, then head back to her shop to work with you in designing your own clothing or bag design on one her three foot peddled sewing machines. She confirms the booking using her basic cell phone. Other early entrepreneurs are ready to go in Rwanda. Again, our goal is to develop tens of thousands of entrepreneur profiles such as this in upwards of 100 countries. VAYANDO BOARD OF ADVISORS Vayando’s board of

level. This means the snow comes early and leaves late. Our Park is only a few
hundred feet above sea level
and rarely receives measurable or sustained snowfall.














Q. When will we have a lift
installed?
A. The window for completion of
lift installation is Sumer 2014 - Spring 2015 and is predicated on lift
selection. We are accepting bids from lift manufacturers now. A
key component is determining the correct rider capacity.
This campaign will offer some great insight into what that rider
capacity must be. Once capacity is determined we can make an
informed decision on which product is most appropriate. The window to
complete installation depending on lift is Summer 2014 to Spring 2015.
Q How do I redeem my
lift pass?
A.  We will send you a
printable “voucher” with a confirmation code. This voucher will be redeemable
for admission to the park.
Q.
If I purchase the 4 day Pass Package will I receive 4 unique
vouchers?
A.
Yes, plus each one of these vouchers makes you eligible to sign up for any of
the exclusive pre-opening ride days.
Q. If I purchase the 4 day
pass package are there any restrictions on redemption?
 A.
There are 0 restrictions on redemption. You can redeem with friends on one
day or use it your self on four separate days. Each pass is
redeemable for one day on the mountain.
Q. Does this mean the passes are
fully transferable?
A. Yes
the passes are fully transferable before redeemed.
Q. When is the earliest I could
redeem my pass?

A. We are planning to have exclusive park preview
days starting in early 2014.

We watched as many gathered to exalt the wonderful name of Jesus. Amongst those who were in attendance, was a newly formed group from the island of Savai'i in Western Samoa. This is the only Apostolic group on the island. Those who attended made great sacrifices selling coconuts just to attend their very first conference. I had the privilege of baptizing many of them at the conclusion of the conference including the village chief. Their zeal and excitement for the revelation of the name of Jesus is truly apostolic. The conversion of the chief resulted in him giving this newly formed work sufficient land to build a permanent place of worship in the village. The foundation has been laid, the walls have been erected and parts of the roof have just been placed. The building is still needing about $5000 (US) worth of work to be done. However, with $2000, they will be able to accomplish enough of the carpentry and masonry to be able to conduct services in the nearly completed facility. </p>
<p>My wife and I are attempting to spearhead this campaign because we have confidence that through our network of friends and your network of friends, together we can complete this project and share a part in the harvest of souls in Savai'i, Samoa. </p>
<p>What we are asking is quite simple. We are asking you to be a part by giving a $20 gift into this fund. Time is of the essence as our missionaries (Bennie and Pat Blunt) to the Samoas' will be retiring in a few short weeks. The dedication of this building would be a great way to culminate their 15+ years of service to the people of Samoa. We believe that God will speak to at least 200 people to give $20 each during this campaign. Is He speaking to you?</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p><br/></p>

The foundation has been laid, the walls have been erected and parts of the roof have just been placed. The building is still needing about $5000 (US) worth of work to be done. However, with $2000, they will be able to accomplish enough of the carpentry and masonry to be able to conduct services in the nearly completed facility. 
My wife and I are attempting to spearhead this campaign because we have confidence that through our network of friends and your network of friends, together we can complete this project and share a part in the harvest of souls in Savai'i, Samoa. 
What we are asking is quite simple. We are asking you to be a part by giving a $20 gift into this fund. Time is of the essence as our missionaries (Bennie and Pat Blunt) to the Samoas' will be retiring in a few short weeks. The dedication of this building would be a great way to culminate their 15+ years of service to the people of Samoa. We believe that God will speak to at least 200 people to give $20 each during this campaign. Is He speaking to you?
Respectfully,

Rev. Michael Loscalzo",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Located in Southeast Asia between India and Thailand, it has a cultural background deeply rooted in Buddhism, Islam and, more recently, Christianity. The landscape is dotted with golden temples and ancient statues from the Himalayan foothills to tropical coastlines, from arid lowlands to dense jungles. This land of contrasts is home to an even greater diversity of people. The government officially recognizes 135 ethnic groups, but the true number is unknown.  Each of these groups is culturally unique with opulent histories and customs. We are keen to explore the rich cultural heritage of this largely undocumented country.<br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Why Now?</b></p><p>Unique Burmese traditions are rapidly disappearing. After a military regime took over the government in 1962, Myanmar quickly became one of the most isolated countries in the world -- third in line behind North Korea and Somalia. This policy of seclusion had detrimental effects on the economy and public welfare, but interestingly it did much to preserve the traditions native to Myanmar. When the regime dissolved in 2011, the country opened its rusty doors to an exploding Asian market. Burmese people are now faced with a world dominated by 21st century technologies like the Internet and personal cell phones. Telecom companies in Myanmar already plan to reach 90% of the population within the next five years (<i>Economist</i>, Jan 2015.)

<ul>
<li>
<p>Our lifestyle candles are the best in India, and up there in the world too. We know how to make candles!

Our lifestyle candles are the best in India, and up there in the world too. We know how to make candles! Our focus has always been to use the best all natural ingredients and sell a really high quality product.  We make awesome products.  However doing lifestyle in India doesn't help the people that need help in India.  So we designed a household candle, naming it LUNA (moon in Italian) and with this product we can help change things in this country.

:)
I want to bring a candle that is less toxic and way better value to the consumer.  I think everyone deserves to no be polluted by toxic agents whilst trying to have some light in the darkness.

The size and scope of this project is immense.  Millions of people could benefit from this candle and its properties. 
What We Need & What You Get:

We need 50,000 dollars to start an automated manufacturing unit.  The funds go to buying machines to enable us to make these LUNA candles at scale.
The wonderful perks you get are all natural beeswax candles that have plant extracts for colour, pure essential oils for fragrances and natural cotton wicks.  These candles are totally amazing and their quality is unparalleled.
 If we don’t reach our goal, the funding goes towards building semi automated machines that will eventually help us to reach our automated manufacturing goal.
The Impact:

This project is awesome purely from a karma perspective, as it brings a clean affordable light source to India.  Think of the little kid that is sitting in their home trying to study or play and instead of breathing in toxic fumes from a terrible candle that his or her parents are burning for them, they could be lighting their room from our clean burning LUNA household candle.
We have managed to make incredibly good all natural lifestyle candles and now want to transform our knowledge and apply it to the bottom of the pyramid.
The success of this project will bring a healthier alternative to 800 million people in India plus you get some awesome candles in the process too!

Thus, we decided to name it ""the SIX.""</strong> </p><p><strong>The SIX was created for you</strong>, the modern traveler. G-RO’s unique take on 4-wheel luggage is the result of unparalleled innovation, incorporating the highest principles of industrial design, engineering and material science. After years of multidisciplinary research and hundreds of thousands of miles of travel, G-RO developed the concept of ‘push’ luggage. </p><p>With the new push configuration, the user's body weight acts as a counterbalance, requiring zero additional energy to roll the bag. It makes maneuvering through crowded places, and navigating through narrow airplane aisles, as easy as pushing a baby stroller.  </p><div data-id=""25519273""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1562707761/w2z5oxmm4wd74kqx8n68.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><h1> <strong>Features &amp; Components:</strong> </h1><div data-id=""25600510""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1562707761/dcglkyt3v4ho5jzjrann.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h3> </h3><h3><strong>PUSH FORWARD - Changing the Rules of the Game</strong></h3><p><strong>This bag was created for effortless travel: what does this mean and how does the SIX do it?</strong></p><p>The SIX was designed to always be pushed forward, virtually eliminating all the effort required when using traditional luggage. When we lug or roll other bags, we use muscle groups we don't activate regularly. This can create major pain and discomfort. Pushing forward concentrates the entire activity on the main muscle groups we already use on a daily basis. As a result of this design, the SIX is the healthiest travel bag ever created. All travel-related pain - in the wrists, arms, shoulders, neck, elbow, and back - is eliminated. It makes travel truly effortless. </p><div data-id=""25524353""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1562707762/doolw2uwj8l2zeh0utak.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h3> </h3><h3>
<strong>Forming a Perfect</strong> <strong>Rectangle  </strong>
</h3><p>One advantage of the hard-shell design is the ability to design the bag so it fits perfectly within the required dimensions for a carry-on bag. The SIX utilizes every cubic millimeter of the 22”x14”x9” dimensions for packing space or the components of the bag. Even when overpacking, the bag will compress your belongings to the allowed size and will always fit in the sizer and the overhead bin - no surprises when you arrive for your flight! </p><div data-id=""25516001""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1562707763/kfu3agqnvknxzyh6wpzp.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><h3> </h3><h3>
<strong>Superior Maneuverability</strong> </h3><p>The SIX will roll and maneuver on many different terrains and surfaces without ever needing to pick it up and carry it. If the terrain is a bit rough, simply apply a small amount of pressure on the handle (extend the main handle all the way up for improved leverage) to lift the spinners from the ground, and the bag will roll on its back axle-less wheels to smoothly conquer any terrain. That’s right – we encourage you to pop a wheelie with the SIX!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1482/4306/files/A1-D-optimized.gif?75397"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Super Spacious</strong></h3><p>The SIX is a super spacious bag. By recessing all of the components into the polycarbonate shell, lowering the bottom and lifting the top, we optimized the internal volume for a carry-on. We kept the internal compartmentalization simple and clean to reduce the weight and the complications of packing. The SIX offers 38L of pure packing volume. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1482/4306/files/packing_gif_12sec_15MB.gif?75399"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>Superior Rolling</strong></h3><p>Since our first project, G-RO has been recognized for its large-diameter, axle-less wheels (which never break and come with a lifetime warranty). We have developed world-class expertise in the field of luggage wheels. We have now taken that expertise to the next level and have conquered the spinner wheel. Specifically for this bag, we developed durable full-bearing wheels, complete with lightweight and silent polyurethane tires for unmatched rolling. The combination of two of our signature GravityRoll™ wheels in the back and two of our new, custom G-RO spinner wheels in the front creates a bag that rolls like nothing on the market. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1482/4306/files/G-RO-Spinner-v01.gif?75400"" src=""""/></p><p>Each of our wheels has passed rigorous testing, which simulates real-life abuse, and we guarantee them for life.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1482/4306/files/A6-2B-optimized.gif?75399"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>Advanced handles</strong></h3><p>We angled the main handle at precisely 66 degrees for effortless steering. This handle is made of magnesium tubes and coated with a protective layer of oven-cured paint for lightness, structural strength, and durability.</p><p>The SIX’s main handle features a unique mechanism that splits the handle in half, with a special lock to make sure it’s firmly locked when in use, and a patent-pending “throttle grip” for extension.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1482/4306/files/A2-B-optimized_2.gif?75402"" src=""""/></p><p>We used 2 single-tube profiles for this bag, due to its special function and configuration, and used magnesium instead of aluminum to reduce the weight.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1482/4306/files/G-RO-Handle-v02_1.gif?75402"" src=""""/></p><p>All handles are recessed in the shell for impact protection and increased durability. The main handle is recessed at the corners into a special casing that protects the handle from impact.</p><p>This revolutionary handle has passed a wide range of tests and meets or exceeds industry standards for strength, functionality, and durability. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1482/4306/files/A8-D-optimized.gif?75403"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>A completely flat top </strong></h3><p>During long wait times spent sitting at the gate, in the food court, in a busy lounge, or on public transportation, we could always use a little personal space. The only physical item that we carry with us is our bag. For that reason, we created the SIX with a completely flat top so it can be utilized for our needs, even if just to place a cup of coffee, a laptop, or put our feet up for a few minutes. You will be surprised how useful this feature is once you start using it. </p><div> </div><div data-id=""25445514""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><div data-dimensions='{""width"":680,""height"":382}' data-image=""https://d15chbti7ht62o.cloudfront.net/assets/025/445/514/02b0e7608d3757d3037ada2518236462_h264_base.jpg?2019"" data-video-url=""https://v.kickstarter.com/1562792104_01e7fb5749c5ccf7a0f5f0a377cb411d84ca8fa2/assets/025/445/514/02b0e7608d3757d3037ada2518236462_h264_high.mp4""><div>

We have decided to dedicate our most exclusive piece of “real estate” on our G-ROs to support a goal, make a stand, or simply display an aesthetic message that will encourage and inspire the world and our society to be a better, more tolerant and happy place to live in. Every week we will introduce a new wheel design with a different theme.</p><div data-caption=""The Pride Edition"" data-id=""25716684""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""The Pride Edition"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1562707771/juswp2e6yjmusdvqwmba.jpg"" src=""""/><figcaption><i>The Pride Edition</i></figcaption></figure></div><p>We at G-RO want to support all humans in their pursuit for self-fulfillment and happiness.

<strong>The SIX And TSA</strong> </h3><p>The SIX is equipped with a TSA-compliant lock - with one slide of the lever, the bag's aluminum channel is locked in two locations. </p><p>To open the SIX, you first open the lock on the handle and then slide the main lock upwards to unlock it. To lock it, you will lock the bag first, making sure none of the contents are trapped in the aluminum channel, and then lock the main handle sections together.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/1482/4306/files/A3-C-optimized.gif?75407"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h2><strong>The G-RO Way: R&amp;D Process</strong></h2><p>We are a very small company with a small R&amp;D team, but through our own unique methods, we're able to deliver innovative, sophisticated products on a large scale. We are a paperless company, mainly because our R&amp;D team members are constantly traveling and collaborating remotely. </p><p>Our process begins with very extensive research, the findings of which are eventually narrowed down to a singular document: the design brief. This document takes these findings and translates them into clear objectives to deliver in our product design. It acts as the architectural framework for the design and includes every detail that will be incorporated in the product.  </p><p>Then, there are three steps in our design process:</p><ul>
<li> <strong>Architecture</strong>: the “pillar” of the design. This includes all the detail about what the product will do, how it will function, what features it will include, and what the product will accomplish for the user.</li>
<li> <strong>Mechanics</strong>: after we know what we want to build and we’ve laid out the frame, we begin to execute it and decide on the materials, how things are going to perform, and how everything will work mechanically. This is where many considerations come into play, such as manufacturing and logistics capability.</li>
<li> <strong>Cosmetics</strong>: the cosmetic decisions complete the process and include all of the aesthetic and branding decisions that do not affect the performance of the product. This includes commercial aspects such as color (outside and inside), textures of the lining and exterior, density of the mesh, and zippers that are not structural, as well as identifying and addressing potential concerns like scratching or fading. </li>
</ul><p>As we go through each step, factors inevitably arise and affect the previous steps. For example, we might find that a certain feature we planned to include in the architecture was not mechanically possible to implement. At that point, we would revisit the previous step and find the best way to update our plans and move forward.</p><div data-id=""25517040""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1562707773/jqphfeho8nstkwkxww1b.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""25517151""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1562707774/bsqfrceqnv8cfezatxni.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""25523076""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><div data-dimensions='{""width"":680,""height"":382}' data-image=""https://d15chbti7ht62o.cloudfront.net/assets/025/523/076/f37e43af6536bdd8b272eb41e090b5d9_h264_base.jpg?2019"" data-video-url=""https://v.kickstarter.com/1562792105_b31c2fde710fc8d5f54aab79277a182ee39e279a/assets/025/523/076/f37e43af6536bdd8b272eb41e090b5d9_h264_high.mp4""> <div>

<h2>Risks and challenges</h2>
<p>While manufacturing a product has become easier in today's well-connected world, it’s still a complex challenge. To best prepare for the challenges ahead, we've partnered with supply chain and manufacturing experts and have recruited advisers and board members, who can provide expert advice and help us tackle challenges in production, engineering, and retail management. <br/>We have developed our plan for manufacturing in Asia and for shipping to our backers around the world. We have sourced the factories for all of G-RO’s major components. For the last five years, we've been developing long-term working relationships with these manufacturers, and they have been invaluable, active partners during our prototype development phase. They have approved the SIX design for its manufacturability and are committed to its success. During the production process, we expect to make minor changes to optimize the design based on consumer feedback and our own experience in traveling with the SIX. On the logistics side, we have established partnerships with a US fulfillment house and international shippers to help the bags get to where they’re going quickly and safely. <br/>Although it's difficult to plan for every unforeseen circumstance, such as political or economic events that might delay production or delivery, we've created contingency plans should these type of problems arise. Nevertheless, we are certain to face unexpected challenges throughout this journey and will do our best to solve them quickly. We pledge to keep our backers well-informed in a timely manner throughout the entire production process and to do everything we can to deliver the SIX to each of you as planned.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Sustainability Efforts</h2>
<p><strong>Long-lasting design</strong></p>
<p>Inherently, luggage has to be strong and the SIX was designed for maximum durability. This depends on choosing the best raw material and design for durability so that the bag and all of the components will last and endure.</p>
<p>Starting with the design process, we specifically created a bag in which most of the components can be accessed and removed easily, both by factory workers and consumers. This way, if a single part fails, it can simply be repaired or replaced without replacing the entire product. Because we're dealing with volumetric products, (sending entire product costs more in gas, weight, etc). So, to minimize the carbon footprint, we have established a three-stage process to manage component failure with the minimal shipping needs. First, we’ll send part to customer for self-replacement. If this is not possible, our second step would be to send the customer to a local repair facility. Because the journey to a repair shop usually requires a vehicle, which also adds to the carbon footprint, we try to reduce the need for this option as much as possible. Finally, we have the bag shipped back to our offices for repair or replacement only when necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Reusability and recyclability</strong></p>
<p>Although our product is assembled of many different parts, 85% of the product components are made of a single recyclable material. We do need to disassemble it in order to recycle it, but we ensured that as much of the bag as possible was made from a single material. The main part of the luggage (the chassis) will never stop functioning, and the components can almost all be repaired or replaced as needed, so the bag shouldn’t ever have cause to be thrown away. When someone decides to move on from our product, they can always pass it on to someone else, i.e. by selling or donating it, for continued use. We encourage our customers to donate used luggage to local charities.</p>
<p><strong>Environmentally friendly factories</strong></p>
<p>Every member of our supply chain - from vendors to suppliers to factories - is examined, tested and certified for environmental impact in accordance with local laws and regulations, and all work within their respective local requirements regarding environmental and ecological standards. These dictate standards regarding noise, water pollution, heavy metals, toxicity, air quality, labor conditions (age of employment, basic working environment), and more. Because our factories are operating at a high level with good working conditions, they have low turnover rates and the workers become experts in the field - both with luggage as a whole, and specifically with G-RO - and are able to operate much more efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable fulfillment and distribution</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to reduce the size of our carbon footprint as much as possible, which is achieved with efficiency and by reducing the carried volume, mileage, and ocean freight. We plan to ship as much as possible by ground instead of by sea or air. We are also planning to use trains vs roads for ground transport because they are more economically friendly. Finally, we intend to aggregate and consolidate</p>

Thus, we decided to name it ""the SIX."" The SIX was created for you, the modern traveler. G-RO’s unique take on 4-wheel luggage is the result of unparalleled innovation, incorporating the highest principles of industrial design, engineering and material science. After years of multidisciplinary research and hundreds of thousands of miles of travel, G-RO developed the concept of ‘push’ luggage. With the new push configuration, the user's body weight acts as a counterbalance, requiring zero additional energy to roll the bag. It makes maneuvering through crowded places, and navigating through narrow airplane aisles, as easy as pushing a baby stroller.    Features & Components:  PUSH FORWARD - Changing the Rules of the GameThis bag was created for effortless travel: what does this mean and how does the SIX do it?The SIX was designed to always be pushed forward, virtually eliminating all the effort required when using traditional luggage. When we lug or roll other bags, we use muscle groups we don't activate regularly. This can create major pain and discomfort. Pushing forward concentrates the entire activity on the main muscle groups we already use on a daily basis. As a result of this design, the SIX is the healthiest travel bag ever created. All travel-related pain - in the wrists, arms, shoulders, neck, elbow, and back - is eliminated. It makes travel truly effortless.  
Forming a Perfect Rectangle  
One advantage of the hard-shell design is the ability to design the bag so it fits perfectly within the required dimensions for a carry-on bag. The SIX utilizes every cubic millimeter of the 22”x14”x9” dimensions for packing space or the components of the bag. Even when overpacking, the bag will compress your belongings to the allowed size and will always fit in the sizer and the overhead bin - no surprises when you arrive for your flight!  
Superior Maneuverability The SIX will roll and maneuver on many different terrains and surfaces without ever needing to pick it up and carry it. If the terrain is a bit rough, simply apply a small amount of pressure on the handle (extend the main handle all the way up for improved leverage) to lift the spinners from the ground, and the bag will roll on its back axle-less wheels to smoothly conquer any terrain. That’s right – we encourage you to pop a wheelie with the SIX! Super SpaciousThe SIX is a super spacious bag. By recessing all of the components into the polycarbonate shell, lowering the bottom and lifting the top, we optimized the internal volume for a carry-on. We kept the internal compartmentalization simple and clean to reduce the weight and the complications of packing. The SIX offers 38L of pure packing volume.  Superior RollingSince our first project, G-RO has been recognized for its large-diameter, axle-less wheels (which never break and come with a lifetime warranty). We have developed world-class expertise in the field of luggage wheels. We have now taken that expertise to the next level and have conquered the spinner wheel. Specifically for this bag, we developed durable full-bearing wheels, complete with lightweight and silent polyurethane tires for unmatched rolling. The combination of two of our signature GravityRoll™ wheels in the back and two of our new, custom G-RO spinner wheels in the front creates a bag that rolls like nothing on the market. Each of our wheels has passed rigorous testing, which simulates real-life abuse, and we guarantee them for life. Advanced handlesWe angled the main handle at precisely 66 degrees for effortless steering. This handle is made of magnesium tubes and coated with a protective layer of oven-cured paint for lightness, structural strength, and durability.The SIX’s main handle features a unique mechanism that splits the handle in half, with a special lock to make sure it’s firmly locked when in use, and a patent-pending “throttle grip” for extension.We used 2 single-tube profiles for this bag, due to its special function and configuration, and used magnesium instead of aluminum to reduce the weight.All handles are recessed in the shell for impact protection and increased durability. The main handle is recessed at the corners into a special casing that protects the handle from impact.This revolutionary handle has passed a wide range of tests and meets or exceeds industry standards for strength, functionality, and durability.  A completely flat top During long wait times spent sitting at the gate, in the food court, in a busy lounge, or on public transportation, we could always use a little personal space. The only physical item that we carry with us is our bag. For that reason, we created the SIX with a completely flat top so it can be utilized for our needs, even if just to place a cup of coffee, a laptop, or put our feet up for a few minutes. You will be surprised how useful this feature is once you start using it.  

 
Tough and DurableThe SIX has been tested and passed a series of aggressive tests that simulate both real-world and extreme scenarios. We do this in order to make sure the bag we deliver to you will endure and last. 

 
We Are our WheelsIn a world of industrial manufacturing where products are made in large numbers, there is very little place for personalization. We have decided to dedicate our most exclusive piece of “real estate” on our G-ROs to support a goal, make a stand, or simply display an aesthetic message that will encourage and inspire the world and our society to be a better, more tolerant and happy place to live in. Every week we will introduce a new wheel design with a different theme.The Pride EditionWe at G-RO want to support all humans in their pursuit for self-fulfillment and happiness. The journey is very personal and challenging. This week’s limited edition wheel is dedicated to freedom, love, and sense of purpose. The Skyline Edition We designed these travel-themed wheels with two different versions of the wheel showing silhouetted city-scapes of major cities - one features all U.S. cities and the other showcases cities from around the globe!  The Aviation EditionThis seemed like a natural fit as a luggage brand! Earlier this year, we released a limited edition wheel design inspired by a turbine engine and it was extremely popular. We decided to do a new take on this design, along with one inspired by the material and construction of an airplane.The Racing EditionFor this design we chose a performance-focused theme- racing! With two different designs for race fans to show their pride, we were inspired by the power, consistency and precision required of race cars. 
The SIX And TSA The SIX is equipped with a TSA-compliant lock - with one slide of the lever, the bag's aluminum channel is locked in two locations. To open the SIX, you first open the lock on the handle and then slide the main lock upwards to unlock it. To lock it, you will lock the bag first, making sure none of the contents are trapped in the aluminum channel, and then lock the main handle sections together. The G-RO Way: R&D ProcessWe are a very small company with a small R&D team, but through our own unique methods, we're able to deliver innovative, sophisticated products on a large scale. We are a paperless company, mainly because our R&D team members are constantly traveling and collaborating remotely. Our process begins with very extensive research, the findings of which are eventually narrowed down to a singular document: the design brief. This document takes these findings and translates them into clear objectives to deliver in our product design. It acts as the architectural framework for the design and includes every detail that will be incorporated in the product.  Then, there are three steps in our design process:
 Architecture: the “pillar” of the design. This includes all the detail about what the product will do, how it will function, what features it will include, and what the product will accomplish for the user.
 Mechanics: after we know what we want to build and we’ve laid out the frame, we begin to execute it and decide on the materials, how things are going to perform, and how everything will work mechanically. This is where many considerations come into play, such as manufacturing and logistics capability.
 Cosmetics: the cosmetic decisions complete the process and include all of the aesthetic and branding decisions that do not affect the performance of the product. This includes commercial aspects such as color (outside and inside), textures of the lining and exterior, density of the mesh, and zippers that are not structural, as well as identifying and addressing potential concerns like scratching or fading. 
As we go through each step, factors inevitably arise and affect the previous steps. For example, we might find that a certain feature we planned to include in the architecture was not mechanically possible to implement. At that point, we would revisit the previous step and find the best way to update our plans and move forward.

Use the TiiPii stand to hang your TiiPii bed on your favourite spot on the patio, the porch, or pop it in your garden...Take it on holiday or ping it down to the beach.  To be honest, with our lasso and bolt set, you can hang it absolutely anywhere you very well fancy.And the best part? All our TiiPii Beds compact down better than a contortionist.  Yup, effortlessly right back into a small 70cm convenient carry bag- weighing only 5 - 7kgs.Our classic TiiPii Bed is now officially available in two sizes – 1.5m and 1.8m. Which might not sound like a big difference, but it actually works out at an extra 2.5 feet of space.Both sizes in the cotton canvas material are available in four natural colours that are inspired by the Australian outback. Pair your 1.5m TiiPii Bed with the lasso and bolt set for an easy solution to hang your nest. The bolt is for direct to ceiling installation, or simply loop the lasso over a suitable tree branch or beam to have your hammock bed hanging quicker than you can say “TiiPii time!” Alternatively hang your TiiPii literally anywhere with a collapsible metal stand... Constructed from powder-coated heavy-duty steel that is durable, strong and perfectly paired for outdoor & indoor use. It’s easily assembled in 5-10 minutes without any tools and packs down just as quickly to allow you the freedom of a truly nomadic lifestyle. You can now also treat your little ‘uns to a den of their own with one of our brand new kids-sized TiiPii Beds.  Exactly the same high-quality build as our adult TiiPii, but perfectly sized for a couple of kids and a whole bunch of finger paints. Don’t worry if it gets messy, you can always pop your TiiPii in the washing machine for quick, easy clean up!Take comfort & relaxation to a whole new level with our extra-special Poolside TiiPii. Made with a unique 'Sunbrella' material that repels any sort of liquid, it's perfect for heavy use areas inside & out. Or partner it with our TiiPii stand & comforter set for the ultimate luxury poolside chill out. Material is characteristically similar to a sun lounger so is 100% made for cocktails & maximum enjoyment. Risk Free PurchasesRest assured this isn't our first rodeo - you're not purchasing a prototype or untried product. We've been around for the past 3 years and won't stop until we put smiles on a whole lot more faces. So if we miss our target, don't worry, we'll still send you your TiiPii - it'll just take us a bit longer to scale up to full capacity and kick our goals. So no matter what you can expect to receive your TiiPii early 2018.  But we'll be sure to keep you updated!Other Ways You Can HelpKnow someone who could really do with their own private chill spot? Well then let them take advantage of our super limited discounts by sharing our campaign with them.  Or perhaps just drop a  few discreet hints to a loved one if you fancy one all to yourself…Either that or just give us a shout out on social media and we'd love you big time… It all helps heaps!  “I work from home but can find it hard to either focus during the day, or fully relax afterwards. My TiiPii helps me to do both. I often now take my laptop & sit inside - it really inspires me.”“We love its size and how easy it is to put up and pack up.  It hangs under the pergola on a large hook, that I can easily remove to store or to take with us to the beach.”“My 8 year old daughter and her friends absolutely love laying in there with books, cushions, blankets and music. Even homework can be enjoyed inside! They like the cozy tent feel, gentle breeze and also use it as a cubby house.”“I actually purchased this for the children, but I use it most of the time. I absolutely love it. I have work to do around the house today but instead I’m just going to chill out & read my book in our (my!) TiiPii.”Us folks behind TiiPii are typical Aussies with a whole lot of love for anything to do with the great outdoors.We’re just itching to inspire people to start camping, canoodling, reading or relaxing – to get the kids playing outside once again! Therefore we decided to create a glorious outdoor abode for you to kick back, chill out and watch the world go by in…When we first launched TiiPii Bed, we completely sold out of stock before we had the chance to make more.

There are clearly other funds that can use the money first so please take them into account. I am only asking for whatever you feel you have left over that you would like to spare to a hardworking mommy that has a serious case of wanderlust. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I have had my Seattle trip planned out for about 5 months now, to visit one of the most important people in my life... my best friend, my sister, my lovah lovah. Thing is I recently had lost my job and had to use my savings for the trip to continue paying by bills and supporting my family which of course comes first above all. So i decided instead of answering 500 questions about what i want for my birthday (Oct 3rd) i would just do it this way and forward it to all of  them.</p>
<p>I am passionate about travelling and feel it should be done atleast once a year, you need to get away from stress and remember who you are from time to time. Working like a maniac sends you into an uncomfortable spiral that you need a break from. Hence my seattle trip. </p>

<span style=""font-weight: normal;""><div><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></div>We've been experimenting with the interactions between people and spaces for over 3 years. In 2014 we started combining our learnings with urban design and we realized that we had lots to contribute to this field. We come from the grassroots world, where we do things with very limited resources, fully DIY, moving things with cargo bikes and exchanging work with work. We work with flexible planning and constant iteration. We do things, we quickly evaluate what worked and what didn't and we move forward. Collaborative design and co-creation is getting more and more popular and it's spreading into new fields. When it comes to urban design, pioneers like Danish <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_Gehl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Jan Gehl </a>have been working with co-creation for over 1/2 a century, creating a new field between sociology, psychology and architecture. </span><div>
<br/><div>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">There's lots of books and companies working with co-creation processes, and finally people are getting more and more interested. What we are doing isn't new, we are just doing it in a different way. We are contributing a unique grassroots perspective to it, we are showing how the citizen sector can get things done. </span>

</div>
</div></div>","We are based in the city of Malmö, the world’s 4th most innovative city and home to many different cultures, lifestyles and ideas. Since 2012, we’ve been experimenting with co-creation and designing spaces to share knowledge. During this time we:*Worked with revitalizing neighborhoods built during the 1960s “Million Program” housing scheme*Organized numerous interventions to reclaim public spaces and build community*Mobilized a strong grassroots network to solve local social challenges*Worked in collaborations of many different kinds, from small groups of neighbors to big institutions including cities, regions and universities*Hosted over 60 free and public events for people to share knowledge*Collected tens of thousands of documents, photographs, surveys and more ready to be compiled into a bookOur work has been featured in 
We've been experimenting with the interactions between people and spaces for over 3 years. In 2014 we started combining our learnings with urban design and we realized that we had lots to contribute to this field. We come from the grassroots world, where we do things with very limited resources, fully DIY, moving things with cargo bikes and exchanging work with work. We work with flexible planning and constant iteration. We do things, we quickly evaluate what worked and what didn't and we move forward. Collaborative design and co-creation is getting more and more popular and it's spreading into new fields. When it comes to urban design, pioneers like Danish Jan Gehl have been working with co-creation for over 1/2 a century, creating a new field between sociology, psychology and architecture. 

There's lots of books and companies working with co-creation processes, and finally people are getting more and more interested. What we are doing isn't new, we are just doing it in a different way. We are contributing a unique grassroots perspective to it, we are showing how the citizen sector can get things done. 










During 2015, we translated all of our learnings into one very special pilot project.  Working with the City of Malmö and a local housing agency, we wanted to discover how co-creation and collective intelligence could be an effective way of revitalizing and building community in a neighborhood.


The neighborhood of Persborg, with 2,000 residents from all over the world had a high level of unemployment, a high level of crime and declining local businesses. Many residents reported a low sense of community and mistrust of public institutions. This was where we piloted our methodology.

<div>
<p>————————————————————</p>
<p>The cyclists have been pedalling through the dusty outskirts of Yemen's capital, Sana'a, for just 30 seconds when the first rock comes hurtling at their wheels.</p>
</div>
<p>None of the seven riders so much as flinch, as the perpetrator, a local shopkeeper, identifies himself. He shouts and waves an arm. ""You gays! Cover up!""</p>
<p>Dressed in an eclectic assortment of sun-faded Lycra cycling attire, and riding an archaic selection of bikes in varying state of repair, the group keeps silent, and together, as they keep on pedalling.</p>

<p><strong>Yemen must be one of the few countries in the world where a group of young men, on their morning ride can, and regularly does, attract such anger and ignorance from passersby. Their crime? Wearing shorts and tight jerseys.</strong></p>
<p>As the riders approached the first steep climb, their coach, Saleh al-Riashi, emerges from the sunroof of an accompanying vehicle. He makes this trip three times a week, every week, with near-religious devotion, barking commands out of the car's roof, much like the director of a pro-team on the grand tour.</p>
<p>It is inaccurate to describe the team as the national cycling team of Yemen, simply because they have lacked the resources to travel anywhere as a team since 2006.</p>
<p>Riashi is the only member of the current team to have competed abroad. He says that when they arrived in Egypt in 2006 to compete in the Arab Club Championships, his Yemeni team were almost laughed off the starting line.</p>
<p><em>""Our bikes were probably 20 years old, and our clothes worn … but we soon showed we are serious racers … we finished sixth out of 13 teams and received an apology,""</em> he says.</p>
<p>Riashi, who competed in the 2008 Tour of Sharjah, is now preparing his team for the next challenge, this year's Arab Club Championships, despite some key shortcomings. ""We are probably $2,000-$3,000 dollars short of money to even get our riders to the start line, beyond the problems with our equipment.""</p>
<p>Money, though, is probably the least of the team's worries ahead of the event, which is being held in the United Arab Emirates next month. Leading up the first climb is Yusuf al-Bandani, a skinny <em>grimpeur</em> (climber) who dances on the pedals of his steel bike like a champion from the late 1980s.</p>
<p>The mountains surrounding Sana'a are almost Pyrenean in feel and as Bandani climbs by the bleached, jagged rocks, he could almost be on the famous Mont Ventoux stage of the Tour de France. The air is suitably thin, and as he makes the summit of the climb he is already more than 500 metres higher than that French summit.</p>
<p>It is the scars on the young man's arm that serve as a poignant reminder that he is actually training in Yemen's highlands. ""We had been preparing for ourselves for a regional competition, near Lahj, when an SUV started driving erratically near us.""</p>
<p>Lahj is not somewhere many cycls find themselves. It is the location of al-Anad airbase, which is home to a contingent of US troops and also a hotbed of insurgent activity. It is firmly in the middle of Yemen's wild tribal hinterland.</p>
<p>""We were riding along, when suddenly we were swept off our bikes by a man in a Toyota Landcruiser. Four of our riders were wiped out. We all needed stitches and one rider needed surgery on his arm,"" Bandani says with a matter-of-fact air and a shrug of his shoulders, as if being attacked and nearly killed for riding a bicycle is a normal daily occurrence. ""It's just simple ignorance.""</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8191/8102476189_683fb2a773_z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Sitting down for a post-training tea, Riashi is keen to explain his motivation for cycling, and his determination for Yemen to compete again, at least regionally. It takes him back to the country's civil war in 1994: ""In Yemen, every small kid has a bike and loves riding. I had to stay inside during the war, and came across the Tour de France on French satellite television. I was hooked on racing bikes from them on.</p>
<p>""Most families in Yemen watch the Tour de France on TV and it's extremely popular. My hero is Mark.""</p>
<p>The British sprinter Mark Cavendish is fast becoming a global cycling celebrity and superstar. ""No,"" says Riashi, using his hands to mime a bald head. ""Not Mark Cavendish.""</p>
<p>The group, sensing confusion, jump up in unison and begin to emulate the late Marco Pantani, climbing vigorously on sets of imaginary drop handlebars with his trademark shaved head.</p>
<p>How a diminutive Italian <em>grimpeur</em>, famous for his tenacity in the mountains, became the inspiration for a squad of Yemeni cyclists is still slightly unclear. But if Riashi and his team want to make it to race in the UAE next month, they'll need all the Pantani attacking spirit they can muster.</p>

Your funds will be used for sensors, resistors, materials for housing, tooling and manufacturing.Your support  by sharing  with your friends and your social networks will help us grow the W@P BLE community around the world and helps expend the Cloud data base to further collect the most accurate weather updates.We would like you to be the first users of the  W@P BLE and to take advantage of special value perks we are offering here.MindLabSolution is a small team of skillful enthusiasts from different backgrounds with limited resources and world-changing ideas. We work hard and are all passionate about the concept of Weather@Point and the idea to make it available and affordable to everyone.  The idea of WeatherAtPoint was born back in 2014 and it required a long period of hard work, a big learning curve and many hands-on experiences, to bring it to life from conception. While this process always comes with some level of risk, we have done everything in our power to reduce it as much as possible, learned the main risk factors and how to manage them. We have developed the first model with an audio jack connection, finalized the first series of production and shipped thousands of devices to 60 different countries.From the great support of the first crowdfunding, leading feedback, and many iterations and improvements we have built a reliable, experienced and skilful team of professionals in design, development, testing and logistics. We also established trusting relationships with our suppliers, manufacturers, as well as fulfillment and shipping providers.All the feedback we got from the community has been carefully studied and used towards improvements and a more clear perspective for any future obstacles that we may come acrossAnd here we are back again with the new and improved WeatherAtPoint BLE. Prototype and beta application have been developed and tested, and the pilot series production is finalized. It is now ready for mass production. ***  You can't find an answer in FAQ section?

Our mission is to bring simple and unique technology solutions to you that are both beautiful in design and great in functionality.Here is what George, the co-founder and Business Development guy of Chargest, says about the idea and the product:“I am an adventurer by nature and travel abroad often, both on business and pleasure occasions. I always bring lots of gadgets with me, including two phones and a laptop.  During one of my trips abroad I said to myself - what if I could charge all these with just ONE device and also no longer bother about the outlet standards around the world? And that's how the idea of Chargest was created!”Chris, our co-founder and Technical Adviser, also says:“We designed and engineered Chargest with the typical user in mind - the traveler, the family man, the business person, the student, the list goes on and on. We create our products to be easy to use and to solve the everyday problems of our users. Chargest is the typical example of this!”We are hustlers, that are never satisfied with little and always strive for more.

This requires the gtrol unit to have an active cellular account to communicate.

Our current prototype is manufacturing spec ready, and we need your pledge to help secure our mass production order and provide gtrol at an affordable cost for every one.</p><p>We've partnered with a leading gps manufacturer in Shanghai, China with a solid portfolio of LBS product manufacturing. The hardware product is 100% ready. We made a couple of trips out to the factory to work out our prototype and production unit. We are happy to say that we are working with a final production version as shown on the project page above.</p><p>The gtrol for bike mount is currently a 3D printed prototype, and we've gotten quotes for an injection mold from our manufacturer based on us meeting our production order.</p><p> Our manufacturer has promised a 6-8 week lead time from our production orderfor the complete packaged product delivered to our warehouse in Houston, and we estimate another 4-6 weeks to completely ship out the first backer orders.</p><p>The product is arriving at our warehouse shipping ready, so we will be shipping these out to our backers once it arrives at our warehouse. We already have experience with order fulfillment and electronic shipping tools to handle volume shipments and we've given enough time for shipping fulfillment. We have plans to temporarily staff up/down additional labor as needed.</p><h3>SOFTWARE</h3><p>Our software is beta ready (as shown in the video and screenshots) and will be made available for demo use to our backers at the end of the campaign. </p><p><b>Iphone App</b> - Done!</p><p><b>Pebble App</b> - Done!</p><p><b>Text Control App</b> - Done!</p><p><b>Web Control App </b>-  (under construction) - Feb 2014</p><p><b>Android App</b> (under construction) - April 2014</p><p>We are looking to set up live demo units worldwide so that trial users can actually use the software on live units.

In return, we'll pay for your gtrol service through the demo period and get the best discounted prototype unit for you, and also give you first access to any software release we are looking to make. </p><p>We are looking to get the DEMO users live Feb 2014</p><h2>Risks and challenges</h2><p></p><p>One big challenge we have is making gtrol available for all countries where GSM communication is available (we see no reason why gtrol should not be accessible to anyone in a GSM capable country/network region). However, we do not have cellular network partnership deals like we have done in the US for low M2M prices/bundles. </p><p>Our USA customers will get the gtrol unit already setup with service bundles, but our non-USA customers will have to get a GSM sim card with a data bundle that fits their gtrol use (about 3-5Mb/month average use). The customers will also need to setup the necessary apn settings to get the unit active. Though this seems trivial, it actually is a lot of problem in initial setup for a lot of people. Another issue we've seen is keeping up with the topup/recharge of these SIM cards while in active use (a lot of people forget and their gtrol units become inactive, vs in the USA where we have an auto recharge feature).</p><p>We have put in a lot of software setup wizards to help in this initial configuration and we hope to improve these network setup wizards as we get more feedback use from customers.</p><p>We are looking to see the demand based on different country regions and set up service partnerships to provide low priced wireless bundles and make wireless service options cheaper for the user's in these markets.</p><br/><p></p><h3>Special thanks</h3><p>AnA video Houston</p><p>Ben's Beans Cafe Houston</p><p>David Nguyen studio Houston</p><p>Folks at START Houston</p><p></p>

Ask your car security installer and also see some Compatible remote starters we've listed on our website.The trigger output can also be wired for door lock or door unlock, we prefer unlock before lock, because most of the time, you lock your self out of the car and you wish you had a remote unlock.Door lock: Well, if you are always forgetting to lock your doors, you might want this feature.Starter kill interrupt: If you are in a region of high vehicle theft/kidnapping, this might be great for you. the gtrol output can be wired with an additional relay to disable the vehicle from starting. ** Note that the trigger output only performs one of the above listed functions, not all of them. DIY's can REMOTELY TRIGGER OR MONITOR ANYTHINGFor DIY's you can HACK gtrol to remotely trigger anything else you can think of, remote generators , solar charging systems, e.t.c. See the detailed I/O specs of the expansion kit above. From the software app, you can configure the output behavior, although we've setup the 4 predefined vehicle actions above.Extended Power PackGtrol can be wired with an external usb charging battery pack for extended battery life if you need beyond the generous 4 weeks.WE NEED YOUR HELP!We have completed very successful tests of beta production prototypes of gtrol with our manufacturing partner in China. With your pledge, we can get enough funds to meet the quantities required for a mass production run of gtrol and make gtrol available at an affordable price for all.

Early prototypesEarly prototype of the gtrol unit with the expansion kit all in one.gtrol bike mount, prototype evolutionService pricingUnlike bluetooth locators, gtrol's key advantage is that it works from unlimited range. UNLIMITED RANGE MATTERS, you could be anywhere and gtrol is still there, listening to your requests, and reporting to you.This is possible because gtrol uses the wireless cellular network for communication. This requires the gtrol unit to have an active cellular account to communicate. Think of it as the reason you can call someone on the phone instead of going to physically meet the person. gtrol allows you to reach out to what ever you are following from anywhere no matter how far, i.e your car, pet, loved one, bicycle.We've partnered in the USA with a wireless provider to provide convenient data plans for gtrols in the USA and Puerto Rico. For (international) non-usa customers, you can use gtrol with a sim card from your local provider. We are also working on discounted packages with wireless carriers for different countries.USA BACKERS - WIRELESS SERVICEgtrol is already setup and ready to use out of the box. 

$3/month - Low use plan (good for pets, long term garaged cars e.t.c)


$9.99/month - Standard plan (normal daily users, your average user)


$13.99/month - High use plan (good for businesses or high activity users)

Good for USA and Puerto Rico. See our website for more detailsINTERNATIONAL BACKERS - WIRELESS SERVICE
$60/year  + (local gsm sim card with data plan)
For (international) out of USA backers, you will need a GSM Sim card with at least 2mb - 5mb of data for (low - high) use. Please contact your local wireless carrier on data costs/plans, and also on how to purchase a SIM card.See our website for more detailsInternational users will need to insert their local gsm sim card with 3-5mb of data.Production PlanHARDWAREgtrol is already ready for our mass production order. Our current prototype is manufacturing spec ready, and we need your pledge to help secure our mass production order and provide gtrol at an affordable cost for every one.We've partnered with a leading gps manufacturer in Shanghai, China with a solid portfolio of LBS product manufacturing. The hardware product is 100% ready. We made a couple of trips out to the factory to work out our prototype and production unit. We are happy to say that we are working with a final production version as shown on the project page above.The gtrol for bike mount is currently a 3D printed prototype, and we've gotten quotes for an injection mold from our manufacturer based on us meeting our production order. Our manufacturer has promised a 6-8 week lead time from our production orderfor the complete packaged product delivered to our warehouse in Houston, and we estimate another 4-6 weeks to completely ship out the first backer orders.The product is arriving at our warehouse shipping ready, so we will be shipping these out to our backers once it arrives at our warehouse. We already have experience with order fulfillment and electronic shipping tools to handle volume shipments and we've given enough time for shipping fulfillment. We have plans to temporarily staff up/down additional labor as needed.SOFTWAREOur software is beta ready (as shown in the video and screenshots) and will be made available for demo use to our backers at the end of the campaign. Iphone App - Done!Pebble App - Done!Text Control App - Done!Web Control App -  (under construction) - Feb 2014Android App (under construction) - April 2014We are looking to set up live demo units worldwide so that trial users can actually use the software on live units. Please let us know in the comments section if you are willing to be a demo user (i.e share/promote your adventures and location updates/check-ins to all the gtrol demo users). In return, we'll pay for your gtrol service through the demo period and get the best discounted prototype unit for you, and also give you first access to any software release we are looking to make. We are looking to get the DEMO users live Feb 2014Risks and challengesOne big challenge we have is making gtrol available for all countries where GSM communication is available (we see no reason why gtrol should not be accessible to anyone in a GSM capable country/network region). However, we do not have cellular network partnership deals like we have done in the US for low M2M prices/bundles. Our USA customers will get the gtrol unit already setup with service bundles, but our non-USA customers will have to get a GSM sim card with a data bundle that fits their gtrol use (about 3-5Mb/month average use). The customers will also need to setup the necessary apn settings to get the unit active. Though this seems trivial, it actually is a lot of problem in initial setup for a lot of people. Another issue we've seen is keeping up with the topup/recharge of these SIM cards while in active use (a lot of people forget and their gtrol units become inactive, vs in the USA where we have an auto recharge feature).We have put in a lot of software setup wizards to help in this initial configuration and we hope to improve these network setup wizards as we get more feedback use from customers.We are looking to see the demand based on different country regions and set up service partnerships to provide low priced wireless bundles and make wireless service options cheaper for the user's in these markets.Special thanksAnA video HoustonBen's Beans Cafe HoustonDavid Nguyen studio HoustonFolks at START Houston",40.0,3,"1 Campaign

Bartering With Electricity


Third World kit owners can charge their neighbors' cell phones

One of the more interesting features of Firefly Chargers is that Third World kit owners can charge others' cell phones for goods and services.
As strange as it may seem, a large number of people without electricity have cell phones.  These phones are typically provided by aid organizations and they only get charged occasionally.  Sometimes, there is a member in the village with a First World-like job, and the others give their devices to that person to charge while at work, for a price.

Story
Raiders Helping Others is a select group of
Texas Tech University residence hall students that perform community service
events twice per month in the city of Lubbock, TX.  The group was formed
in the fall of 2010 as a way to inspire other college students toward creating
a lifestyle of giving back.  Check out our yourtube videos from our 2011 trip. 
The
Impact
Members of Raiders Helping Others have lofty
goals to benefit the community, but all money spent must be raised through
fundraisers.  We are currently raising funds to pay for a trip to Orlando,
FL where we will spend a week volunteering at Give Kids the World- a resort for
terminally ill children.  We will be performing a number of tasks to aide
families that are enjoying some happy memories together.

New in 2012, we will be taking a second trip to Joplin, MO to benefit the victims of the tornadoes last spring.  
 
Without funding, the number of people traveling
will decrease, and our impact will be lessened. 
What We
Need & What You Get
The service trip to Florida will cost our group about $13,000.  
 
Lodging:          
$2009
Airfare: 
            $7,935
Rental Vans:     $1034
Baggage:           $650
Food:              
~$500
Gas:                
~$200
Misc:                
~$500
 
We anticipate that the trip to Joplin, MO will cost us roughly $4000 including vehicle transportation, lodging, meals, and needed building materials. 

Collectively, we anticipate the trips costing our organization $17,000. 

We have received generous donations from a variety of sources such as private
contributions, student organizations on campus, and through various fundraisers
throughout our community. 
 
Any amount contributed is applied directly to
this trip.  In the unlikely event that we exceed the amount needed, all
donations are applied to future service projects in our local community.
 
Any amount that is not fundraised, students will
be making contributions out of their pocket to make up the difference. 
Those unable to make the remaining financial commitment will not be able to volunteer in Florida or Joplin, MO.

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>After sixteen months of designing and developing the nXtbag2, we are finally ready to bring it to market. Our team has spared no expense, because we believe in the value of this product in our hearts. We are confident that the nXtbag2 is a product that people can fall in love with, also that it is a product that will make a difference in the world. For urban professionals, for daily commuters, for students, for home-makers heading to the grocery store, this is just the bag that you have been looking for: durable and fashionable, It makes us proud to present to you today: the nXtbag2!</p>

<li>nXtBag2 is a high quality bag that requires a great manufacturing facility to produce such a fantastic Waxed canvas satchel bag. We need enough funds to cover full production of the bags, we have just finished a successful Kickstarter campaign that was fully funded. We now require further funds to increase the range of the bags on offer.  </li>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Friendly to the Environment</strong></p>
<p>Because it can replace single-use plastic bags, the nXtbag2 has the potential to make a massive and positive impact on the environment. Every time you choose to use your nXtbag rather than a disposable bag — a bag that would litter our environment – you are doing your part to save our natural world and de-clutter our oceans.</p>
</li>
<li>This is nXtBag's second successful project we really appreciate the help from all of our backer, The first nXtBag is being sold around the world and now nXtBag2 will be a reality as well.  </li>
<li>
<p>The idea for the removable lunch/cooler bag was to help stop the use of the single use plastic bag.!</p>
<p>Plastics continue to avalanche into our landfills and oceans every single year, and much of the damage that we have done to our planet will take centuries or even millennia to fix. Fortunately, there is some good news. More and more people and businesses are pledging to move away from single-use products in their lives and use reusable products whenever they can.</p>

For urban professionals, for daily commuters, for students, for home-makers heading to the grocery store, this is just the bag that you have been looking for: durable and fashionable, It makes us proud to present to you today: the nXtbag2!


nXtBag2 is a high quality bag that requires a great manufacturing facility to produce such a fantastic Waxed canvas satchel bag. We need enough funds to cover full production of the bags, we have just finished a successful Kickstarter campaign that was fully funded. We now require further funds to increase the range of the bags on offer.  
Our Indiegogo campaign will be offering our amazing discounted perks.





Friendly to the Environment
Because it can replace single-use plastic bags, the nXtbag2 has the potential to make a massive and positive impact on the environment. Every time you choose to use your nXtbag rather than a disposable bag — a bag that would litter our environment – you are doing your part to save our natural world and de-clutter our oceans.

This is nXtBag's second successful project we really appreciate the help from all of our backer, The first nXtBag is being sold around the world and now nXtBag2 will be a reality as well.  

The idea for the removable lunch/cooler bag was to help stop the use of the single use plastic bag.!
Plastics continue to avalanche into our landfills and oceans every single year, and much of the damage that we have done to our planet will take centuries or even millennia to fix. Fortunately, there is some good news. More and more people and businesses are pledging to move away from single-use products in their lives and use reusable products whenever they can.




Risks & Challenges
Seasoned professionals in the business world, we know exactly what we need to do to put the nXtbag2 into consumers’ hands. Our designers and developers have spent countless hours getting to this point, and we are not going to let anything get in our way.
Whatever challenges happen to arise going forward, we will meet them head-on, figuring out solutions that work for the nXtbag in the long term.

A year latter there is no sign of change despite hundreds of millions of dollars flowing through the country via foreign aid.

Yesterday I was walking through the main street of this tent city at sunset, kids are playing with kites, the temperature has cooled and people are laughing and working in the market and I think, wow for a tent city it's pretty nice here.... then as the sun went down I returned to visit a woman with a new born I had met. I was taking a jar of baby food for her. When I arrived in her tent, which is about 6 square feet, there was a grandma, a new born, three little girls and three sisters lying on a tarp on the ground, getting ready to go to sleep. I felt like such a fool, turning up with my single jar of baby food, and for having previously had such sentimental feelings for the place.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Lydia. I recently graduated from UNC and am currently living in Charlotte, NC. This summer, I’m making my way to the west coast on my bike to raise awareness and funds for affordable housing. Thank you for visiting my page and learning about my trip! </p>
<p>From May 29th to August 12th, I’ll bike from Virginia Beach to Canon Beach, Oregon. The non-profit Bike &amp; Build has organized the route, which goes through 11 beautiful states and averages 75 miles of biking a day! Together with a team of 30, I will help build houses along the way with organizations such as Habitat for Humanity and NeighborWorks. I've also been researching affordable housing and will give presentations on it, and have volunteered with Habitat in Charlotte. </p>
<p>While learning more about affordable housing, I’ve thought about the things we value so highly as a community: family life, health, education, and noticed how strongly these are affected by financial strains of high rents and mortgages. Research by Habitat for Humanity shows that about 44.2 million Americans spend more than half of their income on housing. An estimated one in six Americans are in need of a decent, affordable place to live when the homeless and those in severely substandard conditions are <span>considered</span>. This is a crisis I feel must be addressed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need </h3>
<p>I have great news, which is that I've surpassed my non-profit fundraising goal! To date, I have raised $4,638 through this site: <a href=""http://bikeandbuild.org/rider/6790"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://bikeandbuild.org/rider/6790</a> Any donations through that site are tax deductible and go straight towards housing initiatives! It's not too late to donate there.</p>
<p>My fundraising goal on this Indiegogo site is for my personal needs, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bike gear, though I am borrowing as much as possible!</li>
<li>Travel expenses getting back home once I've biked cross-country, which includes shipping my bike</li>
<li>Health considerations, such as rivers full of sunscreen, nutrition supplements and loads of Clif bars</li>
<li>Insurance </li>
</ul>
<p>Having funds for these expenses will help me focus my energy more on what the trip is supposed to be about, rather than stressing about finances.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Thank you so much to all of you who have contributed already through the Bike &amp; Build site. It feels amazing to know that so many people support me in a project I think is valuable. In the decade of its existence, Bike &amp; Build has built houses in 47 states and contributed over 4 million dollars to affordable housing efforts. This year, the combined efforts of riders on the different Bike &amp; Build routes will log an approximate 20,000 service hours. I’m excited to take part.</p>
<p>Donating to my personal expenses on this Indiegogo site tells me that not only are you dedicated to the affordable housing cause, you're also excited that I'm undertaking this huge trip to address it. It's true that I could make a difference by dedicating my free time to Habitat projects here in Charlotte. I don't need to cross the country to help. But I think it will be an amazing experience and can help bring attention to the issue in a different way. </p>

Αντώνης και ο Γιώργος, τρεις Αθηναίοι αναρριχητές. Η παρέα μας δημιουργήθηκε πριν από πολλά χρόνια γύρω από τη κοινή μας αγάπη για τα βράχια, τα βουνά και τη φύση. Τα βουνά της Αθήνας είναι το σπίτι μας.</p><p>Αν και οι Αθηναίοι είναι συνηθισμένοι στη θεά των
βουνών που περιτριγυρίζουν τη πόλη μας, αυτό που ο πολύς κόσμος αγνοεί, είναι
οι εκπληκτικές ορθοπλαγιές που κρύβουν στη καρδιά τους τα Αθηναϊκά βουνά. Ο ασβεστόλιθος και κυρίως το Αθηναϊκό μάρμαρο είναι πραγματικά ξεχωριστά από αναρριχητικής άποψης και αξίζουν να ανακαλυφθούν από περισσότερο κόσμο.</p>

νέες διαδρομές που έχουν ανοιχθεί τα τελευταία χρόνια. Ο οδηγός θα ωφελήσει
τόσο την τοπική κοινότητα όσο και το μεγάλο αριθμό ξένων αναρριχητών που
περνούν από την Αθήνα με τελικό προορισμό άλλα μέρη της Ελλάδας, όπως η
Κάλυμνος, χωρίς να μαθαίνουν ποτέ για τα τα υπέροχα βράχια γύρω από την
πρωτεύουσα.</p>
<p>Τα δυόμισι χρόνια που περάσαμε συγκεντρώνοντας το υλικό του οδηγού ήταν ένα κουραστικό αλλά ευχάριστο ταξίδι. Καταγράψαμε 33 πεδία, συλλέξαμε πληροφορίες για πάνω από 1100 διαδρομές και βγάλαμε χιλιάδες φωτογραφίες. Όλα αυτά συγκεντρώθηκαν σε ένα βιβλίο 270 σελίδων. Η διαδικασία δημιουργίας του αναρριχητικού οδηγού της Αθήνας μας έκανε να πιστέψουμε ακόμη περισσότερο στη συνεισφορά που μπορεί να έχει στην αναρριχητική κοινότητα ένας όμορφος, σύγχρονος και, πάνω απ’ όλα, χρήσιμος οδηγός για τα βράχια της Αθήνας.

<p>We are Andreas, Antonis and Giorgos, three local climbers sharing a deep love for rocks, mountains
and the great outdoors. Climbing is our absolute passion and Athens is our
home. </p>
<p>Unbeknown to most people, the bustling capital of Greece has an amazing
concentration of perfect limestone and marble rock waiting to be found and
appreciated by more people. The climbing community here is growing fast and so
is the love for rock climbing.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/275648/files/20131223074425-1.jpg?1387813465"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>We believe that the fantastic rock climbing of Athens deserves to have a
modern and inspiring guidebook<span>,which includes
all the hottest crags and hundreds of new routes. This will benefit both the
local climbing community and also the tons of visiting climbers who at the
moment pass from Athens on their way to the islands, such as Kalymnos, having
no idea what they are missing.</span></p>
<p>Our 2,5 years quest of gathering everything together has been an extremely enjoyable journey. We visited 33 crags, gathered information for more that 1100 routes, took thousands of photos and brought them all together in a 270 page guidebook. The creating process of making the Athens Climbing Guidebook made us believe we can make a valuable contribution by creating something beautiful, inspiring and, above all, useful to the climbing community. </p><p>You can download a pdf sample from the guide from here: <a href=""http://dropify.com/l/hnX"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://dropify.com/l/hnX</a></p><p><br/></p><p> <b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get.</b></p>
<p>Now it’s time to turn all this effort into a beautiful book for everybody! </p>
<p>We need funding for the printing of the book. We will use professional high
standard printing services to achieve maximum quality, durability and the
visual results. The more funding we collect, the more copies we intend to print. More copies will result in a lower price per copy therefore lower
market price for the final guidebook.

Είμαστε ο Ανδρέας, ο
Αντώνης και ο Γιώργος, τρεις Αθηναίοι αναρριχητές. Η παρέα μας δημιουργήθηκε πριν από πολλά χρόνια γύρω από τη κοινή μας αγάπη για τα βράχια, τα βουνά και τη φύση. Τα βουνά της Αθήνας είναι το σπίτι μας.Αν και οι Αθηναίοι είναι συνηθισμένοι στη θεά των
βουνών που περιτριγυρίζουν τη πόλη μας, αυτό που ο πολύς κόσμος αγνοεί, είναι
οι εκπληκτικές ορθοπλαγιές που κρύβουν στη καρδιά τους τα Αθηναϊκά βουνά. Ο ασβεστόλιθος και κυρίως το Αθηναϊκό μάρμαρο είναι πραγματικά ξεχωριστά από αναρριχητικής άποψης και αξίζουν να ανακαλυφθούν από περισσότερο κόσμο.
Η  αναρριχητική οικογένεια της Αθήνας συνεχώς μεγαλώνει. Πιστεύουμε ότι της αξίζει ένας νέος αναρριχητικός οδηγός που να περιέχει όλα τα δημοφιλή καινούρια πεδία και τις εκατοντάδες
νέες διαδρομές που έχουν ανοιχθεί τα τελευταία χρόνια. Ο οδηγός θα ωφελήσει
τόσο την τοπική κοινότητα όσο και το μεγάλο αριθμό ξένων αναρριχητών που
περνούν από την Αθήνα με τελικό προορισμό άλλα μέρη της Ελλάδας, όπως η
Κάλυμνος, χωρίς να μαθαίνουν ποτέ για τα τα υπέροχα βράχια γύρω από την
πρωτεύουσα.
Τα δυόμισι χρόνια που περάσαμε συγκεντρώνοντας το υλικό του οδηγού ήταν ένα κουραστικό αλλά ευχάριστο ταξίδι. Καταγράψαμε 33 πεδία, συλλέξαμε πληροφορίες για πάνω από 1100 διαδρομές και βγάλαμε χιλιάδες φωτογραφίες. Όλα αυτά συγκεντρώθηκαν σε ένα βιβλίο 270 σελίδων. Η διαδικασία δημιουργίας του αναρριχητικού οδηγού της Αθήνας μας έκανε να πιστέψουμε ακόμη περισσότερο στη συνεισφορά που μπορεί να έχει στην αναρριχητική κοινότητα ένας όμορφος, σύγχρονος και, πάνω απ’ όλα, χρήσιμος οδηγός για τα βράχια της Αθήνας. Ένα δείγμα του οδηγού μπορείτε να κατεβάσετε σε pdf από εδώ: http://dropify.com/l/hnX(ΟΚ ήταν περισσότερα από δυο λόγια...) Τι χρειαζόμαστε και τι θα
κερδίσετε αν μας βοηθήσετε.
Όλα είναι έτοιμα για την έκδοση!

Αυτό που
χρειαζόμαστε αυτή τη στιγμή είναι χρηματοδότηση για την εκτύπωση του βιβλίου. Ο
οδηγός θα εκτυπωθεί στα πρότυπα επαγγελματικών εκδόσεων ώστε να επιτύχουμε
υψηλή ποιότητα, αντοχή και όμορφο αισθητικό αποτέλεσμα. Όσο περισσότερα χρήματα κατορθώσουμε να συγκεντρώσουμε, τόσα περισσότερα τεύχη θα
εκτυπώσουμε. Όσο περισσότερα τεύχη, τόσο μικρότερο θα είναι το κόστος ανά
τεύχος με αποτέλεσμα χαμηλότερη τιμή αγοράς. Ο ελάχιστος στόχος για να υλοποιήσουμε την έκδοση ανέρχεται στα 3500 ευρώ. Άλλοι
τρόποι που μπορείτε να βοηθήσετε.
Αν η ιδέα
μας σας αρέσει και θα θέλατε να μας βοηθήσετε αλλά δε μπορείτε να προσφέρετε
χρήματα, υπάρχουν κι άλλοι τρόποι που μπορείτε να συνεισφέρετε.

We are Andreas, Antonis and Giorgos, three local climbers sharing a deep love for rocks, mountains
and the great outdoors. Climbing is our absolute passion and Athens is our
home. 
Unbeknown to most people, the bustling capital of Greece has an amazing
concentration of perfect limestone and marble rock waiting to be found and
appreciated by more people. The climbing community here is growing fast and so
is the love for rock climbing.
We believe that the fantastic rock climbing of Athens deserves to have a
modern and inspiring guidebook,which includes
all the hottest crags and hundreds of new routes. This will benefit both the
local climbing community and also the tons of visiting climbers who at the
moment pass from Athens on their way to the islands, such as Kalymnos, having
no idea what they are missing.
Our 2,5 years quest of gathering everything together has been an extremely enjoyable journey. We visited 33 crags, gathered information for more that 1100 routes, took thousands of photos and brought them all together in a 270 page guidebook. The creating process of making the Athens Climbing Guidebook made us believe we can make a valuable contribution by creating something beautiful, inspiring and, above all, useful to the climbing community. You can download a pdf sample from the guide from here: http://dropify.com/l/hnX What We Need & What You Get.
Now it’s time to turn all this effort into a beautiful book for everybody! 
We need funding for the printing of the book. We will use professional high
standard printing services to achieve maximum quality, durability and the
visual results. The more funding we collect, the more copies we intend to print. More copies will result in a lower price per copy therefore lower
market price for the final guidebook. Our minimum target to realise the publication is set at 3500 Euros.Other Ways You Can Help.

<p>Hello Trailblazer!</p>
<p>We're Seadon. Last year, our Regenerative-Tee campaign was successfully funded and it has helped us kickstart our company and create our 'Trailblazer' community, aka, our backers. This is our 2nd Kickstarter campaign and we are super excited to be sharing our newest technical T-shirt range 'The Daily-Tee' collection with you. Over a year in the making, these are definitely our softest and most comfortable tees yet - all guaranteed to give you smiles per miles. We designed this collection with the everyday people (like ourselves) in mind- whether you are working out at home or hitting the trail, or just keeping it spontaneous around the city, we hope there's a perfect fit for you. Please do not hesitate to message us if you have any questions. We'll be here every step of the way. Cheers! -Carson, Founder. </p>

We're Seadon. Last year, our Regenerative-Tee campaign was successfully funded and it has helped us kickstart our company and create our 'Trailblazer' community, aka, our backers. This is our 2nd Kickstarter campaign and we are super excited to be sharing our newest technical T-shirt range 'The Daily-Tee' collection with you. Over a year in the making, these are definitely our softest and most comfortable tees yet - all guaranteed to give you smiles per miles. We designed this collection with the everyday people (like ourselves) in mind- whether you are working out at home or hitting the trail, or just keeping it spontaneous around the city, we hope there's a perfect fit for you. Please do not hesitate to message us if you have any questions. We'll be here every step of the way. Cheers! -Carson, Founder. 

 


 

        Let's start with The Traveler - the 'au naturel' style of the three.The Traveler is a versatile tee for long journeys (even on your sofas!). It’s able to naturally adapt to your surroundings, weathering it through a wide range of temperatures, whilst being extremely lightweight and luxuriously soft to wear.   When we set out to blend 70% ZQ® Merino Wool (Ultra-fine grade) with 30% Tencel® in our Traveler fabric, we knew it would be our comfiest tee yet, but we didn't foresee it being so cozy and comfortable that we would end up sleeping in them too.  Thankfully, Merino Wool and Tencel® are also two of the best antimicrobial fibers in the world!   The exterior of the wool fiber is hydrophobic (water-resistant), while the cortex of the wool fiber is hydrophilic (i.e., moisture-loving) and is estimated to absorb 1/3 of its weight in water without feeling damp to the skin. #NatureRules  The elastic properties of the Merino fiber make it extremely wrinkle resistant. Just hang for half an hour and you’re good to go. Merino Wool and Tencel® are two of the best temperature regulating fibers. Stay cool in summer and warm in winter.Merino Wool is considered to be the best natural fiber that offers ultimate sun protection, with a rating of UPF~ 50+, this is as good as it gets!  Tencel® is 100% natural fibers derived from Eucalyptus trees (say what!). Their fibers are cool to the touch, silky-soft, efficient in moisture absorption, and gentle to the skin.  We have been working with ZQ Merino, the world’s leading ethical wool company in New Zealand, to source the best ethical and sustainable Merino Wool to be used in our Traveler Tee.         Looking for something more active? Maybe The Trailblazer is for you.The Trailblazer is the tee built to pursue performance. Whether you hike, run, ride or climb, you can take it to the limit, with this tee never missing a beat. Keeping it light at only 95gsm for men, and 78gsm for women, you’ll barely notice it’s there. Our breathable fabric allows for optimum airflow with quick-drying ability. High-stretch without adding spandex for maximum mobility. Allow your body to breathe freely with our unique FreeBreathe™ fabric construction that allows maximum air-flow while providing 100% coverage.  Our Trailblazer Tee is rated UPF~ 20, providing just enough sun protection when you're out there sending it! Featuring a world-first performance finish derived from algae oil, this trailblazing fabric turbo charges its wicking and drying ability, keeping you cool and dry when pushing to the edge.       Maybe you are looking for something in between The Traveler and The Trailblazer? In that case, let's dive into The Daymaker style below: The Daymaker is your all-round tee that’s ready to take it easy, or step it up a notch. It might seem like your typical cotton t-shirt at first glance, but it is far more than what meets the eye. Let it take you from city to unplanned adventures with its balanced functionality.  Made with 70% recycled Polyester (from plastic bottles), blended with 30% Tencel® (Eucalyptus fiber), this tech tee is softer than your softest cotton tee (guaranteed!), with features similar to a technical tee such as quick-dry, moisture-wicking, and breathable fabric. Ours are just elevated in every way. Plus you can wear it around the city and not look like you're about to do a marathon, even though you totally can with The Daymaker!  We've added a world-first performance finish derived from Algae oil (miDori® bio-Wick), which turbocharges the fabric's wicking and drying ability to a whole new level. Our 'Stay Fresh' technology from Polygiene® will help you stay fresh all day every day with its eco-friendly, permanent, anti-odor finish.  Stronger, Softer, and more Durable than your average seam construction. We think they look more stylish too!      Unsure about something? We would love to help. You can reach us by messaging us here or email us at support@seadon.co and we will get back to you very soon.  Who else is tired of receiving more plastic than what they actually ordered online? A normal plastic bag will remain in the environment (normally in the oceans or landfills) between 150 to 500 years. We are proud to say that our packaging is practically plastic-free!Meet our new bio-bag - it looks and feels like a normal plastic bag, but it's actually made from the same compound as the natural gaseous hormone given off by plants that cause fruits to ripen! #naturerules Here's the secret- our water-soluble bag will begin to break down at around 100 °F (40 °C) and dissolves completely in 5 minutes at 160 °F (70 °C) water, turning it into carbon dioxide, water, and mineralized natural biomass! #welovescience  'Preserving and protecting Planet Earth is our number 1 priority. We acknowledge that being in the clothing industry, which is the 2nd most polluting industry in the world (oil is the first), we are already contributing to the problem one way or the other. What we believe and stand behind is this - if people are going to buy outdoor gear regardless, it is the company's responsibility to offer customers the most sustainable and ethical choices, with the least impact on the environment. As an outdoor lifestyle brand that focuses on sustainability, we will always strive and go the extra mile to stay true to this philosophy of ours. It's in our Seadon's namesake after all - From the Land to the Sea.' -Carson, Founder.  Hello Trailblazer! For the next 45 days (and hopefully more in the future), we'll be here for you every step of the way to help answer any questions you may have with this campaign. We will also be planning a live FAQ video in the coming weeks, to explain in detail some of the questions you may have. Our main operation is based in Hong Kong, with partners in Taiwan, Vietnam, the United States, New Zealand, and Australia. I moved to Hong Kong (from the UK) 4 years ago to set up our operation hub in order to gain easy access to South East Asia, where most of the best outdoor fabrics and garment factories are based. Being in Hong Kong, we were able to connect with some of today's leading suppliers in the outdoor clothing industry, from sourcing our tech fabrics in Taiwan, to having our Daily-Tees produced in a WRAP-certified factory in Vietnam. This means our factories are compliant with laws and high ethical standards, and our employees are protected and work in a safe environment. Being only a few hours away makes it possible to gain a much closer insight into our supply chain, and manage it efficiently to uphold our quality to the highest standards. -Carson, Founder.",98.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Because of your incredible support we've been able to continue to design products that make traveling a little easier and better.</p><p>We have the raddest Indiegogo backers around - we’re so thankful for the bestowed backer trust. We're busy designing a lineup of travel products that solve problems we and other travelers experience.</p><h1><strong>Lifetime Warranty</strong></h1><p>We are so confident in our product's build that we have added a lifetime warranty - plain and simple. If the blanket doesn't hold up for what it was designed for then let us know and we'll make it right.</p><h1><strong>Return Policy</strong></h1><p>We only used premium materials to ensure years of use. We will repair or replace any blankets that somehow don't hold up to do what the blanket was designed to be used for. We do not offer refunds or returns on blankets that were received as an Indiegogo reward.</p><p>We’re passionate about creating amazing products and Indiegogo is a way for us to launch our brand. As you've read, Indiegogo isn't a store and rewards are a thanks for supporting the project which is why we cannot offer refunds or returns. Your pledge means so much and we take it very seriously. We will do anything we can to make sure that this exchange leaves with good vibes for everyone involved.</p><h1><strong>Outside The USA? International Customs Calculator</strong></h1><p>We are so pumped that we have shipped this product to 108 countries. Perks are merchandise and not gifts. We value your support SO much and want to make every interaction super positive all the way through this process.

Reach out to us at hello@graveltravel.com</p><h2>
<br/>Environmental Commitments<br/> </h2><p><strong>Long-lasting design</strong></p><p>We didn't cut any corners with material selection to ensure rips and tears are minimized plus stress points get extra attention. We also designed reinforcements in areas used most. Two examples:</p><p>1. Snaps are reinforced with extra material surrounding them to reduce rips</p><p>2. Attached stuff sacks can get stress on the connected parts when packing. We added a snap to the piece of material that connects the blanket to the stuff sack. When packing away if the material is getting too much stress, the snap will break loose vs cause threads to take the beating.</p><p><strong>Reusability and recyclability</strong></p><p>With our Lifetime Warranty, we want to make sure that the blanket, as do all our products, gets years of use. Instead of just throwing away a blanket for a warranty claim we want to closely examine and attempt to repair.</p><p>In 2018 we also used only minimal packaging. One cardboard box was designed to serve as packaging and the shipping box (vs a box shipped in a box). We also do not use single use plastic in any packaging. We opted to use tissue paper to protect the product inside.</p><p><strong>Sustainable materials</strong></p><p>Insulation: 100% recycled material. Our insulation is 100% recycled PET plastic (i.e. water bottles) &amp; keeps high performance standards.<strong> </strong>Certified free of harmful chemicals and are safe for human use. Organic certification means that textile and fabric products are grown according to strict guidelines on the use of petroleum based fertilizers, pesticides and synthetic products.</p><p><strong>Environmentally friendly factories</strong></p><p>Even though with some factories it is a new concept to really reduce waste we are pushing them to be more conservative with waste. It's amazing how much plastic can be used just to ship thousands of products from a factory to a warehouse. We take steps along the way to reduce all waste.</p><p><strong>Sustainable fulfillment and distribution</strong></p><p>We're very close (as friends and physically) to our fulfillment center. Waste when fulfilling thousands of orders at once also is pretty ridiculous. Giant plastic bags are a standard &amp; used to gather all the products together to take to the distribution center. For this project we are going to work with our warehouse/distribution center to make sure this waste is minimized (hopefully to zero!).</p><p> </p><h1><strong>Gravel Team</strong></h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2678/3886/files/family-gif-1-small_1.gif?345"" src=""""/></p><div data-id=""25282309""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><br/> </figure></div><div data-id=""25257832""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><a href=""https://m.me/workbygravel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1563486600/phqtyf0hk5ejj6elkuec.png"" src=""""/></a></figure></div><div data-id=""25413765""> </div></div>","What is this all about?

You aren’t likely to carry your grandma’s super comfy quilt on a plane unless you want to look like you’re headed for an adult sleepover. Blankets just aren’t packable!You never know if the plane you are boarding will get drafty, if you will be stuck on a super long layover, or if you'll end up in a window seat up against the cold wall of a bus. We thought there had to be a much better way.Here's The Solution: The Layover will change the way you look at travel blankets forever. We incorporated a ton of neat features to keep you comfortable on the go.Here's a quick walkthrough: Space & weight of your luggage on the go is vital.Detachable & Hideaway Stuff SackThe attached stuff sack packs into a zippered pocket on the side of the blanket to keep it out of the way when using the blanket.Easy Stuffing w/Patent Pending Stuff SackStuffing into stuff sacks is the worst. To solve this, we added 3” of extra material for easy grip & stuffing.You can then use the drawstring to quickly cinch down and convert the material down to its most compact size.The breathable insulation core keeps you feeling just right. Fun fact: Our insulation is 100% recycled PET plastic (i.e. water bottles) & keeps high performance standards.Microfleece Kangaroo PocketWe've lined the inside of the Kangaroo pocket with microfleece for a soft place for your hands.(Inside of the Kangaroo Pocket)  

Snap Blankets Together & Increase Blanket Width Want a wider blanket size to share with a friend? Compatible snaps line the edge of the blanket to increase width to as many blankets as you want. Don't worry, we did the math. It only takes 386,376,478 of our connected blankets to make it to the moon.Spill Proof/Water ResistantSizingTech Specs

Tumble dry it on low or hang dry.When will it all ship?Timeline:Our StoryChris met Lance in 2017 with an idea to design a better toiletry bag for traveling. Holy smokes - we’ve shipped 37,000+ products to 108 countries around the world. Because of your incredible support we've been able to continue to design products that make traveling a little easier and better.We have the raddest Indiegogo backers around - we’re so thankful for the bestowed backer trust. We're busy designing a lineup of travel products that solve problems we and other travelers experience.Lifetime WarrantyWe are so confident in our product's build that we have added a lifetime warranty - plain and simple. If the blanket doesn't hold up for what it was designed for then let us know and we'll make it right.Return PolicyWe only used premium materials to ensure years of use. We will repair or replace any blankets that somehow don't hold up to do what the blanket was designed to be used for. We do not offer refunds or returns on blankets that were received as an Indiegogo reward.We’re passionate about creating amazing products and Indiegogo is a way for us to launch our brand. As you've read, Indiegogo isn't a store and rewards are a thanks for supporting the project which is why we cannot offer refunds or returns. Your pledge means so much and we take it very seriously. We will do anything we can to make sure that this exchange leaves with good vibes for everyone involved.Outside The USA? International Customs CalculatorWe are so pumped that we have shipped this product to 108 countries. Perks are merchandise and not gifts. We value your support SO much and want to make every interaction super positive all the way through this process. If you are backing our project outside the USA you will likely have to pay customs. Shipping fees DO NOT count toward customs fees. Here is a shipping calculator for you to understand what you will be paying your government to import this product. https://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/Need further help?

Environmental Commitments Long-lasting designWe didn't cut any corners with material selection to ensure rips and tears are minimized plus stress points get extra attention. We also designed reinforcements in areas used most. Two examples:1. Snaps are reinforced with extra material surrounding them to reduce rips2. Attached stuff sacks can get stress on the connected parts when packing. We added a snap to the piece of material that connects the blanket to the stuff sack. When packing away if the material is getting too much stress, the snap will break loose vs cause threads to take the beating.Reusability and recyclabilityWith our Lifetime Warranty, we want to make sure that the blanket, as do all our products, gets years of use. Instead of just throwing away a blanket for a warranty claim we want to closely examine and attempt to repair.In 2018 we also used only minimal packaging. One cardboard box was designed to serve as packaging and the shipping box (vs a box shipped in a box). We also do not use single use plastic in any packaging. We opted to use tissue paper to protect the product inside.Sustainable materialsInsulation: 100% recycled material. Our insulation is 100% recycled PET plastic (i.e. water bottles) & keeps high performance standards. Certified free of harmful chemicals and are safe for human use. Organic certification means that textile and fabric products are grown according to strict guidelines on the use of petroleum based fertilizers, pesticides and synthetic products.Environmentally friendly factoriesEven though with some factories it is a new concept to really reduce waste we are pushing them to be more conservative with waste. It's amazing how much plastic can be used just to ship thousands of products from a factory to a warehouse. We take steps along the way to reduce all waste.Sustainable fulfillment and distributionWe're very close (as friends and physically) to our fulfillment center. Waste when fulfilling thousands of orders at once also is pretty ridiculous. Giant plastic bags are a standard & used to gather all the products together to take to the distribution center. For this project we are going to work with our warehouse/distribution center to make sure this waste is minimized (hopefully to zero!). Gravel Team",45.0,1,"5 Campaigns

<h3>What's my plan?</h3>I was offered a trip to Maui island next month. If you don't know about it, it's part of the Hawaii and it's like heaven. (Google it).<br/><b>I want to create a photobook named ""Hawaii's Perfection"" with the best shots I'll take there.</b><br/>In order to do that, I would need a more performing camera with me, so that I could better capture the beauty of the island and create a very high quality photobook.<br/>Since the works that I did this year were basically for free (I wish I could live out of experience), I can't afford all this.<br/>This is where you can make a difference: with your help I could afford a new (and super cool) camera, that I'd use to create the photobook.</div>

</div></span>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p>I currently own a micro4/3 mirrorless camera (Panasonic Lumix GM1) with some lenses and accessories. I definitely love it, but I don't think it's the more appropriate camera for the trip that I'll take next month. <br/>That's because it's not tropicalized (resistant to dust, water drops, humidity, ecc) and it doesn't have a viewfinder (kinda hard to shoot when the sun is very strong).<br/><i>The better choice would be to purchase a very powerful M4/3 camera. In this way I could use all the lenses I currently own while having a more performing camera!</i></p>
<p>That's why I was considering purchasing the following items:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><b>Olympus OM-D E-M1 </b></span></li>

</ul>The whole kit (OM-D E-M1 + 12-40mm) can be found for 2000€ , while the battery grip costs 200€. (Why is life so expensive?)</div><div>

</div></div>","Who am I?




My name is Alessandro Carpentiero, I'm 25 years old and I'm a product designer in love with music and photography.


I can't actually decide what of those three things I should do in my life, so I just keep doing them all.


Design: I graduated last year in product design; since then I've done a few projects. Here's my work.


Music: I've started studying music since I was a child: saxophone, classical piano, singing and jazz piano. Here's a soundtrack I composed. And here's a piece of my band.


Photography: I've started taking pictures 8 years ago. University took me away from photography for some time, but now the passion got back stronger than ever.You can check out my Instagram and my Website.




What's my plan?I was offered a trip to Maui island next month. If you don't know about it, it's part of the Hawaii and it's like heaven. (Google it).I want to create a photobook named ""Hawaii's Perfection"" with the best shots I'll take there.In order to do that, I would need a more performing camera with me, so that I could better capture the beauty of the island and create a very high quality photobook.Since the works that I did this year were basically for free (I wish I could live out of experience), I can't afford all this.This is where you can make a difference: with your help I could afford a new (and super cool) camera, that I'd use to create the photobook.




What do I need?

 
I currently own a micro4/3 mirrorless camera (Panasonic Lumix GM1) with some lenses and accessories. I definitely love it, but I don't think it's the more appropriate camera for the trip that I'll take next month. That's because it's not tropicalized (resistant to dust, water drops, humidity, ecc) and it doesn't have a viewfinder (kinda hard to shoot when the sun is very strong).The better choice would be to purchase a very powerful M4/3 camera. In this way I could use all the lenses I currently own while having a more performing camera!
That's why I was considering purchasing the following items:

Olympus OM-D E-M1 
Olympus M.Zuiko ED 12-40mm f/2.8
Olympus HLD-7 Battery Grip
The whole kit (OM-D E-M1 + 12-40mm) can be found for 2000€ , while the battery grip costs 200€. (Why is life so expensive?)


Why should You help Me?

Everything I do, I do it with passion. My final goal in life is to experience emotions and, hopefully, make others experiencing them as well.



What do You get?

If you'll be willing to help me, you'll get (besides a HUGE thanks), the best perks I can possibily offer you: thank you notes, greetings cards, your pictures edited by me, digital copies of ""Hawaii's Perfection"", Skype lessons, Workshops, physical copies of ""Hawaii's Perfection"" or my 1st camera!Take a look at the coloumn on your right and choose the one you prefer!

What if I don't reach the final goal?


If I wouldn't reach 1500€, I'd use the money to buy a useful accessory for the trip (a new lens, a new tripod, or a new backback).

If I'd reach 1500€ I'd buy the Olympus OM-D E-M1 body
If I'd reach 2200€ I'd be the happiest man on earth.



  ""Hawaii's Perfection"" PhotoBook After I'll get back from my trip, I'll start selecting and editing all the pictures, and I'll create the photobook ""Hawaii's Perfection"". There you'll see the beauty that I was able to capture thanks to you.The book will be available both on digital and physical copies.Of course I'll keep you guys posted with videos and news directly from Maui!
  Risks & Challenges  Sure, it'll be hard to reach this amount of money in less than 1 month, but we can surely give it a try!If I won't be able to purchase a new camera, I'll create the photobook anyway with my current camera (Panasonic GM1), so that I can reward those who trusted me.

  You can help me also if You don't have any money! You like my art but you don't have the money to help me? No problem!You can still spread the word! Just press the ""share"" button and post this campaing on your favorite social network: that would be very helpful!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Show Me! Tour app will take tourists where they want to go, when they want to get there. Via the app, they are connected with local and professional guides who won't waste their time and show up at their location when they want them to! Depending on the guide that is selected, tours can range from kid friendly tours, bike tours, pub crawls, or even a driving tour. Tours originate wherever the user wants!</p>
<p>This idea was born out of a need for a tour guide during a multi-city trip to Europe. One of the cities I was excited to get to was Munich! I had heard of the beer halls and gardens, but only had a few precious hours to see the city. Having arrived later in the day by train, I had missed all the city tours being offered.  Wanting to see the city I had pictured in my mind and read about, I set out, tour book in hand, wondering aimlessly. After wasting valuable time going places my tour book told me to go and after seeing things I had no interest in, I stumbled upon the Munich I had pictured with just one hour to spare.  </p>
<p>As a military veteran who loves to travel both with the military and with my wife, I often find myself in locations unexpectedly or short on time and I want to see and experience all I can. To do this, I thought, ""wouldn't it be great to have a guide come to my location and take me to all the places I imagined?"" Not only that, but go to the restaurants and pubs where locals go! Experience a city without being tied down to a bus schedule?!</p>
<p>To see if an on demand tour guide service could work, I've already started an on demand tour company in which customers can dial our central location and have a tour guide come to them and show them what they want to see. I've gained insight and learned from  this stepping stone in an effort to create an app that will do the same, making booking effortless, fun, and convenient.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>At least 50% of the funding will go into the development, creation, and implementation of a robust application. The application will feature tour guide profiles and availability which users can browse to select their ideal candidate. Once they select a guide or service, that guide will arrive at their location. Development of such apps require use of real-time GPS and location services as well as server based services; features expensive to develop. </li>
<li>30% of funding will be applied to marketing in an effort to inform tourists of the app. The remaining 20% will go towards insurance, legal fees, and initial employee payrolls.  </li>
<li>This has never been done before and it makes sightseeing easy and effortless. Just as Uber has all but left Taxi service obsolete, this app changes the way visitors see cities. The best part is you will be a part of it.</li>
<li>If my goal is not reached, funds will be applied to further application development in an effort to transform the tourism industry. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Currently I'm operating a tour guide service in the ""proof on concept"" phase. Show Me! Tours takes phone calls and offers walking tours in San Diego, CA. Funding will transform this concept to a robust application based service! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Utilizing funds to develop an application is expensive and challenging, but most of the risk lies in the implementation and use of the application. Challenges include having a professional tour guide base that can accommodate a large demand of travelers or lack thereof. Additionally, public awareness of the app is a large part of its success. To overcome these barriers will require a lot hard work in marketing and talent acquisition. </p>
<p>I hope to mitigate these risks by surrounding myself with top-notch talent as well as rely on my persevering and hard-working background. In my experience in the military, I have a developed skills that will aid in the success of this endeavor. I have led many teams, have a successful history in program and project management, and have forged policy to advance the U.S. and the military. I have refined these skills by gaining a Masters in Business Administration and I'm excited to apply these attributes to this effort.</p>

But 5-7 bar is also enough to produce good espresso (<u><i>Mokapot 1~2 bar/ 'A' press 0.4~0.7bar</i></u>). Many commercial lever machines operate at 5-7 bar. Low pressure creates a slow flow rate, which allows stable extraction by offsetting a variety of variables, such as irregular particle size, unbalanced distribution of beans, and others. This is why various attempts have recently been made to lower the pressure on commercial espresso machines. </p><p>Read more about 6bar extraction</p><ul>

On the other hand, PREXO can maintain a stable pressure of 5-7BAR.   Differences from 9bar espressoThe standard extraction pressure of espresso is 9 bar. But 5-7 bar is also enough to produce good espresso (Mokapot 1~2 bar/ 'A' press 0.4~0.7bar). Many commercial lever machines operate at 5-7 bar. Low pressure creates a slow flow rate, which allows stable extraction by offsetting a variety of variables, such as irregular particle size, unbalanced distribution of beans, and others. This is why various attempts have recently been made to lower the pressure on commercial espresso machines. Read more about 6bar extraction

​At the PREXO, a pressure of 6 bar is equivalent to press down about 291 lb (132 kg). PREXO has a strong torque ratio, so it can reach a pressure of 6 bar without difficulty.  How to use PREXO Management and cleaningThe management and cleaning of PREXO are as easy as its use. The filter has fine holes optimized for the optimum pressure and flow rate of the PREXO, so a separate paper filter is not required and can be used semi-permanently. You can also use a ready-made 58mm tamper.After the extraction is completed, leave the handle to rest for a while so that the remaining pressure drops or spin the handle to the opposite direction to relieve pressure.                          Although the shaft is made of stainless steel, rust may occur if exposed to moisture for a long time. Please dry it after use, please wipe it with food grease or edible oil once or twice a month to prevent fray. BPA Free , NON Toxic plastic, NO Phthalates

   We raised over $ 10,000 the last Indiegogo campaign. Thank you.The funds were used for small batch manufacturing and a small amount of PREXO was born. The first products just arrived to our backers and we confirmed the mass production potential of PREXO.The goal of 2nd campaign is to lower the price of PREXO.We can achieve this with mass production through your greater support. We want to make most affordable espresso maker in the world. Espresso is the best coffee but it is still not easy to make. PREXO is the simplest espresso extractor that is faithful to the basics. We hope that through the success of this campaign, good espresso can be placed from your kitchen to the table of coffee farmer. CautionMost important : The combination between chamber and filter basket must be tightened by more than 80%. If combined to less than half, pressure may concentrate on the edge of the joint and cause breakage. Please refer to instruction video.

The limit (breakage) pressure is 9.5 bar. Please use only at the level of feeling slight resistance at your fingertips, That's enough, PREXO has a strong torque ratio. and gentle pressure is the key to good extraction. 
When used for the first time, the combination of filter and chamber is tight.This is due to the friction between the silicon packing inside the chamber and the filter.This phenomenon disappears naturally by the coffee oil applied after several use. Or a drop of edible oil (such as olive oil) into the black packing (o-ring) inside the chamber to combine more smoothly.

Hur Dong-hyuk, founder of HUR and majoring in design, has been running many years a coffee roasting company prior to initiate the development of the PREXO. We want to be a company that thinks about sustainability and simple life.",20.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>Of course, it’s not just bonnie Scotland that’s worth exploring. We know full well there are places hidden all over the globe that demand to be discovered and shared with friends.</p>
<p>In 2013 we searched for a bag that we’d be able to take as carry-on all over Europe on cheap flights. There was nothing suitable to be found so we decided to design the solution. Two years of sketches, sewing, testing and refining followed until the GOBAG was launched on crowd-funding platform Kickstarter. Things moved quickly and we reached our goal in a few days and were eventually 663% funded with almost 2,500 backers from all over the world. Shipping started in early 2016 and the story continues.</p>

<p><b>Warranty</b></p>
<p>We want to make sure you have the best experience with your GoBag, so our bags come with a lifetime warranty. For as long as you own your bag, we will provide a warranty against defects in materials and workmanship.</p>
<p>This warranty doesn’t cover normal wear and tear, improper use, abuse, negligence, or accident.</p>
<p><b>Customs &amp; Duties</b></p>
<p>Sadly we cannot mark any rewards as a gift as it is illegal to do so.</p>
<p>Import duties and taxes are not included in our reward levels. These charges vary by country and are completely out of our control.</p>
<p>However, we are shipping our bags to EU backers from the UK and to US backers from Seattle, WA - so no extra charges should be incurred for backers in these geographies.</p>
<p><b>Return Policy</b></p>
<p>We stand behind our bags and will replace or repair items that fall within our warranty; however, we do not offer refunds or returns on bags/products that were received as a Kickstarter reward and are not suffering from a fault.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding is an incredible tool that allows people to get their ideas off the ground. Kickstarter is not a store and our ""reward levels"" are the way that we say thank you for supporting us (and trust us, we are VERY grateful). Everything received from this campaign will go directly into making The GoBag Backpack a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
</div></div>","Two years ago we launched our first project, the GoBag, and were blown away by the support and recognition the bag received. Our Kickstarter campaign received 2,444 backers from 53 countries and we were featured on Wired, GQ, Stuff, and Everyday Carry.

Pack small. Think big.
We believe that when you pack less, you experience more. We designed the GoBag so you can see more of the world, without the burden of hauling around bulky luggage.


It does things other carry-on bags can't.

It's time to make the most of every adventure. No waiting around to check in your luggage. No delays at the luggage carousel. No lost baggage. No checked baggage fees.
No checked bag, no problem.
 

 

Don't you just hate hauling around bulky luggage? Thanks to our Max Pack you can travel the world for days, weeks or months at a time with only a carry-on bag. 
The vacuum compression system works by hand (or with a vacuum cleaner if you’re really serious about space-saving) to free up oh-so-precious interior space.

 
It can accommodate an impressive amount of kit wherever you’re headed — leaving room for a few keepsakes when you return. 

With a monster 2m-long YKK main zip and six different ways to open your bag, you can instantly access what you need, when you need it.

With more of your gear next to the zip, you can say goodbye to digging around in the depths of your bag - or emptying your stuff in the rain because your waterproof happens to be at the bottom...

More zip. Less hassle.

Say goodbye to wasting time at airport security. Our integrated transparent wash bag has got your liquids and pastes ready to go from the off.

The fully welded design and waterproof zip means that any shampoo explosions are safely contained - leaving your clothes free of dodgy stains and ready for the adventure ahead!

Hassle free traveling is at your fingertips. We designed the Travel HQ so you can stay organised for the adventure ahead.

Everything you need when you need it, stored securely at the top of your bag and laid out just how you like it. There's also a soft pocket to protect any digital items that love getting scratched.

 Simplify the way you travel.

Peace of mind is priceless - and never more so than when you're traveling. We designed a hidden pocket so your documents and money are securely concealed next to your back.

Did you see that?  

 

Whatever the adventure, the GoBag is up for it. From trekking in the Himalayas to your daily commute, the ergonomic harness keeps you comfortable and supported. We've also included a sternum strap and removable waist belt.

Every laptop up to 15"" is safely protected in the padded laptop pouch. What's more, there's a quick release tab that works faster than James Bond's ejector seat. 

 

 Bottle pockets. Stay hydrated. 

Side and top grab handles.

We've selected the finest components and best quality materials to ensure that your GoBag goes the distance.
The GoBag uses ultra hard-wearing Hypalon on the base of the bag and to reinforce webbing straps. This is the material that whitewater rafts are made out of - so it's super tough! This is backed up with waterproof TPU-coated fabric to cover the rest of the exterior - helping to keep all your stuff dry in even the wettest of weather.
There is only one option when it comes to zips, and that's YKK. They can't be beaten for their reliability and toughness - so guess what we've gone for on the GoBag.
We've included magnetic compression straps to get your stuff buckled up that bit faster - and that satisfying magnetic clip signifying you're all packed and ready to go doesn't hurt either.

We’re incredibly proud to call the Scottish Highlands our home. In fact, we’re pretty sure anyone who’s trekked a hidden glen or paddled out to a remote island would agree this kind of experience carves out who you are.

Of course, it’s not just bonnie Scotland that’s worth exploring. We know full well there are places hidden all over the globe that demand to be discovered and shared with friends.
In 2013 we searched for a bag that we’d be able to take as carry-on all over Europe on cheap flights. There was nothing suitable to be found so we decided to design the solution. Two years of sketches, sewing, testing and refining followed until the GOBAG was launched on crowd-funding platform Kickstarter. Things moved quickly and we reached our goal in a few days and were eventually 663% funded with almost 2,500 backers from all over the world. Shipping started in early 2016 and the story continues.

Our core belief is that when you travel compact you experience more. It’s this belief that drives us to work hard every day to create more innovative products that enable others to do the same.

The critical path.

We've got it all planned out.
Let's Talk
Backers: ahoy@gobag.co
Business Enquiries: business@gobag.co
Press Enquiries: press@gobag.co
Thanks for taking the time to check out the GoBag! We'd hugely appreciate you sharing it with your friends.
Thanks
We want to thank some fantastic people that have helped us out on the way.
Daniel Parsons - Dan's the mastermind behind the video. Check out his work at caravel.co
Matt Alani who has worked on the audio for the videos. Check out some of his other work at shifted-sound.com
Fred Ingleby ran round Edinburgh to find the perfect location to shoot the video. Thanks Fred!
BackPack Video - Ian's epic footage was used in our video.
Shawn Lowe - Took the original bag on an awesome trip up the west coast of the USA and brought back some epic footage and memories.
Jack Bussell shot all the tasty product images.
Warranty
We want to make sure you have the best experience with your GoBag, so our bags come with a lifetime warranty. For as long as you own your bag, we will provide a warranty against defects in materials and workmanship.
This warranty doesn’t cover normal wear and tear, improper use, abuse, negligence, or accident.
Customs & Duties
Sadly we cannot mark any rewards as a gift as it is illegal to do so.
Import duties and taxes are not included in our reward levels. These charges vary by country and are completely out of our control.
However, we are shipping our bags to EU backers from the UK and to US backers from Seattle, WA - so no extra charges should be incurred for backers in these geographies.
Return Policy
We stand behind our bags and will replace or repair items that fall within our warranty; however, we do not offer refunds or returns on bags/products that were received as a Kickstarter reward and are not suffering from a fault.
Crowdfunding is an incredible tool that allows people to get their ideas off the ground. Kickstarter is not a store and our ""reward levels"" are the way that we say thank you for supporting us (and trust us, we are VERY grateful). Everything received from this campaign will go directly into making The GoBag Backpack a reality.",49.0,2,"2 Campaigns

Wolffepack is a multi award-winning, revolutionary new concept in backpack design. We've now taken our unique access system a leap further and adapted it to create the most innovative snowsports and outdoor backpack ever. 

A backpack that gives easy access without unstrapping or taking off gloves (or poles).
Introducing the Wolffepack Summit The Wolffepack Summit is packed with fantastic features:Award-Winning DesignSince launch in 2014, Wolffepack's unique design has been recognised with 5 prestigious international design awards from all over the world. Wolffepack has been featured in:Here's what people are saying about Wolffepack:""I bought the Escape Backpack specifically to use whilst Skiing in the French Alpes in December 2015. It performed particularly when I swung it to my front so that I could sit comfortably on a chair-lift without leaning forward (something I have done for the last 25 years until this smart piece of product design came along!). I would thoroughly recommend any skier who likes to ski with a back-pack - go get the Wolffepack!"" - N.H., UK, 2016""In the past I have had to take my rucksack off to get on chairlifts, or try to hook it above the back of the chair. With this backpack it was just a matter of letting it down and swinging it around to the front. At the top of the lift, after coming off, I just pull it back up. Easy! My friends were really impressed."" - D.E. UK, 2016""The bag was excellent for skiing with. I had admiring looks from other skiers who were using traditional rucksacks. Would I recommend the bag? Most definitely."" - A.G. UK, 201612 features combined in the Wolffepack Summit 1. Unique Access SystemThe Wolffepack patented orbital trapeze technology gives you a uniquely easy backpack experience. It's easy off, easy on, easy access.Why bother? It's easy enough to take off a backpack, right? Well, we decided to compare directly the experience and time taken to remove and replace the Wolffepack Summit compared to a conventional backpack. On your marks......2. Easier, quicker and more comfortable chairlifts The Wolffepack system makes chairlifts so much easier. Simply swing the bag round to your front and hook it there.Sit in comfort right back in your seat, without being forced to perch nervously on the edge of the chair, and enjoy the view!Then just pull it up once you've left the lift, without stopping, without missing a moment.3. Hydration capabilityThe Wolffepack back harness is the perfect place to carry a hydration bladder. We've created a pocket integrated into the harness, just right for a bladder up to 2L. There are 2 velcro tabs to locate and retain the bladder itself where it stays stable, close to the body, and means that you don't have any water weight in the pack section of the bag.4. In-built back protection comes freeThe unique Wolffepack orbital design has been further enhanced to offer built-in back protection as part of the system. Our design combines alternate light but tough, hard and soft layers to create a laminated construction that protects your back. In 5 layers we use alternately aircell foam and tough polymers to form a composite protector that combines hard shell resistance with soft-layer impact absorption. We've been to an internationally recognised testing lab and the results show that we have achieved a significant level of back protection, comparable to the recognised European standard EN1621 Level 1 for the central back area. Over the next few weeks, we will be working towards getting full certification.5. Fleece-lined goggle pocketKeep your goggles or glasses protected and accessible in our custom-designed goggle pocket.

Intent on building a real community and social publishing platform for writers and bloggers, Roger founded Glipho in mid-2012.Roger currently works from dawn until dusk (and dusk until dawn) on Glipho. He is a passionate supporter of Barcelona football club and lives in East London. CHIEF TECHNICAL OFFICER - James ToyerAged 25, James is Glipho’s Chief Technical Officer. Before joining Glipho, James had worked for a number of years in Axonn Media where he met Roger. James graduated from University of Warwick with a degree in General Engineering. As a self-taught programmer since the age of 18, James developed his own skills in .NET and server management to become the expert he is today.With a deep expertise in maintaining CMS and designing its infrastructure, James has been responsible for overseeing the development team, and for the design and implementation of the back end stack of the Glipho Platform. Like Roger, James has dedicated most of his waking hours in the last twelve months to the development of Glipho.  Help us grow the Glipho community by following us on social media, too:Twitter:        twitter.com/gliphoFacebook:   facebook.com/gliphoPinterest:     pinterest.com/glipho",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>1. The Attly pen isn't at the final product stage. As described above the Attly still needs work to reach its full potential. Some issues and challenges may arise during this process. However, we are extremely confident in our ability to rise above them and deliver a great final product. We've already overcame countless roadblocks to get to this point, and we will continue to use the same out-of-the-box solution based thinking process to take it all the way.</p>
<p>2. Attly pen is looking for funding from all available places, so we use the most popular crowdfunding projects like Indiegogo and Kickstarter. Why we do that? Just because we want to give more potential for our product and want to give our new hi-tech device to as many people as is possible. It's not intent on cheating, it is just a variant to give our device to as many people as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>CT RollerGirls is a not-for-profit women’s roller derby league and a nationally-ranked member of the WFTDA. Our skaters and officials do not get paid – everyone volunteers her time, and everyone pays dues to the league and is responsible for her own equipment and travel expenses. Our travel team, the Stepford Sabotage, has an opportunity to compete against teams from all over the country at this year’s Spring Roll tournament in Fort Wayne, IN – but first we have to get there!</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>A team of 14 skaters, 2 alternates, and 2 coaches need to fly from New Haven to Ft. Wayne, IN and stay there for 4 nights. We estimate this will cost about $800 per person, or $14,400. The team also has to pay a $450 fee to participate in the tournament. Throw in food and local transportation, and we’re talking about a $16,000 weekend.</p>
<p>So, why do we want to go? Because we love playing roller derby, and we want the opportunity to learn from teams we don’t normally get to play in our region. Plus, we’ll get to share the awesomeness of CT RollerGirls with the rest of the country!</p>
<p>All money raised through this Indiegogo campaign will defray the cost to the individual skaters. If we raise more than we need, the overage will be applied to the rest of the Stepford Sabotage’s travel season; this year the team has games scheduled in New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Maine.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Our skaters and officials do not get paid – everyone volunteers her time, and everyone pays dues to the league and is responsible for her own equipment and travel expenses. These are not independently-wealthy women: they are teachers, dog groomers, nurses, students, personal trainers, and stay-at-home moms who love the sport of roller derby and the sense of self-empowerment that comes along with it. These ladies invest 6-10 hours or more per week training, practicing, and doing committee work to keep their team running. Please give them a hand so they can keep kicking ass.</p>

<h3>What is Owenite?</h3>
<p>We aim to bring the barter system back in this inflation prone economy.</p>
<p>Problem: When you have an used item, and you want to get rid of it, then the most obvious option left is to sell it. But when you sell your used stuff, you see a huge deprecation in their value. For an instance, if you own a Blackberry, and you are interested in iPhone, then you will sell your Blackberry and get some cash to buy the iPhone. But the problem is that the money you will get after selling your Blackberry might not suffice the cost of an iPhone.</p>
<p>Solution: Don't sell! Instead find someone who has an iPhone, but he is interested in owning a Blackberry, this way the both the users will not have to face any deprecation for their item in terms of money.<br/></p>
<p></p>

<h3>The We Taste Story</h3>
<div>
<span>Across Europe,
locals of different regions
enjoy and celebrate many delicacies not
commonly found outside their country of origin. </span>For historical, cultural or geographical reasons certain unique products cannot be equally recreated. We Taste's mission is to source these local products and package them together as a complete offering that is representative of one nation and can be distributed and enjoyed anywhere. <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>We Taste offers you the chance to taste a culture that you may be curious about, or that you have not had a chance to experience yet. Alternatively a We Taste box may trigger nostalgia for someone who wishes to relive a previous vacation or perhaps even celebrate their home country. To put it simply, we sell food experiences. <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>Long-term we will develop new products for other countries, such as Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, and Spain, while broadening our distribution to include more markets.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div><p>Recently, we travelled to Portugal together to explore the
country, visit the producers, film our journey, taste the local
delights and enjoy the local culture. Since our trip we are even more
excited to deliver the tastes we found there to the rest of Europe!</p></div>

<h3>Atuga - A Taste of Portugal</h3>
<p>Atuga is the first product from We Taste.  At the heart of the box you will find 550 grams of “Queijo da Serra” a special cheese from the highest mountain of continental Portugal “Serra da Estrela”. This is the highest quality and most widely known cheese you can find in Portugal. It is made from sheep milk and uses a unique process that ensures the cheese is entirely vegetarian. Additionally the cheese is perfectly stable at room temperature and lasts for up to six months. To accompany this creamy and distinctive cheese, we provide two locally produced jams and rosemary infused honey, sourced from the south of Portugal. The history and intention of our products as well as recommendations for tasting and wines can be found in a pamphlet inside the box. To ensure that you are able to enjoy Atuga no matter where you are, the box also includes crackers and a wooden knife and spoon.</p>
